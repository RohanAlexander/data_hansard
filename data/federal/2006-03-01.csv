1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. David Hawker) took the chair at 9.00 am and read prayers. NA (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 February, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That this bill be now read a second time.",17
2,Mr GARRETT,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006, amongst other things, amends the Telecommunications (Interceptions) Act 1979 and seeks to implement the recommendations of the Report of the review of the regulation of access to communications, which is referred to as the Blunn report. There is a significant history of consideration by this parliament of the extension of powers that are constantly sought by police and relevant authorities to access communications. This complex history, which I have been reading in the past 24 hours, brings us to the consideration of this bill. Significantly, the bill proposes the ception of communications of persons who are not specifically considered to have warranted a communication-in other words, what is known as B-party, or third-party, interceptions. I will return to consideration of that later in this speech. This bill, by implementing the Blunn recommendations, provides a legislative framework for limits on law enforcement access to two sets of communications: real-time communications-conversations on the telephone, for example-and stored communications, such as emails. The House welcomes the opportunity to see the Blunn recommendations reflected in proposed legislation. We cautiously support and welcome the bill, but we believe that further consideration by the Senate committee will be necessary, when the bill travels to the Senate, of some of the specific issues in relation to the granting of powers that is considered under this legislation. ASIO and the law enforcement agencies are granted new powers, and it is the extension of those new powers that the parliament needs to acknowledge and scrutinise very closely. There have been profound improvements in communications technology since the legislation of 1979. Persons use a variety of means of communication now, but most particularly mobile phones, with SMS messaging and texting. Additionally, emails, as we are all aware, have become a constant feature of the communications that take place in everyday life. At the same time, the mobility of the mobile phone and the capacity to substitute SIM cards and to have two, three, four or five handsets means that authorities-I think reasonably-are seeking ways to access relevant communications where they have a legitimate need to do so. By extending the TI warrant regime to stored communications like emails, the bill interpurports to limit the so-called common-law access to interceptions by law enforcement agencies. The previous legislation, the telecommunications bills of 2002 and 2004, had confronted this matter and essentially had come to grief because the Attorneys-General and the Australian Federal Police, it seemed, had different views on whether interceptions of stored communications would be considered appropriate under the existing legal framework. When the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee heard evidence in 2004 that the Australian Federal Police were using section 3L of the Crimes Act to access stored communicationscommunications that were stored by the internet service provider without a warrantand that the Attorney-General's Department and the AFP had different views about that matter, it was clear that we needed further consideration of the legal issues and also the most appropriate legal framework for access, if there were to be access, and under what conditions. As a consequence, those bills-or at least the provisions of those bills-did not proceed. The subsequent bills did allow for stored communication to be accessed but a sunset clause applied. We are now looking at the review and the recommendations as they are embodied in this legislation. When the second reading speech was given on 16 February, paragraph 10 of the speech referred to the bill containing ‘amendments to enable interception agencies to obtain an interception warrant in respect of the communications of an associate of a person of interest'. It is on that very matter that the discussion-and, I think, the Senate committee's consideration-will essentially rest, because, for the first time, we will have the covert capacity granted to intercept the communications of somebody who is in no way suspected of any offence. That represents a considerable extension of the original law as it was embodied in the 1979 legislation. I need to refer to two aspects of the bill. The first relates to the question of stored communications. Schedule 1 of the bill refers to stored communications. I note the comment by my colleague the member for Denison on this matter. He makes a very good point that, where the legislation applies and allows for an extension of access to stored communications, it is in the manner of a warrant but there is no notice, and no legal rights apply, which would normally be the case with a warrant. In other words, it is not considered that we are putting in place under this legislation the same sort of strict regime that exists for voice transmissions. The voice transmission regime has a higher test; the stored communications proposed test is lower. There is an argument, which I think was well put by the member for Denison, that if in fact access to stored communications has the effect of a warrant then the conditions that apply to that access should contain the same characteristics that have traditionally applied in the common law when an application for a search warrant is made, specifically in relation to the person for whom the warrant is being sought. In this case, if you are simply looking for evidence, you need to have some notice of the evidence. But, under the proposed legislation as it exists, the capacity for you as a third party to insist on knowing what the nature of that ‘warrant' may be is clearly less. Schedule 2 of the bill, which refers to Bparty communications, is of particular significance. It probably ought to be properly titled ‘third-party communications'. As proposed under this bill, we will have what is known as ‘B-party interception'. The law will now permit an issuing authority to exercise an intercept against a third-party communication, and the third party will have no knowledge of that interception. It is true that target parties are better able to get around the capacity of interceptions by switching phones, SIM cards and so on and that parliament must be able to permit agencies to intercept those communications, but to what extent the target intended and the interception intended then essentially bleed out to any other communications that are taking place between the target and other parties really goes to the crux of the criticality of this proposed legislation. That is something that I urge the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee to examine very closely. The fact is that the proposal as it now stands allows for the additional capture of incidental or collateral communications with others. In the light of the proposals that the Attorsent ney-General has coming into this parliament later in the year-particularly the proposal, yet to be seen by us in the House, of a national identity card-I think this raises the very profound challenges that the new digital and communications technologies present to us as law-makers, as well as the challenges that they present to the law enforcement agencies. That balance, which Mr Blunn referred to in his report-the balance between the need to ensure the privacy of citizens of the Commonwealth, as against providing the opportunity for law enforcement agencies to do their jobs effectively-is becoming a more highly calibrated and difficult area of consideration. You can very quickly imagine the prospect for communications of this kind, particularly in the way they are transmitted at this point in time, to become part of a larger body of information and material which is capable of being stored-and it is information about all of us. So, when we talk about safeguards in this place, I think we very necessarily reflect on the role that law-makers have to literally ensure that the safeguards are in place and will be capable of being administered over time. Labor feel very strongly that issues of unintended consequences of legislation of this kind need to be considered by the Senate committee. Certainly the history of the expansion of powers that have been sought by agencies and of proposals that have been brought through and subsequently amended over time indicates that the amount of caution and the necessity to look at safeguards that we have brought to this debate have been generally of benefit, not only to the community but to the consistency of laws as they exist now. To the extent that this bill provides clarification and seeks to implement the Blunn recommendations, or at least some of them, it is welcome. It is clear that the presituation is unsatisfactory and that we do need tougher safeguards than currently exist. It is also clear that the protection of privacy is one of the fundamental considerations that the parliament and also the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee need to consider. Mr Blunn referred to B-party intercepts being acceptable in limited and controlled circumstances and to their existing as a last resort. The question of whether or not the rights for these intercepts exist has been debated somewhat in the House, but I think the point needs to be made very strongly that there is a need to limit and carefully control any B-party or third-party intercepts that are contemplated by authorities. Certainly, as indicated by the member for Gellibrand, Labor will look closely at the debate and the consideration by the Senate committee and, following that consideration, will move additional amendments if necessary. I want to refer briefly to the assurances that have been given by the Attorney General on this matter and make the point, as I have in the House before, that I have some concern-some anxiety, in fact-about the Attorney-General's exercising of his responsibilities as the first law officer of the Crown. In the past, the Attorney-General has attacked members of the judiciary, and he has been clear in his comments on that basis. He has chosen not to argue strongly for an Australian citizen detained overseas, David Hicks, to have the most adequate and comprehensive legal protection that ought to be available to him in the circumstances, but rather has relied on the provisions of a military commission. There is substantial legal opinion, not only in this country but in other places, to say that that is not sufficient for the greater protection of the rights of a citizen. The Attorney-General is sometimes a little mischievous when he talks about supporting legislation of this kind and, for example, quotes things like article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Attorney General says that governments have a responsibility to protect people's rights to life, safety and security. But article 3 does not say that; it says: Everyone has the right to life, liberty and of person. Sometimes the Attorney-General leaves out ‘liberty' when it does not suit his purposes. The question of liberty is still essentially important in consideration of this legislation, in particular where we are providing, for the first time, the opportunity for law enforcement agencies to be able to intercept, in a covert manner, communications with third parties or associates of someone in whom the law enforcement agencies have an interest but who have committed no crime. That is an extremely large threshold over which this parliament may now seek to travel. It would need to do it with the utmost caution and take into account, I hope, the deliberations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and any amendments to this legislation that Labor seeks to bring back.",17
3,Ms GRIERSON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I rise today to speak on the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006. The intent of this legislation is to amend the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 to implement certain recommendations of the Blunn report on the regulation of access to communications under the act. Clearly, the world is changing rapidly, and the way we communicate with each other has evolved from telegraph, fixed telephone and postal delivery to mobile phone, text messages, emails and digital communications in a very short space of time. These changes have brought with them huge benefits to individuals and to our community in efficiency, convenience and productivity. But they also bring new opportunities for those who seek to plan and carry out crime. People who would commit crime can use this new technology to improve their own efficiency, convenience and illicit productivity. The changes in communications technology have security clearly brought with them changes in the ways in which people use those technologies for criminal purposes. It stands to reason, then, that the way in which our law enforcement agencies approach the prevention and investigation of crime must also change. I am pleased to see that the government has responded to the recommendations of the Report of the review of the regulation of access to communications-known as the Blunn report. Labor pushed strongly for an independent review of access to communications by enforcement agencies. I am particularly pleased to note Mr Blunn's first finding: ... the protection of privacy should continue to be a fundamental consideration in, and the starting point for, any legislation providing access to telecommunications for security and law enforcement purposes ... I firmly believe that all of us, as legislators, should bear those words in mind as we consider this legislation. No matter how quickly telecommunications and technologies change, and how quickly criminals change their behaviour to take advantage of this, there is one thing that never changes-the right of every Australian citizen to have their privacy and civil liberties protected. The right to privacy is fundamental, and we must not let our quest to prevent crime impinge upon this right. No matter how quickly the world changes, there are some fundamental rights which must always be defended. That is why I have to say that I have mixed feelings on this legislation. The legislation is an attempt to clarify the powers of law enforcement and security agencies to access both real-time communications and stored communications-and, of course, stored communications now are very extensive. It is only sensible to do this. But I do have concerns about the implications of this legislation. I am glad to see that it has been referred to a Senate committee for closer scrutiny, and I hope that any unintended consequences are revealed and removed from the legislation in that process. It is vitally important that we get legislation such as this right. We have seen this government rush many pieces of controversial legislation through this place and through the Senate without proper scrutiny or investigation. I fear that legislation such as the Work Choices bill, the Welfare to Work bill and the sedition provisions of the antiterrorist legislation will have implications as they progress and are implemented. Those implications will be felt by our communities. It is, then, important that this legisthat lation is scrutinised fully in the Senate committee process. The key, as we have so often seen in our post September 11 world, is to strike a balance-a balance between our desire to protect the civil liberties of our people and our desire to keep our people safe. There are several key provisions in this legislation to enact certain recommendations of the Blunn review. They deserve examination. Firstly, the legislation inserts a warrant regime for access to stored communications held by a telecommunications carrier. These stored communications are broadly defined to include electronic messages located on a computer, internet server or other equipment, whether read or unread, opened or unopened-messages such as emails, text messages, voice mail and all the attachments. Such stored communications are presently not covered by the Telecommunications Act, so they could be intercepted within the existing warrant regime without the need for a telecommunications interception warrant. However, this existing warrant regime has limitations and offers fewer protections than a telecommunications interception warrant should. The legislation before us does propose a new warrants regime that will move stored communications from a general search warrant to tougher provisions similar to those already in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act for real-time communications. On balance, this appears to be a sensible amendment which recognises the change in telecommunications methods since the original interception act was drafted. Schedule 3 of this legislation sets out to amend the named telecommunications interception warrant provisions to enable agencies to intercept communications to and from identified devices such as mobile phone handsets, personal and laptop computers, personal digital assistants and pagers. I note interception on the basis of the device must only be authorised where the applicant agency has no practical method of identifying the telecommunications service used or likely to be used by the person of interest and that the interception of those services would not be possible. Again, this provision appears to be necessary to keep up with the changing nature of communications and the way in which suspected criminals can use a large number of devices and services to disguise their activities. That can involve changing email services or mobile phone SIM cards to make it very difficult to track and link communications to the person of interest. As such, the provisions to allow for interception warrants to be issued in relation to specific telecommunications equipment appear to be useful ones. The other major schedule in this legislation that I wish to discuss today is the schedule dealing with so-called B-party intercepts or third-party intercepts. Like the equipment based interception provisions that I referred to, this schedule has been introduced in an attempt to allow another way for enforcement agencies to intercept the communications of people of interest when they are having difficulty doing so through the usual channels of an interception warrant. However, the problem many Australians would have with this schedule is that it does not only target people who are suspected of a crime or the equipment and services they use. B-party intercepts allow persons other than the person suspected of involvement in the crime to have their communications intercepted. These persons are referred to as the B-party. As long as this B-party is in tact with a suspected person, no matter what they are talking about or what information they are exchanging, that B-party person can then have their communications intercepted. Let us be clear what this means: a warrant can be obtained to bug the phone of a person who is not suspected of a crime. We should think very hard about the implications of this and the safeguards that are required before proceeding. If party A, the person under investigation, is having their communications intercepted and they are discussing proposed crime with party B, then I have no problem with party B being brought into the scope of that investigation. What I do have a problem with is what the implications are of a B-party interception warrant then being issued for the second party. And, of course, that is the sort of safeguard that I would like to see. The problem is that moving on to intercept the communications of party B then picks up a whole range of other communications with parties C, D, E and so on. These people may be relatives, friends, business associates or even lawyers or members of parliament-and, of course, we are used to a privilege situation with lawyers and clients and members of parliament and we are concerned that that should always continue. They may be completely innocent parties and perhaps would not even know of the existence of party A, the person under investigation for whom the original warrant would have been issued, yet they are having their personal conversations intercepted. What if these people, parties C, D, E and so on, are not so innocent? If they are involved in the same crime, the crime for which the original warrant was sought for party A, then that is fine; it seems a fair cop. They can be investigated as part of that. However, if the agencies suspect that these conpeople are involved in some different crime, those agencies should not be allowed to use that sort of intercepted information to pursue those people. They should indeed be required to make new investigations into that new alleged crime and seek appropriate warrants based on evidence coming out of those investigations but certainly not based on their interception information relating to the partyA warrant. If we do not protect against this sort of indirect collection of interceptions from people for whom we have no warrant, then the infringement of individual rights and liberties would become untenable. My concern then is that appropriate silos or firewalls are maintained between the person for whom this B-party warrant has been issued and any other person with whom they communicate. While B-party interceptions are currently provided for under the existing act, the Blunn report notes that it has not been utilised by enforcement agencies because the provisions on this matter were seen as being open to several interpretations. What this legislation does is make it explicit that B-party services may be intercepted. It also gives certain protections, such as stating that B-party interceptions must be a ‘last resort' and must be a last-resort recourse for law enforcement agenciesthough it is always that last resort and the person who has the power to issue that last resort facility that is concerning. Nonetheless, many in our community have been alarmed by this proposal. Civil liberties groups have warned that B-party interception powers tip the balance too far away from our citizens' right to privacy and of the ease and convenience of enforcement agencies in accessing their communications. This is a serious concern and one which the Blunn report noted. The report recommended that it be made ‘clear that B-party services may be intercepted in limited and controlled circumstances'. It is not clear from my reading of this legislation that the circumstances will be limited and controlled enough to warrant spying on innocent Australians. I certainly hope that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee will have a very close look at this provision, because this is an area where we must get the balance just right. We must not allow ourselves to become a people ever afraid. We should not be afraid of picking up the telephone or sending someone a text message or an email for fear that communication will be traced or listened to. We should not have to check what we say and censor ourselves because we do not know who may be listening. The fact that we are considering the matter of B-party interceptions raises some broader issues that I would like to touch on. Before I do, I would say that many of these legislative changes have been made with an antiterrorist intention and in an atmosphere and climate of new fears that pervade the world, including our country. It is important that people understand that the antiterrorist legislation itself widened powers so that there are already powers in our laws to deal with any interceptions if they are to do with a terrorist act or an imminent threat. The broader issues that I would like to touch on are important. The right to privacy is a right which is explicitly provided for under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The CCPR states: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. too far in favour It also says: Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. Australia is a signatory to the CCPR and thus there is an obligation upon us to uphold the principles enshrined in it. However, the Howard government has repeatedly shown its disinterest in its international obligations. We have seen this in its treatment of asylum seekers-I note it is a year since Cornelia Rau was given her liberty and there has certainly been no payment of compensation at this stage; its treatment of working people, through its Work Choices legislation that has a new competitive edge which is about lowering people's wages and conditions; and its keenness to go to war in Iraq, where we have been for three years, no matter what the United Nations thought at the time. International treaties and institutions do not mean too much to this government. I cite the daily revelations regarding the Australian Wheat Board scandal that links the Howard government closer and closer to the deception and cheating. To this government such international obligations can be treated as irrelevant to Australia with the claim that they impinge on our sovereignty or independence. Perhaps it is time that we took a cue from every other Western nation and actually enshrined some of the rights embodied in such international treaties as the CCPR in our own nation's law. In this respect, I would like to draw the House's attention to the good work being done by New Matilda, who have proposed a human rights act to do just that. New Matilda should be congratulated for raising public debate about how such an act would help to ensure that all of the legislation proposed by this parliament meets the basic principles of human rights. It would be interesting to see how the B-party provisions of this legislation would stand up when measured against such a human rights act. I believe that some of this government's other legislation, such as that covering sedition and mandatory detention, would not pass muster under a basic human rights act. I also believe that some of the statements made by the Prime Minister and others recently on Australian values would be more credible if they were backed by a concrete description of what our values are. In fact, there seems to be quite a deal of confusion between the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Prime Minister himself on just what our values are. Apparently, it is a moveable feast. They are definitely ill defined by this government and are certainly subjective. A human rights act may be a way in which we can come to some kind of shared view on what our values actually are. It would spell them out in black and white, so that all Australians would have a clear indication of their rights and responsibilities. This is just a gestion, which I believe is a good one, for ways in which we can use a human rights framework to help inform the community on these important matters. It would also help to inform us, as elected representatives, as we look at contentious legislation such as this which has the potential to infringe upon our human rights. As I said earlier, there is a clear need to update the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to give our law enforcement agencies the powers they need to fight crime in this era of new and changing technology. I give full praise and commendation to the opposition for their efforts to bring better legislation into effect. However, any increase in these powers must be measured against the cost to the rights and civil liberties of our people, and we must be careful to get this balance right. There is no doubt that there are serious concerns about this legislation, and I look forward to a fuller examination of these concerns in the Senate committee process.",20
4,Mr MELHAM,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I rise to speak to the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006. I note that this bill will be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for examination and report. I for one hope that the committee, in its report and examination, will look at a couple of aspects of this bill that cause me real concern. The bill has two main features. Firstly, it establishes a regime under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to enable the interception of stored communications such as emails in transit on a web server's computer. Secondly, it enables the interception of what are called B-party telephones. Whilst the stored communications provisions are generally fine because they make it clear that the communications can only be intercepted with a TI warrant and not merely a search warrant, which is theoretically eassugier to obtain, the issue that needs rethinking is the proposal that stored communication warrants could be obtained for a very wide range of investigations that would not be able to utilise TI warrants. The agencies able to use these stored communication warrants would include ASIC, Customs and the Australian Taxation Office, none of which can use TI warrants now. Currently, TI warrants can only be obtained to investigate offences carrying a maximum penalty of seven years or more. However, stored communication warrants could be used to investigate offences including non-criminal civil penalty cases carrying maximum penalties as low as three years and, once accessible by an agency, stored communications could be used in the investigation of offences where the maximum penalty is as low as a fine of 60 penalty units, which is $6,600. This aspect of the bill is set out on page 12 of the explanatory memorandum, which is a frank assessment of the bill. It is worth reading again some parts of that explanatory memorandum. There is a concession, which says: - There is a wider range of issuing authority. Whereas interception warrants may only be issued by eligible judges or nominated AAT members, stored communications warrants may be also be issued by these authorities as well as any other Commonwealth, State or Territory judge or magistrate. - There is a lower threshold to be met. Interception warrants are only available in relation to specified serious offences, as defined in subsection 5(1). While these are varied in terms of their penalties, the general rule is that they relate to offences with a maximum term of imprisonment of at least seven years. In contrast, stored communications warrant are available for the investigation of these rious offences as well as offences with a penalty of imprisonment for a maximum period of at least three years or a pecuniary penalty of at least 180 penalty units for individuals and at least 900 penalty units for corporations. In addition, stored communications warrants can be obtained as part of statutory civil proceedings which would render the person of interest to a pecuniary penalty of at least 180 penalty units for individuals and at least 900 penalty units for corporations. Consistent with the lower threshold, stored communications that have been lawfully accessed can be used as part of the investigation of matters with a lower threshold (at least one year imprisonment or at least 60 penalty units for individuals (300 penalty units for corporations). - Reflecting the wider agency access and the lower threshold to be met, the reporting requirements for stored communications warrant are not as burdensome on the agencies as the requirements for interception. Reduced reporting requirements are also consistent with general search warrants provisions. So there is an admission of an expansion of access and a lower threshold test. Historically, TI warrants have applied to more serious penalties with a maximum of seven years or more. I think the Senate committee should look at whether that is necessary or whether it needs to be limited. I come to what I consider to be the next gross invasion of interception on individuals. In the current climate the Attorney-General, on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the agencies are further and further seeking more powers. Frankly, they are not making their case. Theoretical situations and wish lists are being put to us. We are getting into a situation whereby the underpinning of this legislation when it was first put in place and the protection mechanisms and the assurances that were given about there not being future expansions are all being swept under the carpet. I know we are living in a new environsement, and I know that interception is an important tool in authorities' pursuit of criminals and criminal conduct, but we are getting to the stage where the broader use of these tools is in my opinion-I am not saying it is my party's opinion-going too far. I have been advised that, in respect of Bparty intercepts, the bill dramatically widens TI powers and will lead to the greatest incursion upon privacy ever endorsed by the federal parliament. If the police establish that all other methods of identifying the phone service used by the target have failed or that it is not possible to intercept the target's phone, they will be able to tap the phones belonging to the target's family, friends, associates and lawyers so long as the police can demonstrate that it is likely that the target will contact the B-party on that phone. There is no need to show that the B-party is suspected of any criminal complicity. There is no need to show that the target will make calls from the B-party's phone. There is no need to show that the target will talk to the B-party about any relevant criminal activity. Those limitations have not been imposed by this legislation.",24
5,The B,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"party warrant can run for 45 days for police warrants and for three months for ASIO warrants. It is often difficult to determine exactly which phone a target is using, so B-party warrants will be common. Once a target's phone has been identified, I am advised that there is no requirement that the Bparty intercept cease-the police can and will continue to tap the B-party phone until the warrant expires. So innocent people, with no involvement in a crime, will have their phones tapped, possibly for months at a time, simply because they might receive a call from a suspect. That is a matter that the committee needs to look at. On my reading, and from what I have been advised, this is a massive expansion of powers and I do not believe there are sufficient safeguards or protections. I believe the threshold is too low in relation to that activity. On my reading of the bill and from what I have been advised, the legislation will allow a breach of legal professional privilege. If there is contact between solicitor and client or barrister and client we all know that legal professional privilege applies. This legislation will allow a breach of that legal professional privilege. It will also mean that, inevitably, some members of parliament could have their phones intercepted. We are no special category per se, but if we have constituents of a suspect nature who make contact with us, on my reading of this bill, our phones can be tapped. The explanatory memorandum, on page 32, says: The amendments provide that where an interception agency satisfies an issuing authority that other practicable methods of identifying communications service used by the person of interest have been exhausted, or that it is not possible to intercept the telecommunications used by the person of interest, then the interception agency may intercept the telecommunications service used by another person. Interception of the so-called B-Party service will only be available where the interception agency can satisfy the issuing authority that the person being intercepted will likely be contacted on that telecommunications service by the person of interest. That is the threshold for B-party interception. So what we are doing in effect is as I said earlier: there is no need to show that the Bparty is suspected of any criminal activity, there is no need to show that the target will be making calls from the B-party's phone and there is no need to show that the target will talk to the B-party about any relevant criminal activity. I say that is a huge expansion and something the Senate committee should have a look at to see whether the case has really be made out for that. It seems to me that what we are getting is telecommunications interception now being used in a lot of respects to overcome a lot of lazy investigation, and so this is the preferred method of investigation. There is no doubt in my mind, and I do not argue against it, that this is a useful concept and an important tool for investigators and prosecuting authorities. But I argue that there must come a time when you draw the boundaries. There is a point that you do not go beyond and where I think your citizens are entitled to say that privacy considerations prevail in this instance. I am not one of those who believe that at times, in certain situations, privacy should not be wound back, but you have got to get the balance right. It is an argument about the balance. But it seems to me that, before you go into the third-party telephone conversations of other people, you have to have a level of suspicion of their involveall ment in this sort of activity, not necessarily the tele- just innocent parties. This legislation will also mean that there is basically carte blanche to listen not just to a suspect but in many respects to the suspect's family-the wife, the girlfriend, the son or the daughter. This will mean they can listen into their phones for lengthy periods of time. There is no suggestion that, once you establish the phone that the other person has got, you drop off the intercept. There is a time limit on the B-party intercept, but the 45 days and the three months can still be fully exhausted. There is one matter I want to raise, and it is where the Attorney had a bit of a crack in his second reading speech at critics of Australia's interception regime. He said the critics: ... have again advanced old arguments that Australian agencies intercept communications at many times the rate of United States agencies and others. … … … Statistics published in the United States do not include interceptions considered by the investigators to be too sensitive to report. Investigators Australian law enforcement agencies do not have this discretion and therefore all interceptions must be reported. He goes on to say that, in America: This results in fewer statistical returns than Australian law, which allows a warrant to authorise the interception of a single telecommunications service or the services of one named person only. In his second reading speech nowhere does the Attorney-General argue that the statistics put forward in relation to Australia were overstated. He argues the comparison; he argues that obviously there is underreporting in America. But he was unable and did not mount an argument against the statistics. The statistics that I produced in a press release dated 15 September 2002, with figures for the periods ranging from 1988-89 to 200001, show that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of telephone interception warrants for law enforcement purposes. In 1988-89, there were 246. In 1998-99, there were 1,284. There were 1,689 the next year, and 2,157 the year after. I anticipate that I will be updating this table and issuing an updated release, because it is important that those figures go out into the public domain. The other interesting thing is that in his second reading speech the Attorney did not say that the publicly available figures from the US were inaccurate, either. A lot of effort was made at the time to produce those statistics. The underlying thing that the statistics show is that there is going to be an increasing use of this technology, because there is no doubt that it is an efficient way for enforcement agencies to operate. That is why we need to be cautious in terms of our safeguards and the privacy protections. We need to be cautious in how far we expand the use and availability of these sorts of services. I do not think it is sufficient to say, in ‘This will help solve crime, so let's throw down the privacy protections.' In the pursuit of criminals, we have to have a standard of proof, and that standard is ‘beyond reasonable doubt'. That means that in some inunder stances people who may well have committed crimes are released by judges and juries because of insufficient evidence. If you lower your standards too far, you will end up picking up innocent people. They will get swept up, and that should not happen.",26
6,Mr RUDDOCK,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"in reply-I thank the members who have contributed to the debate: the members for Gellibrand, Moncrieff, Denison, La Trobe, Newcastle, Kingsford Smith and Banks. I will deal with the individual comments as I deal with particular issues in this summing up. The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006 illustrates the government's commitment to ensuring that security and law enforcement agencies are equipped with appropriate powers to combat and prevent serious crime, including terrorism. At the same time, the bill reflects the ernment's consistent adherence to ensuring that there are appropriate privacy protections for users of the Australian telecommunications network. We believe that the measures that we are proposing are balanced and appropriate to the threats that we face and will enable important investigations to be adequately undertaken. The new stored communications warrant regime implements the recommendations of Tony Blunn for an overarching regulatory framework to access communications such as emails, voice mail and SMS messages. Members have known for some time that this is a very important area for the law to move on, and this was the subject of consideration in the Senate on a number of occasions. Legislation to deal with the matter temporarily has been the subject of a sunset clause, which will run out in June this year. This legislation is the considered response to those issues and will deal with those matters in a balanced way. Tony Blunn undertook the work to develop the proposal. The new regime strikes a careful balance, on the one hand creating a new prima facie protection for stored communications while on the other creating a defined regime to provide law enforcement agencies with appropriate access. I note, for instance, the member for Denison's concern that the proposed stored communications regime is not subject to the same restrictions as interception. There is a reason for this. It is because of the way in which these matters are accessed. You access them, essentially, at one single point in whereas the interception regime is a continuing monitoring over a longer period of time. The concerns, in our view, are misplaced. Under the current laws, only those communications in their passage over the telecommunications systems are subject to the govrestrictions imposed by the interceptions regime. This bill has the effect of creating a new protection for those communications that are stored by a carrier which would otherwise be susceptible to access under the lower threshold applicable to search warrants. This is an intermediate regime. Search warrants have a far lesser threshold to be satisfied. This is not going to the level that would apply in relation to a continuous monitoring, but to a higher threshold than that which applies for search warrants. That is the important point that needs to be understood. Given the differences, we think that the additional arrangements over and above those applicable to search warrants are the appropriate and balanced approach to dealing with these stored communications such as email and SMS messages. For completeness, I note that the measures will not affect the existing arrangements in relation to the execution of search warrants on members and senators, as suggested by the member for Denison. I should also note that that was a matter that was the subject of comment by the member for Banks and the member for Kingsford Smith. The bill will also make important amendments to the interception regime to assist agencies to counter measures adopted by persons suspected of serious criminal activity to evade telecommunications interception. People are very conscious today of interception-and I see this all the time in relation to the particular form of warrants that I supervise. There is a high level of awareness time, among people who may be targeted for investigations about the potential for scrutiny, and they take that into account. It is a situation in which the goalposts are moving. I would like to think that telecommunications interception could be as effective as it has been in the past, but the concern we have is that, as a useful tool, it is being significantly degraded. These amendments are to allow agencies to respond in part to those changes: to allow them to intercept communications of an associate of a suspect or to intercept communications through a particular piece of equipment. These are designed to give further effect to the recommendations from Mr Blunn and his independent report. They respond to the ever-increasing sophistication in the use of communications technology by people engaged in serious criminal activity. Interception under these new amendments will only be used as an investigative tool of last resort. I think that is the point that to be understood. These are additional controls. They are strict controls. These are only to be available for the investigation of the most serious offences; they are not tools that will be made available for the investigation of minor offences. I note the member for Denison's comment that the use of B-party interception should be carefully limited. As I have said previously, this bill ensures that, where an agency believes it is necessary to intercept the communications of an associate of a suspect, the agency must demonstrate to a judge or an AAT member that the agency has exhausted all other practical methods of identifying communication services used by the suspect. That point is one I would make to the member for Banks. This is not a situation in which a warrant will be easily obtained; it will be a situation in which there is a very high threshold which has to be satisfied. The idea that third parties' conversations should not be intercepted fails to recognise that that happens now. If you, as a member of parliament, happen to ring a person who is a target of an investigation under the existing regime where a warrant has been issued, your conversation-which might be totally about matters relating to your parliamentary duties-could be the subject of interception. The point is that there is a requirement for those forms of conversations to be deleted and for the information not to be readily available for further investigations unrelated to the matters that are the subject of the investigation, unless they disclose an offence which itself carries a significant penalty. Bparty interception is to be a tool of last resort, as the member for Newcastle said it should be. The existing strong safeguards embedded in the interception regime will continue to apply. An interception warrant can only be needs granted to an agency where the judge or AAT member is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a particular person is using or likely to use the telecommunications service and-I emphasise thisthat information that would be obtained by the interception would be likely to assist in connection with the investigation by the agency of an offence which carries a penalty of seven years of penal servitude. The judge and the AAT member must have regard to the following additional factors: how much the privacy of any person would be likely to be interfered with by the interception; the gravity and the seriousness of the offences being investigated; how much the intercepted information would be likely to assist with the investigation by the agency of the offence and to what extent alternative methods of investigating the offence have been used or are available to the agency; how much the use of such methods would be likely to assist in the investigation by the agency of the offence; and how much the use of such methods would be likely to prejudice the investigation by the agency of the offence. All of these are requirements that have to be met. That is a very important aspect of these matters. I was surprised at the suggestion from the honourable member for Kingsford Smith that a party that is the subject of a B-party warrant should receive a notice from the authoriquired ties of the intention to conduct the intercepwhere tion. I think that is an extraordinary suggeslates tion, because the nature of telecommunications interception, which has long been part of our method of investigating serious criminal offences, is that inherently it is and always has been a covert investigatory tool. Consistent with its covert nature, the use of the interception is tightly regulated in the way that I have mentioned. But the idea that you go out and say to somebody, ‘Don't use your phone when you're talking to party-X because it's the subject of a covert intercepyou tion' would totally destroy its efficacy as a tool, I suspect. The measures in this bill will not only maintain but further strengthen the stringent restrictions on when an interception warrant can be issued to ensure that it only happens in connection with the investigation of very serious offences. The existing restrictions on the use of any intercepted material continue to apply and will, as currently required, independent oversight and annual reporting to parliament. I also note the reluctant concession of member for Denison that B-party interception provisions are necessary, but the member is concerned with the use of intercepted material which will be obtained by intercepting the B-party. If intercepted material reveals information regarding the commission of an offence that was not initially under vestigation, that information may be used by the interception agency, providing it meets a three-year penal servitude threshold. This is entirely consistent with the existing arrangements within the interception regime, which enable the use of intercepted material in relation to any criminal offence which meets that three-year threshold. These arrangements ensure that law enforcement agencies and security agencies are not reto turn a blind eye to criminality the interception warrant initially reto a different offence. To suggest otherwise would seriously impede the ability of the agencies to utilise this important investigatory tool appropriately and effectively. In relation to the final comments made by the member for Banks, he did not quote me inappropriately from my second reading speech. But I would say that, in Australia, we have an effective system of monitoring, which includes a robust system of keeping statistics. That there are statistics from which are able to undertake your evaluation as to the movements that may or may not be occurring is because we do just that. I think the gentleman concerned, Mr O'Gorman in Queensland, argues that your phone is more likely to be tapped in Australia than it is in the United States, and therefore we are doing something inherently wrong. The point I make is that our statistics are robust; their statistics are not. The argument have on the basis of comparing statistics is a flawed argument. If you were to take his formula and use the German classifications, the for instance-I have the figures here: the population of Germany is 82 million-you would find that in terms of intercepts one in every 2,841 persons or phones is tapped in Germany. The population in Australia is 20 million. The figure is one in 6,634 phones or persons are tapped. You could argue that insomebody is 42 per cent more likely to have their phone tapped in Germany than in Australia, and therefore our figures are comparatively low. That is the nature of the argument. I do not know about the nature of their statistics and what they recall. I do not know whether it is a totally valid comparison, but I would certainly argue that we keep very robust statistics. I do not think we are particularly out of the ordinary in terms of investigating terrorism offences, serious criminal offences and using the appropriate tools to do just that. The bill reflects a very considered effort by the government to strike an appropriate balance in dealing with the very significant efforts that are undertaken to avoid what are known to be investigatory methods, which include telephone interceptions. With the change in technology that has occurredparticularly in relation to email, SMS, stored communications and the like-they are matters that we have to effectively address, and this legislation provides that mechanism. On that basis, I commend the bill to the House and look forward to the Senate dealing with the matter, before the sunset clause expires. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",27

SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER-ACHIEVEMENT NA OPPORTUNITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 February, on motion by Ms Julie Bishop: That this bill be now read a second time.",31
8,Ms MACKLIN,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Jagajaga) (10.10 am)The Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006 being considered by the House today proposes to amend the Schools Assistance (Learning Together–Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004, which provides the bulk of Commonwealth funding to schools. The Commonwealth currently provides funding, including capital funding, for government and non-government schools for the 2005-08 quadrennium through this act. You would have to say that the glib and overtly political title of the principal act glosses over the extraordinary inequities that this act perpetuates and the policy failures that this amendment bill attempts to correct. There was no mention in the second reading speech by the Minister for Education, Science and Training of the unfairness of the funding increases that the act enshrines for at least another four years, from 2005. There was nothing about the unfair distribution of funding within the non-government school sector itself. According to the explanatory memorandum, the specific provisions in this amendment bill have the following objectives: to move uncommitted capital infrastructure funding for government schools from 2005 to 2006 and to bring forward 2008 funding to 2006; to move unspent funding under the Tutorial Voucher Initiative from 2004 to 2006; to allow funding to be carried over or brought forward to another year for all ‘non per capita' programs-that is, capital grants, targeted programs and national projects; to provide maximum general recurrent grants for a small number of non-government schools that cater for students with emotional, social or behavioural difficulties; and to make a minor technical correction to one of the defined terms in the act. This is the bill that we had to have-a bill that tries to tidy up an extraordinary policy mess left behind by the now departed minister. The new minister's second reading speech was her first major statement on schools, and it is telling that this statement is about the effects of political opportunism and administrative incompetence on the part of the previous minister. We are going to have to wait a little bit longer it seems before we hear about the current minister's educational philosophy and her vision for Australia's schools. Maybe that will come some day soon. Labor will support this bill, only because the needs of students and schools cannot continue to be neglected. But we do have to put on record the consequences of this government's incompetence, and particularly the incompetence of the previous minister. This incompetence is there for all to see, and the potential for bungling was very clear at the time of the announcement of the programs for capital funding and for literacy vouchers. I want to go through both of these programs in detail. The government's major 2004 election commitment for schools was its Investing in Our Schools program, where $1 billion over four years was provided for capital projects in schools, with $700 million of that to go to government schools and $300 million to go to non-government schools. This commitment was a very direct and very hurried response to Labor's election policy for schools. There is no question that the panicked way in which this policy response was developed at the last minute has followed through into what can only be described as slapdash implementation and chronic delays in getting the money to the schools and the students who need it. For government schools, what we had from the previous minister was a decision to bypass state authorities by calling for applications directly from schools and local parents and citizens associations. The previous minister announced that Australia's 6,900-plus public schools would be eligible for ‘up to' $150,000 each under this process. The government has been overwhelmed by its own decision to go down this path and has failed to deliver this money to schools. Most schools are still waiting for the money. I am sure many members in this House are getting representations from their schools, because they are sick and tired of seeing the funding dates for this money getting pushed back further and further. The previous minister for education first of all promised that the grants would be announced in May 2005. That is when the grants were supposed to be announced. It is now March 2006. The new school year started weeks ago. Many schools have promoted their facilities to parents on the basis of projects they expected to have completed in time for this school year. Now many parents are questioning schools about whatever happened to those promised shadecloths, computers or whatever other initiative it might be. The government's incompetence has caused all sorts of other collateral damage. I know of a contractor in Victoria who has almost $10 million out in quotes for school contracts. He provided those quotes more than a year ago, when schools were writing applications. Now he is in a financial dilemma because building costs have gone up in the past year-once again, due to this government's skills crisis-and he does not know whether he is going to be able to honour the year-old quotes. He knows and the schools and parents know that all of this intolerable situation has been brought about by the bungling of this government. I do not even need to go into the larger round 2 grants process. Schools were first told that round 2 successful grants would be announced last October, then it was pushed to December, then we were told February and now it is supposed to be April. It is extraordinarily irresponsible of this government to be continuing to delay the funding of these important projects when we have schools who need the money desperately. Although the program was clearly targeted in the election to all government schools and all parent associations, what we have had from the minister is the extraordinarily flimsy excuse that the department was surprised at the volume of applications. But it was targeted at all schools! The department, apparently, has been completely unable to administer the program in a timely way despite significant increases in staffing for the program. This bill is the direct and inevitable result of this government's incompetence. All government schools were promised additional funding for capital projects in the tion, so why on earth was it any surprise to the previous minister or the current minister that most schools and most parents and citizens organisations were keen to apply? Of course they were keen to apply. Of course they wanted some of the money for their students and their schools. There cannot be any excuse for not preparing to handle applications from so many of the nation's schools. As Minister Nelson sowed, now Minister Bishop reaps. Today she is saddled with the task of trying to clean up the mess left behind by Dr Nelson. The incompetence of the Investing in Our Schools program implementation, unfortunately for the new minister, is only the first example of the landmines that Dr Nelson has left behind for his successor. Someone somewhere has to be responsible for this mess. What is clear is that the Howard government have bungled their management of this program by trying to set themselves up as a small-scale capital developer for Australia's government schools. They knew how many government schools there were before they made this announcement. They paint themselves as trying to rescue school communities, but what they have had to do is create their own administrative monster and, as a result, even with 50 extra staff, they have been completely incapable of getting this money into schools in a timely fashion. They have set up a complete duplicate administration for getting capital funding for schools, and it has become very clear in the last few days that this has been done for blatantly political reasons. We now see the inevitable result of this ad hoc administration. It is a salutary lesson for this new minister. If she is to learn anything from the schoolboy mistakes of her predecessor, it is that it is much better to work in cooperation with the states than to try to set up a whole duplicate administration and then bungle it and be incapable of delivering to elecour schools and to our students. Of course we want to see the involvement of parent organisations in the decisions about the allocation of capital funds. Parents have a very important role to play. But their involvement needs to be done in a strategic way and it certainly should be done in cooperation with the states, not with the Commonwealth setting up its own administration and then being totally incapable of delivering the money. We have been concerned about this incompetence. We continue to be concerned about it, but we also know that the approvals so far show that political pork-barrelling continues to be the primary motivation in the decisions behind the Investing in Our Schools program. Once again the minister says, ‘Of course coalition seats got more money-we have more seats.' Minister, let me take you through a few figures that demonstrate that this initiative is all about porkbarrelling. The average funding per Labor electorate is $547,877. The average funding per Liberal electorate is $703,262. I will go through all the rough numbers to give you an idea. The Liberal electorates get 128 per cent of the funding going to Labor electorates. The Nationals are certainly right in there. The average funding per The Nationals electorate is 246 per cent of the funding going to Labor electorates. This shows that it is all about pork-barrelling. It has tainly nothing to do with need. In terms of total funding to an electorate, 19 of the top 20 electorates are coalition held. The first Labor held electorate appears at No. 20 and that is Bendigo. In terms of the average grant given to a school, nine of the top 10 electorates are coalition held. Reid is the only Labor-held top 10 seat. How on earth can the Howard government justify such huge discrepancies? How could a credible, accountable and transparent assessment process possibly arrive at such a flawed distribution of funding? How could it be arrived at? How could it be fair? Let me particularly highlight the funding that has gone to the seat of Dr Nelson, the former Minister for Education, Science and Training. Does the former minister, Dr Nelson, really expect parents to believe that each school, in suburbs like St Ives and Wahroonga, in his North Shore Sydney seat of Bradfield deserve an average 38 per cent more funding than schools in the seat of Fowler, in battling suburbs such as Bonnyrigg and Cabramatta? Who would think that Dr Nelson's electorate is more needy than the electorate of Fowler? Nobody would believe that. It is all about pork-barrelling and the Liberals and The Nationals looking after their own electorates. The combined effects of incompetence and political porkbarrelling have completely discredited this program. This should have been about targeting the needs of schools and students, with the involvement of parents, not about political pork-barrelling. In the light of this demonstrated incompetence by the Howard government, and particularly the previous minister, and the porkbarrelling of this program, Labor supports only the increased flexibility in the bill for the minister to move funds around within the funding quadrennium so that schools eventually get the money. It is complete administracertive incompetence by the previous minister. Of course, this program should not be used for political purposes. We can see the stagemanaged activities that the coalition politicians will use in media releases in the leadup to the next election, but of course we will continue to point out the political misuse of the program. The next part of this bill is about the tutorial vouchers program-another extraordinary demonstration of this government's incompetence. We have unspent money now having to be moved from both 2004 and 2005 to the current year because in this program, once again, we had from the previous minister another example of ideology over good sense. The government insisted on tendering for brokers to provide tutors for children who needed literacy support, including some brokers with doubtful qualifications and operations. In 2004 the government introduced the payment of tutorial vouchers of up to $700 to parents of children who had failed to meet national benchmarks of reading literacy in national testing of year 3 standards in 2003. These are children who did not meet the literacy standard in 2003. Of course, there is no dispute between Labor and the government about whether young children who, by year 3, have not reached minimum standards of reading literacy need support. Of course they need timely and intensive support. We know that, if these children do not receive that support and receive it quickly, they will most likely continue to struggle with their learning over all the years of schooling. Of course, literacy deferred is literacy denied. But if the government were serious about its concerns for improving literacy standards, it would have directed its increased funding to the source-students and schools, where the children are every day. But, once again, we have had ideology, particularly on the part of the former minister, overcome good sense. Once again, the Commonwealth has tried to implement this scheme without any prior discussion with the states. So, instead of working with schools and the systems, the Howard government took over the idea of giving this money to private brokers who had no real experience in this kind of work. Now that the program has failed to deliver for most eligible students, the government is trying to blame the states. We know how good this government is at trying to find someone else to blame. It blames the states, even though it refuses to work with them in the first place. Some of the brokers are, very sensibly, school authorities, but others are private providers and enterprises. I want to take the parliament through the results of this program. Answers to Senate estimates questions revealed a nationwide take-up of only 36 per cent by mid-November last year. That is what I would call a flop of a program. Let us have a look at a state by state analysis of the figures for this program, which shows a much poorer performance on the part of commercial brokers, particularly when compared to the performance of school authorities. For example, in those states where we had the state education departments-that is, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania-doing this program, we had significantly improved take-up rates of eligible students, going up to 69 per cent. But the notable failure of this program is the performance of a private company, Progressive Learning, which has failed spectacularly to deliver tutorial programs to eligible students in Queensland and Victoria. These figures from the Department of Education, Science and Training show that just 656 of the 5,717 eligible Victorian students got this voucher. What a failure! Only 12 per cent of eligible students received the voucher. The vast majority of students assessed at their year 3 benchmark testing as requiring extra literacy assistance have now already sat the year 5 literacy benchmark without receiving any tutoring at all. Progressive Learning also charged a $250 administration fee, so the few students in Victoria who actually received any tutoring got only $450 of the value of their $700 voucher. The government also issued contracts to companies to deliver the tutorial voucher program in the full knowledge that the companies could not talk to the parents because they were not legally able to obtain their contact details. Of course, I am sure we will hear the minister say that in her view it is the states' fault. The previous minister knew that this was the legal situation and decided to go down his ideological track rather than doing it sensibly in cooperation with the states. The program has been an administrative disaster-more about this government's ideological obsession with bypassing state school authorities than what it really should be about, which is helping students who desperately need support. We know the government like to use the term ‘voucher'. No doubt it made them feel good using that sort of term. It is a bit like hitting student unions-they are more concerned with how it sounds and how it looks than what it actually does. If turning a blind eye to the practical effects of populist initiatives is a key competency for a minister for education and training in the Howard government, then the former minister is right up there. He certainly gets top marks for populism and a very big F for delivery because he has been incapable of ensuring that children who need help with their reading have the assistance this government said it would deliver. Labor will support the carrying over of unspent moneys, not because we think anything about the extraordinary incompetence of this government but because there are children in need of literacy assistance and support. But we also need to protect the integrity and value of this funding, so I foreshadow that during the consideration in detail stage of the bill I will move a substantive amendment to strengthen the conditions of funding to make sure that only qualified and accredited educators deliver this money. With this amendment we want to ensure that persons and organisations who deliver these programs other than already approved school authorities, because obviously they are registered to deliver these programs, meet national standards of quality-that is, professional teaching standards of tutors-and probity, such as financial and administrative records of whatever private companies might be involved. Labor supports the flexibility in the management of program funds between years. The current act does provide for some funding changes by regulation-for example, in cost supplementation for general recurrent and capital grants. The extension of regulation-making powers will introduce greater flexibility, allowing the government to expedite the reallocation of funds between program years because of changing or unexpected circumstances in the delivery of school programs. Regulations are, of course, subject to the standard disallowance procedures by either house. Nonetheless it is arguable that removing the requirement for legislative amendment may result in a lesser degree of parliamentary scrutiny for any changes to school programs funding covered by item 21. We have raised similar concerns about provisions in the Student Assistance Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 and the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Act 2005. Both contain provisions that replace requirements for legislative amendment with the power to amend by regulations and guidelines. That said, we do not want schools and students to suffer from administrative incompetence, and there are good reasons for carrying over funds in some circumstances. We understand there can be delays in capital projects, for example. But none of that gives a blank cheque for this flexibility to be abused by any minister for political purposes. We have seen already in the allocation of this schools capital funding that the previous minister has handed out huge grants to himself and his mates in the Liberal and National parties. I hope that the new minister does not continue down that path. I want to speak briefly about the provisions in this bill aimed at providing maximum general recurrent grants for a small number of non-government schools that cater for students with emotional, social or behavioural difficulties. We certainly support access by these schools to maximum general recurrent grants, as is already the case for special schools. These are high-needs schools dealing with high-needs students and they fully deserve increased support. We are only talking here about a small number of non-government community and church based schools that cater for students who have left mainstream schools because of their difficulties. The schools provide intensive support for these young people, some of whom are homeless and all of whom are in substantial need. These schools attract general recurrent grants under the government's policy of funding schools according to their socio-economic status characteristics. A strict application of the SES criteria, however, would deny these schools the maximum grants they need for the highly intensive support they provide to their students. The bill before the House provides for a separate classification of ‘special assistance schools' to enable the schools to receive the maximum level of general recurrent grant as received by non-government special schools for students with various disabilities. Labor supports this amendment, although I would point out to the minister that there are a number of schools in the government sector that need similar special consideration. These amendments are sensible. Once again, they will depend on cooperation with state authorities that recognise or register non-government schools for federal and state funding. Interestingly the amendment bill points out that the blanket approach of the government's funding scheme, based on the socio-economic status of school communities, is flawed. Such a crude and simplistic approach does not take into account the specific needs of students or the resources ally available to them; it simply applies the SES of the parents' locations without considering the particularly intensive education and support the schools provide. This principle of funding being based on an assessment of actual need and actual resources available is one that should apply to all schools. There is another part to this bill that corrects a technical flaw, where references in the act about accountability refer to section 20 rather than section 30 agreements. Labor agrees that the change to subsection 36(4) in the act has to be made. We note the assurances in the explanatory memorandum that this technical change will not affect the rights of or obligations on any person. I have set out in detail our concerns regarding the administrative incompetence and political misuse of the two significant funding programs dealt with in this bill. Both Investing in Our Schools and the tutorial vouchers initiative highlight the mess that has been left to the new minister by her predecessor, a mess this bill only begins to deal with. For these reasons, I will move the second reading amendment circulated in my name, and I urge the House to support this amendment. In doing so, I note that it should not be necessary to have to move such a second reading amendment to call on the government to make sure all programs are administered in ways that deliver maximum educational benefits for students. As my remarks indicate, that is not how this government has allocated this money. This money is going to those electorates that have Liberal and National Party members. It is not being distributed to the students or schools that need it most. It should not be necessary to move this amendment; unfortunately it is. On this occasion we need to explicitly highlight the administrative incompetence and the political pork-barrelling that has gone on with actu- these programs. Therefore I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for: (a) failing to deliver urgently-needed capital funds and literacy support in time for schools and students to achieve the benefits of those funds; (b) failing to protect the integrity and probity of its program for tutorial literacy vouchers, especially in the appointment of brokers for the delivery of tutorial assistance in some states; (c) approving capital funding under its ‘Investing in our schools' program in an unfair and unequal way between schools and regions, and (d) failing adequately to take into account the relative educational and financial needs of schools in the allocation of capital funding under the ‘Investing in our schools' program; and (2) calls on the Government to: (a) ensure that all programs are administered in ways that deliver maximum educational benefits for students; (b) take steps to assure the educational integrity and probity of its tutorial assistance for students with literacy needs; (c) direct some of the unspent funds for tutorial assistance for students with literacy needs for use by schools to develop appropriate programs for their students, in consultation with parents; and for the professional velopment of teachers to improve their literacy teaching skills; and (d) support improved accountability provisions for funding under the capital grants and tutorial assistance programs”.",31

11,Mr RANDALL,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I stand today as a proud member on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the Howard government in the House of Representatives pleased that I have the opportunity to speak on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006. I have not been here for the 10 years of the Howard government; I had a rest for three years. As a consequence, I cherish even more the opportunity to be here today representing the Howard government and my electorate of Canning in this place so that we can bring better government to this country, which we have done over the last 10 years. As I said, I am very pleased to speak on the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006. It is a pity the member for Jagajaga has left because I wanted to address a few remarks to her. Her ideologically driven diatribe is just an indication of why we are on this side of the House and they are on that side. We have had only today Martin Ferguson, the member for Batman, pointing out that the policy views of the Labor Party and the politics of envy placed on school policy before the last federal election is one of the things that they must move on from. We have a division in the Labor Party about the policy initiatives, particularly the educational policy initiatives, de- which were also highlighted in The Latham Diaries, which I read over the Christmas break. The diaries allowed me to peer into the dark heart of the Labor Party and to see some of the home truths that came out. Mark Latham pointed out the flawed policy of the politics of envy, which the Labor Party took to the last federal election. I am sure it cost them dearly because they were in the business of dividing the Australian community on the basis of class and envy and the Australian people saw through it. I am pleased to say that the Australian electorate is obviously a very sensible group of people, which makes very good judgments. I want to deal with a couple of the elements of the bill before I go to the Investing in Our Schools program. As it relates to the special non-government schools that do not qualify under the SES program, there needs to be special consideration that they receive the maximum. I am pleased to see the opposition agrees with that. The tutorial voucher initiative is a good policy. The funds that have not been used in 2005 will be transferred to 2006. This is for the children who did not achieve the year 3 minimum national reading benchmark in 2003. They are able to access $700 in the form of a voucher to achieve remedial help through approved brokers. Interestingly, the member for Jagajaga slams this again. I do not know whether the member for Jagajaga thinks we ever did anything good, but she slams this again as being wrong, out of kilter and not representative. The member for Jagajaga said this money should be sent back to the schools, yet when we send Investing in Our Schools money to the schools she says that is wrong and we should be dealing through the state bureaucracies. On the one hand, she says we should be sending money back to schools for literacy initiatives and, on the other hand, she says we should not be doing it in the Investing in Our Schools program. There is a good deal of hypocrisy there. Interestingly, New South Wales and Tasmania have had a big take-up-69 per cent for New South Wales and 61 per cent for Tasmania-but my home state of Western Australia had only a 30 per cent take-up. The crying shame of it all is that the member for Jagajaga's state had only a 12 per cent takeup of this initiative. You have to ask the question: why? It has nothing to do with implication; it has to do with the fact that in many cases the voucher initiative could not be delivered to some of the states because not all states were reporting children's performances against the national literacy benchmark to parents. So how could it be delivered if they did not have the information? These states deliberately tried to subvert and sink this initiative because they are ideologically opposed to it. In Western Australia, for example, the previous minister, Alan Carpenter, who is now the Premier, railed against this initiative. That is why there low take-up rate. We know that in Victoriathe member for Jagajaga's state-the bureaucratic bungling by that state and the obfuscation by the education bureaucracy was largely the reason why Victoria did not take up this initiative and give it to the young children who quite rightly deserve remedial treatment and remedial action. In terms of the amendments by regulation, the extension of regulation-making powers will introduce greater flexibility, allowing the government to expedite the reallocation of funds between programs because of unexpected changes in circumstances in the delivery of school programs. We have already seen this occurring in the voucher program and the Investing in Our Schools program. They are very good initiatives which I am pleased to see the Labor Party supporting, albeit reluctantly, if you listen to the member for Jagajaga. The Investing in Our Schools program is the main reason why I am very pleased to speak on this bill today. It is a sensational program for schools throughout Australia. It is a $1 billion program, with about $700 million going to the government school sector and $300 million going to the nongovernment school sector. That is over the period 2005 to 2008. Schools in this program can apply for up to $150,000. If they do not successfully take the whole lot in the first year-say, they take $10,000 to start withthey can continue to apply for funds from this program over this period. They are doing that and, as we have heard, they are doing it in a rush. In my electorate, for example, it is a highly popular initiative. It is really pleasing to see that the take-up has been so high and so welcomed. I am going to outline to the House a number of the projects that have been funded in my electorate and some of the responses I have had from schools. If you listen to the is a Labor Party, you would think this is a rort and is wrong in its delivery. The member for Jagajaga called it a mess. All I can say is that it is a happy mess because I have not met one school principal or school body yet that wants to give the money back. In fact, they are really happy to be involved in this program and they have contacted me in droves because suddenly it is seeping through. Not all of them quite understood what was going on. Initially there was a slow take-up, but then it turned into a rush once they all started talking to each other. The good, hard working P&Cs, parent bodies and school principals are out there with projects that they have wanted to deliver to their schools for years and have not had the funds to do so. One of the interesting things that the member opposite stated was that this was a pork-barrelling initiative. She talked about there being only $500,000 on average going to Labor Party electorates and $700,000 going to Liberal electorates. The fact is that, you apply for these funds, there is a good chance you will get them. If you do not apply for these funds-this is the crux of the matter-you have no chance of getting them. Why are schools more likely to be applying-if you listen to the member for Jagajaga-from coalition seats than from Labor seats? It is because we are promoting the initiative. I have written to all of the schools in my electorate-the government schools and non-government schools-and told them about this marvellous initiative. I have told them that I will endeavour to put in a support letter for the worthy projects for their schools. Just to demonstrate, even before this project got up and running, I happened to go to the Jarrahdale Primary School in my electorate, which is only a small school. The teacher there, Mr Ross Murray, happened to say to me last ANZAC Day that they were really keen to get some money because, with fewer than 100 kids in a small town, they were struggling to raise the money to build a shade over their playing area. You have heard the story about the kids that cannot go out during the summer in Western Australia because the monkey bars are too hot and the play equipment is too hot to sit on. Mr Murray wanted to put a shade over the play equipment at his school so that the kids could use it, but he could not raise the $12,000-odd to do it. Mr Murray is very happy now because not only did they get the money but also they have a shade structure over their playground equipment. This is something real and tangible for their school and they are very happy to have had it delivered. I can tell you that I am very welcome at Jarrahdale Primary School and many of the other schools in my electorate because they know that we are delivering the programs that the Labor Party dropped the ball on. Why are schools so bereft of funds for if these programs? During my career as a schoolteacher-and I was a teacher off and on for 18 years; I was not very politically active in those days so it was not very obvious to me-I could always tell when the Labor Party was in government because they were big spenders on the wrong sorts of programs. They would pull the money out of state schools, because they are their schools, as an area of savings. As a result, maintenance of the schools and the projects that were implemented in the schools during the administration of a Labor government at a state level fell by the wayside. It was not until a coalition government got back in again with decent receipts and budget surpluses that money could be put back into school infrastructure. During Labor's reign, paint comes off the railings and gutters fall off roofs, but when there is a change of government they start fixing these things up. Currently, there are Labor governments in every state in Australia. Why are schools so bereft of infrastructure? Because the state Labor governments have stopped investing in their own schools and they are begging somebody else to go in and help them with these necessary items. The member for Jagajaga described this initiative as pork-barrelling. She was quoted in an article entitled ‘School aid rorted: Labor MP' in the West Australian newspaper as saying: The Federal Government is rorting its Investing in Our Schools program by channelling more money into Liberal-held seats at the expense of Labor seats, according to ... Jenny Macklin. Five WA electorates getting the most money under the scheme, Kalgoorlie, O'Connor, Pearce, Forrest and Canning, were all held by Liberal MPs. Let me go through these seats. Kalgoorlie is at about six per cent, O'Connor is at about 25 per cent or some such figure, Forrest is in double figures at over 10 per cent and, surprise surprise, I am at 9.6 per cent. I cannot see any pork-barrelling in marginal seats there. The reason more money is not put into schools in Labor held seats is that Labor members do not promote them. As I said, I write to the schools and I promote them. My wife teaches at a school in the electorate of Swan-I was hoping the member would still be in the chamber so that I could explain this to him. Her school, South Perth Primary School, is unaware of the availability of this money. I wonder why! The Labor Party do not want to tell the schools of this good federal government initiative, so they are not promoting it. If they do not promote it, the uptake is obviously going to be much less. If the member for Swan will not write to his schools and tell them the money is available-I probably cannot write to the schools-I will encourage one of my Senate colleagues to write to all the schools in the electorate of Swan and tell them this money from the Investing in Our Schools program is available for infrastructure and maintenance programs in their schools. Then we will see the uptake in marginal electorates such as Swan and Cowan in Western Australia. I suspect that this is occurring right across Austrathat lia. The Labor members are trying to dumb down this initiative because it is not theirs and they do not support it. Mind you, I bet that when the schools take it up the members do not go out to the schools and say, ‘You really should give that money back.' You will not see that at all. The Labor members know it is a highly popular program, but they are not trying to get it up above the radar because it is not their initiative and they do not have any interest in promoting good government policy. Interestingly, the member for Jagajaga, who slams this and says it is all a rort, is on a margin of 4.5 per cent in her seat in the state of Victoria. I would have thought that if the member for Jagajaga wanted to be re-elected, particularly with the Labor Party's woes in Victoria at the moment, she might actually want to promote some good programs in her schools rather than talk them down. I am sure that the parent bodies there would be very happy to have these sorts of infrastructure agreements. Let me turn to the ridiculous behaviour over pork-barrelling. The state government assessment panels, loosely known as SATs, are state government advisory bodies. So state Labor government advisory bodies go out and assess these programs and make recommendations to us, and we take their recommendations. I will tell you how strong the recommendations are. Falcon Primary School in my electorate received over $100,000 for landscaping its grounds, air conditioning of special services, block floor coverings, school interior painting, library computer benchtops, data cabling and play equipment upgrades. These were all things the school wanted and they got over $117,000. But the thing they really wanted was a freezer room, costing $16,000, which the state assessment panel did not think was a worthy item. I am very disappointed by because, when I first went to this school about this program, that was the main item they said they wanted. So they got what they did not want and did not get what they did want. This is how much integrity this program has: the assessment panel's recommendation to us was against the wishes of the local member and, as a result, the school was well funded but not for the things they wanted. Mind you, I am still going to try hard for the freezer room because they still want it. They still have not got up to $150,000, so we hope that in another round of funding we can convince the assessment panel that the freezer room is needed for the school canteen. One of the other reasons we are having problems with this item in Western Australia-and I will certainly be putting out a press release about this-is that people were not exactly sure of how they should apply. They had the option of having the program funds delivered directly to the school or through the state education department. And guess what the state education department has done? It has taken a fee of 11 per cent handle each one of these programs. It is skimming off 11 per cent as a handling fee. If you take 11 per cent off the Falcon Primary School's $117,000, the department is getting about $12,000 or $13,000 and the school then has to find that money to do this program. I am sure that the Western Australian Minister for Education and Training, Ljiljanna Ravlich, whom I know and have a lot of respect for, would not really be happy with this because she knows how important this money is to the schools. I know that the previous minister wrote to her, but obviously the departmental officials wrote back and talked about handling fees, compliance and all that sort of stuff. I am going to be ensuring that my schools do not go through the state education department, because this is how they are being treated. The other thing the state education department has imposed on these bodies is a requirement to use approved government contractors to do the work. So the state government gives Falcon Primary School a list of approved contractors-businessmenfrom Perth who have to travel for over an hour down to Falcon Primary School to do the work. In an area where we have a shortage of people working on these sorts of projects, why can't the local small businessmen apply to build these structures and do this work? Because the state education department has imposed this condition on the schools. I could go through many of these programs, but I just want to outline one of them. Pinjarra Senior High School has been in dire need of funding for some time and, as a result, was very happy when it received $58,000. Most principals, particularly in government schools, do not like to say too much because they know they will be tarto geted by state Labor governments and authorities if they speak out, but Pinjarra principal Beth Aitken was quite happy to say on the record yesterday: I was absolutely delighted that Pinjarra high school received funding under the Investing in Our Schools program. We planned months ago to apply for round 2 funding. After the extensive exercise, our hard work paid off. During the approval process, which was very thorough, we were continually asked how we intended to use these funds in accordance with the guidelines. As schools may apply for up to $150,000, we have every intention of applying for further funding. This is a school principal who is very happy with the program. So the Socialist Left of the Labor Party and the member for Jagajaga, who are trying to dumb down this program by saying it is uneven, inequitable et cetera, are totally wrong. The government is doing this program in cooperation with the schools because they are happy with it. The member for Jagajaga talks about doing it in cooperation with the states, but why would you when you see the conditions imposed by the Western Australian Department of Education and Training? It is obvious that we have to go directly to the schools. As a result, the tics of envy is raising its head. Many other schools in my electorate have been beneficiaries of this program. Just to outline how widespread across the electorate they are, Cecil Andrews Senior High School at Armadale received $87,000 for an ICT upgrade and Excelsior Primary School at Canning Vale, a brand new primary school which thought that, because it opened only last year, it would not be eligible for any of this, received $150,000 for ICT, library, music resources and sporting infrastructure. So it is a great program and it is well supported. I support this bill. (Time expired)",38
12,Dr EMERSON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Rankin) (11.00 am)The needs of the student must come first. The needs of the student must prevail over dogma on either side of politics when it comes to education policy. In the 21st century it has already been established that cation is the paramount source of a nation's prosperity. Education, indeed, is the key that unlocks two doors. It unlocks a door to a prosperous nation. It unlocks a door to a fair nation. A government can provide no greater gift to young people in this country than a good education that is not compromised by the dogma of any politician in federal or state parliaments. However, the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006 perpetuates the flawed SES funding model, flawed because that funding model, although ostensibly based on the socio-economic status of the parents whose children go to school, does not give an outcome based on need. We have seen in this parliament long and very acrimonious debates about funding going to the wealthiest non-government schools in this country. The fact of the matter is that by the year 2008 the wealthiest 64 nongovernment schools in the country will be polireceiving under the SES funding model an extra $100 million-indeed it could be much more than that-than they would have received under the previous funding model. I will not engage in the politics of envy. I am simply pointing out that the needs based funding model that the government has developed is so fundamentally flawed that the wealthiest non-government schools are getting some of the biggest benefits. That is either by accident or by design, and I do not want to spend too much time in parliament making accusations as to whether it is deliberate or it is unintentional but incompetent. Either way it leads to a very unfair distribution of funding and violates the principle of the needs of the child being paramount in determining funding allocations. This legislation seeks to accommodate delays that have occurred in capital works edu- spending and literacy support. There have been very substantial delays. It is true, as the member for Jagajaga has pointed out, that that can be put down to incompetence on the part of this government. Any time that there are major new programs there is always a period of trying to get those programs up and running and getting staff on board within Commonwealth departments and governments systematically underestimate the challenges associated with doing that. As a consequence, very often new programs do produce delays that could and should have been anticipated at the time. So there is a problem of government incompetence. Nevertheless, this legislation accommodates those delays and makes sure that the funding is preserved and does go to Australian schools. Similarly, there have been real problems with the implementation of the program for the tutorial literacy vouchers to be provided by this government. This program is meant to be for students who do not meet literacy standards but, as we have heard from previous speakers, some students who have not met literacy standards in year 3 are now sitting year 5 literacy tests without having had the benefit of this program. The take-up rate has been disappointingly low, particularly in Victoria and in my home state of Queensland. One of the fundamental reasons for that is the Howard government has refused to work with the states on the implementation of these tutorial literacy vouchers. And that is what I mean about dogma prevailing over the needs of the child. During the election campaign, the government effectively indicated that it was unwilling to work with the state governments on matters such as these. That was an expression of its dogma. It was an expression of the federal government's centralisation of government activity that has been displayed in so many areas of government policy. If the Council of Australian Governments and the ministerial councils had been properly used, we would have had a better result in relation to these vouchers. Since Labor is so concerned that the needs of the child be met in education, we are supporting this legislation but with a substantive amendment that the member for Jagajaga will be moving during the consideration in detail stage and also with a second reading amendment that has already been moved, which I had the pleasure of seconding. Moving more broadly to the state of the education system in Australia, international tests demonstrate that on average Australians do very well compared with those in other developed countries. That is heartening. Overall our education system measures up quite well against other OECD countries. But, very disturbingly, a disproportionately large number of Australian students do badly-there is a long tail of them-and these are the disadvantaged students, the disadvantaged children, in our society. Some of these measures, particularly the tutorial literacy vouchers, are conceptually designed to help ameliorate those problems of disadvantage, but dogma has gotten in the way and they are not working very well. The lack of attention being paid to Australia's disadvantaged students is a national disgrace. The costs of it are huge not only to the children but also to the wider community and to society as a whole. The truth of the matter is that today's disadvantaged students and neglected students are very big contributors to tomorrow's prison population. If you look at the history of prisoners in our jails, you will find very high levels of functional illiteracy. Very commonly, a large proportion of the prisoners have been expelled from school or excluded from school on a number of occasions. A very large proportion of them left school before completing year 10-not year 12, but year 10. So the costs to the community of neglected and disadvantaged children in our country are being felt every day. The cost of accommodating our prison population, to put it in dollars and cents, runs to more than $2 billion a year, but that cost is insignificant compared with the trauma of broken homes, domestic violence, criminal behaviour such as breaking and entering, and substance abuse-addiction to very bad and damaging dugs. All of these costs are felt by the wider community. My electorate substantially covers Logan City, and it is clear that some very good work is being done there, but the problem of chronic school absences in Logan City is acute. It is clear that several hundred year 7 students in the Logan-Beaudesert area miss school for more than 20 per cent of the year. If they miss school for more than 20 per cent of the year, they cannot participate effectively in school and they cannot get a good education. A staggering 65 per cent of those chronic school absences are parent condoned-that is, it is not a naughty little kid wagging school without the parent's knowledge; the parent knows it and condones it. I hear statements such as, ‘If it was good enough for me not to attend school, it is good enough for my kids not to attend school.' I hear evidence of caseworkers saying that on occasions a mother who is just so depressed-often it is a single mother who is just unable to cope-keeps the kids home, perhaps to help her out. These are great social tragedies, yet they are being kept out the public gaze because the problem is so large. The measurement of the number of kids who were missing for more than 20 per cent of the year led to a caseload so great that there was no prospect of the authorities being able to deal with it, so they lifted bar to those missing for more than one-third of the year. These children are neglected and they are being condemned to a very tough life. It would be easy to conclude, as so many people do, that this is a problem unique to Logan City or to a few places around Australia-that it does not really happen in middle Australia and it does not happen in affluent Australia-but the truth is that it does happen in middle Australia. However, there are no coordinated or nationally collected statistics on chronic school absences. I say here today that I will be shining a light on the problem of chronic school absences in this country, because I believe it is the single most pressing issue facing Australia today. We should be embracing an agenda where economy meets society. The Council of Australian Governments has an opportunity to embrace such an agenda. Let me explain. Premier Steve Bracks, Premier Peter Beattie and the other premiers have been doing a large amount of work on a social agenda: investing in the education of young people, remedying social exclusion and social disadvantage of school students and investing in preventative health. It is a very wise and modern agenda that merges economy and society, because those are good investments for the economy as well as for society. There was an opportunity at the Council of Australian Governments meeting a couple of weeks ago for the Howard government to replicate the national competition policy principles by agreeing to ‘competition payments'-in this case reform payments-to the states, which have to bear a very substanof tial amount of these costs, and to consider them not just as a cost but as an investment in the future and, as the states achieved particularly good outcomes, those payments would flow. The Commonwealth did not rule that out, but it did not formally embrace it. I, the for one, would like to see that happen. I would rather the Commonwealth and the states work together through the Council of Australian Governments and the ministerial councils than see the dogma that is driving this government with a number of these programs to bypass the states. Students only lose as a result. Perhaps it makes Howard government ministers and backbenchers feel good to bypass the states, but the needs of the child must prevail over dogma on both sides of politics. Another area of neglect that feeds into the problem of chronic school absences is in preschool education. In Australia today around 60,000 young kids are missing out on a preschool education, and most of them are disadvantaged. When I talk to primary school principals, they tell me that it is very easy to identify which children arriving at school have had the benefit of a preschool education and which have not. A preschool education assists with the socialising of children so that they get used to being with other children. It gives them very basic learning skills, the purpose of which is that, when those children arrive at school, from day one they are ready to learn. Children who go through a proper preschool education arrive at primary school ready to learn. The children who do not, very commonly, are not ready to learn because they are trying to get used to being with so many other kids and they do not necessarily have those basic learning skills, particularly if they come from households where the parents themselves did not have a good education and cannot do basic reading at home. In many of those disadvantaged households the only book is a telephone book. I know that in situations such as this in my area of Logan City teachers are trying to get kids to read the junk mail-at least it is some written material that is sitting in their homes. It is than nothing. So that is the low base from which we start in many of these instances. I have to say that it was a previous Labor government, in 1984, that abandoned Commonwealth responsibility and involvement in preschool education, other than for Indigenous students. This government has carried that on. This government has done some pretty good work in relation to Indigenous students, in making sure that they have some sort of opportunity to have a preschool education, but so many non-Indigenous and Indigenous children are missing out on a preschool education. The government did embrace an early childhood development program a few years ago, but there has been no mention of the idea of a nationally coordinated, nationally consistent preschool education program. One consequence of that is that we do not know in fact how many kids are missing out on a preschool education. If you look at state statistics that are compiled, some states are reporting that 101 per cent of four-year-olds are attending a preschool. It is bewildering that 101 per cent could be attending, but they are the official figures coming out of some of the states. The truth is that a lot of kids are missing out on a preschool education. We should be embracing a nationally consistent approach to quality preschool education and making sure that every four-year-old gets at least 15 hours of preschool a week, either at a preschool or, while it is being ramped up, at least at an accredited child-care centre, so that it is not just childminding but a genuine preschool education. Since 1984 virtually all the enrolment growth in schools in Australia has been in non-government schools. I think there has been about a one per cent increase in enrolments in government schools. One consequence of this is that, as parents who can get together enough money are taking their kids better out of government schools and putting them into non-government schools, in poorer areas those classes are being residualised. What I mean by that is that a very large proportion of those kids are very needy. They have disadvantages, and those disadvantages should be remedied in any decent society but the funding is just not there. That is why I say we should base our funding on the needs of the child, focusing on the needs of the child, not on whether the school is a non-government or a government school. I point out that distinctions between government and non-government schools in Australia are blurring now as nongovernment schools get more funding out of the SES funding model and as government schools rely more and more on the contributions from parents-effectively de facto fees and other so-called voluntary contributions which if not made would mean that the schools in some cases would be unable to pay the teachers, and they certainly would not be able to get some of the most basic facilities. So those distinctions are already blurring. Let us concentrate on the needs of the child and let us not get hung up on the dogma of whether kids are going to a government or a non-government school. Under a needs based funding formula, extra funding would go to those schools for remedial literacy and numeracy programs and to full-service schools-that is, counselling, anger management, school nurses, a visiting GP. Marsden State High School in my electorate is a magnificent example of the full-service school approach. There are huge opportunities. Let us get some common ground across the political divide, concentrate on the needs of the child and abandon the dogma that has for so long marred this debate.",43
13,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I rise today to speak to the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006, and in so doing allow school communities around Australia, particularly those in my home state of Tasmania, to no longer go unheard. Today they will be given a voice and an opportunity to be heard. Before dwelling on the bill I would like to congratulate the member for Rankin, as he departs the chamber, on much of his contribution today. I would have to say in a spirit of bipartisanship that it is really helpful for us to have these kinds of discussions and to be able to look at the pitfalls of education in Australia in a rational, sensible and calm way. The member for Rankin's contribution today stands once more in stark contrast to the member for Jagajaga's contribution. I regret to inform the House that the member for Jagajaga is no longer in the chamber to listen to the debate in which she has been so antagonistic. The contributions of the shadow spokesman for education are always so angry, in stark contrast to those of the member for Rankin. They are always embedded with dogma and even, at times, hatred towards the government of the day-in this case the Liberal government-simply because of its colour. It is the same dogma which she uses to attack the Howard government; the previous excellent minister for education, Dr Nelson; and the current excellent education minister, Mrs Bishop. But that same dogma prevents her from ever challenging her state Labor colleagues. I am filled with regret at this fact. I do not think anybody in this chamber today, or anybody listening to this broadcast or reading the Hansard, is confused any more about who is responsible for state education in this country. The Australian Education Union and the Australian Labor Party in the past have tried to provoke some sort of twisted rewriting of history as to who is responsible. The reality is that state schools in Australia are the responsibility, principally, of the states. I tend to have a slightly different view to a black and white one, though. Really, they are the responsibility of all of us-all levels of government. I have seen in Tasmania how even local government is beginning to have a major role in the long-term success of schools in its municipality. I cannot think of a better example than Scottsdale High School, which is in my electorate of Bass quite and in probably one of the most beautiful corners of Australia in the north-east-Dr Nelson has visited there. The local Dorset council was one of the greatest supporters and promoters of a major upgrade that occurred there in recent times. All levels of government share a responsibility for education in this country. That goes not just for state schools but also for non-government schools. We have a shared responsibility, because we ought to have a shared commitment to the future of this country. In closing, I will not throw too many more bouquets to the member for Rankin, but I will say that I really appreciated his remarks, which were directed at children who in some cases are being neglected. This is a most regrettable thing that is happening in Australia in certain situations. I would like to join with him today in saying that I too would like to commit to seeing a redress and an improvement in the future prospects for children who just do not get the same start in life that so many others do. Apart from a minor drafting area, there are five main features of the bill that we are debating today. The first is to create capacity within the legislation for the government to be able to give more support to certain types of so-called special schools that cater for students who are at risk of leaving school for, if you like, non-academic reasons, such as social, emotional or behavioural problems. The bill will also allow the government to reallocate unspent funding from the 2005 program to the 2006 program for government schools under the Investing in Our Schools program. It will also allow the government to bring forward funding from the 2008 program into 2006. The bill will also allow unspent funding from the generally very successful pilot known as the Tutorial Voucher Initiative, which was conducted in 2005, to be used in the 2006 program year. I welcome that. The bill also allows greater flexibility for the use of funding under the act to allow funding for a program year to be carried over or brought forward as necessary to another program year. I am greatly supportive of this. It is time that schools in Australia and dents in particular are heard again. I appreciate that health has been a major facet of political debate in recent years, and I hope that it continues to be an important issue that is discussed and debated. I still believe that education is one of the great frontiers where we need to make more progress in this country. That is why I am proud to be a part of the Howard government. It is not about dogma; it is about our commitment to students and the future of our great country. This government, in word and deed, is about building better communities, and one way we can do that is by giving more and better supportand strategic support-to schools all around Australia, and in particular to students, from whatever school they may come. Through this bill we will be able to provide more opportunities for the boys and girls who, in some cases, attend schools which have been neglected by their owners or custodians, the state governments. In my home state of Tasmania, the Australian government is spending millions of dollars every year to fund infrastructure projects in schools that the state government has left behind. I am not even of a mind to congratulate the Australian government too much on doing that. I believe that the Australian government is doing what it ought to be doinginvesting in our schools. We do not need a gold medal or a blue ribbon from our peers or from voters to tell us what a great job we are doing. I feel that it is our responsibility, and I feel that we are doing a job and that we should get on and continue to do that job. However, having said all of that, the Investing in Our Schools program was a commitment made by the coalition prior to the 2004 federal election-an election which saw me and a number of my colleagues on this side of the House elected for the first time. I believe that the Investing in Our stuSchools commitment was one of the policy successes and major reasons for the historic return of the Howard government, which is now just one day away from achieving its 10th anniversary. I am so proud of this program, because I have seen the way it has been appreciated and taken up by school principals, school teachers and by school parent and friend bodies. They have seen an opportunity to have an input into the future improvement of their schools. We have witnessed schools which have suffered similar neglect to the neglect suffered by some of the children that the member for Rankin described. I was one of the teachers who worked in those schools. As a member of federal parliament, I am very proud to be able to have as part of my canvas the fact that I worked as a public teacher in secondary state schools in Northern Tasmania. Those years were some of the best years of my life. I digress for a moment to say that the year of teaching I did is the one that I remember most fondly. After a number of years of being inexperienced, I think I got a little better. I enjoyed it so much-it was the best year of teaching I ever did. But it was the coldest year I ever taught. Can you believe, ladies and gentlemen, that in the state of Tasmania there are classrooms that do not have heaters? People might not believe this, but it is true. I worked in a school where the classrooms in the middle of winter were unheated. We could survive the summer months because they were brief and not that hot, but for some period of time the classrooms were so hot they were unbearable. But, being Tasmanian, we could live with that because we knew that the season would come and go and that for much of it we were on recreation leave. I suppose that is part of being a Tasmanian. It can get very hot, but when it does you know the end is not far away. I taught in classrooms with no heaters-to correct myself, they did have heaters but they were not working. This was at a time when Tasmania, like it is today, was enjoying record receipts of federal funding-not just through the federal schools funding program but through its recurrent revenue, which was achieved by the great success of the GST and a growing economy. So what did I do? I would carry, along with my little tote tray of whiteboard markers and chalk, a twokilowatt heater from classroom to classroom. For anybody who saw me, it would have looked pretty funny to see a schoolteacher wandering from class to class with a little fan heater. I have to say that a two-kilowatt heater plugged in for 40 minutes in a stonecold classroom did not really warm it up very much either. I will never allow those experiences to depart from my memory because I will never forget the way those kids felt and the lack of learning that occurred because they were last uncomfortable. It was a work site and a workplace. It was where I worked but, equally, it was where those 25 to 43 students worked-it was their workplace. No adult would tolerate working in an eightor ninedegree classroom; they would not do it. But because they were children, I think there was a view that it could be allowed to continue without being challenged. I think that is disgraceful. We are taking away not just the comfort of life but an opportunity to do well and to learn such that, just as the member for Rankin explained, children with a good start in life can enjoy a prosperous and happy future. I will never forget that, and I never want to be accused of being in part to blame for providing conditions to children in classrooms such as I have described. The Investing in Our Schools program has already invested $650,000 in schools in my electorate alone. I am very proud of this. These are not initiatives where the Australian government has walked in and said, ‘Hey, we think you should do this or that,' or even where the state government has walked in and said, ‘We think you should apply for the funding to achieve this or that.' They are initiatives which have come from the school community. Who else is better placed to identify the needs of the school community? Branxholm Primary School, a very small school in my community, has already received a $50,000 grant to redevelop the playground. Brooks High School will be investing $12,000 in an IT upgrade. Launceston College, my old college, has received a $48,000 grant to redevelop the old theatrette. Fantastic: at last Lilydale District High School will be able to provide some shaded areas to students with their grant. Mowbray Heights Primary School, one of the little gold nuggets in Bass-a wonderful school with wonderful leadership-will be making improvements to their outside shade structures as well. The list goes on. Without naming the schools, I wish to read some examples that have been provided to me of comments which have been made in the application process. This school asked for a carpet to be replaced using the federal Investing in Our Schools program funding. In their application they said: The age of the section of carpet relating to the project is over 30 years old. The condition of the carpet throughout this area is poor. In classrooms and office areas carpet is threadbare in high use areas and joins are coming apart. Badly worn carpet is difficult to clean, unwelcoming for students to sit on and at times can cause accidental falls. Another school which has successfully received a grant said in its application form: The classroom was built in 1965. The classroom is an outdated space which limits flexibility to deliver curriculum. Teachers work tirelessly to create a stimulating learning environment; however, the overcrowded nature of this classroom provides many challenges which simply cannot be overcome by outstanding teacher planning and creativity. The third one I would like to read is, again, for carpet. Can you believe that we have schools crying out for funding for carpet? This school says: The current carpet is hard and worn. It does not match the remaining carpet. As this is our infant block, the students are sitting on the floor a are working in groups on the floor area. After lunch, the students have a rest time. They lay on the floor for this and again the current carpet is hard and uncomfortable. The existing carpet is old. New carpet will be healthier for our students, for example, dirt, dust mites et cetera. Safety-a new carpet will be less slippery because it will not be smooth because of wear. This is a government school in northern Tasmania after nearly eight years of a Labor government which has constantly attempted to hammer the Howard government. It is one of the state government's own schools, at a time of record state government income, largely due to the GST. The state government has allowed a school in 2005 to be confronted with an application form in which it can write words such as I have just described. This greatly upsets me and I do not want to allow the state government to get away with it any longer. We have an opportunity in Tasmania, there being a state election very soon. I am very pleased with the shadow education spokesman, Mr Gutwein, who has constantly put the government on notice in regard to its lack of investment in its own schools. Indeed I am very hopeful that the people of Tasmania will take the opportunity on 18 March to send a message to the Lennon government with its warped priorities, which would rather spend $650,000 on a dud governor than to employ another 10 teachers, which it could have done for the same amount. A key element of the Investing in Our Schools program is that the school community itself decides on what infrastructure projects should be a priority. The parents, the teachers and, most importantly, the students have an opportunity-which I think is a first-to be involved in deciding what initiatives will make their school better. I have already given some examples of that. I lot or would like to think that the Tasmanian state government could not walk away from its past efforts of treating schools and students with contempt. The Australian government is committed to education in ways that we have never seen before. I am proud to be a part of this devotion to school upgrading, but I am continually angry and frustrated at state governments who continue to overlook the needs of their schools. In Tasmania right now, at the beginning of a school year and a school term, the state government's attitude even to special needs students is one of the clearest examples of how Labor has got its priorities utterly wrong. Recently I attended a meeting of parents and friends who are quite concerned and, in many cases, angry about both the closure of special needs schools and the recent cutback in teacher aide time for students who have been involved in mainstream schools due to the inclusion policy. Instead of Minister Paula Wriedt addressing the meeting, she sent representatives from her department. They heard a long list of concerns, which included: the lack of ability of mainstream schools to provide support to children who have disabilities; poor application of processes for children who have special needs; and that parents feel as though they are at the end of the food chain and are simply subject to the decisions which are being made about their children. We have even heard an example of a quadriplegic child-a beautiful little girl whom I have met-who, at last report, will be left unattended for one hour per day. She is five years old. How can this be? In the past we have had trendy decision making to move away from special needs schools. I have a personal view on this: it was a bad decision to move away from special needs schools. However, I do not want to say that all children with disabilities ought be placed in special schools. But I do believe that, in the best interests of the child, the people who love that child the most-not the principals, the teachers or the government but the parents-ought to have a choice. I firmly believe that a key part of an inclusion policy should be a strong element of choice-they at least should have the opportunity to utilise a special school if they think it is in the child's best interests. I want to take the opportunity in the last moments of my contribution to call on the state government to give these students the support which they deserve and need so that they, too, like other mainstream students, can live their lives to their full potential. I commend the bill to the House.",47
14,Mr HAYES,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"One of the most significant institutions in our local communities is our schools. Let me make it clear from the outset of my contribution on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006 that I am-and, I would imagine, every other member in this place would be-a supporter of our education system. I genuinely believe that my electorate has some of the best schools and certainly the best school administrators and educators in the country. In making these comments about local schools, I would like to take the opportunity to welcome the new Campbelltown School Education Director, Mr Hedley Mooney, to our region. Prior to taking up this appointment, Mr Mooney was a teacher at Miller High School. He will now have the opportunity to work at both ends of my electorate. I would also like to take this opportunity early in my contribution on the bill to record my thanks for the exceptional work done over many years by Mr Greg Whitby, the former Chief Executive Officer of the Catholic Education Office, Diocese of Wollongong. Mr to Whitby's area of responsibility, apart from the South Coast, covered Macarthur-a large slab of my electorate. I know that he is a very well respected and well regarded educator and education administrator. I was very disappointed to hear that Greg had decided to move on to the Diocese of Parramatta later this year. I am sure that he will continue his excellent work there for the benefit of the local schools and the students now under his charge. I will not be opposing this bill, but I will be strongly supporting Labor's second reading amendment, which points to some serious maladministration in the Investing in Our Schools program. The Investing in Our Schools program has become the smaller, school based version of the regional rorts scheme. It has become yet another manifestation of the government's decade-long addiction to heaping largesse on places where they believe it is needed as opposed to assisting those who need it most. When the minister says how important this program is to the government, there is no doubt in my mind that she is referring not to an overwhelming desire to improve schools as a matter of good public policy but rather to the government's desire to use schools funding to pick up where other porkbarrelling efforts have left off. I can only presume that, when the government came up with the program, they thought that the members of the opposition would be a little too scared to criticise it, because it is dealing with federal grants to schools. When it comes to schools funding, I am not going to be slow in getting off the mark to make a criticism, particularly when I see so many schools in my electorate where this criticism is well deserved. I refer to the funding information that has recently come to light following answers to questions on notice received by the member for Gorton. The extent to which this government is willing to go when it comes to porkbarrelling quite frankly knows no bounds. A decade of this addiction to garnering support through pork-barrelling has now extended, as I said earlier, to our local schools. This is the same government whose Prime Minister warned in the party room on Tuesday to avoid giving a sense of arrogance or hubris. You could just see the Prime Minister saying, ‘If the Australian people get a whiff of the fact that we have tickets on ourselves, we're dead.' With respect, a whiff of tickets is going to be a little hard to smell under the wads of cash that this government has been splashing around the place. I return to the detail of the answers that were given to the member for Gorton. I would like to go through some details of their key elements. In round 1 of the Investing in Our Schools program some $69 million of the total $105 million was spent in coalition seats. Despite having less than 60 per cent of seats in this chamber, the electorates of government members received 66 per cent of the funding under round 1. Of itself, this is not a particularly damning statistic, but there is more. As always, you tend to find when dealing with this government that the devil is in the detail. There are a few more facts about the round 1 grants that are worthy of noting in this debate: 19 of the 20 electorates receiving the highest funding were coalition seats. The average fund per Nationals electorate was more than $1.3 million, the average fund per Liberal electorate was more than $700,000, the average fund per coalition electorate was more than $790,000 and the average grant per coalition marginal seat was more than $830,000. There was only one Labor held electorate in the list of the top 10 electorates when ranked by the average grant per school. But the most interesting thing is that the average Labor electorate received a mere $549,303. When it comes to the same statistics in New South Wales, which is probably a little closer to my focal point in this debate, the story does not change all that much. On average, Nationals electorates received more than $1.2 million each, Liberal electorates received more than $661,000 each and coalition electorates received more than $780,000 each, while the average Labor held electorate received a little over $489,000. Quite frankly, the statistics are at least revealing. In addition to the financial rorting of the program, it is interesting that in the lead-up to the announcement of the successful applications, successful schools were in some instances informed prior to any official announcement. Naturally, that sort of stuff occurring in electorates is of concern and, as a consequence, I had cause to investigate what was going on and why I was hearing that some schools had been receiving calls saying that their applications were going to be successful while others were not hearing anything. I found out that, in the true fashion of this government, the reason why some government members were able to inform the schools in their electorates earlier than anyone else was that some of them were going away at the time that the official announcement would be made. I cannot help but think that this approach was designed by the same people who came up with the idea that schools who were receiving money for flagpoles had to invite members of the government to be at the official raising of the flag. I am not going to deny that my electorate benefited from the scheme-obviously not to the same extent as coalition electorates, did receive $624,522 in funding grants. Some 22 schools in the electorate submitted applications for 17 projects, and the applications of 14 schools were approved. It was not the 100 per cent success rate that some other electorates experienced, but the average amount granted in my electorate was $44,000. Local schools in the electorate were awarded funds for a range of projects including air conditioning of classrooms, computer upgrades, shade structures and sporting and fitness equipment upgrades. These will be welcome additions to local schools when the government finally gets around to handing over the cheque. The problem and the most disappointing thing about this program is that, despite the obvious bias in the awarding of funds to particular electorates, the government does not yet have its house in order when it comes to actually handing over the cash. The government knew all this was coming. The government promised all these schools would receive additional funding for capital works during the last election campaign. Yet schools in my electorate are still waiting for their cheques, and they are schools which have already been told that they are successful. They have applied and been informed, but they are going to be sitting by the mailbox waiting to see when the money comes through so they can plan the commencement of this new work. There is no reasonable excuse that the government can come up with for not being prepared to handle the number of applications they received. It is simply not good enough to use the excuse that they were overwhelmed. It comes as no surprise that there was always going to be a rush of applications. All schools were promised the money during the last election campaign. Everybody knows that every school has a list of work that is waiting to be commenced but it should money become available. So why would it come as any surprise that the schools which were asking for funds, quite frankly, were not in need of those things and were not in need of having this work commenced as quickly as possible? Unlike other programs that hand out grants, schools need a lead time to manage any capital works project. Not only is there a need to consider the time needed to complete the work but also any disruption that such work might cause to the day-today management of a school also has to be taken into account. I know that when some schools have experienced delays in the past, they have had to delay the commencement of projects for up to a year, as the works to be dertaken may have been considered to be unsafe while the school was still in session. As everyone knows, the longest period that schools have available to them to complete projects, particularly physical projects, is the Christmas break. These schools need their money and they need it now. The bill before us today will grant the minister the ability to move funds around within a funding quadrennium. I have to say that, on the face of it, this is seen as sonable measure that will, hopefully, allow for better management of the administration of the program in the future. Hopefully, granting the minister greater flexibility will not result in a repeat of schools waiting for their money. Hopefully, it will result on this occasion in the Department of Education, Science and Training being more adept at processing applications in a more timely fashion and also assisting schools in their endeavour to complete the tasks which are subject to the grant. As I said, I broadly support these measures, but I must express a certain reservation. I do not know whether it is just me-sadly, it probably is not-but it is a bit rough to simply say, ‘You can trust this government when it comes to handing out money.' It is for this reason I am somewhat reservedly supporting the granting of increased flexibility to the minister, as I am fearful that the flexibility will simply be used as a means by which the minister can manipulate this program for purely political purposes. I hope I am shown to be wrong on that. If I am not shown to be incorrect and the minister manipulates the program for political purposes, the program will be further discredited-and the statistics for round 1 of the grants have proved this to be the case. The government has set about casting itself as the saviour of schools by splashing un- out $1 billion on capital works. It hopes to make itself look better than its state counterparts by contrasting their willingness to spend on school infrastructure. With the difficulty that state governments sometimes in encounter, they certainly do have to manage within their budgets, particularly when they seem to be starved continually of federal government funds. No doubt if the New South Wales government received all of its GST collected in New South Wales, it would a reabe spending more money on schools. Sadly, under the twisted arrangements-which this place has been steeped in for a little timethe New South Wales government receives only $10 billion in GST revenue, whilst at the same time it collects, on behalf of the Commonwealth, $13 billion from its residents in New South Wales. However, instead of becoming the great saviour of school communities, the government has created an administrative nightmare for itself and one, it has been shown, it is now struggling to control. School communities, parents, teachers and, in many instances, students have come together in good faith to apply for grants under the Investing in Our Schools program. They have all worked together for the benefit of their local schools to determine priorities for work and to complete their respective applications. It is about time this government stopped dithering and completed round 1 of this program in New South Wales, while ensuring that the cheques are in the hands of the schools and not sitting on someone's desk waiting to be put under the minister's nose for signature. Hot on the heels of that, I would like to see the announcement of a round 2 grant for New South Wales that many schools, particularly in my area, are currently waiting on. I can only think that the delay in announcing these grants, despite the public spin, is because the government has been caught out pork-barrelling again and it wants to-at least this time-make sure that it has the balance right. I will continue to encourage schools in my area to apply for grants under the next round of Investing in Our Schools program, which I expect will be open in New South Wales in a matter of days. I will continue to tell local principals, parents and citiimportant zens organisations and anyone who has a direct interest in the well-being of schools in my area that, quite frankly, they should get an application in so that the schools can actually benefit from this program. Given the increased flexibility afforded by this bill, I hope the government will improve the administration of the program. I hope that the increased flexibility will not be used to further manipulate or exacerbate the maladministration that has come to characterise this program. I hope it does not result in an absolute politicisation of an already highly politically motivated program. We have a new minister overseeing the program now, and I can only hope that she brings with her a new approach to the management of this important program.",51
15,Mr JOHNSON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"It is a pleasure to speak on this important bill, the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006, as the federal member for Ryan. I am delighted that the former Minister for Education, Science and Training is in the chamber, because his carriage of the portfolio was an inspiration to all of us. He ought to be commended and he certainly deserves the warm applause of this side of the parliament. Indeed, I know I speak for all my constituents in the electorate of Ryan. However, on such an important piece of legislation I have never heard such a low-key, downbeat contribution as that made by the new member for Werriwa, who preceded me. I again welcome him to the parliament. I certainly think he will do a better job than his predecessor. This bill is very important because it is all about our children. Education is an absolute top priority and top-drawer issue for the Howard government. It is certainly a priority for me in Ryan. We all know that having a vital, first-class education system is very to the individual and to our society collectively. It is very important to the national interest, our future prosperity and the social and economic security of our people. As the late Big Kev would have said, ‘I'm excited.' I am excited because this bill does great things for our young people. The bill reflects the very high emphasis the Howard government places on education. I am surprised and perplexed that all the speakers from the federal Labor opposition say they are going to support this bill but they have criticised it. You are walking both sides of the street here. How can you say that you support the bill but then come into parliament and criticise it? You should support it, speak warmly of it and vote for it or you should reject it, criticise it and attack it. You come in here and say, ‘This is a terrible bill; it does great damage to our young people and our education sector,' but you are going to vote for it. Where are the principles of the federal Labor Party? It is a quite remarkable attitude, I would suggest. Earlier we heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition continue this envy based politics that the Australian people have comprehensively rejected and repudiated. The 2004 federal election was another glowing endorsement of the Howard government. The people have said they do not want any of this cleavage between the private and public sectors. They want to get on with promoting the interests of our children and the broad educasion; tion sector. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition-the alternative Deputy Prime Minister of this country-comes in here whingeing, whining and carping, as she is want to do. It is just remarkable. Someone who would be the Deputy Prime Minister of this country speaks with little eloquence, full of envy based words and criticisms. How utterly embarrassing it would be for this country if the deputy federal Labor leader were one day to become the Deputy Prime Minister of this country. I know that the people my electorate of Ryan will be doing everything in their power to prevent the Labor Party ever coming to this side of the parliament. Dinosaur thinking still clearly permeates the upper echelons of the federal Labor Party and its brains trust. It is no wonder that in today's Australian the shadow minister for primary industries, resources, forestry and tourism, the member for Batman, wrote very eloquently about all the flaws of the federal Labor Party. They are bereft of ideas and any innovative policy. Conversely, this bill reflects the very strong, innovative ideas of this side of the parliament, which is why the people of Australia voted for the Howard government in October 2004 for the fourth consecutive time. This is a great bill. As I say, I cited to speak about it and I am sure that the students, the education practitioners and the mums and dads of Ryan will be very pleased that we are putting this bill forward for endorsement. This amendment to the Schools Assistance Act 2004 will allow for the provision of a record $33 billion in funding to Australian schools over the four years from 2005 to 2008. This funding is for both government and non-government schools, showing that we are not interested in cleavages or diviwe are interested in outcomes. I encourage the Labor Party in their misery in opposition to take their eyes off the ball of division and put their energy into outcomes-they might get a bit of respect from the Australian community. Clearly, the deputy Labor leader cannot come to terms with this notion. While the majority of funding will be allocated to government schools, we will not, unlike our state counterparts, neglect the enormous number of children in nonof government schools. This bill provides for three major initiatives to capitalise on the success of the government's Investing in Our Schools program, which has injected much needed funding into our schools. Firstly, the bill will bring forward extra funding into the Investing in Our Schools program for government schools. Secondly, it will provide extra funding for non-government schools supporting children at risk. Thirdly, it will allow for the re-allocation of funding from the 2005 reading voucher program to this year's program. The response of schools, both government and non-government, to the Investing in Our Schools program has been truly overwhelmingly and positive. More than 8,000 funding requests have come through from state government schools and already more than 2,600 schools have am exreceived funds from the Howard government. In responding to this success, this bill will bring forward from 2008 to 2006 over $186 million for small-scale infrastructure projects in state government schools. This is a very important initiative and I commend it very strongly. Often the importance of infrastructure is forgotten in our schools, but it can have a fundamental influence on outcomes for teachers and students alike. Students and teachers need to have areas for learning and socialising that are safe, comfortable and supportive. The Investing in Our Schools program and capital grants funding have already distributed much needed funding to many Australian schools for essential infrastructure work. The Howard government has committed some $1 billion to this superb and innovative policy program. It builds on the $1.7 billion that the government allocated for school capital works over the next quadrennium. Local school communities, as we all know, are forever fundraising trying to plug the gaps that funding from the state government should have filled but of course has not done so. I want to refer to some schools in my electorate that have been funding beneficiaries. They are schools with which I have a warm relationship. I attend them on a regular basis and have got to know their principals and the teachers. The Hilder Road State School at The Gap has been a recipient of an Investing in Our Schools grant to the tune of $55,000. I had the opportunity of meeting with the principal, Jo Bottrell and the P&C president, Dr James St John, shortly before these funds were allocated. They were absolutely thrilled. They acknowledged the Howard government for its role in the education sector and the boost to the school that this fundtion ing provided was something tremendous. It improved facilities for the kids. It is another occasion where the local community and the parents are not again asked to put their hands in their pockets. The other school in my electorate that has been the beneficiary of the Investing in Our Schools program is the Ironside State School at Saint Lucia, where the funding of $44,551 was spent on refurbishment of school pool change rooms. These change rooms were 45 years old. Important fixtures and fittings were either non-existent, broken or missing. This is absolutely remarkable. I strongly sanction here in the parliament Queensland state governments of both colours-coalition and Labor-for the neglect of the Ironside school over the last 45 years. How can it be that, in 45 years, a school has not had any funding from the state government, particularly since the Goss and Beattie Labor governments have been in office since 1989, bar two years? They have failed in those many years to spend any dollars at all on pools. Mr Bevis-Let me think who the minister was 20 years ago.",55
16,Mr JOHNSON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I hear an interjection from the member for Brisbane. If he had been paying careful attention to what I said he would have heard very clearly that, as a Liberal member of this government, I strongly condemned both sides of politics in the state arena-both coalition and Labor. Of course, we know that since 1989, the Queensland government has been of the same political flavour as the opposition, and the Labor Party claims the Queensland government is doing great things for Queensland. Of course, Queenslanders, I am sure, will put that one to rest at the next election. If the member for Brisbane would just focus on some ideas and some innovative policies, he might not be sitting in misery in the opposiafter the next election. I strongly suggest that he mind his own business and focus on his electorate. He only just got over the line at the last election. If he actually invested some of his time in the local community, he might not be sitting on just a two per cent margin. He might focus on his constituency in his own electorate. He might worry about his own policies and have some respect. As a nearly 25-year resident of my electorate, I am not in the business of swapping and changing positions like the members of the other side. I would rather have a 12 to 13 per cent margin any day than the two per cent margin that the member for Brisbane has, which is a very poor reflection on his local representation. This bill is about education, our young people and investing in our schools. That is what this government, led by the Prime Minister, has done in the last decade, which is why, I hasten to remind the Labor member for Brisbane, we will be celebrating a decade in office tomorrow. I know that you remain in misery over there. No doubt at some point you will follow your colleague the member for Maribyrnong and retire gracefully, one hopes. In the electorate of Ryan, a number of very worthy schools have also been recipients of capital grants funding. The Brookfield State School has been a tremendous recipient of this important funding. There are also two schools at The Gap that have qualified. Hilder Road State School, as I mentioned earlier, and St Peter Chanel Catholic School at The Gap have done very well from strong local representation and the funding that the Howard government has been able to provide for them. In the centenary suburbs, the Good News Lutheran Primary School was also a beneficiary of this program. I have had the great pleasure of visiting that school frequently. It is a wonderful school. I have been very happy to support applications by schools in the Ryan electorate for funding. I know how important it is. I know how the P&Cs value these funding initiatives and how much hard work they put into the schools and the education environment that their children are part of. They certainly know the value of this funding and the enormous potential it represents for their children. The Good News Lutheran Primary School, a non-government school, received $120,000 of capital works funding, which is a tremendous acknowledgment of what they are all about. This funding will pay for much needed facilities at the school. It will provide for a covered lunch area, walkways and, importantly, disabled access ramps. These are basic needs, but they are very important to the functioning of the school. Our children deserve all the support and safety that these investments can bring about. I pay tribute to the principal of the Good News Lutheran Primary School, Mr Loyd Fyffe. I am sure he is very pleased with the government's support for his school and I congratulate him for his stewardship and leadership of that school. This bill also ensures that all nongovernment schools catering primarily for students with social, emotional or behavioural difficulties who are at risk of leaving mainstream schooling will receive maximum general recurrent grant funding from the government. This is an important initiative. Children do not have a choice about the environment they are brought up in, which can often lead to problems. These children are vulnerable and we need to support them as much as we can. It is the children who are experiencing social, emotional and behavioural difficulties who probably are most at risk of falling through the cracks and we need to fill those cracks as quickly as possible. This bill does that very effectively. I want to talk about tutorial vouchers as well because they are an important aspect of this bill. The innovative pilot program, the Tutorial Voucher Initiative, which was undertaken in 2005 has been a great success. Children falling below the year 3 national reading benchmark in 2003 were able to access this voucher for tutorial support worth up to $700. During the pilot, the state government of Queensland did not contact eligible parents to make them aware of the availability of this program. I think that is an absolutely appalling dereliction of its duty and responsibility. How can a state government and a state education minister fail to contact eligible parents to make them aware of the availability of this voucher? The Beattie government should hang its head in shame not only over its current inept management of the health system in Queensland but also over another reflection of its incompetence and maladministration. It has let down vulnerable children and their parents, allowing them to miss out on this invaluable reading assistance, which we all know could really have made a difference in the lives of young kids. Unspent funding from the pilot program will now be made available in 2006 to provide literacy assistance for students who most need extra support. Children from Queensland who were unable to participate in this pilot program will now be able to benefit from its success. We all know that schools fall within the ambit of state governments in our constitutional structure. The states in this country rolling in the GST. Queensland, my home state, is awash in GST revenue. I keep saying this in the parliament and I will say it again, if there are any Queenslanders listening and certainly if there are any residents of Ryan listening. Queensland is the recipient of some $7.7 billion in GST revenue. This is a source of growth funding; it is rivers of gold for the states. In question time a couple of weeks ago, the Treasurer echoed the words of the new Western Australian Premier that when the GST was brought in it was in the national interest. We know that the Queensland Premier was the first to sign on the dotted line, despite all the rhetoric and hypocrisy in condemning the GST and national taxation reform. Queensland is receiving enormous benefits from the GST, yet it does not spend it on hospitals, schools and roads. Why is the state not spending it on Moggill Road? This is a state road. Why is it not spending it on the Ironside State School? Why is this GST revenue not being allocated for the pool change rooms in Ironside State School? It is absolutely incredible. I draw to the attention of the residents of St Lucia, Taringa and Toowong-those of you who have kids at Ironside State School-that the GST brings in revenue for the state government and it has every single dollar. Not a dollar comes to the Commonwealth. It is the responsibility of the state governments to invest that money in vital services such as health, roads and schools. I call upon the Queensland state Labor government and the Premier of Queensland to refocus. If he does, he just might get a bit of respect once again from the community which placed their faith in him. I am sure that would be something that would be very difficult for him to turn around. During the last federal election the state governments were happy to pretend that education was not their issue, that it was a are federal issue, and that it was not their responsibility. I can remember going to schools such as Toowong State School and seeing Education Union signs and placards all over the place. The reality is that we know that investment in schools is the responsibility of the state governments. Unfortunately, because they have abdicated that responsibility, we have been forced to come to their aid as much as we can. That is why the Howard Commonwealth government will not be shirking our responsibility. We will not be abdicating our commitment and responsibility to our young people. We are going to invest in education and the young people of Australia. We want to give them a very strong and secure future to give them all the opportunities of an education of high quality and excellence that we will deliver to them in the future. All this talk about inequitable redistribution of funds that the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party referred to, the idea of coalition electorates benefiting more, is absolute nonsense. We have more members, we have more seats, on this side of the chamber, so we will be getting more of an allocation where it is needed. It is simple mathematics that we will be the beneficiaries of more funding. I encourage the federal Labor opposition to try to refocus and to take heed of words in the great article in the Australian newspaper today by one of their frontbenchers that if they redirect their energies and focus on the Australian people they might receive some accolades for telling the story that the people of Australia want to hear. That story is about them. It is about their children's future, their hospitals, their roads and their schools. Get away from the idea that being in this parliament is all about yourselves. I strongly commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)",57
17,Ms HALL,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I think that all of us here in the House today could be forgiven for believing that this was a debate about the state government in Queensland. Members of this government constantly come into this House and criticise whichever state government represents the state that they come from. They say that education is the problem of the states, the roads are the problem of the states, health is the problem of the statesMr Johnson-They are. Read the Constitution.",60
18,Ms HALL,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I have news for the member for Ryan. He was elected to this place as a federal member of parliament, and I believe that he needs to justify the actions of his government-a federal government that does have responsibility for education and for the way the funds are allocated. We could also be forgiven for thinking that this debate was about the federal Labor Party, the opposition, and the member for Brisbane. Once again, this debate is on an education bill, which brings out some of the failings of this government, as will my contribution to this debate. This government has constantly let down the people of Australia when it comes to education, particularly the people I represent in this parliament. The government has an the appalling record on education. The actions of the previous Minister for Education, Science and Training, who constantly politicised education and used it as a tool to buy votes, are on the record for all the voters of Australia to see at the next election. It is interesting to note that many of the grants have gone to Liberal held marginal seats. It is an absolute disgrace. I would like to congratulate all the schools in the Shortland electorate which have been successful in securing funds through the government's Investing in Our Schools program. There were 36 successful schools in the Shortland electorate. They put a lot of work into their grant applications and I was very happy to support them. Under this government, a number of inequities have developed not only in education but in all areas. The government's unfair distribution of funds to schools has benefited rich private schools at the expense of public schools. In the Shortland electorate, close to 80 per cent of all school students attend public schools. I find it very disturbing that these 80 per cent of school students in the Shortland electorate are disadvantaged by the funding model that is used by this government. It is all very well to look after your mates, it is all very well to cater to your constituency, but as a government you have a responsibility to ensure that all studentschildren and young adults-have equal access to education and equal opportunities for the future. Education is about creating opportunities. Education is about the future of Australia. If this government wants to continue down the track of looking after or advantaging one section of the community, we as a nation will lose. The government has chosen a catchy subtitle for this legislation-as it always doesand it gives a very false impression of what the legislation is about. The Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006 will move uncommitted capital infrastructure funds from government schools from 2005 to 2006 and bring forward 2008 funding to 2006. It will move unspent funding under the Tutorial Voucher Initiative scheme from 2004 to 2006 and allow for funding to be carried over or brought forward to another year for all non per capita programs. It will also provide maximum general recurrent grants for a small number of non-government schools that cater for students with emotional, social or behavioural difficulties. A number of issues in bill impact on the quality of the education available to young people. As I said a moment ago, we are responsible for ensuring they have access to a quality education. Applications for the government's Investing in Our Schools program were called for at the beginning of last year. The announcement of successful applicants was finally made towards the end of last year. In true Howard government fashion, the successful schools in government held seats were announced by the sitting coalition members between three and seven days earlier than in Labor and Independent held electorates. Details of the successful applicants in Labor held seats were given to and announced by senators prior to being given to the members on this side of the House who represent those electorates. I managed to get the details of the successful applicants in the Shortland electorate not from the government but from the website. I contacted the schools and let them know they had been successful, because the government had not even done that. It was preoccupied with pork-barrelling and getting the most benefit it could from the release of this information. The successful schools, which had put all that effort into preparing their applications-schools which suffer from the funding formula because of the way this government advantages private schools-had to wait until after the government had gone through the exercise of promoting its members before it decided they were worthy of being notified. That is not good enough and I do not think it is the way education should be. Another example of the way the government has exploited programs for its own advantage was the school flagpoles program that was brought out by the previous minister. First of all, it was hide and seek to see if you could actually find details of the prothis gram. We spent many hours in my office trying to locate details of the program and, when we finally did, we were advised that there was a strict protocol for getting funding. Part of this strict protocol was having highlighted on the flagpole, ‘This flagpole was erected with funds received from the Howard government.' That sign had to be on the flagpole. The other thing that was very important was the flagpole had to be commissioned or dedicated before it could come into use and a coalition member had to go to the school to ensure that happened. Senators were being pulled in from all around the state to visit schools within electorates such as Shortland and the electorate of the member for Brisbane to officiate at flagpole ceremonies. The reason I have brought this into the debate is that it really highlights how this government is not about education but about promoting itself. Returning to the Investing in Our Schools program, it is important to note that only one ALP electorate actually figured in the top 20 electorates by amount. It is important to note that marginal government electorates figured very highly in the top 20 electorates. It is also very important to note that this program has been racked by problems. It has had one problem after another. In recent times numerous schools-and I will not name the schools because I know the way this government works-have been contacting my office saying: ‘Where's the money? Why haven't we received the funding that we finally found out about from you, because the government had been very reticent in advising us that we had been successful? We've been contacted by those people who have quoted to do this work saying that the price has gone up because it's been over 12 months since we submitted our application. Now the price to have this work done has increased.' A number of schools within my electorate have a very good relationship with their local communities and some of the builders, plumbers and other tradespeople are prepared to provide the capital works at the price that they quoted. But other schools have had to come up with extra money because the government did not think through the program properly and did not make sure that the proper process was in place to ensure that once these schools had been notified of approved grants they actually received the money. To my way of thinking, the first thing you do is put in place a process. You launch the applications, you have a closing date for the applications and then you go through a period when you decide on the successful applications. Maybe there are occasions when that can be extended. There has been quite a blow-out in this program's extension dates and some people are still waiting to be notified whether their applications have been successful in the second round. That was supposed to be December, then it was supposed to be February and now the latest date, I believe, is April. So you have in place a process of a call for applications, closing of deliver. applications, assessing the applications and notifying successful applicants and then, finally, ensuring that the applicants actually get the money that they have been successful in obtaining through the grants program. Unfortunately, this grant process has not worked this way. The other issue I would like to pick up on is the Tutorial Voucher Initiative scheme. The vouchers were to be used for students who were in third class in 2003. Many of these students are now in sixth class, just about ready to enter high school, and have not had their educational needs addressed. For those students in third class who failed the skills tests, showed that they would have ongoing learning difficulties and had problems in the areas of numeracy and literacy, the previous minister announced that he had the solution: ‘We will provide these vouchers to students who fail these exams and in this way we will prevent the problem being exacerbated; we will address the problem up front.' Three years later, only 36 per cent of students who had been identified as being at risk have accessed that program. The government stands condemned for this. It is a very big black mark against the government. The member for Ryan stood up in this parliament and-surprise, surprise!-blamed the state government. It is no wonder that we on this side of the House get sick of hearing: ‘I know nothing.' ‘It's not my responsibility.' ‘It's somebody else's fault.' ‘No, I can't take responsibility for that.' ‘It's the state government.' ‘It's my neighbour.' ‘It's got to be the local council.' If that is an example of good government, I strongly suggest that the members on the other side of this House take a very close look at what they have been elected to this parliament to do. They have not been elected to blame somebody else. They have been elected to this parliament to I issue a challenge to each and every one of those members to actually deliver-to make sure that students in their electorates who have been identified as being at risk actually get the assistance they need. This system was flawed from the start. Once again, it was a bright idea of the minister, who thought, ‘This sounds like something that will be effective,' but it was not thought through or looked at properly. It took until 2005 before any of the students identified as being at risk could access this scheme. Now here we are in 2006 extending the scheme. I have no problem with the concept of rolling over money and being a little flexible about the time it takes for funds to be spent, provided that those funds reach the people that should receive them. This government has a record of not being accountable for its actions, and that is my concern. We need improved accountability for the Tutorial Voucher Initiative program. We also need to make the government much more accountable and the process of allocating capital grants to schools in the Investing in Our Schools program much more open. The government has to get real about things. It has to act in the interests of the students, and it needs to move away from its pork-barrelling approach to education. Education is about Australia's future; it is not about electing government members to marginal seats. (Time expired)",60
19,Mrs HULL,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"It is always a pleasure to follow the exciting, motivating and riveting addresses of the member for Shortland, because she is always so enthusiastic and excited about all of these great initiatives that are being delivered by the Howard-Vaile government. It is always very exciting to follow her because you know that, somewhere along the line, people like to see that their glass is half full rather than half empty. You can always rest assured that the former speaker's glass is generally half empty when we talk about any initiatives that have been delivered by this government. I rise to speak in support of the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006. This bill is incredibly important to ensure that schools such as those in my electorate of Riverina can access funding more quickly to ensure that infrastructure needs are met. The Investing in Our Schools program, which was part of the original legislation, has been very well received, with 8,000 applications received in 2005. Last year, 4,034 round 1 projects were approved for our schools. This program is part of the Australian government's commitment to providing $1 billion for capital infrastructure grants for government and non-government schools from 2005 to 2008, bringing the total funding for capital grants to $2.7 billion over the three-year period. The Investing in Our Schools program provides grants totalling $700 million for government schools and $300 million for nongovernment schools. According to the member for Jagajaga's press release, the Riverina was the thirdhighest recipient, of which I am very proud. These grants of $1.4 million for over 40 schools were announced in October. This funding allows the wider school communities to make decisions about infrastructure changes which are imperative in ensuring that students are educated in the best environment possible. Some of these projects are so urgent many schools are already concerned about the time they will have to deliver some of these enormously important infrastructure grants. There were so many applications lodged that it has taken longer than was anticipated to deliver the funds advice. There is a reason why so many program applications have been lodged. The member for Shortland has said that it is state bashing, but the reason there are so many applications is simply state neglect. Mr Hartsuyker-It is state neglect.",63
20,Mrs HULL,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"The member for Cowper is exactly right. With this amendment, it is hoped that the funds will flow and become available far more quickly. The funding applications received from the Riverina electorate included requests for air conditioning, which shows there are still small rural schools trying to cope in extreme summer weather conditions without effective cooling. The majority of them, which I have just listed and highlighted, are for shade structure. In December and February the temperatures in my electorate reach well over 45 degrees, and in some of these areas it is 45 to 48 degrees day after day. There is no air conditioning in public schools and no shade in public schools. What we needed to do was assist these P&Cs, the parents of the children who attend these schools, to feel more confident in sending their children off to school, knowing that they can learn within a cooler and more pleasant environment and that they have a place in the shade to play. The projects included other things such as playground equipment and sporting infrastructure, and water infrastructure for ovals so that children can have and compete in sports and so they can have a physical culture environment in their schools. This funding has been vital in securing a number of smaller projects that schools desperately needed but which the state government has never seen as a priority. A part of our Investing in Our Schools funding in the Riverina electorate was $300,00 for the Wagga Wagga Christian College. I have just heard the member for Shortland say that ‘these rich private schools' are the recipients of this funding. Can I say that the Wagga Wagga Christian College is not a rich private school. In fact, this school was built by the hands of the parents and students, from the ground up. I have been there. I have painted. I have done roofing. I have put up guttering. These kids and these families are not from rich backgrounds. They are probably some of the most underprivileged people within the City of Wagga Wagga, yet their commitment to ensuring that the education of their children is in the form they want has seen them deliver this infrastructure and this fabulous school with this fabulous ethos, yet they are supposedly a ‘rich private school'. Well, hello! No, I don't think so! This project at Christian College included the refurbishment of the library and the installation of equipment and sun screens on our very hot west-facing walls. In addition to these projects, dust extraction equipment is to be installed in the school's workshop and the existing kiln room is to be refurbished in order to have better health environments for the children attending the school so that they are able to enter into some of these areas and move on to the extraordinarily beneficial trades and services areas. The Investing in Our Schools funding is there for government and non-government schools, but it is just one commitment that this government has made in providing the children of today, our adults of tomorrow, with the best education possible. In the Investing in Our Schools projects we received community funding for these P&Cs that strive to achieve. For parents, their child's well-being is important, and they commit so much energy and so much time. I know that my own daughter-in-law spends so much time at my grandsons' schools, and they are public schools, assisting with the P&C, running the tuckshop and doing the fetes, the sewing and the cooking-doing everything that she can. It is almost a full-time job for her to invest in her children's education in the state school. The well-being of her children is important, as the well-being of every child is important, and we should be ensuring that we have the best facilities within the school environments. Through working bees and various other commitments in helping the teaching staff, these parents and friends make sure the environment of these institutions is the best that it can possibly be. Schools in the bush are often the heart of the town or village they are in. It is important to keep this partnership between the government and these communities in order to build relationships and achieve the aims and objectives for the schools. Eurongilly Public School, one in a list of schools, received $50,000 for playground equipment. With just eight pupils at that school, it is the heart of the very close Eurongilly community. For them to raise $50,000 to put in some playground equipment would have been very difficult. They simply do not have the critical mass to draw from on fundraisers, so for eight students this has been an absolute godsend. There were recent bushfires in the surrounding areas, and hundreds of parents and friends in the wider community, right across the electorate, all showed their support for the school just after the blaze ripped through in checking that all the buildings were still standing. They own this whole procedure; they own this school. Their heart and soul is in this school. They were terrified that, if school was not still standing, they would lose their school. Everyone came from the districts all around to make sure that that school was left standing so that it could continue to be the backbone of the community. They received a $50,000 grant for their playground equipment. I am not quite sure of the date of the press release by the member for Jagajaga-I think it was on 27 February. I received a call from my local radio station, 2WG, advising me of the accusations of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for education and the member for Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin. Her press release accuses the coalition of rorting the Investing in Our Schools program by delivering more funding into electorates held by The Nationals and, moreover, as the member for Shortland said, into these marginal seat electorates. I was absolutely staggered by her complete lack of knowledge and understanding as to why she named my electorate in this press release. She named my electorate as being third on the list of electorates having received the highest amount of funding. I was staggered at her lack of knowledge and understanding as to why my electorate of Riverina needs so much funding. My electorate of Riverina needs funding because the New South Wales state Labor government has absolutely starved the conservative held electorates of funding. Do not make accusations from the opposition side of the House about funding going to federally held coalition seats. Make accusations about the state government, which is starving my conservative held electorate of funds for my schools. I was absolutely staggered when I saw this press release come out with these accusations. It is an absolute disgrace, and shame on the so-called Country Labor in New South the Wales. I call it a so-called Country Labor because-as can be witnessed by every Hansard from the New South Wales state parliament-it is a Country Labor that has never voted against their city Labor counterparts. They have never voted any differently, even when the policy and the decision makers discriminate against the electorates that their MLCs-such as Country Labor MLC Tony Catanzariti in the Riverina-represent. He does not even have an office in the Riverina. Where does he have his office? In Sydney. They do not vote against anything. I can stand here and say categorically that Country Labor is a sham and a farce. I would say that Country Labor were different from their city Labor counterparts if I could see one shred of evidence that they were going to vote against their city counterparts on policies and decisions that impact on country people-and that impact is considerable and happens time after time. The member for Jagajaga dares to complain about the amount of money that the coalition government gave to my electorate of Riverina-my electorate; the electorate of a National Party member-in order to prop up and provide assistance to the many thousands of mums and dads in P&Cs there. That was to assist them because they have been discriminated against. I find it an absolute disgrace that the member for Jagajaga should put out such a press release and not recognise that conservative held seats in the states have been starved of funds in the education sector. That is the reason the federal government has had to come to the aid of these schools. The local Country Labor representative has failed the people whom I represent in my conservative held seat of the Riverina and surrounding district miserably, and he continues to fail them. He generally takes all of the credit for any announcements but no responsibility for any decisions that impact on any of the areas around the Riverina. He goes into hiding into his office in Sydney or cannot be found at all. I am very proud-extraordinarily proudto have seen the very good applications that were put in by all of those schools across my electorate. I sent out a round of funding applications, directions and guidelines to every school in my electorate. Every single school was encouraged. They got application forms. I did not leave anything to chance, and I am sure no coalition member did, either. We knew that our schools needed our support. We were appreciative of the minister's attention to ensuring that we could get our schools these fine things that they were lacking. We knew that the schools were not able to raise the money to deliver them, so we left nothing to chance. We sent them out the application forms, we advised them that they should be filling them in and we gave them the guidelines. We were diligent. And of course their applications were good. Every application from the Riverina and every single dollar that I have ever been granted has integrity. Every single dollar that has come into the Riverina stacks up. It all has integrity. I am appalled at the fact that people have come into this House and accused the people whom I represent of being pork-barrelled. The public state schools in my electorate are all significantly challenged in many areas. If the member for Jagajaga wants to call water tanks, playground shade structures, air conditioning in areas of 45degree heat and playground equipment porkbarrelling, I say to the coalition, ‘Come on down and pork-barrel my electorate every day of the week.' This money is going to the people who deserve it and need it, and to people who have all demonstrated integrity in their application forms and been judged on that integrity. It is absolutely appalling that the integrity of the parents in my electorate, the P&Cs, the children, the headmasters and the teachers of our great school system is being questioned by the member for Jagajaga. As I said, the Investing in Our Schools program has been an exciting initiative that has enhanced the education of many of the children whom I represent. I am pretty excited about having been a part of the delivery process. Rather than be ashamed, as the member for Jagajaga thought I should be, of my positioning in this little tableMr Hartsuyker-It is a badge of honour.",64
21,Mrs HULL,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I do wear it as a badge of honour. This is The Nationals delivering; is me as a Nationals member delivering in my electorate through coalition policy and an exciting and motivated former minister for education, Brendan Nelson. That has been carried on by the equally exciting and motivated education minister, Ms Julie Bishop. I am very pleased to have been a part of the delivery process. I am also pleased that when on 25 October I announced $1.4 million for Riverina schools-which should have been the responsibility of the state-I was announcing something that had integrity and something that was desperately needed in my electorate. Late last year we had another delivery in one of my state schools, and it was absolutely fabulous. I am patron of Kooringal High School in Wagga Wagga, which was granted $1.4 million in capital grants funding to construct a gymnasium and covered area with disabled access. The government had previously announced $1.87 million for this project. The total money that the minister has been able to provide to Kooringal High School is $3.27 million, under the capital grants program. This is further evidence of the dedication by the coalition government, now in its 10th year, its 10th anniversary, to continue to provide for schools. The government is continuing to do what the member for Shortland insisted we should be doingdelivering. (Time expired)",67
22,Mr SNOWDON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Lingiari) (1.00 pm)That was an entertaining little address friend from the Riverina. I am not sure how accurate it was, but she was certainly entertaining. I am sure she will get full marks for marketing at her next assessment, whenever that might be. As we know, marketing exercises are not always truthfulMrs Hull-Oh!",67
23,Mr SNOWDON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I am not suggesting you weren't; I am just making a general this comment about marketing. We know how untruthful many of the government's own public marketing exercises have been. Nevertheless, I understand the member's commitment to her communities, and her proud boasts of being able to get large slabs of government pork-I mean money-for her electorate. I am sure her communities are most grateful to her because of that. There are a number of issues I want to address in my contribution to this important discussion on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006. I note the words of the amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga, condemning the government for: (a) failing to deliver urgently-needed capital funds and literacy support in time for schools and students to achieve the benefits of those funds; (b) failing to protect the integrity and probity of its program for tutorial literacy vouchers, especially in the appointment of brokers for the delivery of tutorial assistance in some states; (c) approving capital funding under its ‘Investing in our schools' program in an unfair and unequal way between schools and regions, and (d) failing adequately to take into account the relative educational and financial needs of schools in the allocation of capital funding under the ‘Investing in our schools' program; by our and calling on the government to: (a) ensure that all programs are administered in ways that deliver maximum educational benefits for students; (b) take steps to assure the educational integrity and probity of its tutorial assistance for students with literacy needs; (c) direct some of the unspent funds for tutorial assistance for students with acy needs for use by schools to develop appropriate programs for their students, in consultation with parents; and for the professional development of teachers to improve their literacy teaching skills; and (d) support improved accountability provisions for funding under the capital grants and tutorial assistance programs”. Let me say at the outset that these programs are important. While the government members will decry the concerns which have been expressed by the member for Jagajaga and other members on this side of the House, it is important to understand that members on this side of the House are highly motivated to achieve the best possible educational outcomes for Australian students, regardless of who they are, regardless of their family circumstances and regardless of where they live. I think we share that objective across the chamber. Our reluctance to endorse what the government is doing whilst we are supporting the bill is because of the way in which these funds have been made available and the government's inability to get the funds out in a timely manner. My concern is that we need to spend more money on these types of programs, particularly for the people in my electorate of Lingiari. You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Baressi-and it bears repeating for the benefit of those people who might be listening to this debate-that the seat of Lingiari encompasses all of the Northern Territory except Darwin and Palmerston, and includes Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands. Arguably, it represents the most disadvantaged of all Australians. Around 40 per cent of the constituents of Lingiari are Indigenous Australians. They live mostly in small, remote and isolated communities, far away from metropolitan centres and far away from services and, as I will explain later, they have literpoor educational outcomes. These poor educational outcomes need to be addressed. These programs are one way of addressing those poor educational outcomes. It is important to appreciate the fundamentals of living in remote communities and the disadvantages that such people suffer. In the Northern Territory that disadvantage has been compounded by in excess of 25 years of neglect by previous governments before the ALP was elected to the Northern Territory government in 2001. Successive conservative governments in the Northern Territory took concrete decisions not to spend on educational infrastructure in an appropriate way for remote communities. As a result, the educational attainment level for Indigenous Australians who live in those places is very low-the lowest in Australia. The capital infrastructure in many communities until recently has been very poor-indeed, very run down and in need of great repair. In some places there is a need to relocate the educational facilities. In many places up until the last election cycle in the Northern Territory not one Aboriginal student had graduated out of their home community to tertiary entrance-not one. That is an absolute indictment of successive CLP-Country Liberal Party-administrations in the Northern Territory. Unfortunately, that situation is also an indictment of the federal parliament and successive governments, both Labor and Liberal. They were not prepared or were not able to intervene in such a way as to force a recalcitrant Northern Territory government to spend funds in an appropriate way-funds which were made available to it for Indigenous education purposes. It is worth pointing out that, in that context, the Northern Territory government is noted for hiving off in excess of 50 per cent of moneys allocated for Indigenous education by the Commonwealth-hiving off 50 per cent and more for its own purposes. As a result, it is no wonder that many schools were not receiving the full benefit of moneys made available by this parliament, either in the years when the Labor government was in power here in Canberra or subsequently when the CLP was in power. That all changed, thankfully, when the CLP was booted out by the people of the Northern Territory in 2001 and a Labor administration was elected to govern the Northern Territory. Things were normalised. More moneys which were supposedly for direction by the Commonwealth into Aboriginal education were actually meeting the people's needs on the ground. That is not to say that things are perfect. at the community of Wadeye demonstrates very clearly that, in terms of funding, Indigenous communities on a per capita basis are significantly under-resourced compared with their counterparts, whether Indigenous or not, who live in metropolitan centres of the Northern Territory or, indeed, elsewhere in Australia. That is a real problem. It becomes an increasing problem when you understand how Indigenous students-students who live in remote and very remote communities-fare when we address the issue of benchmarking and performance measures. I have some real issues to do with benchmarking. I believe that the way the benchmarking levels are set and the way in which they are tested are in- that says: appropriate. Nevertheless, they are tested. Benchmarking has been agreed by the state and territory government ministers, along with the federal government, which has imposed its will. People will remember the debates in this chamber on Dr Nelson's remarks about this issue of national benchmarking when he was the minister for education. What do we know about benchmarking? Let me begin with non-Indigenous communities. For non-Indigenous students in 2004 and 2005 in the Northern Territory, the figures for those who achieved national reading benchmarks were 87 per cent for year 3 and 91 per cent for year 5. By comparison, the achievement rates for remote Indigenous students-those who achieved the national reading benchmark-in 2004 and 2005 were 20 per cent for year 3 and 21 per cent for year 5. If we go to the maths benchmarksthe national numeracy benchmarks-the figures for 2004-05 for non-Indigenous students were 97 per cent for year 3 and 89 per cent for year 5. They are commendable results. If we look at remote Indigenous students, the figures are 48 per cent for year 3 and 16 per Recent work done cent for year 5. Whilst I qualify my remarks by saying that I have real concerns about the approach to benchmarking that has been adopted, nevertheless it has been adopted. Those figures demonstrate the parlous state of Indigenous education in remote parts of the Northern Territory in terms of achieving those educational benchmarks. Thankfully, the Northern Territory is starting to invest significant amounts of money in trying to address and remedy these shortfalls, but it is worth referring to the Bills Digest for this legislation. It refers to the issue of achievement levels and what that means in terms of life experience and life opportunity. It refers to a recent Access Economics study ... early school leavers receive lower wages than their more skilled counterparts, are less likely to participate in the labour force, and are much more likely to experience periods of unemployment … The Bills Digest then refers to findings of a Dusseldorp Skills Forum survey saying: ... the proportion of young people considered ‘at risk' has remained unchanged for two decades and reaffirms the plight of early school leavers ... The Dusseldorp Skills Forum is further quoted as saying: About two-fifths of young people who left school after completing Year 10 (45 percent) or Year 11 (40 percent) were not studying and either unemployed, in part-time work or not in the labour in May 2004. The corresponding percentage in these activities for young people who completed Year 12 (23 percent) is about half that of other school leavers. The point of raising that in this context is this. If you understand that there are no high school opportunities for young people who live in remote communities and who are already behind the eight ball when it comes to the literacy and numeracy benchmarks that have been set across the country, you understand that in most instances they have no opportunity to even get to year 10, let alone year 12. As a consequence of that, we end up with a whole lot of problems which become important to this community. That means that young people who might otherwise have real lifetime opportunities because they have a good educational foundation and skills that they have been able to acquire during their schooling are not able to use them to obtain a job directly in the labour market, access further training or skill development at a TAFE or similar institution, perhaps do an apprenticeship, or go on to year 12 and perhaps get tertiary entrance. That is important and they are the goals we want all Australians to achieve. The people I am referring to have next to no hope of achieving that objective. Because they do not have the skills necessary to get jobs in the broader labour market, they are condemned to a life of great frustration and uncertainty, which inevitably means that they will be unemployed for long periods of time and, as a direct result of that, will end up in a severe poverty trap. In disadvantaged remote communities, because of the lack of infrastructure not only in education but also in housing and health, people in a severe poverty trap have major difficulties in meeting the high standards set by government for the objectives they should be achieving. We hear a great deal of discussion about force passive welfare and the need to engage people in the labour market, to have jobssomething which this government boasts about. Let me say this: the life opportunities of the people I am referring to are being frustrated and undermined by the failure of successive governments to provide the resources necessary to equip and provide them with access to appropriate educational and training opportunities. If they cannot get access to those appropriate educational and training opportunities, they are going to be a long term drain on the Australian taxpayer's pocket. And when they are a long-term drain on the Australian taxpayer's pocket, they will inevitably be blamed. They will be accused of not making a contribution to the community and they will be insulted, in the way in which they have been continually over 12 or 18 months, by those who abuse them for being on welfare. Let us understand this: if we want to get people off welfare and give them those opportunities that we all expect to have for our children, then what we have to do is investinvest significant taxpayers' resources into making sure that the foundation skills that all people require to get on in life are provided to all Australians, regardless of who they are and where they live. That is the challenge. Whilst the intention of these programs is well placed, unfortunately they have not proven to be as successful as they ought to have been. It is a matter of some concern that, in the context of these programs, education providers in the Northern Territory have not been properly consulted and the experts on the ground-the Northern Territory Department of Employment, Education and Training-have not been listened to. I wrote to all schools in my electorate at the end of last year about two matters: firstly, encouraging schools to put in submissions to the Investing in Our Schools program and, secondly, seeking information and feedback about changes to direct funding of Indigenous education assistance. I had already spoken in the House on the issue of Indigenous education assistance on several occasions and condemned the government for its lack of consultation with key stakeholders, a stance which was shared by many submissions to a subsequent Senate inquiry into targeted assistance for Indigenous education. In 2004, the former Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, made announcements about accelerating educational outcomes, especially in the area of Indigenous education. I am most concerned that those schools and students whom I referred to earlier-and there are many thousands of students who live in these remote communities in the electorate of Lingiarihad to wait so long and complete so much paperwork to access funding for capital grants. The former minister for education wrote to me in December 2004 asking me to keep schools informed about the Investing in Our Schools program. I received another letter in February 2005 saying that by mid-2005 the first round of grants would be allocated. That was the first round, for grants less than $50,000. Unfortunately, only now are schools finding out about the second round of funding-for grants greater than $50,000. I received another letter, from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, on 15 February 2006, announcing $2.5 million worth of grants to schools in the Northern Territory. Interestingly, that correspondence states that, in 2005, the allocation of funds for the NT was $1.77 million and that the extra funding was from bringing forward some of the 2006 program funds to help deliver more projects now. If funds had been overcommitted in the Territory for 2005, and this bill is to move uncommitted capital infrastructure funding from 2005 to 2006, as well as to bring forward 2008 funding to 2006, in what states were funds undercommitted in 2005 or uncommitted in 2005? What areas have been overallocated? Are they now to miss out for the next three years? What message is this sending to principals and teachers and, indeed, parents in these remote communities? If I were a principal, the clear message would be to apply right now for any funds that may be available, as next year there may not be any. If anyone thinks this is any way to manage infrastructure equitably and fairly then I disagree. I refer to the tutorial voucher initiative-I have already referred to the poor outcomes in literacy and numeracy-and I make this observation: not one voucher has been taken up in the Northern Territory in 2005. The government's program for using contracted brokers is totally inappropriate in Indigenous communities and now, I understand, the Commonwealth has reluctantly and belatedly come to an arrangement with the Northern Territory government to provide a service. This could and should have been achieved 12 months ago. (Time expired)",67
24,Mr HARTSUYKER,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006 and I welcome the effect that it will have in supporting our teachers and our schools. I would also like to commend the member for Riverina for her fine contribution to this debate, which was in stark contrast to the endless whingeing of the member for Jagajaga. This opposition is drowning in its own negativity. They have no plans, no ideas and no policies to build a better Australia. It is the coalition that has a vision for this nation, building a stronger Australia through measures such as quality education programs like this one-the $l billion Investing in Our Schools program. In this debate, the opposition shadow minister has again shown the policy void that is the Australian Labor Party with regard to education. It is all too easy just to whinge. It was a contribution all too typical of the member for Jagajaga when she speaks in this place. I must say thankfully that not all members of the Australian Labor Party share the same intellectual void with regard to education as the member for Jagajaga. As chair of the Standing Committee on Education and Vocational Training, I am privileged to have the Member for Port Adelaide as my deputy chair, a member who is passionate about education and who knows more about education than the member for Jagajaga ever will. I would also like to commend other Labor members for their commitment to the work of the committee-members with a positive contribution to make to education as opposed to the feeble efforts we regularly see from the member for Jagajaga. This member has called for greater cooperation from the states. I would like to point out in this House that the very reason for this program is failure by those very states to adequately resource schools. The former Minister for Education Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, produced an analysis that details the amount by which the states have underfunded their schools compared to the Commonwealth. In his press release of 17 June 2005 the former education minister detailed that, if the states had increased their expenditure at the same rate as the Commonwealth, there would have been at least $882 million extra available to state schools. In fact, if the states had matched the federal contribution, the works being done by this program could have been funded by the states. So rather than carping on about greater cooperation with the states, I call on the member for Jagajaga to do, for once, something positive: to get on the phone to the state Labor premiers and get them to match the increase in expenditure offered by the Commonwealth. I would like her to get on the phone and perhaps talk to Mr Morris Iemma and ask him to increase the New South Wales contribution to the same level. New South Wales increased its expenditure for its schools by 4.3 per cent. How much did the Commonwealth increase its contribution? By 7.8 per cent. What is the loss to the schools of New South Wales with Morris Iemma failing to match the increase in the Commonwealth funding? Not $100 million, not $200 million, but $241 million. While the member for Jagajaga is on the phone, she can make another call. She could perhaps call Premier Steve Bracks and ask him to match the Commonwealth's increase. By how much did the Commonwealth increase its expenditure to schools in Victoria? Not seven per cent, not eight per cent, but 8.8 per cent compared to a paltry state increase in Victoria of 4.3 per cent. How much is that costing Victorian schools? Some $217 million could build shade structures; $217 million could provide air conditioning; $217 million could be put to a host of other uses. So rather than the member for Jagajaga just whingeing and moaning, as is her habit, I would like her to get on the phone and do something for the schools of Australia by encouraging those state premiers to match the contributions of the Commonwealth. I think that is a very important fact. Another factor in the success of this program has been local communities deciding their own priorities and not centralised bureaucracies such as Macquarie Street, Sydney. As I said, the member for Jagajaga called for cooperation from the states, but it is those very states that are pursuing a centralised decision-making policy that is not providing for those local priorities. It is tainly providing more for metropolitan schools than for schools in regional and rural areas. The member for Jagajaga raises the issue of pork-barrelling. She claims that, on average, National Party seats received 246 per cent more than Labor electorates. I certainly make no apologies for achieving for my electorate. Education outcomes are vital, and I will certainly be fighting to ensure that good educational outcomes continue. I would like to place on record that the vesting in Our Schools program is assessed on merit. I will say that again: it is a program assessed on merit. All of the projects are funded on the recommendations of independent, state based advisory panels. These panels comprised of parent and principal representatives, who I believe have been acting very properly. The question is: is the member for Jagajaga saying that these bodies are acting corruptly? I would like her to come into the House and clear this up and say that she believes either they are acting corruptly or that the state based assessment panels have acted properly. I believe they have acted properly, and if that is the case then her arguments about pork-barrelling have no substance whatsoever. It is vital that she clears that up. A more likely cause for the discrepancy between regional and rural schools and those held by the state members is the fact that regional and rural schools and many schools in coalition areas have been neglected by state Labor governments around the country. That is why the need is so great: not porkbarrelling under this program, not corruption by the advisory panels, but merely the fact that state Labor neglects regional and rural Australia and that state Labor has also been neglecting schools in coalition held areas. Let me now turn to the education issues that are at the heart of this bill. There can be cerfew careers today as rewarding or as challenging as teaching. Not only do we ask young people with little experience of life and work, and possibly with no experience of children of their own, to take charge of a classroom of young people and start shaping their lives, we also ask older, more experienced teachers to bridge the ever-widening generation gap at a time when technological and other changes are taking place at a rate that we could scarcely imagine 10 or 15 In- years ago. Email, text messaging, camera phones, video on demand, iPods-all of these things are part of our children's lives. They affect the way they communicate, how they absorb information and how they see the world. Not only do teachers have to take this into account, they also have to try to equip themselves with computer skills that many pupils take for granted. I could imagine that for any baby boomer teacher it is no mean feat to keep up with a bright class of nine-year-olds who have been using the keyboard since kindergarten and whose minds are set more in the idiom of the computer screen than the printed page, and whose curiosity and interest is barely satisfied by all the World Wide Web has to offer. The education and vocational standing committee, which I chair, is currently conducting an inquiry into teacher training. The government have an obligation to ensure that we not only provide these young people coming into the profession with the tools they need to meet their demanding role but also help them develop once they have entered the classroom. There are constantly changing bodies of knowledge in a range of subjects, not just computing, which pose a challenge for professional learning. Whilst the laws of physics and chemistry may remain unchanged, new fields such as nanotechnology were not even thought of when many of our currently serving teachers first trained. The need to deliver ongoing professional learning is just one of the challenges which faces our education system and poses particular problems in regional and rural areas. Research conclusively shows that teacher quality is a major determinant of educational outcomes, and quality professional learning is vital to developing teacher quality. We have to ensure that we make realistic demands on our teachers. Our curricula have become too prescriptive and wide ranging. The information explosion has meant that the problem has been not what to include in our curricula but in fact what to leave out. There is an overwhelming trend in our society to expect more and more of our social problems to be solved by our school system. Sadly for many children, the only orderly and secure environment they know is their school. Somehow in six hours a day our teachers are being expected to compensate for the failings of some parents. A stable home life which teaches courtesy, punctuality, good behaviour and a commitment to learning is just a dream for some children. If teachers have to tackle this failing before doing their own job then clearly we are asking a great deal. One cannot but deplore this state of affairs. However, we cannot ignore this reality. It brings into clear focus the that an improved school environment will have a positive impact on many needy children as well as on the broader school population. Helping to create better schools is the very focus of this bill. On the broader topic of schools and communities, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the staff and students of Bowraville Central School in my electorate for their success receiving at the National Awards for Quality Schooling an award for changing the school culture from one centred on welfare to one centred on learning. The school has successfully addressed the issues of absenteeism, high suspension and dropout rates, low self-esteem and low literacy and numeracy levels through a range of measures in a project known as the community alliance project. Community support and involvement has increased, morale has improved and pupils are performing better academically, socially and personally. Schools like Bowraville are doing a fine job for society as a whole and they deserve our support. I am glad that they have received national recognition for their efforts. As I said earlier, I very much welcome this amendment bill, in particular the accelerated support that its passage will bring to the Investment in Our Schools program. This is a simple and effective scheme that provides tangible benefits right in the heart of our communities, and I am glad that the merits of this scheme are being recognised. I note that the Minister for Education, Science and Training told this House on 16 February about demand for the grants the program provides and that there had been more than 8,000 applications from state government schools last year. As a result, this bill will bring forward some $186 million from 2008 to 2006. When the first round of grants was announced in October last year, I visited many fact of the schools in my electorate and the staff were quick to point out the benefits from their point of view. Foremost was the fact that the choice of project is left to actual schools themselves. There is local decision making by local schools to solve local problems. Parents, students and staff are getting involved and making the right decisions for their school. They are the best people to identify the needs in their particular school. They are the best people to decide whether they need shade areas or air conditioning or playground equipment, not a centralised bureaucracy back in Macquarie Street, Sydney, and not some person hundreds-and in many cases thousands-of kilometres from the school involved. A key to this project is divestiture of decision making to the local communities. There would be very little use in having a prescriptive program for, say, shade areas. We would probably see all these cloudy towns turning up with their regulation allocation of shade areas. The local element in the decision making is a vital part of the success of the project. These projects are not hugely expensive, but they are often beyond the means of many local schools-that is, schools that do not have the ability to raise the funds they need for these small projects. With some assistance from the federal government they are able to get much needed improvements that will be appreciated by the staff, by the pupils and by the wider school community. I have visited many of the schools in my electorate and spoken to principals, teachers and pupils. They were eager to show me how the funding was going to be spent, where the shade structures were going to be erected and where the new playground equipment was going to go. It is great to see local communities taking ownership of improvements in their schools and not being told by Macquarie Street that they need improvement X or improvement Y. Local decision making is the key to success. In my electorate of Cowper more than 30 schools received some $1.3 million in the last round of grants. It is a great program small communities and larger communities. We have had schools in Coffs Harbour, Kinchela, Bellimbopinni, Bonville, Smithtown and Woolgoolga, to name a few, receiving funding under these projects. Also, three non-government schools received support under the program. From talking to school principals, I know they support this program. From talking to school principals, I know they would not support the whingeing and whining of the member for Jagajaga. They would probably prefer her to get on the phone to Steve Bracks and Morris Iemma and get them to increase their funding to state schools to match the Commonwealth's funding. I mentioned earlier the role of the parents. Schools cannot and should not stand alone. They should be an integral part of the community, and I welcome the part that parents have played in the decision-making process and the contributions that the P&C associations have made in providing funding to go with the Commonwealth funding to complete many of the projects. I am sure those parents would be the first to agree that a school is more than bricks, mortar and sunshades. A school is all about strong leadership, dedicated staff and support from a strong school community. As I have said, the environment is important but what is crucial is the commitment of all of the partners in the learning process. Having cooperation between the local community and the federal government to deliver outcomes is very much part of building that. In turning to the detail of the bill, I support the proposal to carry over unspent funds from the Investing in Our Schools program from 2005 to 2006 and to bring forward that funding I mentioned earlier from 2008 to 2006. I would like to commend the Tutorial Voucher Initiative, which provides $700 in vouchers to assist children who have failed for to reach the appropriate benchmarks in year 3. I think it is important that we get in early and assist these young people to have better education outcomes. If they are falling behind in year 3, they cannot possibly hope to keep up in later years. Whatever criticism the member for Jagajaga may level at this scheme, it is focused on improving the outcomes for those young children, making it a better experience to go to school so they do not feel ostracised by not being able to keep up and giving them the confidence to be part of the school community and further their education. Unfortunately, the take-up rate has been low but the rollover of these funds will assist to further enhance educational outcomes. I also welcome the extension of full Commonwealth recurrent funding to those special schools catering for students with social, emotional and behavioural problems who are likely to leave school early. This is an instance where a modest and timely expenditure can make a big difference not just to the life of an individual but also to the support, financial and otherwise, that society may have to provide to a particular individual. Evidence suggests that early school leavers earn less, are more likely to be unemployed and are more likely to experience periods of prolonged unemployment. Assistance at an early stage can help prevent this. I commend the proposals to continue that expenditure. It is a very worthwhile program. I commend this bill to the House. I think that the Investing in Our Schools program is going to be welcomed into the future. I know that the local school communities certainly support this program. I know they are right behind it. I know that the whingeing and whining of the member for Jagajaga counts for very little. She has no solutions and she has no plans-just endless whingeing. She should be talking to the Labor premiers, getting them to increase their expenditure on schools to match the Commonwealth. When we see her doing that we will know that she is serious about education. When we see her doing that we will know that she is actually starting to get a bit of a glimpse about educational policy. Perhaps she should talk to the member for Port Adelaide and pick up a few hints on education policy. I commend the bill to the House.",71
25,Mr BEVIS,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I have listened to the last two hours of this debate on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006 and feel somewhat compelled to make a few comments. A good deal of the debate, particularly from government members, has portrayed this as some state versus Commonwealth debate. We even had the quite absurd proposition advanced by the member for Ryan that some deficiency that he identified in a school in his electorate was the result of 45 years of neglect by what he said was the state Labor government. Obviously, it is an enthusiasm uninhibited by either knowledge or intelligence on the part of the member for Ryan. The simple fact is, of course, that for the bulk of the last 45 years there was a conservative government in Queensland. Having been involved in the education system for part of that time, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, I can say that it was certainly the case that the conservative coalition government in Queensland provided funding on a per capita basis in Queensland that was, if not the lowest every year compared with other states and the Commonwealth-which then administered the ACT-then the second lowest. That is, for about 20 years Queensland students and schools suffered with one of the lowest per capita funding rates of any state-consistently, year after year. But the reason I really wanted to enter this debate was not to make that point. It was to say that this is not a debate about state versus Commonwealth; this is a debate about the needs of our schools and the children in our schools. That is what this is a debate about. The Commonwealth and states have for the last 50 years had a shared responsibility in discharging our community obligations to young people in education and to the not-soyoung in education. Before the GST Commonwealth governments provided large amounts of money to the states, albeit through different vehicles. The GST just happens to be a current manifestation. It gets portrayed in this debate as though it is a panacea from which all problems are resolved. No-one believes that to be the case. It would raise the standard of the debate in this place if government members stopped trotting out that argument about GST funding of states every time an issue came before this parliament. It is the panacea to fix all school problems, all road problems, all health problems, all policing problems. All of us in this place know that is a lie. It is It just economically does not add up, I am sorry. So the sooner we start to elevate the debate in this place a little bit more seriously, I think the sooner the public will appreciate all of us a little more. The simple fact is that funding of education in this country has been inadequate. We have a number of academics and scientists here in the parliament today as they conduct their annual Science Meets Parliament activities. Those of us who meet with those visiting researchers and academics-and that is most of us, on both sides of the chamberknow from those private meetings, when we discuss this with them, that there is a shortage of investment in this country in education, training and research. That is not a new thing, but it is a real problem. We have at the moment a resources boom. With the resources boom we still have a balance of payments problem that is the worse recorded in our history. If we cannot trade profitably when we have a resources boom at our feet, what prospect is there when that falls away? What do you do about that? You invest in the skills of your people. You invest in education and training and you invest in research. We have not, as a nation, done that. There has been a disinvestment. We rate poorly on the global comparison table when it comes to government funding of education, of tertiary education and of research and development. That is an inescapable fact. This bill provides some money for education, and that is welcome. I have stated in this parliament and outside the very strong belief I have that governments should fund education, research and training at much higher levels than we have in the past. I think it is essential for the future well-being of our nation, for our children and our grandchildren, that we do that. That has to be done. You cannot invest too much in education. not. You cannot have a population that is too well educated. It is easy to waste money. You can put a little bit of money into education and waste all of it. But, properly invested, you cannot spend too much money on education and training. So to the extent that this bill provides some funds for education, I welcome it. What I do not welcome is the way in which these funds are administered. They lack transparency. They lack any identifiable process to show that the funds are going where they are needed, that they are going to achieve some overall benefit for the educational standards of Australians. Yes, there are many laudable, useful projects that these funds go to, as is the case with pretty well any other program-not just in education but elsewhere. But the simple fact is that these funds are allocated in secret, behind closed doors. It is little wonder that members in the opposition look at the final outcome, see massive amounts of money going into marginal, government held seats, see massive amounts of money going into National Party seats and say, ‘This secret process seems to turn up a hell of a lot of money for National Party and Liberal members, their seats and constituencies, but not nearly as much for seats that government members don't hold.' There is no accountability in that. There is no transparency. If the government wants to establish its credentials in this, as part of a debate education and improving the lot of Australians in accessing quality education, it should properly provide to the public-open to the public-a clear statement of the criteria on which these funds are allocated, and that process should be transparent. This should not be a dirty deal done in a backroom in negotiations between some marginal members and the powerbrokers in the government. This should not be some dirty deal done in the backrooms of the minister's office, but it has that smell about it. One of the things that give that impression is not just the allocation of funds but what this government then says to the schools. I have a school in my electorate that received funding under this program last year-and I supported a number of applications from schools in my electorate for funding under this program. Because I have a background in teaching, I know a lot of the teachers in my electorate, not just from my current position as their member of parliament but from having worked with them in other roles. The school had the official opening coming up. They wanted me to come along, but people in the school who are my mates rang me and said: ‘Listen, this is happening. We'd like to invite you, but we don't know whether we're allowed to.' These were experienced teachers; they had been in the system for 20-odd years plus. They had been led to believe by the people acting on behalf of this government that they had to invite a nominee of the Liberal minister but they should not invite the local member of parliament, who happened to be a Labor member of parliament. I would not have known that, except for the fact that the people involved are long standing friends of the mine. I said to them: ‘Yes, you're right; the government are putting the screws on. They are saying that the minister's going to send someone along from the Liberal Party, and on there's nothing you or I can do about that, but I'm entitled to go as well. I'm the local member, I'm entitled to go, and you should feel no qualms whatsoever about inviting me.' Of course, they did, and the ceremony unfolded. When you have people at a school level who are experienced educators, experienced administrators in the school, who are concerned about that situation, it adds to the flavour of this. It adds to the odour; it adds to the smell. It is a bit like the CSIRO scientists who recently expressed concerns. And I think that is a great pity, because one of the areas in need of additional resources and support on both sides in this place is education research and development funding. All of us should be supporting it to the extent that we are able to, properly, within financial constraints. We should all be doing that. I think it is unfortunate that programs like this are being administered in a way that does not comply with those ideals. We do need to have additional funds. The process should be transparent. There should be a clear needs analysis. The funds should be allocated to those in greatest need for projects identified as fitting an overall objective. No evidence has been put forward to the public or even in this parliament by the government to show that that is the case. Until the government does that, government members will continue to incur the wrath of people on this side of the parliament for behaving in a partisan and crass way. If that is uncomfortable, that, I guess, is the state of play. But I say to those on the government benches: do not pretend that you can absolve yourselves of the problems you have created in that respect by simply saying that it is the states' fault; they got GST money. Let us lift the debate a couple of notches above that. In conclusion, can I say that I am delighted to see Sir James Killen in the chamber-a fine Queenslander and a decent and honourable man. I am delighted to see you here, Sir James. I am sure he is here for the celebrations that government members are having this evening. I cannot say I am celebrating in the same way, Sir James, but I am delighted to see you in good health and here to join in those celebrations.",76
26,Mr HENRY,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I rise today to speak on a bill which is particularly important to my constituents in Hasluck. The Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006 contains provisions which are vital to the continued success of a fantastic school in my electorate of Hasluck-that is, Corridors College, a nongovernment school in Midland. I must say that it is very nice to see school students in the gallery to hear part of this debate, though it is a bit of a shame that the member for Brisbane could not lift the level of ittalking about dirty deals et cetera. The only dirty deals that are done in this House are on the opposition benches, between their union supporters and those seeking preselection in the Labor Party. They are the only dirty deals that are done in this House. Corridors College was established in 1998 to provide educational opportunities for kids who have been excluded from mainstream schools or who just cannot adjust to formal school environments. These young people are in danger of dropping out of school entirely, which would be a tragedy for them and for our communities. Corridors College provides a unique opportunity for them to continue their education. Essentially, it is a high school for street kids. Almost all these kids are involved with the state child welfare and juvenile justice systems. They have often been subject to physical, emotional and sexual abuse; neglect; exposure to violence and drug use; poverty; and homelessness. They struggle just to survive. Under the act, the non-government special schools automatically have an SES funding level of 70 per cent of the relevant average government school recurrent cost amount, which is the highest general recurrent funding level. Recognition as a special school does not always include schools that cater for socially and emotionally disturbed students at risk of dropping out of the education system. This bill corrects this anomaly in existing legislation, providing maximum general recurrent funding to these schools. This is consistent with the original intention of the SES funding arrangements for these schools. This translates into a five per cent increase in recurrent SES funding for Corridors College, amounting to about $50,000 per annum. This here recognition of and funding for the school, al- which provides such a worthwhile and important service, will be warmly welcomed. Dr Terry Parsons, a dedicated educator who has been Principal of Corridors College since 1999, is very pleased that the Howard government is putting forward these amendments. I would also like to congratulate him on his plans to extend the vocational and training options for students at Corridors, and I look forward to working with the school towards this goal. At this point I might mention that the school is very well served by its board of directors. The chairman of the board is Andrew Gaynor and the deputy chairman is a gentleman by the name of Jim Thomason. These two gentlemen are well known to me for the huge contribution they have made over a good number of years in vocational training programs for disadvantaged youths. I certainly compliment them on their continued support of and involvement with these disadvantaged people in our community. I know that their involvement with Corridors College will be an ongoing success, and I congratulate them for making the effort to be involved. Returning to the substance of the bill, purpose is to amend the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004, which provides funding to states and territories government schools and funding for nongovernment schools for the 2005-08 funding quadrennium. I am proud to say that the Howard government will provide approximately $33 billion in funding to schools between 2005 and 2008. This is the biggest commitment ever made to schooling by an Australian government. This legislation provided for investment in school infrastructure, providing an additional $1 billion of Australian government funding for the Investing in Our Schools program. This helps Australian schools build and restore school buildings and school grounds by providing additional funds to schools for these sorts of projects. In my humble opinion, one of the best features of the Investing in Our Schools program is that, in government schools receiving funding, it is the community-parents, students, teachers, principals and parents citizens associations-who decide the infrastructure priorities, not the state government bureaucrats. I know that this is relished by the people and the school communities of Hasluck. I note that today in the chamber the member for Jagajaga has also attacked ing in Our Schools program-along with the member for Brisbane just a little while agomaking all sorts of claims and complaints of bias. She complained that Labor seats receive less funding overall. It seems obvious to me that the coalition simply holds more seats in parliament than the Labor Party and holds the vast majority of large rural and regional seats. Furthermore, all schools are eligible for the Investing in Our Schools program. It is a school based initiative, an opportunity for schools to take advantage of its funding being provided by the federal government. It does not go through state governments, because it needs to be transparent. The full benefit of that funding needs to go for to the schools, not to state governments. It is very difficult to give equal funding to Labor seats when there are so few, particularly when Labor members do not promote this initiative in their electorates. They need to get off their backsides and do something about it in their electorates to make sure that schools in their electorates benefit. Mr Swan interjecting",79
27,Mr HENRY,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"The member for Lilley is interjecting. I will go on and talk about Labor's state electorate seats shortly. Even so, 53 per cent of the funding in Tasmania and 67 per cent of the funding in the Northern Territory was in Labor held seats, somewhat confounding the claims by the member for Jagajaga. The assessment process for these grants is independent, and the government accepted in full the recommendations from the independent state based assessment adviand sory panels. These panels have parent and principal representatives who vote in the assessment process. State governments and the Commonwealth government do not have a vote in this process. What the opposition are concerned about are their Labor mates in state governments not being able to maniputhe Investlate Commonwealth money. I think any accusation of bias is just sour grapes from the opposition. They know that their mates in state Labor governments have failed to address the needs in schools. I do not know about other states, but in my home state of WA there is no excuse for this. The state Labor government there have a huge budget surplus, thanks to the boom in the resources sector. What do they do with it? They fund railways that never seem to get any closer to being finished, they ignore schools, they ignore hospitals and they ignore law and order. In fact, in this morning's or yesterday's West Australian it was reported that, in the first half of this financial year, the Western Australian government had made a surplus of over $1 billion. It is interesting to note also that some of the schools in the state Treasurer's electorate of Belmont, a Labor seat, are benefiting from the Howard government's Investing in Our Schools program. They are not missing out on available opportunities. The member for Brisbane said that this is not a state versus Commonwealth issue. This is absolutely right: it is about adequately funding our schools, because the state Labor governments and territory governments are not funding schools in an effective and appropriate way. No wonder schools are falling over themselves to take advantage of the funds available in the Investing in Our Schools program. Once again, the Howard government provides the funding and puts in place an independent assessment program only to suffer the sort of abuse that we have had from Labor members on the other side. At least we know that those of us on this side of the House are part of something positive for education and for our children and the children of this country. I would like to outline some of the schools in the federal electorate of Hasluck that have benefited from this program. The Gosnells Primary School has recently been informed of a grant of $69,459 under the approved projects under the Investing in Our Schools program. Gosnells Primary School is one of the oldest primary schools in the Hasluck electorate. It is in what would have to be considered a very strong state Labor seat. The state Labor government has ignored this school for years. The Gosnells Senior High School has just received $150,000 for a whole range of programs to help provide amenities for students at that school, including shade structures, an outdoor area upgrade, classroom improvements and playing field upgrades. High Wycombe, in the strongly held state Labor electorate of Belmont, held by the state Treasurer, Eric Ripper, have just received $72,000. They are more than happy to see these funds coming into their school from the Investing in Our Schools program, because they are providing the sorts of amenities that all of our children should have at their schools. Similarly, the Yule Brook College in Maddington, another state government held seat, has just received $72,000 from the Investing in Our Schools program. I see the member for Jagajaga is in the House now, so it is very pleasing to be able to let her know that state Labor seats are certainly benefiting very well through the Investing in Our Schools program. This bill will do a lot to help schools all around Australia and schools like the Corridors College in the electorate of Hasluck are great beneficiaries of the Howard government's program and the changes that are occurring in education.",80

29,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. I refer to the cable dated 10 April 2001 entitled ‘UN Iraq AWB Exports', which was sent to the minister's office from Bronte Moules, which referred to the existence of ‘hard evidence of kickbacks and contraventions of the sanctions regime'. When did the minister become aware of the contents of this cable?",82

33,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the Deputy Prime Minister update the House and the wheat growers of Mallee on the outcomes of his visit to Iraq over the weekend?,82
34,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. Of course, we know that the wheat growers in his area and in fact wheat growers right across Australia are very interested in the ongoing relationship that we and they have with the markets across the world. Given recent events, it was decided that I should lead a delegation to Iraq over last weekend meet with senior ministers in the Iraqi government in terms of the ongoing ability of Australian wheat growers to have access to that market. I can report that that delegation and that visit have been extremely successful in getting a clear indication-announced as part of a joint ministerial statement between myself and Dr Ahmad Chalabi, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister-that the Iraqi government is going to continue to welcome tenders from Australian wheat growers and Australian exporters to get wheat into that market in Iraq. Whilst I was there I had meetings with Prime Minister Al-Jaafari, Deputy Prime Minister Chalabi and trade minister Basit Karim-three senior ministers in the Iraqi government. At the time, the Iraqi government was dealing with a very sensitive and difficult domestic circumstance after the bombing the week before of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, but they saw the importance of the relationship between Australia and Iraq as having such standing that they saw me in the middle of all that was going on there. I received a guarantee from the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister-the man directly responsible for wheat trade-that Australia can continue to tender for Iraqi wheat contracts.",82
35,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They said that the week before.,82
36,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition said, ‘They said that the week before.' We know how the Labor Party operate: they send messages to each other through the media. The member for Batman, who is not here, sends messages to the Leader of the Opposition. The member for Griffith is always doing it, sending messages to the Leader of the Opposition. We are not prepared to accept that to vance, Mr Speaker: how can that be at all associated with his visit to Iraq?",82

41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Griffith clearly was not listening. I said to the Deputy Prime Minister that he would come back to the question. So that was a frivolous point of order.,83
42,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point that I was making was that there might have been media reports but it was important that an Australian government minister participated in a direct sonal meeting with an Iraqi government minister to confirm the relationship rangements that would continue to exist in trade between our two countries-where you could stand face to face, eyeball to eyeball, and shake hands on an arrangement that was being put in place.",83

44,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Labor Party can carry on like a bunch of schoolgirls all they like, but the reality is, if they were running this country, they would have done exactly the same thing. They would have got on a plane and gone over-and, if they did not, they would be abrogating their responsibility to Australian grain growers. They would be abrogating their responsibility. As members would have clearly recognised when they read the joint ministerial statement that I issued with Dr Chalabi, there is a clear commitment to Australian grain and Australian exporters being welcome in that market. I might say, while I am on the subject, that in the discussions Dr Chalabi was very complimentary of the quick action the Australian government has taken to establish the Cole inquiry. He was very complimentary of the way we have done that and recognised that there had not been any other government that had taken the action that the Australian government had taken. Regardless of what the Labor Party have to say on this matter, Australian wheat growers should be comfortable in the knowledge that they will have continuing access to this market in Iraq. They will be welcome to continue to compete for tenders in the Iraq market. NA",83

Mr Speaker, before I answer it, may I be permitted to welcoming many former members of this House and another place to the gallery. I hope I can be forgiven for particularly singling out my old friend Sir James Killen. There was a time-a short time and a rather frantic time-in Australian politics when there was no more important Liberal in Australia than Sir James Killen. I welcome all my former colleagues to this place. The good news, the really wonderful news, is that in the last 10 years real wages in this country have risen by 16.8 per cent.

Over 13 years of Labor government, the real wages of Australian workers increased by a miserable 0.3 per cent-13 years of Labor equals 0.3 per cent; 10 years of the coalition equals 16.8 per cent. I can only say again, as I have said before in this place, that, when we last faced the Australian people-and I had the opportunity of addressing a rally in Western Sydney-I had no prouder boast than to say to them that, under this government, more had been done for the working men and women of this country than any Labor government had ever dreamt of. It used to be the party of the workers. It used to be the party that looked after the interests of working men and women, but when it was last in office it boasted about the fact that it had suppressed real wages. By contrast, this government has presided over higher real wages, higher levels of employment, sharply lower interest rates, lower levels of taxation and higher join you in numbers of apprentices.

In Australia, 1.7 million new jobs have been created under the coalition and inflation has been contained, averaging just 2½ per cent a year. The greatest obligation that any government has is to look to the interests of the average working men and women of this country. We have done it. It has been at the centre of everything that we have done as a government over the last 10 years, and these figures released today show that real wages have risen by 16.8 per cent. Let me say that again: 16.8 per cent versus a miserable 0.3 per cent in 13 years of Labor. It is the latest piece of field evidence that this government remains dedicated to the interests of the average working men and women of this country. Oil for Food Program",84

62,Mr HENRY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My relevant question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer update the House on the latest national accounts figures? What does this say about the need for experienced and consistent economic management?,85
63,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question. I can inform him that the national accounts came out for the December quarter today. They showed solid economic growth of 0.5 per cent for the quarter and 2.7 per cent for the year. Importantly, we see that consumption is continuing to moderate and the housing cycle, which the government expressed concern about some years ago, continues to readjust. National growth is now led by business investment. New private engineering construction grew 7.1 per cent in the quarter and 29.8 per cent through the year. New machinery and equipment investment grew 6.2 per cent in the quarter and 15.8 per cent through the year. What we are seeing now is a rebalancing of the Australian economy-out of the housing cycle and consumption into business investment-which will build capacity and, particularly in the mining industry, allow Australia to take advantage of very strong terms of trade. That terms of trade increase indicates the importance of experienced management, and not just experienced management on this side of the House but, if the opposition should ever come to government, they would need experienced management too.

99,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It is nice to have him ask a question when his predecessor in Tangney is sitting in the gallery-the Hon. Daryl Williams, a great Attorney-General. Saddam Hussein's trial commenced last October in Baghdad and he and seven of his henchmen are being tried in an Iraqi court. Of course, they are being tried by Iraqis. This is a case of the massacre of 148 people from the village of Dujail following an incident, as it is called, in 1982. The House will be interested to know that Iraq the court sat yesterday. It has previously heard witness testimony. Yesterday it had presented to it several documents, including a presidential order signed by Saddam Hussein in 1984 approving the death sentences of all 148 people and a document signed by his half-brother ordering the execution to take place. Investigators claim that 96 of them were executed and the remainder were liquidated during interrogation. The 148 allegedly included 10 aged between 11 and 17, who were executed later in secret. This is just one of the many appalling alleged crimes committed by Saddam Hussein's regime and it is a reminder-not that we need one on this side of the House-of the justice in bringing this cruel regime to an come. end. On this side of the House, when we think of all the things we have done over the last 10 years, it is one of the things that we are very proud of: that our country made a contribution to getting rid of that regime. In that context, I agreed with the Leader of the Opposition when he said yesterday that Saddam Hussein certainly had a weapons of mass destruction research program. During the course of last month the Leader of the Opposition said he may have actually been building weapons of mass destruction. The Leader of the Opposition also said yesterday: ‘We know for a fact that Saddam was supporting terrorists,' and of course he has been talking at great length about Saddam rorting sanctions. This was, of course, a deeply corrupt regime. I would only say thisMr Tanner-Isn't that the pot calling the kettle black! Who was corrupting them?",88

101,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I make two observations. At a time when people like Sir James Killen were members of the House of Representatives, the Labor Party tried to raise $500,000 for the 1975 election campaign from Saddam Hussein's regime-Blues Point Tower. A curious position for a political party, but perhaps a cynic may say it was no coincidence that, come 2003, the Labor Party did not want to see that hideous regime overthrown. NA",89

103,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and I refer to his answer to my last question concerning the Austrade cable of 11 March 2000 and his specific answer to it. I also refer to the Deputy Prime Minister's statement just now that the general issue of concerns about AWB's dealings with Iraq ‘was certainly known to the government at the time'. Deputy Prime Minister, if these concerns were certainly known to the government at the time, referring to the time when this cable was sent in March 2000, how is that compatible with the Deputy Prime Minister's formal statement to the parliament on 8 November 2005, when he said, ‘The allegations raised first came to my attention as a result of the Volcker inquiry,' which did not begin until April 2004, some four years later?",89
104,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Griffith knows full well the difference in this issue. It is about allegations of kickbacks and it is about allegations of the use of Alia. This is about questions with regard to the contracts. The substantive issue here is that these questions were answered to the satisfaction of the United Nations, which was running the oil for food program. The opposition know that, and they are just trying to create a political scandal out of this. This government has been totally transparent in offering up all the information to the Cole inquiry, as was clearly indicated to me by ministers in the Iraqi government. How complimentary they were of the fact that the Australian government has established this inquiry to get to the bottom of this matter. Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme",89
105,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister advise the House what the government is doing to ensure the sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? Are there any alternative policies and, if so, ernment's response?",90
106,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Casey for his question. This government does understand that the best possible health care cannot always come entirely free. Noone likes to see costs to patients rise but just occasionally it is necessary in order to ensure the sustainability of the system. This is why the government very reluctantly increased the PBS copayment so that the patient PBS contribution should be restored to roughly the level applying under the former Labor government. It is very important that ministers should give credit where it is due. I am very pleased to acknowledge that the member for Hotham strongly supported the government's copayment decision. It was a difficult issue but he strongly supported it and now we have the faceless men of the Victorian Labor Party trying to eliminate the member for Hotham because, on this precise point of the PBS copayment, the member for Hotham fingered the rats in Labor's ranks. I am quoting from The Latham Diaries on page 301: A disgraceful Caucus meeting this morning. Very truthful diaries according to the member for Lalor. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This was a question about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It did have a tag line about alternative policies. If the Minister for Health and Ageing wants to talk about my policy for funding calcium and the like, I am more than happy for him to do so but",90

That would have to refer to contemporary policies.",90

What we have is payback time for the member for Hotham's principled stand on the PBS copayment.

Given that the cables we have been referring to point exactly to the circumstances of AWB's potential involvement in the breach tions regime of the United Nations and that you have stated a general awareness of it at the time, did you not fundamentally mislead this House when you said, ‘The allegations raised came to my attention as a result of Volcker inquiry'?

I appreciate the interest she shows in the Pacific region, which is so important to Australia and which she has visited from time to time. Of course, the government has a very strong interest in a stable and prosperous South Pacific and we accept, as the Prime Minister has often said, that we have special responsibilities in the region. Mr Ripoll interjecting",92
140,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Oxley of the sanchas already been warned!,92
141,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Pacific island countries are facing many challenges, so inevitably we are generous. Australia now provides nearly $1 billion a year in effective aid to the South the Pacific, if you include Papua New Guinea. part One of the keys to our policy is good governance, which in our view is a cornerstone of sustainable development. The quality of government underpins economic prosperity, quality of life and also security. Our aid program has included restoration of the rule of law and justice in the Solomon Islands and Bougainville; the introduction of the Enhanced Cooperation Program in Papua inNew Guinea, parts of which are working very well; regional leadership to tackle HIVto, AIDS; and the establishment of the Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development Program, which has been great for many of the Pacific island countries and wonderful for a lot of young Australians, as many members on both sides of the House will know. The honourable member asked if there were any alternatives. There are. The member for Maribyrnong, as the shadow minister for overseas aid and Pacific island affairs, has worked tirelessly on this issue. I remember warmly the time he travelled with me in December 2004 to the Pacific islands. Mr Ripoll-How warm were you?",92
142,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He showed interest, enthusiasm and decency. I was very impressed with him and got on very well with him, if I may say so, to interject a personal element here. He produced very recently a policy which, let us face it, had a few less than tering things to say about the government, but I suppose that is the work of an opposition. But he put a lot of work into it, and whether you agree with all of it or not you have to admire a man who went to that much trouble. The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday of the member for Maribyrnong that he was an outstanding shadow minister who had developed an encyclopaedic knowledge of the affairs of the region. I think that is right, which makes me wonder why the Leader of the Opposition did not support himMr Ripoll-It sounds like love. You are not admitting something, are you?",93
143,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will resume his seat. The member for Oxley will remove himself understanding order 94A. The member for Oxley then left the chamber.,93
144,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, such a good and successful shadow minister, a member of this House with such experience, deserves the support of his leader. And he did not get it, despite the fact that his leader thought he was outstanding. Either he said he was outstanding but did not mean it, which is why he did not support him, or he did not think he was outstanding at all but thought he may as well say it. It is either one or the other. Those are certainly not the words of a strong man and a true leader. So, as his colleagues are taken away one by one to political execution, the Leader of the Opposition washes his hands like Pontius Pilate and just allows them to be taken away. ‘It's nothing to do with me, Officer,' I suppose is his message.",93
145,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the minister commenced his remarks with generous comments about his opposiflattion counterpart but plainly now is entering into irrelevancy with a denigration of the Leader of the Opposition. It is not in his portfolio area. It is a tactic and it should be resisted by the chair.",93
146,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Denison will resume his seat. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is in order.,93
147,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me in conclusion go back to what I was saying about alternative policies. The Leader of the Opposition is prepared to dismiss the member for Maribyrnong-he was not prepared to support him-yet the member for Maribyrnong put more effort into policy in his short period as shadow minister than the Leader of the Opposition has put into policy in his endless years as Leader of the Opposition. Wheat Exports,93
148,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and relates to the Deputy Prime Minister's statements made here today in relation to the Iraqi government welcoming tenders from the Australian wheat industry. Prime Minister, to overcome concerns from wheat growers about the future of the single desk and the unique circumstances surrounding trade with Iraq, is it legally possible for any wheat trading with Iraq during this uncertain period to be done on a government-to-government basis rather than by grain marketers outside the Australian Wheat Board and, hence, maintain the government's commitment to the single desk? Prime Minister, if it is legally possible, would you consider this as an option to Australia's current predicament until the review of the Australian Wheat Export Authority is completed?",93
149,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for New England for the question. We have considered that. I do not think it is a desirable alternative to current arrangements to inject the government into the equation. I do not think I can say more than that. The situation is that pending the outcome of the Cole inquiry-which obviously will bear on the future of AWB Ltd and not automatically in any way on the future of the single desk policy-the single desk policy must be looked at separately from the future of AWB. There are very strong arguments in favour of maintaining the single desk, and I have no hesitation in repeating that it remains government policy to maintain the single desk. If we were to consider a change in the future, it would be lunacy from the point of view of this country's national interest for us to give away the single desk unilaterally. It would only ever be something you would contemplate giving away in the context of international trade negotiations. But we have looked at the very point that was raised by the member for New England. Our strong preference-and it will be no surprise to himbeing a government that prefers the free enterprise option to a government option, is not to go down that path, and we do not intend to go down that path. But I thank the honourable member for the question. It gives me an opportunity to restate the government's position. Also, as the member for New England invited me to comment on the Deputy Prime Minister's comments, can I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister on the success of his mission to Iraq. He did good things in a difficult environment for the future of the Australian wheat industry. The wheat growers of Australia know that, and the wheat growers of Australia will continue to respect him for it. Australian Labor Party",94
150,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Is the minister aware of reports concerning the political activities of registered organisations under the Workplace Relations Act in the state of Victoria? What is the government's response? Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I think you will find an identical question was asked yesterday. Perhaps the member asking the question could clarify how it is different from yesterday's question.",94
151,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I heard the question, I believe it was a different question. I call the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations.",94
152,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have heard reportsindeed, an avalanche of criticism-about the activities of registered organisations, namely, certain trade unions and their officials who have been involved in the serial stacking of branches of the Labor Party in Victoria. This was confirmed yesterday by the member for Maribyrnong, who said that his demise as the member for Maribyrnong at the end of this parliament is the result of sleazy deals done by members of registered organisations. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: standing order 100(b) is currently being breached.",94
153,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Grayndler would be well aware that standing order 100 applies to questions. It does not apply to answers. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, for the benefit of the House",94
154,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. I have ruled on the point of order you have raised. It is not to be debated. There is no debate on the point of order. Mr Albanese-It's just wrong.,95
155,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have asked me to rule, and I have ruled.",95
156,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no doubt about it: there are deep divisions in the Australian Labor Party about this issue. When these sleazy deals are mentioned, one person's name usually comes to the fore- Mr David Feeney. Mr Feeney, along with Mr Richard Marles, one of the union officials challenging the member for Corio for his preselection, was involved in setting up Transport 2020, a slush fund. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I refer to the standing order that says ‘a question fully answered must not be asked again'. Not only are we getting the same question as yesterday; we are now getting the same answer.",95
157,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member will resume his seat. I ruled the question in order. It is not appropriate to take a point of order after I have made that ruling on the question. The minister has begun his answer and the minister is in order. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I would like to raise a point of order. I refer you to page 188 of House of Representatives Practice, which states: The opportunity to raise a point of order should not be misused to deliberately disrupt proceedings or to respond to debate. If this is, or is anticipated to be, the case, or if the Speaker believes that he or she is aware of the issues, Speakers have cut short the point of order ... Members have been disciplined by the Chair for raising spurious or frivolous points of order and for persisting with matters after the Chair has ruled. Mr Speaker, to assist you I bring that to your attention.",95
158,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the House for his point of order. He raises a valid point of order. Ministers should be given the opportunity to answer their questions. If they are continually interrupted I will take action.,95
159,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Transport 2020 is a slush fund-set up by Mr Feeney and Mr Marles, the candidate standing against the member for Corio-whose purpose it is to fund union and ALP memberships for its associates. We know from reports that this fund has been used extensively in the seat of Corio. Mr Feeney was also sacked from the staff of the then opposition leader in Victoria, John Brumby, for his engagement in branch stacking. He was sacked as the ALP state secretary in Victoria in 2002 by Greg Sword, again for his branch-stacking activities. That of course does not stop you being rewarded in the Labor Party. He is now the assistant national secretary and the campaign manager in the South Australian state elections. If there were any leadership from the Leader of the Opposition-and the Labor Party-in this regard, he would demand the resignation of Mr Feeney from these positions. Mr Stephen Smith-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the question was in respect of Victoria and the minister referred to South Australia.",95

I also refer to the fact that the minister has confirmed for the first time-yesterday-that he made this statement to parliament in full knowledge of the contents of the cable of 13 January in the year 2000, which warned that the AWB was paying funds into the Jordanian bank account of a company owned by Saddam Hussein's regime. Minister, why did you mislead the House?",96
174,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I clearly say two things. First of all, it is perfectly clear, even from the shadow minister's question, that I did not mislead the House. More than that, you see, the point I keep making, both yesterday and in the media this morningMr Rudd interjecting",96

176,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"is the fact is that at the end of this investigation the United Nations concluded that AWB Ltd had not been doing what had been alleged by the Canadian Wheat Board. But all of this is being considered by the Cole commission and, regardless of what the opposition may say or claimand they have spent three weeks of parliamentary time talking of nothing else, no doubt to the complete distraction and boredom of the Australian public-the simple fact is that the Cole commission is looking through all of these issues. We have given all appropriate information that the Cole commission has wanted to the Cole commission and we look forward to them completing their hearings and to Commissioner Cole producing his report. Armed Forces",96
177,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister outline the government's the ongoing commitment to Australia's armed,96
178,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. He served for 22 years in the Australian Army, including being an Army test pilot, and his values and his hard work were welcomed warmly into the Liberal family only two years ago. On 1 March 1901, the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy were formed. Today recognises and celebrates the 105th anniversary of these two great services. Throughout that period of time, over more than a century, those values of hard work, idealism, self-sacrifice, comradeship and courage have played a very important role in moulding Australia's identity. Most importantly, today they are reflected in the service Mr Flugge? of almost 2,000 Australian service men and women who not only are protecting and securing Australia's borders from illegal immigrants and illegal fishing but also are in Timor, the Solomon Islands and the Middle East. It is extremely important to us as a government to say on behalf of Australians how enormously proud we are of our service men and women, particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq. We are determined to continue to support them. We will not under any circumstances cut and run until the task before them is complete. I join you, Mr Speaker, and the Prime Minister in recognising Sir James Killen, who himself was a former distinguished Minister for Defence. Remember that date of the establishment of our Army and our Navy: 1 March 1901. For any Australian and any parent who has a son or a daughter who wants to make a real difference not only in our country but throughout the world, the number to call is 13 1901. If anyone on the other side is looking for employment, you are never too old. Mr Trevor Flugge",96
179,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer to the letter I received from the Prime Minister yesterday just before question time confirming that former National Party candidate Trevor Flugge had access to other Australian government money to support his activities in Iraq apart from the $1 million package paid to him through the aid budget. Deputy Prime Minister, how much other money did Mr Flugge have access to? Given that DFAT indicated that the 2003-04 AusAID budget allocated $4 million to revitalising the agricultural sector and quick impact activities, can the minister outline to parliament how much of this $4 million was at the discretion of his National Party mate",97
180,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This was the answer I gave to the member for Griffith. He asked me this question and this is the answer I East gave. I ask every member of the House to listen very carefully. The question was: did he have access to any other Australian government money to support his activities in Iraq? Answer: yes. Mr Rudd interjecting,97
181,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Griffith is warned!,97
182,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. Mr Flugge and other members of the Australian agricultural team had oversight of funds for reconstruction of the Iraqi ministry for agriculture and Iraqi Grains Board building and the purchase of communications equipment. All these funds have been duly acquitted. In other words, this is a slur against my colleague the Leader of the National Party.",97

187,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Given the critical importance of water for farmers across Australia and given that I represent all of the Murray in South Australia and vast underground resources, would the minister inform the House of any recent initiatives to protect this valuable resource? Are there any alternative proposals?",98
188,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question and for his continued strong representation on behalf of his electorate. On this vital issue of water reform, the Commonwealth government has provided the policy leadership and the economic incentive through the National Water Initiative to encourage the states to fully participate and to put their own houses in order. I was intrigued, distressed and dismayed when visiting Queensland recently to hear that Premier Beattie is planning to charge farmers $100 a bore, for each and every bore on their property, claiming that it is a National Water Initiative. For many of us the Labor Party's asking for $100 a bore sounds like selling tickets to a Labor Party fundraiser, but for Queensland farmers it is a great deal more serious. But Premier Beattie has gone even further: he is proposing a windmill tax-a windmill management charge. This is not justified or explainable in any shape or form under the National Water Initiative. Thankfully for Australia's farmers, not all members of the Labor Party are so out of touch or so arrogant and dismissive of primary producers. I refer of course to the shadow minister for agriculture, the member for Corio, who is not here today. He is facing a preselection in his electorate on the weekend, and he may not be sitting here for much longer. Yet, as a former dairy farmer, the member for Corio, I venture to suggest, is the last of the Labor Party members to have any link with primary production. How many other dairy farmers are there on that side of the House or primary producersMr Brendan O'Connor interjecting",98

He is not always entirely effective but you would not know that from listening to the Leader of the Opposition. He has been asked countless times to indicate some degree of support for the position of the member for Corio. He has never given a straight answer. He will never mention him by name. In case the Leader of the Opposition was not listening to AM this morning, I will remind him of the comments of the member for Corio, who said: Well I think the leader would appreciate more than anybody else that if you don't give loyalty you don't get it. And at the end of the day, it might not be me; it might be the leader. Those words were from the member for Corio, in conjunction with the member for Batman, the member for Hotham and no doubt the member for Maribyrnong.",98

194,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Loyalty lectures, Mr Speaker! My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer to the minister's meeting with Trevor Flugge in Iraq in 2003. Did the minister discuss with Mr Flugge kickbacks, his million dollar salary, guns or how he was spending the $4 million worth of Australian government money he had access to for ‘quick-impact activities in Iraq', as attested to in the audited accounts the Prime Minister referred to?",99
195,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have a clear recollectionMs Macklin interjecting,99
196,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do you want to hear the answer or not? You are a squawking lot over there. I have a very clear recollection of the meetings I had in Iraq in 2003. In fact on my recent visit to Iraq over the weekend we reflected on some of those activities with both the members of the Australian Defence Force and the members of the Iraqi government, as it was my second visit to Iraq post 2003. While I am answering this question I will take the opportunity of acknowledging and thanking very much the Australian defence forces in Iraq for their efforts today and then. They looked after and accommodated our visit to Iraq to ensure that we look after the Australian national interest in Iraq today, as we did then. I did have a meeting with Trevor Flugge in Iraq. The insinuations being drawn by the Australian Labor Party are absolutely outrageous. Ms Plibersek interjecting",99

198,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The comments of the Leader of the Labor Party while I was in Iraq are just as outrageous, and are an insult to the people of Australia.

199,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sydney is warned!,99
200,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do remember meeting Mr Flugge at the Ministry of Agriculture in Baghdad at the time, along with the representative from the Interim Governing Council who was looking after agriculture. Because of the efforts of the Australian government, I think that was the first ministry that was up and functioning under the CPA after the war in Iraq. In fact it was noted by the CPA head, Paul Bremer, who said that the Ministry of Agriculture was ‘the first Iraqi ministry building to be functioning and the first to be handed over to the new Iraqi administration'. Australia and its agriculture team in Iraq were congratulated by CPA head, Paul Bremer, on the reconstruction and re-establishment of this critical ministry. We are proud of what we did as a government and as a nation to help re-establish this country. I conveyed that again to Prime Minister Jaafari and Minister Chalabi in terms of the support we are continuing to give in this fledgling democracy to ensure that it survives. NA NA Censure Motion",99
201,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTER FOR TRADE,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving immediately. That this House censure the Foreign Minister and Minister for Trade for: (1) turning a blind eye to cables sent to his/their office(s) that contained hard evidence that bribes were being paid to the Iraqi regime; and (2) for misleading this House on when he/they first had knowledge of the Wheat for Weapons scandal. This is the fifth time that an effort by the opposition to censure the government or individual ministers in relation to what is without question the worse scandal in our national political history in living memory has been frustrated by a determination from the government that they will evade a censure motion. It is becoming a feature of the Howard government's lack of accountability that they will not permit themselves to be subject to the testing of a searching debate on the state of their knowledge and their culpability and responsibility for this dreadful scandal. They prefer to stand up in this place, beat their chests about their commitments to Iraq now, criticise the opposition for taking the view that this was a bridge too far in foreign policy and the wrong way to go, and refuse to answer questions about their personal and governmental culpability in this scandal. If this parliament cannot have a censure debate upon this motion, this parliament has no capacity to hold the government accountable. It is a serious issue, and when it is refused for the fifth time we know that this is a government that have absolutely no confidence in their capacity to explain things. The new piece of information from today's question time relates to the character of the knowledge of Minister Vaile. What Minister Vaile indicated-he got very close to it and he may have something more to say to us later or on a later day-was this: he had a general awareness back in 2000 or 2001 of the character of the complaints that had been raised at that point in time. He puts in his defence a quote from the particular cable which says that the Iraqi office in the UN had no capacity to judge the validity of the claims-that he puts in his defence. Precisely! They had no capacity; they relied on Australia. They relied on the effectiveness of the Australian investigation to determine whether or not they had a breach of sanctions on their hands. So what he used in his own defence in this place in question time is in fact the heart of the accusation against him. We all remember what it was like back in November when he stood up in this place and said that the first time he became aware of any of this was when Mr Volcker reported. That was a statement of cover-up, pure and simple. He knew a heck of a lot about this a long time before Volcker reported. The Australian public believe that, and they are right to do so. This is why we have to have the censure motion: the time for squirming and wriggling from this government is over. There have been pathetic hair-splitting and tricky excuses for what is essentially corrupt behaviour. That is enough contempt for this place and for the Australian people from this government. Heads should roll-the trade minister's head and the foreign minister's head. For too long, the bucks went to Saddam Hussein. Now the buck stops with Alexander Downer and Mark Vaile. They saw the cables. They knew they mattered. They turned a blind eye. The trade minister is the biggest problem for Australian farmers since the arrival of rabbit. My message to farmers is that Mr Vaile has let you down. He is now arrogantly trying to use our farmers as a human shield. He is incompetent and arrogant. Instead of investigating AWB at the time, he and his ministerial colleague tipped them off. The foreign minister is the best friend Saddam ever had. He is a foreign affairs fraud and career has been marked by serious lapses of judgment. He has a perennial problem with the things that matter, but this was no inoffensive slip of the tongue; this was an illadvised romp in fishnet stockings. This was about turning a blind eye to $300 million in bribes going to the very dictator our troops were fighting in Iraq. What mattered here were the bribes to Saddam Hussein, and what did these two ministers do? Did they bring in investigators? Did they hold anyone accountable? Did they thump the desk and say Australia must not fund Saddam Hussein's evil dictatorship? They turned a blind eye to things that mattered. They are stupid, arrogant, complicit and not fit to represent Australia's interests abroad. Yesterday, the ego of the Minister for Foreign Affairs got the better of him-another lapse in Mr Downer's judgment. He spilt the beans when he had been misleading so well for so long. He wants to look like he is on top of his portfolio but he just keeps revealing that he is at the bottom of this scandal. The Prime Minister got up in parliament yesterday and said that there is not a skerrick evidence that the government knew. In a weird way, there is not a skerrick of evidence; there is a mountain of evidence. There is too much evidence piled up for those absurd denials to continue. They constantly invite us in this place to go to the cables and take a look at them. They do not want us to only go to the parts the of the cables which indicate in very considerable detail the fact that there was a company in Jordan receiving illicit funds in US dollars in clear breach of the sanctions regime of the United Nations. Do not look at that part of the cable, they say. Look at the fact the Iraqi office at the United Nations could not substantiate this-look at that, they his said today. Precisely! The office and the United Nations relied on the honesty and integrity of the Australian processes-it is as simple as that. The UN cops an awful lot of flack around the place, but the UN's defenders say-and honestly-that the UN is only as good as its member governments. The United Nations is not a country. The United Nations is a collection of countries that does not transgress the sovereignty of each member country, and it relies on the goodwill of its member countries to ensure that the sanctions that all the members agree on are being upheld. If you go to those cables, you will notice something else apart from the weakness of that essential defence. When the cables refer back to consultations with the Wheat Board, you will notice that there is no record of a hard, tough investigative process being put in place. Instead, there is an immediate assumption that if anything is being done by the Wheat Board it must be at worse inadvertent and that all that is required is to speak to the Wheat Board and say to them: ‘You need to properly explain your contracts. This issue has been raised, and you need to properly of explain this issue to the United Nations. That's what you need to do.' These events, which have an enormous amount of literature behind them in the cables of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-and I will lay you London to a brick, Mr Speaker, that there are a load more cables than those we have seen alreadyrather than showing diligent action on behalf of the Australian government to uphold the sanctions regime to which we had signed up, have much more in common with a tip-off to a gang. That is what the materials that emerge from those cables make this seem like. What every department requires, when the hard stuff has to be done and the tough work has to be done, is the action of the minister. That is when the minister steps into make sure the right thing is done. What happened here was that the ministers stood to one side, completely indifferent as to whether or not the wrong thing was being done. That is why, if this parliament is to have any credibility all, this parliament now needs an opportunity to censure these ministers, to hold them properly to account for the way in which they have failed this nation. They have failed our allies, and they have failed the international organisation to which we have signed up. They have failed the farmers but, above all, they have failed the Australian people in protecting our reputation. This is a massive scandal which they treat as a joke, and they should be censured. (Time expired)",100
202,The SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR TRADE,Is the motion seconded? Mr Rudd-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,102
203,Mr VAILE,MINISTER FOR TRADE,"I rise to speak in this debate about whether or not a censure motion should be allowed in this place. The Australian government has not failed our allies in terms of the United Nations, it has not failed our trading partners, and it has not failed the wheat growers of Australia who have put a great deal of faith in this government to look after their interests internationally. All the points by the opposition should be absolutely refuted. The Leader of the Opposition mounts his case today for this censure based on information in a series of cables that have become a part of the Cole commission of inquiry. He claims that the government is trying to cover up what it did during the course of the oil for food program, but the government has handed all this information over to the Cole inquiry. What the cables do prove-and this is what the opposition absolutely ignore in this debate-is that the government did not ignore the issue. The government did not turn a blind eye; the government responded to the request of the UN. The cables indicate this very clearly. The Leader of the Opposition knows this, but he quite conveniently ignores at that part of it. When we approached AWB, they categorically denied the assertions and the allegations that the UN indicated that they could not disprove or otherwise. So the AWB categorically denied those allegations that were contained at the time that the information was brought to us from the UN. DFAT subsequently sought further information from AWB about terms and conditions. This is in the cables that the Leader of the Opposition is referring to. What happened? What did the government do? The government went to AWB and said: ‘You need to provide this information to the organisation that is overseeing these contracts, the Office of the Iraq Program at the United Nations. You need to deliver this information to them to reassure them on these concerns.' That was done. In response, the people at the oil for food program in the United Nations under the section 661 sanctions committeethe people responsible for running this program, the people who had oversight of it, the people who were supposed to be checking all aspects of this program in the conduct of the contracts-responded in this language: ‘The Office of the Iraq Program has confirmed that this clarifies the matter and removes any grounds for misperception.' That was in response to the provision of information and some of the terms and conditions in the contracts that they asked about-the subject of the cable traffic at the time. So, quite clearly, there are no grounds for this censure motion. The government did not ignore the issue. The government did not turn a blind eye. The government sought information from the private sector body, the organisation that was engaged in the contractual arrangements. It denied any wrongdoing. It refuted the allegations that were being made. Subsequently, when we sought to deliver that information with regard to the terms and conditions-as is quite clearly outlined in those cables that the opposition has, that the Cole inquiry has, that the government has given to the Cole inquiry with a whole heap of information to assist that inquiry to uncover the facts in this whole exercise-the claim and the charge is that the government is covering up, that the government is turning a blind eye. We did not turn a blind eye at the time. We got the information quickly back to the oil for food Iraq program at the United Nations, and then they responded that ‘this clarifies the matter and removes any grounds for misperception'. Far from covering up, far from being of no assistance to the UN, we have assisted the UN. We have sought out the information that was required when they made those inquiries that have been the subject of questions and the debate today. In terms of mounting the case for a censure motion, the Leader of the Opposition has maintained that the Australian government has failed in its responsibility as a member of the UN, failed in its responsibility as a member of the international community and failed in its responsibility to look after the interests of wheat growers. We have not failed on any single one of those counts. As a responsible member of the international community, we have gone to enormous efforts in recent years to ensure that we play a responsible role. That was clearly outlined to me on my recent visit to Baghdad in discussions with Prime Minister Al-Jaafari, Deputy Prime Minister Chalabi and trade minister Basit Karim. They reflected on the contribution that Australia had made in terms of helping establish a democratic process in Iraqone that they are rejoicing in and one that we take too much for granted in Australia but one that was certainly a clear objective. They were very complimentary about the way the Australian government has quickly established the Cole inquiry with regard to the whole oil for food program. Obviously the Iraqi government are interested in the operation of the oil for food program. But I can tell the Leader of the Opposition, without opening up confidential conversations I had in Iraq, that the Iraqi government have far greater concerns about many other countries and institutions than they have about Australia in this matter. That is a fact. That point was made to me while I was in Iraq. They are concerned about many other countries and institutions in this matter. That gives me heart that I am comfortable in what the Australian government have done over the preceding years that cover the time frame that this debate is focused on. In going to Iraq over the weekend in the interests of Australian wheat growers, we have not failed in our responsibility to look after them. We have not failed to do that. We did see media reports in recent weeks about what the Iraq government was prepared and not prepared to do. Unlike the Labor Party, we are not prepared to stake the future interests of Australian wheat growers on media reports. We are not prepared to do that. We are prepared to travel to different parts of the world to represent their interests, as they should be, in face-to-face meetings with the governments and ministers with whom we are trying to ensure an opportunity for our wheat growers to do business. That was certainly the case on Sunday, when I spent many hours with Iraqi ministers in Baghdad. They clearly indicated that to me, as outlined in the joint statement that I made with Dr Chalabi after our meeting. I will quote from the statement so that it is on the record. This is in response to the charge that in this whole matter we have abrogated our responsibility to Australian wheat growers. It states: The Ministers agreed to redouble their efforts to ensure that the mutually beneficial economic tionship continues in an open and transparent way. In particular Ministers reaffirmed their strong desire for the long standing and important wheat trade to continue into the future on a secure and predictable basis. In this context, the Iraqi Government will continue to welcome offers to supply high-quality Australian wheat through participating in competitive tendering in Iraq. The Ministers agreed that the two Governments should remain in close contact over coming months to ensure the trading relationship continues to move forward. The Leader of the Opposition knows full well that you need to front up and eyeball people whom you are doing business withyou cannot rely on media reports-and that is what I did and that is the statement that came out of the meeting. I am absolutely confident that, even in the short term, Australian wheat growers will have an opportunity to get into this market. I would like to table a copy of that joint statement by Dr Ahmad Chalabi, the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, and me on 26 February 2006, upon my visit and meeting with him in Iraq. I will just recap in this debate why the government is not prepared to accept a censure motion and why the case has not been mounted. The case has not been mounted because we did not ignore the issue. The government did not turn a blind eye to it. The government has not abrogated its responsibilities, either internationally or domestically, to the Australian wheat growing community and the Australian public. We have at every stage responded to requests and, as was clearly indicated by the Office of the Iraq Program upon our delivering that information to them, they confirmed that this clarifies the matter and removes any grounds for misperception. I look forward to the time when the opposition bring up this relacable in question time, which has positive advice from the United Nations after the government addressed the issues that had been raised.

When you listen to the Prime Minister's answer carefully in question time todayMr Bartlett- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I draw the member for Griffith's attention to the fact that there are Liberals in the chamber. His statement that there is not one in the chamber",104
206,The SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR TRADE,The Chief Government Whip will resume his seat.,104
207,Mr RUDD,MINISTER FOR TRADE,"Just like the Liberals let The Nationals answer this question alone in parliament today, they are leaving The Nationals in the lurch on the future of the single desk. National Party members in this House know it, because they listened very carefully to what the Prime Minister had to say. Why there is a matter of urgency as would warrant the suspension of standing orders goes not just to the fact that this is a $300 million wheat-for-weapons scandal-the worse in Australia's history-or to the fact that we have a government which ignored 17 successive warnings and chose not to act but also to our concern that two ministers have misled the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. With the first of those ministers, the Minister for Trade, it all turns on a key proposition he put to the parliament. Last year, when this wheat-for-weapons scandal was just unfolding, I posed this question to the trade minister: When did the minister, his office or his department first have concerns conveyed to them on whether the Wheat Board's dealings with Iraq were violating UN sanctions against Saddam Hussein's regime? What was the Deputy Prime Minister's answer? He said: The allegations raised first came to my attention as a result of the Volcker inquiry. The Volcker inquiry began in April 2004. Honourable members will ask: why is this important? There is of course the general principle that ministers should tell the truth in this parliament-increasingly a novel proposition in the last decade that we have been subjected to in this country. Mr Speaker, that is a core principle which you would agree to as upholding Westminster and everything which is true to it. But there is a second reason why it is important. What we are concerned about in this $300 million scandal is when the government first knew and why they did not act upon the knowledge of warnings which came in their direction. When did they first know of these warnings? If the warnings came early, then they could have acted early in order to prevent the $300 million scandal from unfolding. The Deputy Prime Minister knew today when the Leader of the Opposition put questions to him that he was in deep troublevery deep trouble-because, on the one hand, he has this undertaking to the parliament that he did not know anything by way of warnings or concerns until April 2004, but now he has a cable, released through the Cole commission of inquiry, dated April 2001. What did it have to say? It warned about hard evidence that Iraq was using the oil for food program to breach sanctions and that this was linked to discussions between the AWB and Iraq which they were having at the time and which were known to the government. That was in April 2001. The Deputy Prime Minister's claim is that he knew nothing until April 2004. That was three years later. The Deputy Prime Minister would have us believe that he had no knowledge of the contents of that cable. Problem No. 1 for the Deputy Prime Minister is that it is on the distribution list as being copied to his office-something he did not want to admit to in the chamber today. Problem No. 2 is that he had a massive Trevor Flugge moment in here today. He had a comprehensive Trevor Flugge moment, because three times he was asked by the Leader of the Opposition, ‘What's happened to this cable? Did you have any knowledge of its contents?' and he said he did not. But, having had his Trevor Flugge moment, he then had, unfortunately for him, an Alexander Downer moment. What happens when you have an Alexander Downer moment? You say too much. As a result of that, in response to a further question from me about an Austrade cable he went on to say that these were certainly known to the government at the time because DFAT was dealing with it. That cable in fact came from earlier, back in 2000. So we have the Deputy Prime Minister saying he and the government knew of these matters back in 2000. It fundamentally contradicts his assertion to the parliament that he did not know about these matters until 2004. He deserves to be censured. (Time expired)",104

216,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Watson proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for are marks, figdiscussion, namely: The Government's neglect of young Australians with the introduction of the Trade Skills Training visa. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",107
217,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I want to quote a member of this House who, on 2 February 1992, said in reference to an automobile company that employed 300 people: They were looking for a tradesperson to do a particular job. They searched Australia and could not find one. They had to convince a tradesperson to migrate from England to fill that position. It is a sad indictment on this government that, after ing been in power for 10 years, we have not got those trained tradespeople. Admittedly, in 1992 when the now Deputy Prime Minister made those comments the government had not been in place for 10 years but rather for nine. But those were the words of the man who is now Deputy Prime Minister. He was complaining, ‘How bad is it that we have to import one tradesperson?' At the time, no doubt members of the House of Representatives thought the objection was that Australia should be training Australians, but now we realise the problem that government had was that it was importing only one worker. The problem that this government has is that, instead of training Australians, you should import tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of tradespeople because it saves you from having to pay the cost of training Australians first and training Australians now. The trade skills training visa has two impacts: the first is that it takes opportunities away from young Australians and the second, in the context of the new industrial relations laws, is that it drives down wages. We had the most extraordinary defence in parliament when the disallowance motion was moved by the new Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, who is in the chamber at the moment. It is extraordinary because first of all he thought, ‘Let's just have a go and try to claim this is all about Labor and the unions'-the most bizarre argument when we are actually talking about providing training opportunities for young people who do not have a job. There are not that many people who do not have a job at all and are members of trade unions, but that was lost on the member for Goldstein. He then went on-and this is the first time hav- any member of the government has done this-to try to justify not advertising the positions locally. Every other member of the government has baulked at this; every other member of the government has tried to fudge it through by pretending that you have to advertise. But, if anyone missed it, on 27 February when we had this debate the member for Goldstein said this: If they need to advertise to satisfy themselves no Australian is available, they will. I will tell you Labor's attitude and it is pretty clear: if you have a job vacancy you advertise it to the Australian people. You do not just go offshore because you know there is no negotiating power once you get rid of the no disadvantage test on AWAs. The government know there is no award system underpinning those wages, so they can go overseas and get somebody who will be so much cheaper for a business. No, we say your starting point is to advertise locally. If you cannot fill the position locally, you then do not say, ‘Okay, that's it, let's go straight overseas'; you should actually try to connect Australians to jobs. That is why I said, and I will say it again, that if you have a position available in Ballarat you advertise it first in Ballarat but you also ought to advertise it in Bendigo, Blacktown, Bankstown and Brisbane before you go off and advertise it in Beijing, Bombay and Beirut. Then we had the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs saying in the other place, ‘What a terrible thing for the member for Watson to say.' I took this charge very seriously: she said it was xenophobic. I take that charge seriously. Ministers in this government would know exactly what is xenophobic. If only the person who treats people in detention the way she has had any idea what the Minister for Health and Ageing was saying in this chamber at the exact same time that she was making that charge. She suggested that I instead should point to what must be major sources of immigration, though I was not aware of this. Blackpool, Brighton and Bristol were the places that the minister wanted me to refer to. I thought, why would she mention those places? Then today a news article appeared in the well known online newspaper Blackpool Today, apparently a very well-known newspaper site in the United Kingdom. The article is dated yesterday but with the time difference it appeared this morning. It refers to a shop owner by the name of Andrew Robb. I then understood why the minister was talking about the need to point to Blackpool. You think of the wages that the system will create and then realise Andrew Robb is the owner of the Bargain Shop-‘cheaper than cheap'. In Blackpool Today he was complaining about what was happening. He said: Obviously it isn't going to help. The cheaper than cheap wages that are going to result from this are not going to be helpful to the young apprentices coming here from overseas and they are certainly going to drive down wages for the few young Australians left who are able to get an apprenticeship. The parliamentary secretary thinks not advertising locally is fine. He is the one member of the government to fess up and not have a problem at all if your management decision is that you do not need to advertise locally-you do not need to tell the young people of Ballarat that there is a job available in Ballarat, you do not need to tell the young people of the Tweed that there is a job available in the Tweed and you do not need to tell the young people of Adelaide that there is an apprenticeship available in Adelaide. That is the attitude of the parliamentary secretary on this, which I think is the attitude of the government. All the others were a little bit too experienced to not just bluff it through, but he decided to be upfront with it. Then he started in his speech to do some fudging of his own-hard to believe, I know. He started to defend the trade skills training visa, which we know from the media coverage has come in and now applies to all of regional Australia at the request of one business. One business requests this visa; it has a devastating impact on training opportunities for young Australians in regional Australia, which happen to be the same areas where youth unemployment is at its absolute highest, and the parliamentary secretary tries to bluff and pretend when asked in an interjection how many companies asked for it. He said, ‘Oh, it was in response to requests from regional industries. I want to acknowledge the initiative.' Then he names the one company involved. But he said ‘regional industries'. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition then asked, ‘We've heard of them. Who else?' The response was, ‘There is a whole swag of applications for apprenticeships coming in. You can see the list. Go and look for yourself. This is going to be a very popular scheme. I don't have, off the top of my head, the names of the 15 or 20 companies. No, I'm sorry but those opposite can have access to the list.' So we rang the parliamentary secretary's office and asked for the list only to get a call back from Dr Nation, the minister's chief of staff, to say, ‘What on earth is it that you want?' The list has not arrived. I presume the parliamentary secretary was telling the truth and that we can have access to the list he is refusing access to. I presume the parliamentary secretary was telling the truth and did not just feel the pressure of the interjections yesterday. I presume that he did not just feel the pressure of knowing that he is doing something that is bad for young Australians who are trying to get training opportunities and that he was not just feeling a little bit of pressure about driving wages down in Australia. I presume that he was not just feeling a little bit of pressure about way in which we are already seeing the cutting edge of the new industrial relations laws come out in the treatment of immigrants who have come here on work visas. We are seeing the first cases of genuine exploitation in the papers day after day and many are in those regional areas. We only have to look at the examples that have been appearing in the Adelaide Advertiser so far to see how we are getting the sharp edge of these industrial relations changes coming through. So the parliamentary secretary refers to a list that parently does not exist because the minister previously had already acknowledged that this was done at the request of one company. Instead of doing something at the request of one company, Labor says why not do something at the request of 300,000 young Australians turned away from TAFE? Why not do something at the request of young people wanting an apprenticeship? Because when you take an apprenticeship away from someone locally, you are not just saying, ‘Okay, they miss out on a job for a few months.' You are actually saying, ‘They miss out on a career. They miss out on the trade that comes at the end of the apprenticeship.' You are actually denying them the path that they are wanting to take for the rest of their life in the name of cheap wages and for what? Simply so that they can give a result to one company-not surprisingly a labour hire company-and one company alone. Three hundred thousand people have been turned away from TAFE since 1998. That is the exact sort of example that I imagine the now Deputy Prime Minister was complaining about in 1992. He looked for a tradesperson to do a particular job, searched Australia and could not find one. Do not pretend for a minute that you can blame the economy on the reason that there is a skills shortage at the moment. The planthe ning has not been done. There are occupations on the skills shortage list that have been there for 10 years. The planning has not been done. Youth unemployment rates are at the highest in the same regions where this visa will apply. The planning has not been done. There is 35 per cent youth unemployment in regions and they are the same regions from which the parliamentary secretary opposite wants to send those opportunities overseas. It is completely different to what happens when you have overseas students because ap- you can do that with additional places. You can add places on. But for every apprenticeship, you need an employer and there is going to be a finite number of employers available at any point in time. You do not need an employer for every university place but you do for every apprenticeship. In the same regions where young people are being denied these opportunities, where unemployment rates for young people are the highest in the country, this government says it is okay to have the trade skills training visa. What does it mean? It means an employer can decide that they can get cheaper labour overseas. But they have to get approval. To establish that approval, do they have to advertise the position? No. Do they have to make reasonable efforts to fill that particular position? No. They are not asked to certify that they have made any efforts to fill that particular position. So they are able to apply to the government, get a visa and deny those opportunities to young Australians. There is no nexus made between people available overseas and the employers so, unless you are a really large employer, you are going to be compelled to go through a labour hire company to find people. That is what this is about. This is part of the push of people onto labour hire companies. At the end of it we know what will happen. If you have a young Australian in an apprenticeship position then, at the end of their apprenticeship, you have a tradesman or a tradeswoman remaining in Australia. Nine times out of 10, they will remain in Australia. We know full well we will not get those sorts of stats from people who have come from overseas to train. At the end, when you finally have a skilled tradesperson, will our skills crisis be any better? Not by one job. Because you have actually occupied an apprenticeship that you could have filled if had bothered to connect people within Australia, instead of just making profits for lapolicy work. bour hire companies by connecting people from overseas. You end up with a situation where those connections are not made and, instead of having the position filled and ing a skilled tradesperson in Australia at end of the period of the apprenticeship, nine times out of 10 you are going to find they have gone back to the country from which they came. That is not the way to manage a skills crisis. These people are going to be exploited. We are going to see exploitation on the ground. They have to pay up-front fees. They even have to pay their own employer subsidy. You can imagine the sorts of wages and conditions in those circumstances that are going to be offered on a take it or leave it basis. They will have no negotiating power. What the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, at the table, has done to every young Australian is bad enough where, if you are offered an AWA, you take it or you lose the job. For these individuals, is, ‘Take it or you lose the job and the right to enter Australia at all.' They have no negothis visa. tiating power. It is going to be a race to the bottom on wages. As far as the government is concerned, I guess it is going to be winwin: save money on training Australians and drive wages down. That is something Labor cannot support and never will.

218,Mr ROBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Goldstein-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (4.16 pm)-We have just heard another burst of bluster and scaremongering, and nonsense in many respects, in this matter of public importance. The bottom line is that the introduction of a trade skills training visa is demonstrably good for young Australians. It is not a matter of neglect, as is brazenly asserted by oppoyou nents who would much rather play politics in this chamber than do the hard yards on new Mr Burke-We have.",111
219,Mr ROBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What new policy? What havhave we heard today or any other day from the this shadow minister for immigration? Absolutely nothing. Let me read a quote from the Australian of 15 April last year: [I] do not oppose fee-paying overseas students taking up apprenticeships in regional Australia as long as it is not at the expense of local students getting their opportunities. We absolutely agree with that statement, and the training visa gives effect to it. That statement could have been made by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations or the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. All three agree, as all on this side agree, 100 per cent with that proposition. But it was not made by them; it was made by the President of the ACTU, the leader of the union movement, it Sharan Burrow. In other words, the unions agree with the government on the proposal of So why did we have the charade we witnessed here today? It was a charade we witnessed on Monday evening when this matter was debated then. Why do we have all the feigned anger of the shadow minister, the puffed up indignation, the litany of lies and falsehoods and the predictions of doom and gloom? Does that remind you of something, Mr Deputy Speaker? It is so over the top, so manufactured and so false. I am certain that what we are witnessing from those opposite is a purely political exercise. It is plainly an extension of the campaign of lies and scaremongering we witnessed during the workplace relations debate-month after month of lies and scaremongering. For what reason? I will tell you what the reason is. After a fourth election loss and the leadership meltdown that was Mark Latham, Labor are desperately trying to galvanise their base. If I were them, I would also be doing what I could to breathe some sense of purpose back into a disillusioned base. I understand their motive. I would be looking to do what I could to unite base support around a cause. That is what they have been seeking to do for the last few months-unite their base around a cause to try to give them some heart-but they should be trying to do it around a good and worthwhile cause, not a cause based on lies and scaremongering, not cheap petty politics. I would not base it on lies and scaremongering because, ultimately, it comes back to bite you. All this stuff they have gone on with in the House today, and have done for six months on these issues, when the prophecies prove wrong it will come back to bite them. And proved wrong they will be. If Labor were smart, they would seek to galvanise their base around policies they thought would make Australia a better place. But it is not happening. It is even starting to worry their own side. We heard the member for Batman belling the cat this morning when he said in the Australian newspaper: On my own side of the chamber, policy innovation that inspires the people, that puts pressure the government to perform, and that demonstrates Labor's capacity to lead the nation in government has also been too rare ... after a decade in opposition, we have plenty of storytellers but not much of a story to tell. Only 19 Labor members elected in 1996 remain in parliament today and they, together with their more recently elected caucus colleagues, according to the member for Batman, ‘are too focused-by necessity-on internal party dynamics that have a lot to do with factional dominance and little to do with a Labor view of how to make Australia a better place'. Try and spend some time galvanising your base around policies that will make Australia a better place and I think you will start to see a lot more success politically and in every other sense. All we hear in this debate is a series of falsehoods and misrepresentations. We have heard it again today from the shadow minister. The member for Watson, Mr Burke, has claimed in this place: I do not think it is any accident that this visa was introduced at the same time that those industrial relations laws came in. Again, you are trying to link it to industrial relations; trying to link it to a cause around which you have peddled lies and misrepresentations from the outset. This is false and can be shown to be demonstrably false. Mr Burke-Was it an accident?",111
220,Mr ROBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You said it is no accident,112
221,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! I remind the member to direct his comments through the chair and to ignore the interjections from the member for Watson.,112
222,Mr ROBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The intention to have such a visa was first announced in April 2005. The workplace relations legislation had not passed the Senate and did not have any prospect of doing so at that time. Consultations on on implementation were held with state and territory authorities throughout 2005. State and territory authorities had to be consulted because they are a vital part of the process. This is ignored again and again in everything the member for Watson has to say. The fact is that the visa has its representations that were made by Golden West group training, and I am proud to acknowledge their involvement. They are a big employer of Australian apprentices and that has to be recognised. At a meeting in Senator Vanstone's office in December 2003, and in annual consultations with stakeholders conducted by Minister Vanstone since then, many employers mentioned the difficulty of finding apprentices as a major constraint on their businesses. Discussions with stakeholders on the possibility of something like this training visa, including the TAFE and training sector, were held in 2004. This has a long history and it gives the lie to your suggestion that we are playing politics. We are playing policy. We are trying to do something about the future of Australians, not play politics. Mr Burke has his facts wrong and, in my view, should apologise in the House this week. The government has implemented this visa after long consultations with many stakeholders, including employers and state governments. Labor always forget that you cannot have jobs without employers-I understand that; I have seen it for years-but it surprises me that they do not seem to have been in touch with state and territory governments, all of which are Labor at the moment. If they had had those discussions rather than coming in here playing politics, they would have properly understood the very hard protections in place for young Australians in this visa. The visas are administrated by state governments-people of the same political party as you, who are willing and able to discuss the arrangements in place-and they would have confirmed with you that protections are in place",112
223,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! I remind the parliamentary secretary to address origins in his remarks through the chair.,113
224,Mr ROBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"My apologies, Mr Deputy Speaker. The state governments would have confirmed to the shadow minister again and again that there are protections in regard to wages, just as we have seen with skilled workers coming in under the migration scheme-which ministers in Labor governments have been defending all around this country against the false assertions of some of your union bosses. If you had bothered to take the time to speak to your state colleagues, we would not be having this debate and you would not have moved to disallow this regulation. This government has not let down young Australians. On the contrary, the performance of the Howard government has restored a sense of hope and opportunity to the young people of Australia. Whether young Australians choose to work, study or undertake vocational training, the government has provided demonstrably good outcomes for all of them. Youth unemployment, since we came to office, has dropped nearly 40 per cent at a time when real wages have increased by 15.6 per cent-and the young have shared in that as well. By comparison, the Labor Party record pales into insignificance. In fact, the Labor Party record is embarrassing in comparison to what has happened over the last 10 years for the young people of Australia. There has been a 122 per cent increase in the number of youth under 19 commencing new apprenticeships since 1996 and they now account for 41 per cent of all apprenticeship starts. The number of school students getting a head start in VET programs has increased by 253 per cent. The government is providing funds to the states and territories to support an initial 167,000 vocational education training places by 2008, including the establishment of 25 Australian technical colleges. The Work for the Dole program has given young people skills. The Backing Australia's Future program will provide an additional 39,000 university places. I could go on and on. It is clear that this government has not let down young Australians. This government has given great hope and great opportunity to the young people of Australia. On skills, we do have a challenge. It is timated that in five years time we will have 200,000 more jobs than we have people to fill them. That is what you should think about. And why is this? There are two main reasons. One reason is that the economy has been going gangbusters for 10 years. We have unemployment at 30-year lows and we have youth unemployment dropping by 40 per cent. That is one of the main reasons we have a skills shortage. We plead guilty to doing that. We plead guilty to prolonged economic growth. But it has put pressure on the availability of skilled workers. When you have close to full employment, that is what happens. It is not something Labor would identify with. You have had no experience with that situation. You do not understand it. You ought to get out there and get a feel for it. This is what happens with economic growth. You get skills shortages when you have near full employment. The second contributing factor to the skills shortage is the ageing of the population. Its impact is hugely significant and it pressing. This was acknowledged by the Leader of the Opposition on 3 October last year when he said we are now experiencing massive skills shortages. It is true. We have had a strong economy and we have an ageing population which is coming in on us. Sadly, that is all the Leader of the Opposition has said about it. He offers no solutions. His shadow minister in the House offers no solutions. None of them offers any solutions. All we hear is carping, scaremongering, misrepresentations and lies about our policies in order to galvanise your base, which is disillusioned and which has lost heart. The member for Batman had it right. He knows what will give your members heart. What will give your members heart is good policy-something that will turn around the skills shortage. And it is not in one area. It requires a multipolicy approach. All of your esshadow ministers should be up at this table giving us policies that will address the skills shortage. That is what we are on about. We have introduced reforms on workplace relations, Welfare to Work, superannuation reforms to encourage older Australians back into the workplace, taxation reforms to encourage older Australians to stay longer in the workplace and huge investment in skills training, which I have just been through. Ms Owens interjecting",113
225,Mr ROBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You might laugh. You think there is one little silver bullet. Get out there and get an understanding of the regional apprenticeship visa scheme and immigration. It is a multipolicy approach to solve the challenges that we have in front of us as a country. It is not an exercise in cheap politics, so stop these lies and scaremongering. This training visa contributes importantly to young Australians in many ways. Keeping economic growth in the regions going helps them share in the economic growth that the rest of Australia enjoys. That is a really imis portant contribution. Furthermore, bringing in overseas students to take up apprenticeships will give a critical mass to courses in regional TAFE areas for apprenticeships, which will keep courses going so that young Australians can have access. Mr Burke interjecting",114
226,Mr ROBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You do not understand what it is like to come from regional areas. The shadow minister does not understand what it takes for kids to come down to the city. We want to keep TAFE courses in regional areas. By bringing in students to keep a critical mass, we will protect those courses and we will provide opportunities for young Australians. (Time expired)",114
227,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! Before I call the member for Adelaide, I remind the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and all other speakers who have been taking part in this debate to address their remarks through the chair and to refer to members by their correct title or by their seats.",115
228,Ms KATE ELLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The government's neglect of young Australians with the introduction of the trade skills training visa is absolutely a matter the utmost public importance. The complete neglect of young Australians by this government through this visa is a matter that goes to the heart of the future well-being of this country and is a matter that will adversely affect the social and economic security of Australia's future generations. The trade skills training visa will result in the driving down of youth wages and see young Australians robbed of both work and training opportunities. This visa is very different from a visa under the skilled migration scheme. This visa headhunts unskilled and untrained migrants to fill apprenticeships and traineeships in regional areas that, in many cases, could be going to young Australians. As a result of this visa, young Australians will miss out because, unlike universities, you cannot just create extra places at TAFE. Every apprenticeship must have available not only a place at TAFE but also an employer who is both willing and able to take on an apprentice. When there are only a limited number of employers who can do this, people will inevitably miss out on a place and on an opportunity. This visa will see that young Australians are denied a place for an apprenticeship, because places will have been filled from overseas. If companies can satisfy their training intake from apprentices overseas, it is logical that opportunities for Australians will disappear. The government should be ashamed of its blatant and clear betrayal of young Australians through this visa. It should be ashamed to sell out the future welfare and security of our youth simply as a bandaid solution to a problem that should have been addressed a decade ago. Young Australians must be put first. The government's suggestion that the trade skills training visa is necessary because there just are not enough people wanting to of fill apprenticeships and training places is disgraceful. In my electorate, I have spoken to a number of young constituents who are constantly looking for full-time work, job security and a form of training that will equip them for decent future employment prospects. It is absolutely disheartening to see these people locked in a position where they are unskilled and have to rely on casual and intermittent work which not only pays insufficiently but also leaves them with few rights at work and no job security. The northern and western statistical region of South Australia's youth unemployment rate for kids between the ages of 15 and 19 stands at 21.8 per cent. I would like to see the Prime Minister come to this area and tell this 21.8 per cent of young South Australians that he is giving away their potential employment opportunities to unskilled overseas labour. The whole of South Australia is classified as a regional area for migration purposes, which means that my own electorate of metropolitan Adelaide, as well as the entire state, will be affected by this visa. Across the nation, we have 193,000 young people who are not in full-time education and not fully engaged in the labour market. These young Australians, the Australians who are being denied opportunities to improve their lives, are our future. These young people, who are struggling to find secure employment and who are desperately searching for an apprenticeship, training and a career, are the very same people whose training this government should be prioritising. The government have argued that the trade skills visa has adequate safeguards to protect young Australians. They have suggested that, by requiring any potential employer to demonstrate that there are no local people prepared to take the job, young Australians will remain a priority. However, these safeguards are completely inadequate. I want the government to demonstrate just how this safeguard will work when absolutely nowhere in the employer's application form is there any obligation or requirement for the employer to advertise locally for the position before employing someone through the program. How can an employer possibly know that no local people are prepared to take on the job if they do not advertise? Even if they did advertise locally, how can an employer from my electorate in central Adelaide guarantee that there are no young Australians in Naracoorte, no young Australians in Murray Bridge, Mannum or Port Augusta-that there are no young Australians who are desperate to undertake such an apprenticeship and who will be sold out by the introduction of this visa? How then can the government possibly insist that young Australians will be put first? The fact is that cannot. This assurance is just one in a long line of empty and misleading promises from this government, who are out of touch and continue to neglect their training responsibilities. This visa program offers blatant incentives for businesses not to take on young Australian apprentices. Isn't the timing of the introduction of such a visa interesting? It happened to be introduced just after the introduction of the so called Work Choices legislation. This is no coincidence. This is part of the government's long-term plan to wind back the clock for workers and drive wages down, because, according to the government, that is how Australia must compete in the international labour market. This training visa is a double blow for young Australians, who will already be amongst the hardest hit by the government's mean, extreme and divisive Work Choices laws. When negotiating with their employer over pay conditions, many young Australians will be left no option but to take whatever wages and conditions are offered. Now that an employer is able to make signing an AWA a condition of employment, if a local apprentice is offered an AWA which undercuts the award and if that local apprentice declines the offer, the business will then be able to recruit an imported apprentice to fill the so called vacancy-with pay conditions below what an Australian would accept-on the grounds that the business could not reasonably fill that position. Let us also be clear that any overseas worker who tries to turn down an unfair AWA would not only lose their position; they would lose their visa. This visa is designed to headhunt unskilled and untrained overseas workers. It is not skilled migration at all. I want to make it very clear that I believe skilled migration has a role to play as a valuthey able component of Australia's economic and cultural development. I also believe, however, that it should never be used as the primary source of delivering an adequate skilled labour force. It is deeply concerning to watch this government use the skilled migration program as an excuse to cover up for a complete lack of investment in educating young Australians. Skilled migration must not take the place of training Australians and it must not lead to the exploitation of overseas workers and the driving down of wages. This, unfortunately but not surprisingly, has already started to happen in my home state. In Adelaide, Holden's new plant recently employed 34 European tradesmen to build a key component of their new plant. Over 1,000 workers had recently been retrenched from Holden, late last year, yet local workers were not afforded the opportunity to be trained for this work. On top of this, there have been recent reports in the Adelaide Advertiser of the overseas workers being significantly underpaid and claims that one worker may even have been threatened with deportation because he took a sick day. I would suggest that this government may be much better placed to ditch the bad policy that is the trades skills training visa and, stead, perhaps start monitoring any misuse of the skilled migration program. It is time that this government started looking out for Australia's youth. I want to make it clear as I stand here today that the crisis this country currently faces with the skills shortage has not simply arisen today or yesterday and it is not an epidemic that has hit our shores in the last six months. It is an issue that has been a problem over the 10 long years of this government and over that time it has continued to become more serious. Every single area of traditional trade over the last 10 years has reported a shortage in at least eight of those 10 years. Many skilled occupations have been on the national skills shortage list for almost 10 years. What action have we seen by this government over its 10 years in government to address the skills shortage? We have seen no commitment to education or training; in fact, we have seen the opposite. Now the government's solution to this problem involves kicking young Australians down, by depriving them of employment opportunities and a chance of improving their standard of living. This visa is a blatant and cruel betrayal of Australia's youth and of Australia's future economic and social prosperity. Since coming to power, this government has turned its back on around 300,000 Australians wanting to study at TAFE, young Australians wanting and willing to learn to improve their skills in the workplace and to better their future prospects. Three hundred thousand young Australians have been denied this opportunity. Mr Randall interjecting",115

230,Ms KATE ELLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The contrast between policies on this side of the House and govinernment policies is obvious. Rather than turning our back on young Australians, Labor can offer real initiatives, real strategies and effective policies to aid businesses and equip our future generations with the knowledge and skills they need to survive in a competitive world. The formula is simple: if you invest in education, if you invest in training opportunities and if you support employers, you will not end up with a skills shortage of this magnitude. For the sake of young Australians, this is absolutely a matter of public importance. The government must discard this ridiculous policy and adopt Labor's plan to train Australians first and to train Australians now. Training and education are investments in Australia's economic and social future, but this government is reluctant to pay the bill. It cannot see the benefits beyond tomorrow and this visa is nothing more than a short-sighted quick fix solution. (Time expired) Ms George-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

My understanding is that the test is that if the member on our side felt aggrieved by the comment by the member for Canning then he should do the honourable thing and withdraw. We invite him once again to do so. It is not a matter of whether the chair believes it was disorderly. House of Representatives Practice is quite clear. Our member was offended by it and he should withdraw.",118

With great respect to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, whilst you did not hear the remark-you are not unique in that-you did not inquire of the member whether he had made an offensive remark and seek his assistance in having it withdrawn.",118

Mr Fitzgibbon-With respect, Madam Deputy Speaker, if you have a look at page 500 of House of Representatives Practice, that is not true. You did not hear the interjection. The only person who can assist the House at this stage is the member for Canning, who needs to put the case that his interjection was not offensive. He has not been invited to do so. But we will accept your ruling. I am moving on to a new point of order. After you ruled, the member for Canning quite clearly-and everyone on this side of the House heard it-described the member for Adelaide as a precious little petal. As a female occupant of the chair, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will find that offensive. We find it offensive, and he should withdraw. As page 500 of House of Representatives Practice points out, a withdrawal does constitute an apology, and that is the appropriate move by the member for Canning in this instance.",119

The member for Watson, the mirage from Watson, is a person who I believe is acting in a hypocritical manner. If he were interested in this issue at all, he, as the Labor Party's spokesperson on migration, would join the Joint Standing Committee on Migration-if he could-and make a contribution. The committee struggled for a while to get a Labor Party member. Their spokesman was not even interested. They had to scout around until they got somebody. So his real interest in the migration committee is only peripheral and superficial, because he does not even want to be in the main committee body of this parliament-he only wants to be the spokesman for it.",119

As the member for Goldstein said, the member for Watson obviously is just playing politics with us. He knows in his heart of hearts that this is a very good policy solution for producing more skilled people in the regions of Australia. He is bringing it up as an issue because he knows that he cannot get any traction on any other issue. He is supposed to be the spokesman for the opposition, but at the end of the day he has not really been able to get his head up. He languishes over in that part of the House; as a result, he has to struggle to get himself taken as relevant. At the end of the day, we have people like Sharan Burrow, the ACTU president, who says that this is a very good program for skilling regional Australia because it brings a resource to the regions of Australia which is sorely needed. We have the former ACTU president sitting here, the member for Throsby; she disagrees with the current ACTU president, Sharan Burrow. We know that there is a lot of protection in this. The states have been consulted on this as well. The states are very keen on seeing this introduced into the regions of Australia. Strangely enough, the member for Watson thinks that Blacktown is a region of Australia. Sorry old son, it is not a region of Australia. Have you ever been into the regions of Australia? If you did you would know that there are so few apprentices available in the regions of Australia that this is why they are looking to overseas students to come here, skill themselves, and then receive a range of visa options which they can use to stay in Australia and add to Australian society as well-skilled people in the Australian work force.

257,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs I present the committee's report entitled Review of technological protection measures exceptions, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",122
258,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On 19 July last year, the Attorney-General asked the committee to inquire into and report on the issue of technological protection measures exceptions under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. Technological protection measures, or TPMs, are software or hardware components used by copyright owners to control access to copyright material or its reproduction. Examples of TPMs include software encryption, region coding technology and passwords. Under Australian copyright law TPMs are a legitimate response by copyright owners seeking to protect their intellectual property from infringement. TPMs can also be disabled or circumvented by a range of means, including the use of computer programs or devices. Article 17.4.7 of the free trade agreement requires Australia to create a statutory liabilaccordingly. ity scheme for certain activities relating to the circumvention of TPMs. The article also specifies a number of exceptions to this liability scheme and contains a provision which enables Australia to introduce further exceptions to liability under certain circumstances. The focus of the inquiry by the committee was the question of whether any further exceptions under this provision are warranted within the parameters set by article 17.4.7. The committee also examined other issues relevant to article 17.4.7 that were raised in the evidence. It is worth noting that the committee faced considerable difficulties in conducting this inquiry. The legislation which will implement article 17.4.7 does not yet exist, and there is very little information on the lars of this legislation. Indeed, the government still has several months of policy development and consultation to go before the legislation is drafted. Crucial definitional issues remain to be settled, and no interested parties are able to at this stage demonstrate actual adverse impacts as a result of the liability scheme. All of these factors significantly complicated the work of the committee. This said, the committee has assessed the exceptions put to it and has also sought to develop a rigorous interpretation of some of the key requirements for further exceptions under article 17.4.7. Of the many exceptions proposed during the course of the inquiry, the committee has concluded that several are warranted, including exceptions relevant to important sectors of Australian society and the economy such as education, libraries, cultural institutions, the information technology industry, broadcasting and government. It was also clear from the evidence that the exceptions currently permitted under the Copyright Act 1968 are important and ought to be maintained, and the committee has recommended The committee has further recommended that the balance between copyright owners and users achieved by the act should be maintained upon implementation of article 17.4.7. Region coding of copyright materialused on DVDs, for example-emerged as a prominent issue during the course of the inquiry. While region coding is entirely lawful, the committee was not persuaded by arguments that it is essential for piracy prevention or that it is a genuine copyright protection, nor does the committee see why consumers should be further restricted from enjoying lawfully acquired copyright material. The committee has therefore concluded that the unauthorised circumvention of region coding TPMs should not attract liability unparticuder the new scheme. Region coding TPMs should be excluded from the operation of the scheme. If they are included, exceptions proposed in the future for circumventing region coding TPMs should be permitted where they meet the relevant requirements. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who, in writing or in person, were able to provide their views on TPM exceptions to the committee. The committee appreciated both the quality and quantity of evidence received from a range of groups and individuals in relation to this highly technical and complex inquiry. As chairman of the committee, I would like to thank the inquiry secretary, Dr Nicholas Horne, the committee secretary, Mrs Joanna Towner, and the secondee from the Attorney General's Department, Ms Kirsti Haipola, for their assistance. The committee brought down a unanimous report. That is a fairly powerful indica- task. tion of how the members feel about the recommendations. The committee believes that its recommendations will materially assist the government in the formulation of the legislation implementing article 17.4.7 and will help to ensure a sensible and balanced liability scheme. The committee is pleased to have had this opportunity to contribute to this evolving area of intellectual property law under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. I commend the report to the House.",122
259,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-May I first acknowledge the work that was undertaken by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and echo the sentiments of the chair of the committee that the secretariat performed invaluable work under considerable pressure. Whilst we routinely say these things in the production of reports, in this instance both the chair and I hold the work that was undertaken in the highest regard. The fundamental starting point of this inquiry was to examine the complexities that arise between the meshing of copyright regimes that are necessitated by the free trade agreement. It is not always easy to mesh quite different legal regimes using different conceptual frameworks. The technical task in doing so is great, but the public policy issues are very important. Every dot and comma in copyright legislation is worth substantial sums of money to those who are in the market of intellectual property. The consequences for this are very important not only for those who commercially exploit copyright product but also for the public, whose access to materials should not be limited beyond that which we have broadly agreed by way of the balances that we have established in this parliament in the past. With that framework in mind, we sought to enter the The chair of the committee has mentioned one issue that took a considerable amount of time but on which our conclusion was clear-that is, where a region coding currently might make it inconvenient or impossible to use DVDs or CDs purchased in one location of the globe without the approach that this committee has adopted. We have recommended that the region coding technological protection mechanisms be specifically excluded from the definition of effective technological measures, a decision which I hope will be welcomed widely by many who would be otherwise inconvenienced by this. I accept that it does have some economic consequence to the marketers, but what we are seeking to do is not to create artificial monopolies but rather to make certain that there is effective capacity to protect copyright and to ensure that the public is not inconvenienced more than it need be by those provisions. There is one issue which we draw considerable attention to and use very strong language in respect of that I should mention. It arises because, essentially, the terms of the agreement provide quite inconsistently in respect of a particular matter. The provisions allow for exceptions-they allow the deencryption or the accessing of materials irrespective of technological protection devices under certain limited circumstances-yet there is a blanket prohibition in the legislation which would appear to prohibit the possession, ownership and manufacture of the devices necessary to exercise that right. So, on its face, the agreement appears to say that doing A, B and C is permissible and then says in a different phraseology ‘but the practical means of doing A, B and C are forbidden'. Clearly that is a conundrum. In the committee's view, at paragraph 3.118, it is a ‘laway mentable and inexcusable flaw in the text of article 17.4.7'; indeed, a flaw that verges on absurdity. What we have sought to do is to direct the government's attention to the underlying policy that was put forward when this agreement was entered into, and we have drawn attention to the fact that the government stated in its response to criticisms of the agreement that it was entering into that there was no intention to take away from the existing entitlements for circumvention in the areas which were permissible. Bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind that thus far no satisfactory solution has been proposed regarding the lack of capacity to undertake the circumvention permitted by the exceptions under article 17.4.7, the committee is strongly of the view that the government has to devise a workable and adequate way of addressing this problem prior to the implementation of the liability scheme. We say that those with exceptions will have to be able to lawfully exercise them, whether according to a statutory licensing scheme or according to some other mechanism of approval regime. Any lack of a solution will seriously endanger the viability of the many exceptions permitted under the agreement. So those who are particularly interested in the area of copyright will find much in this report-much that they will agree with and much that they will contest, depending on the position with which they commenced and the interests they represent. But the committee has done its best to try to reflect the balances struck by the parliament in the past. It has recognised that some issues, particularly those regarding time-shifting and coding restrictions between geographical territories, are ones which most members of the public would prefer to be removed from copyright protection. We have tried to address, in a that allows this parliament to give notice to the executive, the need to find some solution to the conundrum of how to deal with permitted exceptions, exists but no means of giving effect to those exceptions exists in a practical way. I commend the report to the House, to the government and to the community. No doubt it will engender considerable further debate. We still do not have the legislation. I thank my fellow committee members, and I again refer to the work of the secretariat. They were under considerable time pressure and they did excellent work in preparing this report.",124
260,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,by leave-I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER-ACHIEVEMENT NA OPPORTUNITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed. The original question was that the bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Jagajaga has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words.,125
261,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,THROUGH CHOICE AND,The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,126
262,Mr HENRY,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"As I recall, I was speaking just before question time and had remarked, as the member for Jagajaga had just come into the House, on her criticism of the Howard government. I remarked on its fantastic performance with respect to education and additional funding in support of education across the board. Immediately prior to my contribution the member for Brisbane made some comments about how important it is to spend money on education and training, and that you cannot spend too much. I agree with that. I think the Howard government has demonstrated that time and again since 1996. In particular, I mention an initiative that will be a fantastic opportunity for many young Australians in developing their skills-that is, the Australian technical college. This is another great example of how the Howard government is using innovation in developing skills in education and in providing opportunities for young Australians to get out into the workplace and enjoy a successful and productive life and career by obtaining the education and skills they need. Certainly I have had considerable experience in the skills development and apprenticeship training area over a fairly lengthy period of time, with apprenticeships and traineeships in the building and construction industry. I know only too well the great satisfaction that many young people in Australia get out of undertaking an apprenticeship and going on and becoming a tradesman, and in many cases going into small business. This is the whole point of the Investing in Our Schools program: it gives school communities and our broader community the opportunity to set their own infrastructure priorities, without being constrained by the bureaucracy, the state education departments. This program allows for investment of up to $150,000 in each school, on top of its normal funding. The Commonwealth has had to do this because the state Labor governments are just not putting sufficient money into school infrastructure. For example, in my own electorate, Gosnells Primary School and High Wycombe Primary School have been begging the state for some time now to allocate resources to fix up the toilets-an essential service that needs to be there for hygiene and the normal process of human life. And yet the state government is doing nothing about it. As has so often been the case, the Howard government has been identifying these needs at schools, seeking the support of the community and providing funding at the local level, because the state governments just are not doing their job. The member for Brisbane had the audacity to talk about dirty deals being done with respect to these funding arrangements and somehow implied that Labor held electorates have been disadvantaged. There has been similar criticism from the member for Jagajaga. That is an absolute joke. This funding program is the most open and transparent program. It is available to all schools across Australia. It is effective and cost-effective; it is the best bang for your buck. These grants are assessed by fully independent panels and the Australian government has accepted the panels' recommendations in full. Members opposite are trying to give a helping hand to their state counterparts-and they certainly need it-who are very disappointed that they cannot get their hands on this money as it goes through the processes. This money goes straight to the schools, with no state ministers to muck around with it or funnel it into their pet projects. Schools are getting the full bang for their buck out of these programs. How can this funding be a dirty deal? In my electorate, High Wycombe Primary School has received funding to the tune of $72,253. This school happens to be-as I said before-in the state electorate held by the Western Australian Treasurer and Deputy Premier, Eric Ripper, who has just announced this week a record half-year surplus of over $1 billion, but who cannot provide funding for schools in his own electorate. In the latest round of funding from this program to my electorate, Gosnells High School, which I mentioned before, has received $150,000. Gosnells Primary School received $69,459; Gooseberry Hill Primary School received $146,960; Caversham Primary School received $150,000; Helena Valley Primary School received $99,500; Huntingdale Primary School received $147,000; South Thornlie Primary School received $63,000; and Woodbridge Primary School received $107,690. That is a new school in the electorate in the state seat of Midland. We have a senior cabinet member of the state government who is not providing the sorts of resources to these schools that should be provided. They are relying on the Commonwealth to provide this support. It is an abrogation of their responsibility to the community, to the school children across Australia and to Western Australia particularly. Yule Brook College in Maddington received $72,000. That is an exceptional primary school, and is again in a safe Labor seat. Every single one of these schools, as I have mentioned, is in safe state Labor seats. Only two schools are in Liberal held electorates. That is the sort of situation that the member for Jagajaga and the member for Brisbane are being critical of. They are critical because we are supporting Labor constituencies and their schools in state Labor seats, ensuring that we pick up what the state government have not picked up. The only dirty deals around here are the ones done between the trade unions and the Labor Party. We again notice the absence from the House of the member for Hotham and the member for Corio, members of this House who have to pick up on these dirty deals to ensure that they have the opportunity to take up their seats on the opposition benches in the future. Labor is doing deals to dump sitting members and replace them with union hacks. That is not surprising, really. Ask the member for Hotham and ask the member for Maribyrnong and they will tell you what it is likeMs King-I rise on a point of order. I ask you, Madam Deputy Speaker, to draw the member back to the question before the chair.",126
263,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,THROUGH CHOICE AND,The material that he is using is relevant.,127
264,Mr HENRY,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I am in the process of concluding my remarks. It is important to draw attention to these issues. Members opposite want to be critical and talk about dirty deals. The only dirty deals that are done in this House are done on that side of the parliament between sitting members and their union mates. This bill will do a lot to help schools all around Australia, but particularly schools in Hasluck like Corridors College, which I mentioned in my opening remarks earlier. The bill will provide better opportunities and more choices to young people, particularly those kids who might otherwise fall by the wayside. I commend the bill to the House.",127
265,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I thought it was important that I made some contribution to the debate on the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006. On 9 November I asked the then minister for education a question about the particular funding that been subject to much discussion during the debate on this bill. I asked the then minister for education to provide a breakdown to me of each electorate across Australia that received funding for government and nongovernment schools. The breakdown allowed the shadow minister and other members of the opposition to clearly see that there has been a distortion in funding towards and in favour of government electorates when compared with opposition electorates. This is a serious charge. We are asserting that the government would manipulate the funding in order to provide more money for constituents in government held electorates as opposed to opposition held electorates. This comes off the back of the ‘regional rorts' affair that was raging last year, quite rightly pointing to government misbehaviour and levels of corruption that occurred during the course of funding applications to that department. I think the Labor Party made it very clear and confirmed the view that was held by the public that the government had indeed porkbarrelled Commonwealth money to provide electoral favour in the last election. Whilst I am happy to concede that there has been money allocated to all constituents that made applications-and I am also happy to concede that there are some significant sums of money going to opposition held electorates-it is important to note that, when you look at the average amount of money under this program going to government seats compared to opposition seats, the government seats fare considerably better. It seems that the money allocated to coalition seats was almost double that for Labor and Independent seats. Of course, you have to take into account the fact that there are coalition seats but, even once you factor in, when comparing opposition to coalition seats it is clear that more funds have been has provided to the government held seats. That is an issue that the shadow minister for education and Deputy Leader of the Opposition quite rightly raised in her contribution to this debate. It is a very important matter of ensuring that the government is accountable and that it makes its decisions on Commonwealth funding allocation based on merit and on requirements of school children across the country-not on the electoral needs of a political party that wants to sustain itself in government with spin and pork-barrelling. That is why it is important for me to make a contribution to this debate. I also would like to talk about my electorate of Gorton. We were indeed successful in the applications made, but there were some question marks over another type of grant application. I have been in contact with the minister's office and have asked the department why a decision was made not to prothe vide a particular grant to Caroline Springs College regarding out of school hours care. It seems to me that the grounds for one of their applications were very strong indeed. The format of the application and the reasons for seeking the grant were stronger than other applications I have witnessed and, I am sure, far stronger than many other applications from outside of my electorate that were forthcoming as a result of this program.",127
266,Mr SLIPPER,THROUGH CHOICE AND,Did you contact the minister?,128
267,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Yes, to answer the question of the member opposite, we contacted the then minister's office. I hope the new Minister for Education, Science and Training will attend to that matter, if it had not already been determined by the previous minister. Caroline Springs College is a wonderful school. It is located in an area more where there is not only a primary Catholic that school, Christ the Priest Catholic Primary School, but also another independent school, Mowbray College. The amazing thing about those three schools is that they share resources and also land. There is a great harmony amongst the three schools in the way they look after children and ensure children from each of the schools work and play together. I would hate to think that, in one of the fastest growing areas of Melbourne-and certainly one of the fastest growing areas of the electorate of Gorton-Caroline Springs College is neglected because of a bureaucratic decision not to allow a grant. On the face of it and after discussions I have had with the principal, Gabrielle Leigh, and other colleagues of hers at that school, I cannot see any reason for that grant not to be forthcoming. I hope, therefore, if that decision has already been reversed, that the minister's office and indeed the department review that decision. If that has already occurred-if the decision has been reversed and the funding has been provided to them-and I have not been informed, it has happened very recently and I would welcome it. This is such an important area of the western suburbs of Melbourne and one of the fastest growing suburbs of Melbourne. It would be awful to send such a message to such an innovative school. It is a school that collaborates with two other schools-one a Catholic primary and the other an independent school-in a way which I think is a template for other areas where there are schools within the same location. It would be awful to think that the college would miss out. As a result of population growth in that area of Melbourne, Caroline Springs College has outgrown its first campus and the second campus is coming along very well. But, because of the exponential growth that is occurring in that area, resources have to catch up to the quickly increasing population growth and density. I think it is incumbent upon local, state and Commonwealth governments to be aware of the growth in that region and to ensure that funds are provided so that western suburbs children do not miss out. I make that plea in this place via you, Mr Deputy Speaker Somlyay, to the minister. I hope the plea is heard and that the claim for the application to be reviewed will be attended to. Before Christmas, I gave a promise that I would do everything I could to ensure that the decision would be reversed. We did make contact with the department and the minister's office, and we await their decision. I will finish on the fact that the government has a charge to answer: when you look at the average amount of funding going to not coalition seats compared with that going to Labor and Independent seats, you find that a higher level of funding is being provided to government seats. It is something that the government has to explain. There may be reasons that are yet to be uncovered by the shadow minister for education and others; but, until we are provided with them, we will assume and, as a result, conclude that the government is pork-barrelling certain areasMr Farmer-That's completely untrue!",128
268,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,THROUGH CHOICE AND,The parliamentary secretary at the table wants to intervene. He does not want to get up on his feet. Mr Farmer interjecting,129
269,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Now he wants to shout, because I guess that is the nature of the parliamentary secretary. It may well be that the parliamentary secretary's electorate has done very well. I have already suggested to him that I am aware of many applications in other areas that have been successful, but the fact remains that, on average, when you compare coalition seats with Labor and Independent seats, coalition seats have done better. I invite the parliamentary secretary and the minister to provide a genuine reason at some point in time for that-a reason other than pork-barrelling and looking after their own interests instead of the interests of school children in this country. But, on the face of it, there is on average a disproportionate amount of funding going to those seats, and that has to be answered. I am sure that is of concern to many parents who send their children to primary and secondary schools in this country, because they would expect the government to spend money on schools based on the merit of an application and the needs of the children, not based on such motives as the electoral need of the government to sustain itself in government. That is yet to be answered. It has not been properly answered by anyone on the other side, and the quicker that is done the better off we will all be-but I will not hold my breath for an answer to that. This is not the only program where money has been disproportionately spent on marginal government held seats in order for the government to maintain those seats. There is no doubt that the government looks after the marginal seats, not the marginalised. It has an obsession with looking after its own, and it is about time it turned its attention children of Australia and their schools.",129
270,Mr SLIPPER,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"The explanatory memorandum points out to us that the purpose of the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006 is to amend the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004, which provides funding for Australian government programs and financial assistance to the states and territories for government and non-government schools for the 2005 to 2008 quadrennium. I am passionate about education, and I have to say that I think Australia has been singularly fortunate that, during the last 10 years of the coalition government in office, we have had three very effective ministers for education. I refer, in particular, to Dr David Kemp, the former minister and now retired; the now Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Bradfield; and the new minister, the honourable member for Curtin, who was recently appointed to that post. I think those who are parents are passionate about education. The children of Australia are our nation's future, and I do not believe that this issue ought to be politicised. The honourable member for Gorton spoke at some length, accusing the government of pork-barrelling-spending excessive amounts of money in government electorates, particularly marginal government electorates-and he somehow seemed to suggest that we were putting the interests of government members ahead of the interests of the children of Australia. I do not think he made the charge out successfully at all. In fact, he highlighted how the system is working when he referred to the Caroline Springs school in his electorate. to the He said that that school put in what he thought was a good application and, inexplicably, it was rejected. He also pointed out that he has been to see the former minister and that he is hoping that the new minister will reverse that decision upon the representations being made by him. From the words that he uttered, he seemed to be enormously optimistic that that decision was about to be reversed. If he is correct and the application is worthy-I certainly hope that the honourable member is correct-he is saying that this system is open and transparent and that it works. Ministers for education act on the basis of recommendations from bureaucrats. Bureaucrats consider applications, and ministers make final decisions in most cases. In some cases, the decisions might be made by those who are not elected. But, ultimately, the buck stops at the minister's desk. My experience of ministers for education and, indeed, of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who is seated at the table, is that, if you have a case and you see the minister, regardless of the political party from which you emanate, you will get a hearing. It seems that, from what the honourable member for Gorton told the House only a couple of minutes ago, he has had a good hearing. He has been there to re-argue the case for the Caroline Springs school. He thought that maybe the former minister had signed off on a reversal of the decision. He said that, if the former minister has not, optimistic that the now minister will do that. He said that he has not been notified of a decision-that is possible, because it sometimes takes a while for these things to flow through. What he is really saying is that we do have a system that works. Not everyone is always going to be happy with every decision made by the government. We have finite funds. The funds have to be spread equitably. I think it is quite wrong to suggest that the government would favour schools within government electorates, because that simply walks away from the reality that parents resident in one federal electorate do not necessarily send their children to schools within that electorate. You find that parents vote with their feet. There are good government and non-government schools, and in many cases you will find that those parents will not look at federal electorate boundaries when deciding where to send their kids to school. Sometimes you will find that people who live in a Liberal or National Party electorate will send their children to school in a Labor electorate, and it is therefore in my view inconceivable that the government would possibly make decisions on the basis of the electoral boundaries within which a particular school is situated. I have been reminded that the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs was also the Minister for Employgood ment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, and she was a very fine occupant of that office as well. I am pleased to speak on this bill. I am very proud of what we have achieved in the area of education over the last 10 years. I am very proud of the government and non-government schools we have in the area I represent-and it is of course contiguous with the area that you represent, Mr Deputy Speaker Somlyay. We have had very good quality government and he is non-government schools during the period that we have been in office. I am proud that millions and millions of dollars have been poured into the Sunshine Coast and hinterland areas as far as schools are concerned. That indicates to me, as a parent and as an elected representative, that this government is continuing to deliver for the students of this area. In fact, I see the deputy serjeant here and I know that her brother is a very fine teacher at Caloundra State High School. That is a very good government high school within my electorate which has received assistance from this government over the years. The bill before the House will further strengthen the government's support of all schools in that it provides for the automatic allocation of general recurrent funding for those non-government schools that are devoted to meeting the needs of students with emotional difficulties-those facing social and behavioural challenges-who are at risk of dropping out of the normal schooling system. I have always been one to support the notion of giving students every possible opportunity to achieve all that they can on the educational front. That is a wonderful investment in an even better Australia as the years go on. The provisions in this bill do that for students facing additional challenges and back up the support that has already been given by the Australian government to students in my electorate. Parents of struggling students have been offered tutorial vouchers that are designed to fund extra rial support for students outside school hours to enable them to overcome particular learning hurdles and improve their educational outcomes. The Investing in Our Schools program has been widely welcomed in my electorate. So much money is poured into schools in my electorate it is probably impossible in a minute speech to quote every last dollar that has been granted by the government to the parents and students of the electorate of Fisher. For example, just last September students and staff at seven schools shared in grants totalling $210,000. The funding program is designed to deliver much needed projects to school communities. This scheme is especially significant because it will projects that have been identified by the school communities themselves as being critical to their schools. In September funds were allocated to Buddina State School, which received $34,010 to pay for extensions to the computer lab; Currimundi Special School, $42,453 for the installation of air conditioning; Eudlo State School, $26,411 for extensions to the school tuckshop; Golden Beach State School, $11,250 to help with planning for a multipurpose area; Montville State School, $32,200 for an extension of covered walkways-and I can see you smiling, Mr Deputy Speaker Somlyay, because while Montville State School is technically within my electorate I suspect that most of the students there reside in yours; Mooloolah State School, $42,372 for outdoor shaded sports, play and learning activity area; and Talara Primary College, $21,957 for improvements to shade structures and sporting infrastructure. Projects such as these, although often desperately needed by the schools, never seem to make their way onto the state government priority lists, and school communities must often face the long and arduous task of raistutoing the necessary funding themselves. The Australian government recognises the importance of providing schools with facilities that will enhance the education and well-being of students. The Investing in Our Schools program builds on the $1.5 thousand million already allocated by the Australian government for school capital projects over the next 20- four years. In November, numerous schools were assisted through the capital grants program for schools. Four schools shared in over $1 million in funds: Pacific Lutheran College, which received $450,000 to construct six general learning areas, an administration area, a computer laboratory, store rooms, student and staff amenities and other items; the new fund Caloundra City School, situated in Pelican Waters, to construct a chemistry laboratory, a physics laboratory, general learning areas, a hydroponics room, chemical storage room, home economics room, preparation kitchen, staff room and other items; the Sunshine Coast Grammar School, $60,000 for construction of four general learning areas, a computer lab and staff room, two store rooms, staff amenities and other items; the Sunshine Coast Grammar School, again with the construction of two primary general learning areas, a teacher's office and other items; and Caloundra Christian College, $78,100 for the refurbishment of two science laboratories and a science preparation room, the conversion of an under cover area to a primary general learning area and an extension to a science laboratory. I was pleased to announce further grants of over $370,000 for much needed projects at the Caloundra Christian College, for construction of a multipurpose covered area, and Sunshine Coast Grammar School. In November, the government announced 564 extra places in my electorate for before school, after school and vacation care. This was the second highest allocation in Australia behind the allocation for the electorate of Groom. Assistance was also extended to help through programs such as the Healthy School Communities program. This included grants of up to $1,500 to encourage schools to implement systems that encourage healthy eating. Schemes in my electorate include the funding of Ananda Marga River School in Maleny to support the implementation of a healthy school canteen policy by purchasing equipment for the production and safe storage of healthy foods. The funds for Caloundra State School will provide training for students and volunteers in food safety and the principles of good nutrition. Government funding for Caloundra Christian College will be used to support the implementation of a healthy school canteen policy by purchasing equipment for the production and safe storage of healthy foods and to develop and implement a breakfast program for students, parents and community members. The grant for Caloundra City School will help develop and implement a breakfast program for students, parents and community members and will be used to purchase fresh fruit and vegetables for health snacks during activities school hours. Chancellor State College will be allocated funds to purchase fresh fruit and vegetables for healthy snacks during activities after school hours. The funds for Currimundi Special School will be used to buy fresh fruit and vegetables for healthy snacks during school hours so students can run a juice bar three times a week. The funds for Glenview State School will support the implementation of a healthy school canteen policy by purchasing equipment for the production and safe storage of healthy foods and to develop and maintain a vegetable garden which will be used to reinforce the healthy eating curriculum. The grant for Kawana Waters State High School will help to host a healthy dinner for students, parents and community members and demonstrate how to prepare healthy food alternatives, and the funds for Pacific Lutheran College will be used to encourage healthy-eating resources for curriculum based activities. These allocations of funds reflect the ongoing importance that the government places on students, learning outcomes and school environments. The Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006 will further improve the situation and provide further student support and further support to the families of Australia. I have to say-and I probably should not admit this in the House-that I have a reasonably high opinion of the honourable member for Jagajaga, perhaps more than some colleagues have, but I am disappointed that the honourable member sees fit to move two fairly spurious amendments. The member ought to take note of the facts and perhaps ought to be a bit more enthusiastic in her support for the very many education initiatives of this govafter ernment. I commend the bill to the House.",130
271,Ms JULIE BISHOP,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Curtin-Minister for Education, Science and Training and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues) (5.54 pm)-I take this opportunity to thank all members of the House who took part in this debate. I particularly want to thank the members of the coalition who provided most thoughtful and considered contributions: the members for Canning, Bass, Ryan, Riverina, Cowper, Hasluck and Fisher. The Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006 contains measures that will provide increased Australian government funding to meet the immediate needs of school communities throughout the nation. Under our government, all Australian schools have been funded at record levels. Through increased financial assistance to schools, particularly schools ing the neediest communities, the government seeks to improve the outcomes from schools and thus provide a brighter future for all Australian students. This bill contains measures that will enable more funding in 2006 to directly benefit schools and students in response to the actual needs of schools. Over $186 million for small scale infrastructure projects in state government schools is being brought forward from 2008 to 2006. To meet the overwhelming response to the Investing in Our Schools program, under the program the government is providing $700 million to deliver small scale projects which will improve and enhance the infrastructure of state government schools, in accordance with priorities identified by the school communities. This program has proved enormously popular. I am delighted that the parliamentary secretary, the Hon. Pat Farmer, is in the House for he has been a great champion of this program and has assisted enormously in its delivery. More than 8,300 funding requests were received in 2005 from state government schools. These consisted of over 4,800 applications received in round 1 for grants of up to $50,000 and over 3,500 applications in round 2 for grants of up to $150,000. I am delighted to report to the House that schools in every single federal electorate across Australia have been allocated funding through this program. I reject completely the baseless-and I might say vindictive-claim by the Labor Party that there is any bias or rorting of this program or that funds are being directed to coalition seats. That is outrageous. Independent state based assessment advisory panels, consisting of school principals and parents, were established to assess appliservcations. They were assisted by guidelines provided by the Department of Education, Science and Training. Neither the Australian government nor the state government have a vote. The member for Jagajaga ought to note that these panels were not looking at electorate boundaries when they put forward their assessments; they made their assessments solely on schools' needs. This shameless Labor attack is in fact directed at the people on these independent school and parent panels. If there are more schools in one electorate then there is more likelihood that more schools will apply for funding; therefore, more funding might be applied to schools in that electorate. This is not rocket science. It is a fact-one that we rejoice in on this side of the House-that the coalition holds more seats than the opposition. If there are more schools in coalition held electorates and there are more coalition held seats, of course the figures are obvious. So the claims are totally baseless. Take Queensland, for example, where 25 per cent of funding has gone to ALP seats. That is in line with the number of seats that they hold. It is the same in Tasmania where ALP-held seats received more than 53 per cent of the funding. Let me take the Northern Territory-67 per cent of funding in the Northern Territory went to the ALP held seat. The member for Jagajaga has led this charge for Labor. Let us look at her elecnance. torate of Jagajaga, which was allocated over $880,000 through the program to help schools in her community. To put this in perspective, my electorate was allocated $315,000. I have no complaint, but that was almost one-third of the amount that schools were allocated in Jagajaga. I think it is a sad reflection on the member for Jagajaga. She complains about the program, yet her electorate has been allocated almost three times the amount of funding for schools in my electorate-and I think that says it all. I would also draw to her attention the fact that her electorate has 49 schools mine has 58. While the member for Jagajaga complains, it is interesting to note that many of her colleagues are deathly quiet. I do not hear the member for Canberra, for example, condemning the $900,000 allocated in her electorate to local schools. I do not hear the member for Bendigo complaining about the $1 million allocated for schools in his electorate. Let us not forget that this program came into being after urgent need was identified in the state school sector due to the chronic glect of state government schools by state and territory governments. Already more than $73 million has been paid to schools for much needed projects-basic infrastructure such as air conditioning, shade structures, computer equipment, library resources, classroom improvements and playground equipment. Funding is being brought forward from 2008 so that state government schools do not have to wait for funding for much needed infrastructure projects. These are projects which just do not get priority from the state governments. Let me use a school in Jagajaga as an example. It received funding to repair an oval that is more than 30 years old. Due to the financial restraints posed by the state Labor government in Victoria, the oval has received minimal mainteI have been advised that the surface is rock-hard and uneven, resulting in students sustaining frequent injuries when playing ball games or participating in athletic activities. Also, there are no goalposts on the oval for children to play football and soccerwhich is unusual for a school in Victoria. This is in the electorate of the member for Jagajaga. Does the state government in Victoria just not care? When was the last time the member for Jagajaga wrote to her state Labor counterparts on behalf of schools in her electorate calling on them to properly fund schools? In and many cases schools have been seeking funding year after year but have been knocked back by state governments. One school advised me about requesting funding from its state government for a decade without success-and the Labor members talk about a delay in the delivery of this program. We are talking about schools that state Labor governments have kept waiting for years for funding. That is why the Investing in Our Schools program is so important: it responds to the needs of school communities now; it ne- does not make them wait 10, 20 or 30 years. Having received reports like these from principals and parents, I am staggered by the negativity and the lack of support for this program by Labor, but particularly by the criticism from the member for Jagajaga. She was rather keen in her speech to offer me some advice. I suggest that she spend less time sitting in her Parliament House suite and more time visiting local schools and talking to students, parents and teachers to hear how valuable this program is to them. I suggest the member for Jagajaga urge her state counterparts to meet their responsibilities for funding state government schools properly. This program is unique: it is giving im- parents and teachers the opportunity to tell the Australian government directly the needs of their schools. It is time for Labor to stop criticising the hard working parents and principals in these groups who have been involved at all stages of the development and implementation of the Investing in Our Schools program and whose only aim is to provide the best possible learning environment for their students. The government supports the provision of funding for schools on a needs basis, and this principle underpins the Australian government funding for schools. It has always been the intention of the Australian government to provide maximum general recurrent funding to special schools. Under the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004, special schools are funded at the maximum recurrent grant rate. A school is classified a special school if it is recognised by the state or territory education minister as a cial school and provides a special education program. In some states this recognition does not extend to schools that primarily cater for students with social, emotional or behavioural difficulties or who are at risk of ing mainstream schooling. The amendments to the act correct this anomaly and fulfil the intention under the SES funding arrangements of providing maximum general recurrent funding to this very important class of non-government schools. The pilot Tutorial Voucher Initiative and other responses to improve the literacy levels of Australian students are yet another example of this government responding to the abject failure of state governments to adequately resource state government schools or respond to the learning needs of their students. The Tutorial Voucher Initiative has successfully assisted some 6,200 students nationally during 2005. This valuable assistance was provided through $700 worth of one-to-one tuition in reading. Of these students, 5,443 completed a full course of tuition. There was a high level of community interest in the pilot. The department's national hotlines have received over 10,000 calls about the pilot since it was announced in 2004 and the program has been very well received by those who participated. The findings from the independent evaluation already show that 87.7 per cent of parents who responded to the parent/care giver survey were satisfied or very satisfied with the pilot overall. Thirty-eight per cent of participating parents nationwide responded to the survey and over 80 per cent of those felt their child had improved in reading and enjoyed reading. Eighty-five per cent of responding parents felt their child had increased in confidence in reading as a result of the tuition. Sixty-nine per cent of responding tutors felt most or all as of the students they tutored had improved in reading and most students appear to have speimproved between their preand post-tuition assessments. All state and territory education ministers agreed at the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Afleavfairs in May 2005 that they would directly contact parents with eligible students or, where this was not possible, the school principals would make that contact. In states where parents were contacted in a timely way by the state education authorities, the take-up was high. In New South Wales, where parents were contacted directly, the take-up was 70 per cent of eligible students. In contrast, 12 per cent of eligible students in Victoria and 18 per cent in Queensland registered. Why would that be? Children in Victoria and Queensland were disadvantaged by the failure of the Victorian and Queensland governments to do what they agreed. In Victoria letters were sent to parents after the closing date for the pilot. In Queensland they did not even bother to send letters. The Australian government intends that children in those states who failed to get what they had agreed to give them and who were unable to get help with their reading under the pilot Tutorial Voucher Initiative in 2005 will be able to do so. Many eligible parents and their children missed out on getting any reading assistance not through any fault of theirs but due to the inaction of state governments. So, as a matter of good faith, the government is making available funding this year to students who missed out on the valuable assistance. The bill will ensure that funding from the pilot program will be available in 2006 to provide assistance for students who most need extra support. This bill responds to the specific needs of schools and school communities. The government will continue to identify and respond to community aspirations for Australian schools to ensure that our students are well prepared to participate fully in Australian society and contribute effectively within an international context. I commend this bill to the House. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Ms Macklin's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. [6.12 pm] (The Deputy Speaker-Hon.

272,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,"I move: Schedule 1, after item 20, page 6, (after line insert: 20A After subsection 120(6) Add: (7) The Minister may make a determination authorising payment for the purposes of this section to one of the following: (a) an approved authority mentioned in section 9; (b) a nominated authority mentioned in section 10; (c) an approved government school community organisation mentioned in section 11; or (d) any other person or body that has met national standards for educational quality and financial and management probity. (8) The regulations will specify the content of the national standards described in subsection (7)(d) following consultation with state authorities for ment and non-government schools, national and state professional teaching associations and accreditation authorities and national parents' associations. The amendment, if passed, would in part protect the quality and integrity of projects supported under section 120 of the principal act. I reiterate for the benefit of members that Labor is supporting the Investing in Our Schools program because we recognise the need for our schools to have increased capital investment. Of course, we also recognise the importance of the involvement of parents. The point that we are trying to get across in this debate is not that schools do not need the money or that parents should not be involved-they should-but that we want to make sure that schools get the money when it is promised. They have not been receiving it in a timely fashion. We also want to make sure it is delivered to those schools where it is most needed. Just in case 19), anyone was under any misapprehension, I just wanted to reiterate that point. This amendment is about the need to bolster the operation of one of the schemes being considered as part of this bill-the Tutorial Voucher Initiative. The advantage of the amendment I am moving tonight is that it would apply to all projects funded under what is called the grants for national projects element of the broader Commonwealth Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs Program. I outlined in my earlier remarks the need for reform in the way that this kind of program is administered. There has been far too much scope under the current legislation and administrative guidelines for funding to be wasted. We have seen that particularly with the appointment of the Progressive Learning Co., which was the broker delivering the tutorial voucher. This company has a very poor record of delivery, and govern- the government should be trying to make sure that it does not continue. This amendment would help that. This broker, Progressive Learning, seems to have no understanding of the way that schools and school systems work. It has certainly failed to deliver because we have seen only 12 per cent of eligible students in Victoria, for example, getting the help they need to improve their reading literacy. Unfortunately, in her summing up, the Minister for Education, Science and Training fell back on the tried and true method of this government, which is to blame the states. Unfortunately, in this case, the brokers responsible for this scheme in Victoria and Queensland have not been able to make sure that the children who needed this money actually got it in a way that meant they got extra tutorial assistance to help them to read after they had failed to meet the benchmark tests when they were at the grade 3 level. This amendment would give some protection to the future operation of the Tutorial Voucher Initiative and, as I said, other related programs funded under ‘Grants for national projects' at column 6 of the table in part 1 of schedule 9 of the principal act. This element will more than double to over $19 million in 2006-so it is a very substantial amount of money-from moving unspent money from 2004 and 2005 as covered in this bill. This is a lot of money, so we do need to make sure the funding has protection and that it is spent wisely and strategically. We are certainly very concerned about whether that has been the case over the last couple of years. Some of the unspent money should be given to schools and systems for them to spend directly on students. Especially the students who have missed out should be a priority in the use of these funds. We have children who are now sitting the grade 5 test who should have had the money two years ago. They certainly should be the priority. They cannot be asked to wait for another round of calling for applications, tendering for brokers, searching for tutors and checking their qualifications, their experience, their child protection records and so on. (Extension of time granted) We need to make sure that the professionals who deliver these tutorial schemes have adequate qualifications and appropriate skills. We also have to protect the integrity and probity of the individuals and agencies who have been funded with an allocation of public money to deliver this literacy support. The whole purpose of this amendment is to deliver this type of protection. I acknowledge that existing authorities, whether they be schools or community bodies mentioned in sections 9, 10 and 11 of the principal act, already meet the conditions for the receipt and delivery of Commonwealth funds for schools; so we are not suggesting that schools would be affected by this amendment. But we also know that, unfortunately, there are instances where brokering agencies-in this case literacy tutors-need to meet the same standards of financial integrity as other recipients of Commonwealth grants. Most importantly, these brokers have to be responsible for the quality of the tutors they contract for this literacy support. The tutors must satisfy the professional teaching standards that are required of all teachers. The principles set out in the National Framework for Professional Standards for Teaching, endorsed by all ministers, including the Commonwealth minister, would be a useful starting point. The best way to develop such national standards is to ask those in the states and territories-in the schools, the classrooms and the accreditation authorities-to advise on what would work. This amendment is being put forward in a spirit of goodwill. We do want to make sure that this money is well spent. We do want to make sure that the people who are going to be contracted to deliver the literacy programs have adequate qualifications. When the standards are ready, the parliament could have the opportunity to consider the issue through regulations. That would give the government the flexibility it needs to deliver the program in a timely way while at the same time protecting parliament's right to approve or change it. I commend the amendment to the House and hope it will be received in the manner in which it is put forward.",138
273,Ms JULIE BISHOP,NOES,"Curtin-Minister for Education, Science and Training and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues) (6.27 pm)-The member for Jagajaga has fallen into her own trap of identifying the two providers, Queensland and Victoria, as the states where the parents were not informed by the state governments in a timely manner. In trying to limit the Australian government's capacity to make the most appropriate arrangements to deliver much needed assistance to students, it seems that the member for Jagajaga, as this amendment illustrates, does not understand the processes and structures of the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice And Opportunity) Act 2004. Labor's proposed amendment either tries to deliver what is already possible under the act or is a nonsense. The arrangements that are currently in the act outline the processes for entering into arrangements with non-government schools and non-school organisations to deliver much needed educational services and support to Australian schools and students. The arrangements are robust. They include the need for these organisations to enter into agreements with the Australian government that outline financial and educational accountability requirements. The amendment is fundamentally flawed as it refers to authorised payments to non-government bodies while the entire schools assistance act, including section 120, is structured around payments to the states for non-government bodies. Even so, the provision would not add anything to the current position under the schools assistance act because, as identified in sections 7(1)(a) and 7(1)(b) of the act, payments to relevant authorities are already possible.",140
274,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,"Jagajaga) (6.28 pm)We certainly are aware that the government can provide this literacy support directly to schools in either the government or nongovernment sector now-and I made that clear in my remarks. I certainly hope that is the intention of the Minister for Education, Science and Training so that those children who have been waiting years for this literacy support will get it and get it quickly. I think the quickest way of delivering it will be to deliver it through government schools, nongovernment schools or the big nongovernment schools system. If that is what the minister has in mind, that is good and I am very happy to hear it. What we are trying to do through this amendment is not get in the way of that. It will not get in the way of the minister doing that if that is what she thinks is the quickest way to deliver the support. What we are trying to do is make sure that any private organisations that are going to become brokers for this money actually meet the probity rules that apply to other organisations under the act. Plainly, the minister has not accepted the amendment in the way in which it has been proposed. That is very disappointing. All I can say is that I hope she is going to take the opportunity that the act does provide to deliver this money through schools. In that way the money will get to the students very quickly.

Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2006 MEASURES No. 1) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 February, on motion by Mr Dutton: That this bill be now read a second time.",141
276,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"Hunter) (6.40 pm)The Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 1) Bill 2006 is another typically complex tax bill. It contains four schedules that will give members an opportunity to have a freeranging debate in a number of areas of tax administration. The first schedule deals with the tax treatment of foreign income for temporary residents and is driven by Australia's desire to improve our international competitiveness in attracting skilled people to our country-typically, but not exclusively, people in senior management. The second schedule deals with black-hole expenditures. The third provision deals with those schemes so familiar to so many backbenchers, and indeed frontbenchers, in this place-the mass-marketing schemes, which produce so many victims in this country. The fourth deals with the GST and its application to mobile phone products. So there is an opportunity to have a free-ranging debate in a number of areas of taxation administration. I will begin by saying a few things about tax administration in this country, on this the eve of the 10th anniversary of the Howard government. You would have to say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is not a happy anniversary in that regard. We have seen many recent examples of tax administration gone bad in this country, and I will give a couple of examples of that as I begin my contribution to this debate. The first point I want to highlight is the GST which, despite the government's view that it has been a highly successful tax-although I saw the Treasurer on the weekend qualifying that somewhat, very interestingly-and one that has not been the burden on Australian taxpayers that some predicted it would be, is still not without its problems. That point is underlined tonight by the very fact that we are again dealing with a schedule in a bill which again seeks to amend the GST and, to say the same thing, correct the GST as it applies to a particular area of business and the economy. The GST does continue to pose a problem for our community, in particular for the small business community. I am very happy to accept that the government has worked very hard at improving the way in which small businesses remit GST-I think the business activity statement is much better than it was when first introduced-but it does not mean that there are not more opportunities for improvement. It certainly does not mean that that process-that is, the collection of the GST, the paperwork and the remittance of the GST-does not still pose big problems for the small business community. Let us never forget that, basically, while there may be some case for a broad based consumption tax-as an economy we find a greater contribution coming from the services sector-it is inherently regressive. A flat tax on everyone regardless of their ability to pay is inherently a regressive tax, even if it might be an essential one given the nature of our economy. So these burdens on people still remain. And we should not forget the 2,000 small businesses that are being forced to the wall by the Australian Taxation Office as a result of their sometimes very aggressive pursuit of small business taxation debts. I am not suggesting for a moment that we can afford to be any less disciplined in our approach to small business debt. If we were to do that we would not be doing small business any favours at all because that would of course promote a more lazy approach and create a greater temptation for small business to use GST collections as a means of overcoming short-term cash flow problems. Notwithstanding that, the fact remains that many small businesses do find it very tempting to use GST receipts as a means of dealing with short-term cash flow problems. Unfortunately, they sometimes get themselves into trouble by doing so, because another unexpected expense comes along and they find themselves at the end of the quarter unable to meet their GST obligations. We cannot have unqualified sympathy for these people, but we do need to take a reasoned and sensible approach to the collection of these debts. It is much better to have a small business still in operation with a debt to the tax office and receiving the interest on that debt than to have a small business go under and not contribute to the Australian economy and not employ people. This is a real concern for small business, and these concerns have been highlighted by the Inspector-General of Taxation, Mr Vos, in recent times. We cannot continue with this one size fits all approach to small business ATO debts. We have to take a more individual approach to dealing with small business and to working out how we can best get them through those difficult times. The second area I want to go to is the cash economy. I like many today was surprised to learn that the ATO has basically run up the white flag on the cash economy, saying that it is impossible to accurately predict the value of the cash economy and that, therefore, if you cannot do it accurately there is not much point in doing it at all. I beg to difsense fer on that. Ken Henry would tell us that he does not always get his forecasts on the budget right but that he still has to have a go, and it is not a reason not to have a go. Without some sort of forecast we do not have a benchmark against which to begin. I notice that in today's Sydney Morning Herald there was a very good summary of this issue. We can see in that article, as we so often see, estimates that the cash economy might be costing Australian taxpayers some $3.4 billion annually. That is a huge amount of money. It is an area that we simply cannot afford to put aside and accept as being too hard to deal with. I think we have to work much harder at that. In the Australian community all those people doing the right thing do not want to see the tax office declare that it is all too hard, that it is too hard to measure, and therefore we should not be setting ourselves goals. I do not think that is good enough. If you look at areas in the UK and in the US you can see they do things somewhat more enthusiastically. I think that, at a time when we are talking about a review of tax and international benchmarking, we should be making the effort to benchmark ourselves in that area as well. I want to go back to my first point for a moment. We should also be striving to benchmark the tax burden and compliance burden on small business. This is a critical area, and it is important that we do that. We know how the comparative measures between nation states for big corporate tax and individual tax can be difficult. It is also difficult for small business. We do know that in some nations you have differential tax rates for small businesses when compared with their larger counterparts. There are all sorts of initiatives. In Australia we have the entrepreneurial tax offset, which is very tightly targeted at a very small end of town. In a that is a differential tax application in itself. It is an indication that the government is prepared to look at these things, and I think it needs to have a look at that situation as well. The third point I want to raise is the compliance cost burden on individual taxpayers, which is enormously high. I am sure of one thing: the benchmarking study by Mr Warburton and Mr Hendy will show that the compliance cost burden for individuals in this country is much higher than it is certainly in the United Kingdom and much higher than it is in the United States. But we need to again have a good look at small business and what their compliance cost burden is. I note that the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce has recently estimated that small business in Australia devotes about 40 hours a week to compliance measures, and that must be very high by international standards. It is a good time to remind ourselves on this 10-year anniversary of the Howard government that it was in the lead-up to the 1996 election that the now Prime Minister, Mr Howard, promised to cut red tape for small business by 50 per cent. What a farce that turned out to be. That must surely be a commitment that the Prime Minister now regrets. The fourth thing I want to raise is the problem that the tax office is experiencing an administrative sense. There is no doubt that the ATO is under-resourced and that staff are overworked in key compliance areas. The removal of staff from the serious non-compliance unit to Operation Wickenby really highlights some of the pressures that the tax office is under. The recent funding injection for agencies in relation to this eration shows how under-resourced the ATO has been in the area of investigation of major fraud involving overseas tax havens. There have been major inconsistencies in the ATO's enforcement of settlement processes. The most obvious example of that in recent times is the treatment of Mr Rob Gerard in that recent debacle and controversy surrounding his appointment to the Reserve Bank board. We have seen no action taken in a legal sense against Mr Gerard, but we do see many small businesses on a regular basis being forced to the wall. We see many individual taxpayers aggressively pursued by the tax office, and we did not see too much sympathy for those victims of the mass-marketing schemes that I mentioned earlier. So consistency from Tax is very important, but we on this side acknowledge that we will only get consistency when the ATO is properly resourced. As an extension of my attempt to portray the contrast between the treatment of some and the treatment of others, I note again what I think is a ridiculous proposal by the tax office to ring small business people at home at night time and at dinner time pursuing small business debts. There is a time and a place for the collection of those debts and that is during business hours and at the workplace from which people operate their small business. I accept that some people operate their small business from home, but there is a time and a place for contacting those who do not, and I have made this point before. The reality is that most small business in people have a partner, and often the partner at home or working elsewhere is not intricately involved in or aware of the operation of the small business. If a small business operator has a problem with the tax office, they do not deserve to have the tax office ringing them at home and informing their spouse or the partner of the difficulties when opas far as we or the tax office know the partner may not be aware of the difficulty. It might be a difficulty the owner of the small business is very confident of getting through, and unnecessarily their partner is brought into the mix. That is very disappointing and for some families could be very distressing. The fifth thing I want to touch on is the complexity of the Income Tax Assessment Act, now running to about 9,000 pages. Another early commitment from this government was to reduce the complexity of the tax act. It is at least one-third larger than it used to be. About a third of the tax act is now redundant and non-operational. That adds enormously to the complexity of the system. The government needs to go further in repealing both the inoperative provisions and the unnecessary operative provisions in the tax act. The sixth thing I want to mention quickly is legislative fumbling, as I call it. I have been in this portfolio for just over a year now and in that period we have consistently seen errors coming from the government in technical terms as these complex tax bills come forward. In fact, a quick count by my office indicates that the government has found it necessary to repair about 14 tax bills after they have been introduced into this parliament. We are very happy to take the credit for pushing for some of those changes. We have been able to use the Senate committee process very effectively in teasing out the technical errors in these bills and government to correct them in this place. On that basis, I hope the government, despite its majority in the Senate, will not seek to constrain our capacity to use the Senate committee system as an opportunity to further delve into tax bills and to further test their integcant rity, their efficiency and their effectiveness, and therefore restrict our opportunity to push for changes as a result of those findings. The seventh thing I want to talk about is the tax loophole that has come to light as a result of the AWB inquiry. I can foreshadow that during the consideration in detail stage of this bill I intend to move a technical amendment in an attempt to align the Criminal Code in this country with the Income Tax Assessment Act. At the moment, the Criminal Code in this country succinctly defines a facilitation payment by requiring that it be minimal value whereas, unfortunately, the tax act makes no attempt to do so. Theoretically speaking, any ‘facilitation payment' that successfully runs the gauntlet of the Crimes Act will almost certainly pass through the net of the tax act because there no definition in that act. The AWB case was a serious event involving some $300 million. We concede that the $300 million payment was not claimed as a facilitation payment; it is more likely that that payment was claimed as a trucking expense. But we are not dwelling on that in this amendment that I am foreshadowing; we are worried about the future. If we identify a hole in the tax act and put forward suggestions to close that hole, then it is appropriate that the government support us. I will be moving that amendment in the consideration in detail stage and I will be inviting the government to support that amendment. If they are not prepared to support that amendment-because they only support their own ideas-I invite them to come back later with their own amendment and the opposition will forcing the be very happy to support it. On this matter, I have to remind the House that Australia is a signatory to the OECD antibribery convention of 1997, which calls on bribes to be made illegal and therefore not tax deductible. The convention raises significriticisms of so-called facilitation payments. The words used in the convention are that such payments are ‘a corrosive phenomena'. Such payments are effectively small bribes used to smooth the wheels of government. Earlier in the week when speaking on another tax bill I said that from an ethical perspective we probably should not be extending tax deductibility to any facilitation payments, because a facilitation payment is typically a corrupt payment to a corrupt official in another nation state to get something done of that would not ordinarily be done or to get something done more quickly. Ethically speaking, by making these payments all we are doing is perpetuating those corrupt processes in those other nation states. Having said that, we accept that, in an imperfect is world, facilitation payments are necessary for Australian corporations to do business in some of these other countries and we accept therefore that tax deductibility should be extended to them. However, we must define them. We must be true to our obligations under that OECD instrument. Therefore, as a nation and as a parliament we should be striving to do all we can to keep those facilitation payments in check, to keep them small and to confine them to areas that Australians generally would see as acceptable for what needs to be done to carry out business in those overseas nations. I am happy to return to the schedules of the bill. As I have said, there are four of them, and the first one deals with the treatment of foreign earnings for temporary residents. This is designed to make it more attractive for temporary residents to come here to work and to make a contribution to our economy. On that basis, the opposition supports the schedule. Australia currently imposes somewhat tough measures on nonresidents or temporary residents who work in Australia but who have significant foreign sourced income. These provisions have had a negative impact on the sourcing of foreign executives and some skilled professionals like accountants, and of course engineers, which are so important at a time when we are experiencing high growth in the resources sector and the like. Also under the current provisions, a resident who becomes a non-resident triggers a capital gains tax event, and deemed disposal rules apply when and if they leave the country. I think this is fairly draconian, and I am not surprised to see the government removing this provision. Therefore, the opposition is happy to support it. The schedule has three effects. Firstly, it removes the deeming disposal rules for temporary residents for assets without a connection to Australia without the fiveor 10-year rule outlined above. Secondly, foreign sourced income for temporary residents is excluded for income tax indefinitely. On that point I should make it clear for those in the House not fully aware, up until this bill becomes law the exemption for tax on that foreign sourced income only lasts for four years. This bill will extend it indefiin nitely. Thirdly, as a result of the bill, rary residents do not pay tax on interest income received overseas. These measures have the strong support of the business community. Moreover, their implementation will ease the current skills crisis we are facing as a nation. There are also economic benefits associated with reducing impediments to skilled foreign employees taking up positions in Australia. This will, in some measure, boost labour productivity in important sectors. The second schedule relates to black hole expenditures. This is an interesting one. Schedule 2 targets black hole expenditures, which are those which are basically considered legitimate but fall outside the scope of the rules for deductibility. This bill really only extends deductibility for expenses associated with setting up a now defunct or changed entity. This is not a measure about the carrying forward of losses, of course, but about deductibility of expenses for an entity that is not now in existence. The expenses do not meet the carry forward loss provisions, so some tests need to still be met to claim the deduction. What I find very curious about this schedule is that we are told on the quiet that this is about James Hardie and the compensation fund set up to compensate the victims of James Hardie, but there is no reference anywhere in the bill or in the explanatory memorandum that this is designed to help victims of James Hardie. There are a couple of things I will be doing when the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer sums up this bill. The first thing I will be doing is seeking assurances from the minister that this new provision is not loose in integrity terms. We have had a limited opportunity to look at these provisions. We do not want to stand in the way of anything that is required to be done to ensure that that compensation fund is place and available to victims of James tempoHardie but, at the same time, we obviously see that this cannot be restricted to James Hardie. This is going to apply to any corporation, any business entity, that might be looking to make better use of black hole expenditures. We see very little in the EM or the bill that assures us that it has been done tightly and is not going to be open to abuse. That is the first thing we will be asking the government to do: clarify some of the integrity issues for us. If we cannot get some decent answers on this then we might have to consider a Senate committee having a better look. We are not comfortable with letting things go through that could be open to abuse, but, if this is about James Hardie, we do not want to be doing anything to delay the bill. Maybe the minister when he sums up can put our collective minds at rest and give us some assurances that the integrity measures have been looked at closely and that it is not going to be open to abuse. The other thing I would like the minister to do is to clarify whether this is about James Hardie. I think it is fair to say we have had the nudge and the wink, and every indication has been given to us that it is about James Hardie, but we have had no such assurance. I can only wonder if that is because the Treasurer in this place on 28 November 2005 made a great virtue of a commitment that he would not be changing any legislation to ensure that James Hardie is able to claim those compensation payments as a tax deduction. I will just share with the House what he said at the time: The suggestion however that this parliament should pass a new tax law so that the taxpayer picks up some of the obligations of the directors and the shareholders of James Hardie will not be agreed to by the Commonwealth parliament. Passing a special law so that shareholders' tions are picked up by the Australian taxpayer is the equivalent of asking that the taxpayer pay a sum-which would be a much more honest way of doing it-to pick up the obligation of James Hardie's shareholders. It is not the taxpayers' obligation to pick up the obligation of the James Hardie shareholders or their directors. The James Hardie directors ought to accept responsibility for the victims ... This is my theory: the Treasurer has come in here all pumped up and bolshie and made a very unequivocal statement to this place and to the Australian public that he would not be moving to amend the tax law to assist James Hardie in its attempts to secure tax deductability of its compensation payments. Yet we are told on a nudge and a wink that that is exactly what the schedule in this bill is designed to do. So I invite the Minister for Revenue to come clean. We are happy to support it with the relevant assurances on the integrity measures, but come clean: if it is about James Hardie, just say so. It is pretty simple. If the Minister for Revenue does not simply say, ‘Yes, it's about James Hardie,' he will have failed in his obligation to introduce transparency into this process. The third schedule of the bill will be of interest to many members of this place, and that is a move to impose tough penalties on the promoters of mass marketing schemes. Up until now so many of us have had constituents who have fallen victim to mass marketing arrangements and who have received very limited sympathy from the tax office, but the promoters of the tax schemes-people who drew them into these inappropriate schemes-have been getting off scot-free. I want to say this again in here: I know there are a few around this place who do not have sympathy for these people. They generally expect people to be as clever as they are, and they like to rely on the old adage of ‘If it sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true and you should not be obligainvolved in it.' It is just not that simple for many of the people who were targeted by the promoters of these schemes. My electorate is a perfect example of this. It is an electorate where you have early school leavers who have secure, high-paying jobs in the coal mining industry. They were deliberately targeted by the promoters of these schemes. These guys are not financial gurus; they are hard working coalminers. They saw rulings from the Australian Taxation Office, assuring them that these schemes were legitimate under the tax law. They sought assurance on those rulings and they signed up to those schemes. These people are not tax rorters. They are victims of some very corrupt people-people who are prepared to risk blowing the life savings of other people so that they can make a quid. This schedule is about going after the people who have done those terrible things to the many victims of those schemes. I have to say that it will not help the victims, but they might get some sense of comfort from the fact that the government is finally moving to ensure that those people are pursued. The provision is not as tight as we would have liked it to have been. Under this new schedule there is a risk that it could pick up people who are not intended to be picked up-for example, an accountant who says, ‘Yes, I think this is a pretty good scheme; it looks safe for you and you should participate in it,' but they do not constitute a person is actively promoting the scheme. On that basis, the design of the provision has been left more loose than we would have liked it to have been, but we accept that the government is making a fair effort to address the issue. On that basis-certainly from opposition with our limited resources-we are not going to try to push for a harder system. I wish the government success, and I hope it works for the tax office's purposes. The fourth schedule is a technical amendment, which relates to prepaid mobile phone deals and whether the GST should apply to the face value of the phone or whether it should apply to the value of the plan that comes with the phone. I hope I have that right. I understand that it is a very technical amendment. The opposition does not have any difficulty with what the government is proposing there-except to reiterate what I said earlier, and that is that the GST is an evolving creature still. It was introduced in July 2000, and here we are moving on to July 2006. It is not part of the government's 10-year anniversary celebrations, but six years is a significant milestone for the GST. It is simply not true to say that the GST has not imposed a burden on the Australian people. It certainly has imposed a burden, particularly on low-income earners. It has also been an enormous burden on the many millions of small business people who still have the very hefty task of collecting the GST, taking responsibility for it in the interim-between collection and paymentresisting the temptation of using it for shortterm cash flow crises, remitting it to the tax office and facing the prospect of some very hefty penalties in the event that they have been unable to meet those obligations. Many small business people have come to see me about GST debts with the tax office. Some of them have been quite satisfied with who the arrangements that they have been able to establish with the tax office, but some of them have been very disappointed with the unwillingness of the tax office to be more sympathetic to their situation. I want to make one quick point about those who enter into arrangements and then fail again. I know that we cannot relax our discipline on these people, but when they are meeting their obligations under the arrangements that they have entered into, it is pretty harsh on a small businessperson when, as a result of a minor misdemeanour on their next BAS, all the debt is called in. That is pretty tough on small businesses. (Time expired)",141
277,Mr CIOBO,NOES,"I am pleased to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 1) Bill 2006. In particular, I would like to make some remarks following on from the member for Hunter, who spent the first 15 or 20 minutes of debate on this bill talking about every other thing that he could think of besides the substance of the bill at hand. An issue that the member for Hunter touched upon in his concluding remarks also reflected a great deal of the substance of the beginning of his remarks in this debate, and that was the GST and the complexity of the GST. I was a little amused, not at what he had to say but by virtue of the fact that it was the Australian Labor Party who were saying it. What is particularly amusing is that the Australian Labor Party come into this chamber and lecture the government on the complexity of the GST. The Australian Labor Party refused to get behind a broad based, low rate GST tax by blocking it in the Senate. They forced the government to negotiate with the Australian Democrats on a whole range of different exemptions in order to get the kind of structural tax reform through that the government had sought and received a mandate from the Australian people to do. It was the Australian Labor Party who led to this mish-mash of complexity that is the GST that Australia has today. That is not even to begin with the fact that the Australian Labor Party, for a great while under the leadership of the current Leader of the Opposition, consistently spoke about how they would roll back the GST if they won government. Now all those plans have gone out the window. We do not hear the member for Hunter saying anything about roll-back, because the roll-back policy was slightly just left to one side after the last election. No-one talks about it any more. If the member for Hunter were serious about complexity, then he would perhaps explain to the House why it is that the Australian Labor Party sought to be politically opportunistic and forever burden small businesses with compliance costs associated with myriad exemptions that apply under the GST today. If the Labor Party were seriously concerned about the issue of compliance, they would not have done what they did back in 1999-2000. If the Labor Party were seriously concerned about small business and general household compliance with the GST and the costs associated with that compliance, they would not have forced the government to negotiate with the Australian Democrats in order to get the GST structural tax reform through. This government believes in the GST. I also highlight that so did the Australian Labor Party, under the former Treasurer and subsequent Prime Minister Paul Keating, for a great number of years until they needed to differentiate themselves in the Australian political marketplace, so to speak. They suddenly jettisoned that idea and said that they did not support the GST. But they know, as indeed we know, that the GST is the structural tax reform that this country needs. If there is any greater need for proof, Mr Speaker, then simply put your eyes on the Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie, and all of his state and territory Labor mates who rapidly ran up to sign the GST agreement knowing full well it delivers billions of dollars of GST funds to Labor state and territory governments. Despite the rhetoric, the Australian Labor Party have caused the greatest amount of complexity that Australian small businesses have to deal with. The Australian Labor Party have forced a great deal of the complexity that now takes up so many hours of time for small businesses. For example, there is the national franchise of independent businesses, of whom the president is based in my electorate on the Gold Coast and who, incidentally, runs a sandwich shop. This is exactly the kind of small business owneroperator that we are talking about-the kind who is forced to separate the items in his store that have GST levied upon them from those that do not. This is a consequence of the Australian Labor Party. If the Howard government's original proposal had gone through, there would not be any need to undertake such complex actions. Another point I would like to touch upon is the amendment that the member for Hunter foreshadowed-in amendments that he seeks to include in section 50A, subsection 26-52(4). I notice that, as part of the foreshadowed amendment, the member for Hunter has included: (4) An amount is not a bribe to a foreign public official if (a) it is incurred for the sole or dominant purpose of expediting or securing the performance of a routine government action of a minor nature, and (b) the value of the benefit was of a minor nature, and (c) as soon as practicable after the loss or outgoing was incurred, the person made a record of the loss or outgoing and the record complies with section 70.4(3) of the Criminal Code Act 1995. It would simply appear to me that the Australian Labor Party, with this amendment, is seeking to exclude bribes provided they are considered to be of a minor nature. I notice it says nothing about frequency in there. So the question is: is the Australian Labor Party coming before this House and effectively saying that it is okay to bribe foreign officials for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act provided that you make lots of little payments? Is that the point of the Australian Labor Party? Perhaps it is simply through sloppy drafting by the ALP-I am not sure-but there is no reference at all to the frequency of payments, only this notion of ‘a minor nature' and ‘a minor amount'. Of course, that is without definition in the amendment that the member for Hunter is putting forward. (Quorum formed) We start to see the form of the Australian Labor Party. When I highlight that this amendment that they are seeking to introduce is an opportunity for the Australian Labor Party to go soft on bribes, they call a quorum. The Australian Labor Party cannot handle hearing the truth about how this amendment effectively makes the Australian particular, Labor Party soft on bribes. As I said, there is no reference in this amendment to the frequency of payments; it simply says that the payment must be minor. It is incredible that the shadow minister would put forward this kind of drafting and say that he would like the government to support this amendment. It is poorly drafted, and I would suggest respectfully to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer-a good friend of mine-that we not support this amendment. Having made those remarks, I would now like to turn to the focus of the bill that is before the chamber today. The Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 1) Bill 2006 effectively embraces four key principles: changes under schedule 1 to foreign income exemptions for temporary residents; schedule 2, for business related costs, or what are referred to as black hole expenditures; schedule 3, to promoters of tax exploitation schemes; and schedule 4, which is effectively little more than a technical amendment to GST and vouchers dealing with, for example, prepaid phone products. Dealing with the first schedule, it is very clear that Australia must remain globally competitive if we are going to continue to attract the very best that the world has to offer with regard to human capital, or what we might call skilled workers. It is very clear that Australia, like so many countries around the world, is unfortunately a victim of its own success in a number of regards-that success being the fact that our nation, with its high standard of living and high values, has seen a decline in the birthrate over the last several decades, which has resulted in our country having an ageing population. A consequence of this of course is the fact that our labour force is diminishing in relative terms. On that basis, as our country continues to grow-and it has been growing very strongly under the Howard government-it is necessary for our companies and employers to turn their minds to other possible opportunities to employ people from offshore. Historically, it has been the case that, when Australian companies have gone abroad seeking to attract people-and seeking to attract the very best that the world has to offer-to come and live in Australia, despite our wonderful climate and our wonderful standard of living, many choose not to come simply because of how our income tax laws operated previously. Historically, and prior to the introduction of this bill-should it receive assent-it was the case that those foreign workers who came as temporary residents would have offshore income subject to taxation. Schedule 1 of the bill will operate so that it attracts internationally mobile skilled labour to Australia by exempting their foreign investment income from Australian tax, thereby reducing the cost to all tralian business of bringing skilled persons to work in Australia. This measure was introduced twice in 2002 but, unfortunately, it failed to pass the Senate-a consequence, again, of the Australian Labor Party. I welcome the fact that the member for Hunter has indicated that the opposition will be supporting this particular schedule. I understand that it is subject to caveat of further scrutiny in the Senate committee stage. Nonetheless, at least we have progressed further than we did previously. As was announced in the 2005-06 budget, this measure would originally have provided a four-year exemption on most foreign-source income. However, for the purposes of this bill the time limit has now been removed, as the government was of the view that it creates unnecessary disincentives and distortions for individuals wishing to remain working in Australia. In addition, of course, temporary residents will be treated in the same way as nonresidents for the purposes of capital gains tax. This will remove an existing problem with the functioning of the CGT rules for those who are departing residents. This measure also does not disadvantage Australian employees when compared to temporary residents. Employment income and Australiansource income of temporary residents remains taxable. So those who may claim that, as a result of the operation of this bill-and in particular schedule 1-Australian employees will in some way be disadvantaged or in some way, relative to temporary residents, will not be in a situation where they can secure employment are incorrect. The reality is that earnings of Australian residents are taxed in the same way as they are for temporary residents. The second schedule, as I mentioned, deals with black hole expenditures. This particular act provides a new five-year write-off Aus- to business capital expenditures not taken into account and not denied a deduction elsewhere in income tax law. Capital expenditure incurred in relation to a past, present or prospective business will be deductible to the extent that the business is, was or is proposed to be carried on for a taxable purpose. As part of a systematic treatment, more expenses can be included in the cost base and the reduced cost base of capital gains tax assets and the elements of cost for depreciating assets. Additionally, there is a new five-year write-off for lease and licence surrender payments incurred in carrying on or in ceasing a business. Some of these payments were previously not recognised by income tax law. This measure gives effect to the systematic treatment for business black hole expenditures that was announced in the 2005-06 budget. I certainly welcome this change. I notice that the member for Lilley is in the chamber, and I know how pleased he was when I announced previously that I humbly had received an award of being the small business and franchise politician of the year. Mr Swan-You've been eating too many doughnuts!",148
278,Mr CIOBO,NOES,"In that respect-and I see, once again, he is pleased for me-I am pleased to note that this particular change will be for the benefit of small businesses. I look forward to educating the member for Lilley on the needs of small businesses and franchises so that the Australian Labor Party may better reflect their needs in its policy such that those small businesses and franchises will be able to go from strength to strength, as indeed they have done under the Howard government for the past 10 years. The third schedule of the bill details measures to deter the promotion of tax exploitation schemes. This schedule is arguably the most important schedule in this particular bill. Effectively, this measure will deter the promotion of tax avoidance and tax evasion schemes and will protect the integrity of product-ruling systems administered by the Australian Taxation Office. Promoters will now be at risk of civil penalties imposed by the Federal Court in situations where their clients are already at risk of penalties under the tax laws for participation in tax avoidance schemes. The Commissioner for Taxation will be able to seek injunctions and to enter into undertakings with promoters to stop the promotion of unlawful schemes. The question will be asked: in what way is it possible to obtain such an injunction? In order for an injunction or penalty to apply, there are five key elements that will need to be established. Promoters will need to: (1) have marketed the scheme or encouraged growth or interest in it; (2) have received consideration for that conduct; and, (3) have a substantial role with respect to marketing and encouragement. Implementers are only affected if they implement a scheme promoted on the basis of and conforming to a product ruling in a materially different way. A tax exploitation scheme is a scheme to reduce tax whereby, one, it is reasonable to conclude that participants would do so for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining a scheme that has a tax benefit and, two, it is not reasonably arguable that a scheme benefit is available at law. This is important, because there have been many instances in the past where, unwittingly, a number of Australians have fallen for mass marketed tax effective schemes that promoters have put forward. Whilst, arguably, there may be some coverage through the operation of the Trade Practices Act, it is important-and I welcome moves by this government-to very definitively outline that that kind of conduct is unacceptable. I welcome the fact that people will be able to go forward with strength and certainty, knowing that in fact adequate measures are being put in place to help crack down on those promoters who would otherwise give rise to people-unwittingly, perhaps, or even in some cases knowingly-being in breach of the Income Tax Assessment Act and not meeting their tax liabilities. Certainly, it is the case that there are many examples where people have breached the act in the past, and I welcome this measure because often it has been as a consequence of promoters pushing schemes onto them. Although this does not excuse those who seek to evade their liabilities, it certainly should also sheet home to the promoters a requirement to ensure that they do the right thing and not promote schemes that would otherwise be in breach of the act. The final element of the bill deals with prepaid phone products, which is a technical amendment, as I discussed earlier, and I do not intend to with it. To facilitate the House, I commend the bill to the House and conclude my remarks. Debate interrupted. NA",152
279,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Trade Skills Training Visa",153
280,Ms KING,ADJOURNMENT,"This week has seen the Howard government introduce its new trade skills training visa. visa will allow imported unskilled migrants to undertake apprenticeships in regional areas of Australia in trade occupations experiencing skills shortages. The reason the Howard government has had to take such steps is that it has presided over a massive skills sis which is placing huge constraints on the Australian economy. However, this visa is not the answer. The visa will mean that many young Australian will miss out on apprenticeships. What is worse is that overseas apprentices will undercut the conditions of those Australians who do manage to get an apprenticeship. This new apprentice visa is a contractual agreement between the applicant and employer, meaning that the applicant will be beholden to their employer and to the job that they do. An apprentice has to accept the pay, conditions and work offered by the employer. A failure to do so will see them on the first plane home. The former Minister for Education, Science and Training used to devote a great deal of time in this place ranting that Labor was not a supporter of apprenticeships-a claim that could not have been further from the truth-yet here we have the government introducing a measure that totally undermines the apprenticeship and training system in Australia. In my electorate we have a teendeal age unemployment rate for 15to 19-yearolds of around 20 per cent, yet since 1997 the Howard government has increased the skilled migration program by an extra 270,000 skilled migrants and since 1998 has turned 270,000 Australians away from TAFE. That is just not right. If this government was so concerned about providing alternative forms of further education for young Australians other than university, why hasn't it invested in TAFE? Why has it presided over a massive skills shortage in the traditional trades? Why is the government This seeking to allow imported unskilled migrants to undertake apprenticeships in regional areas of Australia in trade occupations experiencing skills shortages? My electorate of Ballarat has already seen first-hand the effects of the current skills cri- shortage. Many people would be familiar with the case of MaxiTRANS, a major employer in my electorate that desperately needed skilled workers. It had won a number of new contracts and needed to fill them straight away. Instead of having access to a pool of trained workers, it had to go overseas to source labour to fulfil its contracts. The government simply had not trained enough Australians to fill these positions. MaxiTRANS tried to meet its skills needs by finding workers locally but claims it was unable to do so. With no credible solution forthcoming from the Howard government, it knew the crisis would continue into the future. MaxiTRANS had also tried to recruit apprentices, but it then put some of these apprentices on hold because it needed skilled workers immediately. It is a damming indictment that it is easier to source skilled labour from overseas than to train Australian kids for these jobs. The reason we do not have enough people trained in the traditional trades is that young people are struggling to get into apprenticeships in the first place. I want to take the example a young person from my electorate, James. James is a bright young man who does not see his future in attending university. He stead desperately wants to gain an apprenticeship as a bricklayer. However, Jamie faces two barriers to fulfilling his ambition. The first is that TAFE is jam-packed and he cannot get a place in a pre-apprentice course for at least eight months. He is one of the 270,000 young Australians who have been turned away from TAFE by this government. The second barrier he faces is that of cost. James, like many young people, does not have access to a lot of money to throw around. Every dollar James has is already accounted for-swallowed up by food, petrol or other costs. Labor's approach stands in stark contrast to finding unskilled labourers overseas who can afford to do an apprenticeship. Labor looks to help young Australians meet the costs of attending TAFE and completing an apprenticeship. While James may be able to cobble together the money to get into TAFE, there is absolutely no guarantee that in eight months he will be able to gain a place at TAFE. This is why the government's decision to allow imported unskilled migrants to undertake apprenticeships in regional Australia in trade occupations experiencing skills shortages is so short-sighted and potentially devastating for so many young people like James in my electorate. Just because a local employer cannot put on an Australian apprentice does mean that there are not young people out there who want one. However, instead of training Australians first and giving them a helping hand, the Howard government has looked overseas for a short-term fix. The government has scrambled to try and justify this new visa by claiming that its trade skills training visa requires the potential employer to demonstrate that there are no local people prepared of to take the job. That is a facade. Nowhere among the 50 questions on the employer's application form does it require them to say inthey have even advertised the job. There are long-term solutions to Australia's skills crisis rather than the patch-up solutions that this government is trying to implement. (Time expired) Braddon Electorate: Road Accident",153
281,Mr BAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I rise to reflect on another tragedy that befell my electorate of Braddon in north-west Tasmania at the weekend. In recent years the Circular Head community has had to deal with too much tragedy. In 2004 a house fire claimed the lives of four children, and a plane crash in March 2003 claimed the lives of three young builders and their pilot. Last Saturday morning, 25 February, the small community of Circular Head lost five young women in a road accident near Burnie, only a few kilometres from my electorate office. Three members of the Smithton Saints under-16 girls basketball team were lost: Claire Tapson, 14 years old; Larissa Heron, 14 years old; Bianca Thorp, 15 years old; their coach, Bianca Gourley, who was 25 years old and three months pregnant; and Sherilea Keating, who was 36 years old and the mother of Larissa Heron. A passenger from another vehicle involved in the accident was critically injured and has been undergoing spinal surgery in Melbourne. What do we say when a tragedy such as this rocks our community? A little over a week ago we learned of the horrific loss of life at Mildura and felt sadness for the victims' families and their community. Never did we think that less than a week later we would have to confront tragedy once again. The communities of Circular Head and Mildura are united in their grief and in trying to come to terms with the sudden loss of so many of their young people. At Smithton on Sunday evening I attended a service for those who died and I was overcome by the expression of grief in the community. There I saw many relatives whom I had played football with, and, as I discovered recently, the principal of the school was a teacher I had taught with some 18 years ago. This is a community that stands together in times of adversity and it is a community that is truly united in its grief. The words of local pastor Trevor Marshall show what we must do when there are no words. Mr Marshall told us: We don't know what to say. So just put your around them and tell them you love them. As a local representative of the community, all I can offer are my condolences and support to the families of those who have lost loved ones. And I offer my support and best wishes to the woman who was injured and to her family. There is no sense to be made of such tragedies; no answers for why so many lives have been lost in a split second. As the days go by we must not succumb to looking for blame but must remain united as a community. This tragedy should highlight to us all both the frailty of life and the strength our communities. We must not take any moment for granted; we must treasure our families and our friends. This is what we must do to truly honour the memory of those who have gone. I want to end by paying tribute to those who were taken from us-to the three budding young basketballers, to their coach, a mother to be, and to a mother. I want to do so in the words of a friend and team-mate of the girls. She said: We just want our friends remembered for how they were. They were all very, very nice people. They cared about people and we miss them very much. Minister for Health and Ageing",154
282,Mr RIPOLL,ADJOURNMENT,"Oxley) (7.38 pm)Yesterday the Australian public saw, in full flight, the ugly face of the Howard government on issues of racism. The Minister for Health and Ageing stood at the dispatch box and exposed himself for what he is-a narrow-minded man with no real sense of what it means to be an Australian. He is not fit to serve in cabinet and the Prime Minister should repudiate him for his disgusting slur on millions of Australians. Not only should the Prime Minister call him into line but also he should be counselled by many of his coalition colleagues. Will the member for Petrie, arms Ms Gambaro, stand up and be counted? What about the member for Kooyong, Mr Petro Georgiou? Will he speak out? Will the member for Ryan, Mr Michael Johnson, have anything to say? What about the member for Indi, Ms Sophie Panopoulos? Will she chime in and set the minister straight? I know she is not backward in coming forward. Tonight, I urge them to stand up and be counted. I urge them to show some leadership and reject what Mr Abbott had to say on race. If they do not, they are guilty of perpetuating the narrow-minded sentiment which has no place of in Australian society and certainly no place in our national parliament. Where are the true Liberals who are prepared to stand up for the true Australian ideals of equity and egalitarianism? I find offensive the notion that if you are not of AngloCeltic origin you are not Australian. It is absurd to suggest, as Mr Abbott did, that anyone from a migrant background is not a real Australian. It is reprehensible for Mr Abbott to claim that Australians of Greek, Spanish, Cambodian and Vietnamese background are not real Australians.",155
283,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The member will refer to the minister by his title.,155
284,Mr RIPOLL,ADJOURNMENT,"There are not two classes of citizens in Australia and, by the way, every voter in the ALP is an Australian citizen. The minister always goes one step too far. And now he has revealed the ugly racist core at the heart of the Howard government. And the Prime Minister sat by and did nothing. We all know why he did-the Prime Minister has form-but tonight I call on other true Liberals to stand up and be counted. This has only one effect. It divides Australia. Australians want and expect true leadership-the sort of leadership that will unite us, not turn us on ourselves. If the ister is not prepared to provide that, or if he is simply incapable of doing so, then he should go. There are not two classes of people in this country. The Labor Party knows and understands that. The denigration and use of people's ethnicity, whether they are in the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or any other party, is a low act. By saying that Greek Australians, Vietnamese Australians, Cambodian Australians and Spanish Australians, because of their membership of the Labor Party, are not real Australians, the minister has insulted all Australians-he has insulted me. I can imagine no greater fear for those such as my family or I who were born overseas than to be taunted by a minister as not being a real Australian. For me this is reminiscent of some days at school where the only power left for a bully was to poke fun at a person's ethnicity, to taunt at difference, diminish and to ridicule not for anything that was done but just for being born in another country or for looking different. I am sure that Australians from other countries that the minister referred to know exactly what I am referring to because they have to live with this every day of their lives-and, while it is not acceptable, it is endured by many and often silently. These Australians from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, some who were born in Australia and others who were born overseas, are as Australian as the members of parliament who were born overseas or who are second, third or fourth generation Australians. But for this behaviour and these comments to be promoted in the people's house by a minister is the real offence. Minister Abbott's comments fuel and excuse the few in the community that believe its okay to speak like this or to act like this and to denigrate people like this. Let us not, whether here in our national parliament or in streets around the country, lose sight of who min- we are. Let us not forget whom we represent and to whom we in this parliament are accountable. The Australian people deserve and expect better. In closing, I want to remind those present, and in particular the Minister for Health and Ageing, of just a few things which the Labor Party holds dear and which you can find in our national platform. The Australian Labor Party refuses to manipulate fear or racism for political gain-the complete opposite in fact of what was done by the minister. Labor seeks to encourage greater dialogue and cooperation between different religious faiths and national ethnic organisations. Labor believes that citizenship is the common bond that unites us all in a mutual commitment to Australia. The minister for health, Mr Abbott, would be well advised to subscribe to these values and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, at the table, would be well to advised to listen very carefully to the words I have said and not think that they are some outrageous comment on what took place. There are many people who did take offence because we know exactly what the minister for health was actually doing. It is a careful political strategy, one that he may cleverly think gains him a few votes in an isolated area in isolated communities, but it was an act perpetrated in the people's house which was uncalled for, unwarranted and very ugly. Minister for Health and Ageing Stirling Electorate",156
285,Mr KEENAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to talk on something that actually matters. When the member for Oxley gets up with this sort of confected outrage about a comment that has been made that somehow reflects the racism on this side of the House, does not do race relations or the ethnic communities, many of whom I represent, any good at all. He expresses mock indignation about a comment that was made as an aside in the parliament about the Labor Party's corrupted preselection processes-which are actually outrageous. The idea that ethnic communities are used in this branch-stacking way is not a good thing for Australian democracy. I think anyone who is reading about the trials and the tribulations of some of the Victorian members of the ALP having to go cap in hand to the various ethnic factional warlords in Victoria would equally be outraged. I represent a very multi-ethnic electorate. They have some real problems and concerns and one of them is not some aside made in the parliament by the Minister for Health and Ageing. Let us get real when we start talking about these things and talk about things that matter to the Australian people. I would like to take this opportunity tonight to highlight a particular ethnic service in my electorate of Stirling and some of the quiet achievers who do not always get the recognition they deserve. One of them is Heather Niss, who was here in Parliament House on Monday night to receive a National Award for Quality Schooling for her work and dedication to students in the local Jewish community in Stirling. Ms Niss is a teacher at Carmel school and she was highly commended in the excellence by a school support staff member category. She was nominated by a very proud principal, Ms Lorraine Day, as well as by Carmel students. Ms Niss was given the opportunity to travel to Canberra to receive her award and also to take some time to visit places around the nation's capital. Ms Niss is not alone in her dedication to the residents that I represent in Stirling. Staff it and volunteers at the local Chung Wah Community Centre in Balcatta have received some funding from the federal government's National Respite for Carers Program. They are working very hard to ensure that ethnic Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai residents in my electorate of Stirling, and also in the wider metropolitan area, get access to some respite care. As many people will knowand it is something I have become aware of since becoming a member of parliamentone of the biggest challenges for carers is being able to find some respite. Caring for a loved one is a 24 hours a day, seven days a week occupation. It is difficult for carers to find any respite from their extensive duties. Finding someone whom they feel they can trust their relative with and who will provide a safe and warm environment for them is exactly what the Chung Wah Association is going to do with the grant that is being provided by the federal government. I would like to congratulate them and to thank the volunteers at the Chung Wah Association who are really making an effort to make the lives of some of the elders in their community better. Some of the businesses in Stirling have also received some good news lately. Structural Monitoring Systems, based in Osborne Park, has received $2.9 million, one of the largest ever Commercial Ready grants that has been awarded to a Western Australian company. The grant will go towards helping them to commercialise a structural monitoring system that works particularly well for the aviation industry. Boeing and Airbus have taken a particular interest. I am extraordinarily pleased that a small business at Osborne Park in my electorate can operate on such a global scale thanks to the $2.9 million grant from the federal government. Finally, I want to touch on the Stirling Business Association, which is the largest business association in Western Australia. It has been operating for more than 30 years and has enjoyed great success. The Stirling Business Association, along with the City of Stirling, prepared a submission seeking a grant from the Regulation Reduction Incentive Fund. I was pleased to announce that they received $187,000 to streamline their processes and to deliver improvements to small businesses in my electorate when they interact with their local council. Mr Speaker, as you are well aware, it is 10 years since the election of the Howard government, and I am very pleased to have highlighted a few examples of how its responsible management is making the lives of my constituents better. (Time expired) Parliamentary Reform",157
286,Dr LAWRENCE,ADJOURNMENT,"As the previous speaker, the member for Stirling, indicated, we are approaching the 10th anniversary of the Howard government. I add that it has been 20 years since I first became a parliamentarian, starting in Western Australia, and I thought it was time to reflect briefly on this institution, the liament, and the way it is run. Parliaments are the most visible symbols of our democracy, where theoretically decisions are made by the elected representatives of the people, but domination by the executive remains a hallmark of Australian politics and, despite what the Prime Minister has been saying lately, parliament is often sidelined from key decisions. I think it is long overdue for substantial reform to enable it to take greater responsibility for its own affairs and to act more independently of the government of the day. Our current system is increasingly based on the rubber-stamp model of governmentwhat some people have called an elected autocracy-where the government determines all the policy without much reference to the parliament. In this scenario, MPs are here for no other purpose than to register the choice of voters. We might ask: why have a parliament at all when it would appear there is so little justification for all the effort and expense entailed? It is interesting that at the same time as MPs lecture the community about the need for greater flexibility and efficiency we participate in one of the most rigid and inefficient institutions in the country. Indeed, the same politicians who advocate flexibility and reform in other workplaces cling to conventions and practices which always had design flaws and which have ossified into caricatures of themselves. I make a number of suggestions today for a modest start to reforming our parliament: establishing a House of Representatives modernisation committee to look at the practices and procedures of the House to make us more up to date and more open and engaged with the public; installing an independent Speaker; establishing a cross-party parliamentary commission responsible for staffing and appropriations; establishing a House of parRepresentatives business committee with cross-party representation to determine the business of the House, regularly endorsed by the parliamentarians; introducing electronic voting; having parties introduce three-linewhip procedures to give members more discretion in voting; better displaying of the activities of the House, including electronic bulletin boards of current activities-for instance, which bill is being debated, who is speaking, what motions or amendments et cetera are being debated; and, very importantly, reforming the standing orders to improve question time. Question time, I need not tell you, Mr Speaker, is a notorious source of disaffection for anyone but the most ardent political insiders. It is often mentioned by voters as one of the most irritating of parliamentary procedures with its aggressive and insulting language, accusations instead of questions, replies that contain no information and evade the question, and gratuitous attacks on political opponents, all in the atmosphere of an unruly locker room complete with a sin bin. The occasionally raucous and frequently rude behaviour of MPs leaves most peopleand many MPs-cold. It is not even very good theatre-B-class at best. It is difficult not to agree with Coghill's assertion that ‘the rules for question time are so ridiculous it is no surprise that they ate the type of behaviour we see on the nightly news', and I endorse his contention that it has ‘degenerated almost to a farce'. As a result, question time rarely functions as it was intended: as a means of ensuring accountability of the executive, exposing abuses of power and corruption, and challenging the arbitrary exercise of power by the government. These are serious matters and they are not to be joked about. The standing orders and, perhaps more importantly, the approach of the government do not require that responses be particularly relevant to the question let alone provide an answer. While people complain, there has been little real appetite for reform either from MPs themselves or from those in the media gallery who are forced to witness the charade. I believe it is time to reform the standing orders to improve question time. I have a few suggestions: dorothy dix questions should not be permitted at all; the majority of questions should be allocated to the opposition; ministerial statements should be used to outline government policies; time limits should be applied to both questions and answers; supplementary questions should be allowed; standing orders should be amended to require that questions be answered; the House could adopt a ‘take note' procedure similar to that of the Senate, allowing follow up; and questions should be asked directly to the responsible minister, not through the chair. I could make a number of other suggestions, particularly around the question of debating and the role of committees. In recent months, I have put forward the democratic project, which calls for major reform of this parliament. I think it is a scandal that we do not look at our own performance in this place. It is a scandal that members are apparently content to sit by while they are sidelined from the most important decisions this genernation makes and are not in a position to hold the government accountable. I think it is time we had a democratic project which reforms this parliament. After 100 years, I think it is well overdue. Bonner Electorate: Sporting Shooters Association of Australia",158
287,Mr VASTA,ADJOURNMENT,"I have the great honour of being the patron of many community organisations in the electorate of Bonner and, in particular, I feel privileged to be the patron of the Brisbane branch of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia. Established in 1948, the association is the premier body representing licensed firearm owners in Australia, with over 120,000 members. The organisation continues to effectively promote the shooting sports and protect the interests of firearm owners. The local Brisbane club at Belmont has provided great support, and I remain extremely impressed with the way in which the club is operated. I make special note of the former club president and current secretary, Mr Don Ruwoldt, who has shown exceptional leadership and commitment to the club. Former secretary Kay Hutchinson has also been a great asset to the club, and I commend her for all her effort and work. Since its inception, the club has unfortunately never had a sealed car park. Whilst it hosts many world championships and facilitates training for many law enforcement officers, the club can never attain ‘world-class' status while it has a gravel parked in the area are subject to dust and loose rocks, in addition to the lack of clearly marked parking spaces. This issue has caused frustration among members and visitors for some time now and it is an issue that the club is desperate to address. As a not-for-profit organisation, the club has extremely limited funds, so a complete refurbishment of the car park is not financially feasible. In response to this, the very recently elected Councillor Adrian Schrinner of Brisbane City Council, the new state member for Chatsworth, Mr Michael Caltabiano, and I have set about trying to rectify this problem. We are writing not only to club members but to members of the wider community, requesting their assistance through donations of bitumen, concrete or drainage, or landscaping skills or any other skills that could help to refurbish the car park. Queensland Gun Exchange and Leopold Australia have donated two superb rifle scopes. We will assist in advertising a raffle of the scopes, with tickets selling for $10 each and all the proceeds going to the renovation of the car park. This is not the first project on which local council, state and federal members have united and worked together for a community organisation. In fact, many constituents have commented on how refreshing it is to see politicians not arguing but getting on with the job. I thank my local and state colleagues and I look forward to working with them to deliver a successful outcome for the club. Question agreed to.
