1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 2.00 p.m., and read prayers. NA Unemployment",13
2,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the increase revealed this morning of 10,500 in the number of long term unemployed, the fourth month in the row that the number has risen and an increase of 18 per cent since May? Is the Prime Minister aware that this rise follows 32 consecutive months of falls in the number of long-term unemployed? Will the government now review its budget cuts to labour market programs, including skillshare, so as to give some hope to the battlers and the unemployed?",13
3,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first question is yes. The answer to the second question is that I will accept the honourable member's statistical analysis, unless it is demonstrated to me that he is wrong. I do not think he deliberately sets out to mislead the parliament. He has some very misguided views, but I do not think he sets out to erately mislead the parliament. So far as causation is concerned, I would have thought that your former job did more to push unemployment up in this country than anything else. Inflation",13
4,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. What steps has the government taken to lock in low inflation? What evidence is there that these policies have started to take effect?,13
5,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. This government is determined to lock in a low inflation growth economy in Australia. With regard to our you said: commitment to inflation, with the appointment of a new Governor of the Reserve Bank, this government agreed on a monetary policy Tourism which set out an objective agreed between ties of Bligh. both the government and the Governor of the Reserve Bank, made it clear that monetary policy would be conducted with transparency and made it entirely clear that it would be done on an independent basis. Expectations for inflation in 1996 have fallen dramatically since the beginning of the year. The government expects underlying inflation to ease to 2% per cent in 1996-97 and headline inflation is expected at two per cent in 1996-97. Low and stable inflation will encourage investment and improve the productive capacity of the Australian economy. In relation to the inflation outlook, it is sensitive to wage developments. In relation to wage developments, it will be incumbent on both employers and employees to make sure that wage developments are kept within the band recommended by the Reserve Bank. I can report that financial market confidence about low inflation has been reflected in a reduction in the 1O-year bond yield as against the differential with the US 1O-year bond. At the end of June 1996 the yield on 1O-year bonds. in Australia was 8.8 per cent, about 168 basis points above the US equivalent bond. This morning the yield on Australian bonds was 7.52 per cent and less than 100 basis points above that of the USA. It is clear that the government's monetary delibpolicy has given the government and the economy credibility in relation to interest rates. It is clear that the premium which had been built into the Australian bond rate as a result of a perception that Australia was a high inflation economy has now been taken out. These are indications that the government's policy is fully understood and is working, and they indicate a very positive investment climate for Australian business. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism",13
6,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Yesterday, Minister, in a press statement To the best of my knowledge no matter has come before me as Minister for Industry, Science and which is in any way related to the activiI ask the minister: has he now checked all of his records to ensure that none of his decisions has in any way related to the activities of Bligh? Does he stand by his statement of yesterday?",13
7,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'I thank the honourable member for his question. I welcome this opportunity to explain to the House the operations of Bligh Ventures Ltd. Bligh Ventures is a publicly listed company in which I have had a minority shareholding for many years. It operates as a venture capital investor. It invests as a minority shareholder in other companies. It does not itself manufacture anything, grow anything or develop anything. It operates in a way similar to a superannuation fund, a unit trust or any other capital investor. It receives no money from the government nor, to the best of my knowledge, has it ever been eligible for any allowance or concession such as research and development grants from the government. As a shareholder, I receive a copy of the annual report of the company. The last annual report I have received is for the financial year Prospect! to 30 June 1995. What transactions occurred within a financial year-what acquisitions or divestments the company makes within that financial year-are completely unknown to me until I receive the annual report.",14
8,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,All the more reason to divest.,14
9,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Orderl Mr Costello-Oh, yes! What do you declare in relation to your wife? Mr Martin Ferguson-A mortgage.",14
10,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Batman and the Treasurer!,14
11,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Even then, Mr Speaker, the annual report does not necessarily record details of transactions which occur totally within that 12-month period. The company may make an investment, then sell that investment without shareholders being aware of the details. As a shareholder, I am in no way involved in the day-today operations of the company. Between annual reports, I have no knowledge of the decisions of the management of the company. I am in no position to know whether the company still retains the interests listed in the Â·1995 annual report. I take no part whatever in the operations or management of Bligh Ventures. I am not and never have been a director. I have no operating interest or control within that company. Nevertheless, following my appointment to cabinet earlier this year, I decided to take steps to divest myself of shareholdings. I did so, even though the guidelines in the ministerial responsibility clearly states: Ministers are not precluded from making investments in the stock markets or other financial or other trading markets. I instructed my broker to sell my shares in Bligh Ventures on 28 May. They have been on sale since that time: 5,000 have so far been sold. The turnover of the stock last month was 15,000 and I am not the only seller. The stock remains for sale. Mr Crean-Why? Until you get the right price? Mrs Crosio-Why not dispose of them now?",14
12,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Orderl The member for,14
13,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is now a backbencher in Victoria to whom you could sell your shares.,14
14,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, I am quite sure, Daryl, that you could raise a few bob.",14
15,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! These are serious questions which are being addressed seriously.,14
16,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And more to the point, Mr Speaker, he would not be the only one on the Labor Party front-bench who could do that. My interest in Bligh has always been included in my declaration of members' interests. It has always been clearly on the public record. In addition, it was included in the ministerial return that I submitted to the Prime Minister after the election. The shares have been publicly declared. They are for sale. No matter of which I am aware has come before me as Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism which in any way relates to the activities of Bligh Ventures. I am not in a position to know the current trading activities of Bligh Ventures. To the best of my knowledge, Bligh Ventures is not involved in any research and development which would have involved a conflict of interest with me as a minister. I have publicly disclosed my shareholdings. I have made endeavours to divest myself of the stock. I have clearly, in all respects, complied with the guidelines on ministerial responsibility. I might just add to that. Some people in opposition have peddled a few stories around this morning, some of which come under the clear heading of 'Labor lies'. There are people in this House who subscribe to superannuation companies, who invest in a wide variety of corporations. Everybody will have to rip outside and ring up the AMP and ask them what they have invested in today to make a decision. For all of those who happen to own life insurance policies, the same applies. If you happen to own a unit trust and that unit trust owned a building in Canberra in which your department held space, on rent, you would have to inquire about that. What a ridiculous stance has been taken by the opposition in relation to these matters. There is no conflict of interest. Mr Tanner-They are your guidelines.",14
17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Melbourne!,15
18,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is a very clear desire by me to invest properly in Australia not in mug sport and some such things that you guys have been promoting. Howard Government,15
19,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Do the Prime Minister's guidelines on ministerial conduct also apply to parliamentary secretaries?,15
20,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the question asked by the honourable member for Hughes is yes, and it is for that reason that I inform the House that this morning I accepted the resignation of Senator Brian Gibson as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. Mr Lee-Why didn't you ask for it?",15
21,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Orderl The member for Dobell!,15
22,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not, I might say, in relation to the ownership of shares in a bank which has been the subject of comment by members of the opposition and canvassed in the media. The decision of Senator Gibson to tender his resignation was taken following the discovery by Senator Gibson's staff on 14 October of a document which suggested that he had breached the guidelines on ministerial responsibility by taking a decision in June the 1996 to include Boral Energy (Victoria) Pty Ltd in the Victorian electricity exempt futures market declaration. Senator Gibson at the time that decision was taken held shares in a related company, Boral Ltd. It could, therefore, be perceived-despite, for reasons that I will explain in a moment on the purely mechanical nature of the decision-that he had a conflict of interest in making that decision. The Corporations Law provides that the minister may declare a specified futures market to be an exempt futures market subject to conditions. Exempt futures market status exempts participants from some of the requirements of the futures industries provisions of the Corporations Law. Boral Energy (Victoria) applied for inclusion in the Victorian electricity exempt futures market. The Treasury, in a minute dated 25 June 1996, stated that the Australian Securities Commission recommended that the declaration be made subject to conditions including a time limit of 30 June 1997. The Treasury agreed with the commission's recommendations and also recommended that the declaration be made. The minute also stated that trading was intended to commence on 1 July 1996. Consequent upon that advice, the parliamentary secretary clearly was in order in approving the application. Senator Gibson has informed me that, at the time of making the declaration, he failed to take account of the shares that he jointly held with his wife in Boral Ltd. The decision that he made was in accordance with recommendations made to him by both the Australian Securities Commission and the Treasury. At no stage did Senator Gibson knowingly seek to advance his own interests by making the declaration and there is no evidence that he has been in any way personally enriched or advantaged by the decision. But, as he has pointed out in his own statement, it did involve the perception of a conflict of interest, and a proper application of the guidelines means that he has been obliged to tender his resignation. I regret that fact but, having considered all the circumstances of the matter which were put to me yesterday and in his resignation delivered to me last night, I considered the matter again this morning and felt that I had no alternative but to accept his resignation. I take the opportunity of saying to the House that these events of the past few days are regrettable. I wish to say that the guidelines, which were effectively consolidated by the new government when it came to power, are guidelines that have now been in operation for a long period of time. I believe that there ought to be guidelines and I do not believe .that those guidelines should be watered down in any way. I do, however, believe that the events have spotlighted what is, I think, one of the gaps in the comprehensiveness of the guidelines, that is, the greater difficulties that are faced by people who enter politics, who go onto the front bench and who have substantial assets other than in real estate. I think it is fair to say that, under the guidelines that have operated on both sides of politics, it has never been a matter of much comment for a person, for example, to own a block of flats, negatively gear it and receive very significant rents. Yet whenever somebody has owned a portfolio of shares, that has been a matter for fierce criticism. Mr Crean-Where they have a conflict of interest.",15
23,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Some people would argue that you have a conflict of interest if you the tax laws on negative gearing. And you altered the tax laws on negative gearing. Mr Crean-Oh, come on!",16
24,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am not arguingMr O'Connor-You couldn't even enforce your own standards.,16
25,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Corio! Think about your own standards.,16
26,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not argue that the rules in relation to real estate and the rules relation to other things should necessarily be altered. What I do believe is that the change in the structure of share ownership, the impact of financial deregulation, the widespread privatisation of large government corporations and the spread of ownership to many hundreds of thousands of Australians call for an examination in this country, which I intend to conduct, of whether we ought not to introduce arrangements for ministers, parliamentary secretaries and also, I believe, leaders of other political parties, who, because of the finely balanced numbers in this parliament, have as much capacity to inflict financial change as, indeed, do decisions of the government. What I have in mind is that we might have an examination of the introduction into this country of the notion",16
27,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Your guidelines lasted only until the first people were caught.,16
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Denison will be caught. Mr Gareth Evans interjecting,16
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not helping matters. Order! Mr Crean-Go on. Mr Gareth Evans-You are so sensitive.,16
30,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I am not. I am very comfortable and relaxed. Mr Martin Ferguson-Are you comfortable and relaxed, John? Mr Moore-Yes, of course.",16
31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We are addressing issues of serious import. The demeanour of the members on my left does them no credit. Mr Ted Grace-What about those on the alter right of you? They do not have any credit either.,16
32,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Werriwa is warned. Mr Latham-I did not say anything.,16
33,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the Prime Minister.,16
34,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is therefore my intention to examine the feasibility of introducing into the arrangements that apply in this country what is categorised in other jurisdictions as the notion of a blind trust whereby in people who do have substantial holdings of shares, or substantial assets other than in real estate, might have the opportunity to put themselves at arm's length from the control of those assets while at the same time having the opportunity of participating in ministerial life. I think it would be a very detrimental circumstance for the interests of this country if we were to create a situation where people were literally intimidated out of seeking election to office simply because they held substantial assets other than in real estate. I do not think any fair-minded person can argue that the present rules do not in fact disadvantage people in that category. I think they do and I think we ought to examine whether or not there is a desirability of examining the introduction into the Australian system of that approach. That in no way, of course, alters the decisions that have been taken in relation to either Senator Short or Senator Gibson. NA",16
35,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"We have in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Neil Turner, Speaker of the Queensland parliament, and the Hon. Billy Hilly, who is a former distinguished Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands. I wish you both a very warm welcome. I hope you enjoy your stay here with us in Canberra. NA Howard Government",17
36,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker: it seems that on these questions of interest we have gone from the most advanced interests declaration that we have ever had in this country through to a consolidated version of the previous government's and now to unworkability. It is pretty unsatisfactory. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism",17
37,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer the minister to his previous answer and to his portfolio responsibility for the computer bounty. Isn't it true, Minister, that three of related companies-all of them listed in the annual report of Bligh Ventures-in which Bligh Ventures has a substantial holding are in receipt of computer bounty funding; that is, RSM Research, which received $24,000 in the last financial year; ELPRO Technologies, which received $36,900; and Jtec, which received-wait for it-$l.1 million? Isn't it true, Minister, that of the five bounties axed in the budget only the computer bounty was continued beyond budget night until June 1997? Why did the computer bounty get such special treatment? Minister, how can you say it is a decision that does not in any way relate to the activities of Bligh Ventures?",17
38,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hotham continues to try to mislead the public of Australia and the House. It is the usual nonsense that comes out from the Labor Party in relation to all these things. I said in the answer before that Bligh Ventures is a venture capital company that invests in other companies. It itself has no influence whatsoever over the course of those other companies. As a consequence of that, it is not responsible in any way for the type of investment that you are referring to. So once again you are telling fibs. Mr Crean-I seek leave to table the annual report of Bligh Ventures Ltd, which clearly lists the companies that I have referred to. Leave not granted. Mr Crean-Why won't you allow it to be tabled? What have you got to hide?",17
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Resume your seat. Immigration,17
40,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister confirm media reports that he has received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition proposing a bipartisan motion to the parliament on Australia's immigration policy? What is the Prime Minister's response to this proposal?,17
41,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is true that I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition informing me of a notice of motion he has put down which canvasses the matters relating to immigration, Aboriginal affairs and a number of other issues. I say to the honourable gentleman and to the House that it is my view and the view of the government that, if there is a genuine desire on the part of people across both sides of politics in this country to have passed through the parliament a motion dealing with particular matters and thus expressing a bipartisan point of view, then the most productive way of achieving that would, in the first instance, not be the presentation of a motion which then becomes a benchmark in relation to the issue but would rather be the appointment of people at the nomination of the leaders of the respective parties or perhaps they themselves are willing to undertake it-I am happy either way-to negotiate the terms of a motion. I will be quite happy to participate. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that the best way of doing this would be for him to withdraw his motion, for him to nominate somebody to deal with the government and I will nominate somebody to deal with that person and we will see if we cannot reach agreement on what might be Mr Melharn-Do it yourselves.",17
42,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will decide whom it is. I will not decide who your bloke is and you will not decide who my bloke is. Mr Lee--What about a woman?,18
43,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Or my female representative, either. I have not decided whom it might be. I believe that, in relation to quite a lot of the matters that are contained in the motion put by the Leader of the Opposition, there is common ground between the coalition and the opposition. To the extent that that common ground exists, I am very happy for it to be given public expression. There are some other areas in his motion that I could not give even general assent to, let alone detailed assent But I think we can probably find some common ground. If we can, I do not think it would do this parliament any harm to have a motion moved by me, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition, on these matters. I would be quite happy to have a talk to the Leader of the Opposition at some convenient time after hostilities have ceased at question time to see whether we cannot work out an arrangement. That is the best way of doing it. The Leader . of the Opposition should withdraw his motion and we will see if we can reach agreement on the substance of a motion. The only other suggestion is, in order to refurbish your credentials, why don't you cancel that sleazy deal with the AAFI in Lindsay?",18
44,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
45,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker: an invitation was issued to me by the Prime Minister on that matter. I will ignore the inaccurate coda that he put at the conclusion of it because it is inaccurate and was against the spirit of what else he had to say in his answer, which I will respond to. I will now formally withdraw that notice of motion of mine and conduct negotiations with him on the basis he suggests. Mr Costello-Why don't you withdraw the deal?",18
46,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no deal to withdraw.,18
47,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,18
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! All of the points have been amplified. There is general agreement between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. All the other issues will be taken up outside of the province of this chamber. Mr Lee--What part of the motion do you dispute?,18
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Dobell is warned. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism",18
50,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and to. Tourism. I refer the minister to his description of the decision to remove tariff concessions on business inputs as a dreadful decision. Isn't it the case that you, Minister, have responsibility for the Customs Tariff Act and that you played a leading role in the government decision to restore the tariff concessions? Wouldn't that decision have had a significant impact on the Bligh stable of related companies, where they import machinery and components for manufacture? In those circumstances, how can you say it is a decision that does not in any way relate to the activities of Bligh Ventures? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I submit that question is out of order because it clearly asks for an opinion from the minister, and the standing orders should be applied.",18
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is out of order.,19
52,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting-Why? Why?,19
53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Orderl Mr Crean-Why? This is a disgrace.,19
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The question is out of order. I call the honourable member for Wakefield. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Haven't you got a reason, Mr Speaker?",19
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hotham. Mr Crean-But I have a point of order!,19
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will hear it in a moment. I have already called the member for Wakefield. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under the standing orders, all points of order must be disposed of before any other business. I suggest that",19
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I had already called the member for Wakefield. Mr Martin-The honourable member for Hotham rose to his feet, calling for a point of order.",19
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will sit the member for Wakefield down as I address the chamber. I need no precipitate or patronising advice from a former Speaker. Resume your seatl Resume your seatl Resume your seat! I warn the member for Cunningham. I name the member for Cunningham.

62,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,The issue has been resolved. I have made my ruling. Resume your seat. Mr Crean-So I do not get an answer for that?,20

64,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Bruce! Trade Unions,20
65,Mr ANDREW,NOES,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. What is the minister's position on the provision of government funding to trade unions? Does the government's position match that of the previous Labor administration? Mr Griffin-Union bashing again. Here we go.,20
66,Mr REITH,NOES,"The coalition parties have been concerned for a long time about the PAIRS inherent conflict of interest between the ALP and their trade union supporters. The Institute of Public Affairs calculated that up to the end of 1993-94 direct grants from the Labor government to the trade unions totalled $92 million. In addition, tax exemptions on union contributions and property meant that in the last years of Labor the taxpayer was underwriting unions to the tune of $130 million a year. A lot of that money went out of the taxpayers' pocket to the government and straight back to the ALP. So, if you take the year 1992-93, the Miscoes union got a grant of $575,000, of which $254,000 went as a donation back to the ALP.",20
67,Mr MELHAM,NOES,Tell us about the NAB.,20
68,Mr REITH,NOES,"The CEPU got $100,000 and $140,000 went to the ALP. The CFMEU, $1.163 million and $314,000 back to the ALP. The AMWU, $1.253 million and $306,000 back to the ALP.",20

72,Mr REITH,NOES,"The National Union of Workers, $1.219 million of taxpayers' money and what do we find? A donation, a grant, to the ALP of $266,000. So it goes on and on and on. In fact, altogether in 1992-93 by this restricted measure alone, the Labor government granted $5.6 million for 18 union bodies, $2.2 million of which came straight back through the revolving door to the ALP and all at a cost to the average Australian taxpayer. What did the Labor government get for its, or rather the taxpayers', generosity? It got plenty in return. The Labor government's largess underpinned its political alliance with the unions. Mr Tanner-How much did you get from the banks?",20
73,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Melbourne!,21
74,Mr REITH,NOES,"The influence of the unions in Labor's preselection ballots means that the direct beneficiaries of this rort continue to opposite in this very chamber today. If you look at what the unions got for their money, they got plenty. Do not worry, they look after themselves. They got a closed shop on the waterfront to look after the rorts on the waterfront at the expense of average Australian workers. They got their very own shipping line to do with what they wanted. They got their own foreign aid policy. They got a seat in cabinet. Not only did they get all that, but they also got a seat in the Reserve Bank, the Council for the Order of Australia, the Administrative Review Council, Telstra, the ABC, the Australia Council, the Defence Industry Committee, the Australian National Training Authority, the Australian Career Foundation, the Trade Policy Advisory Committee, the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Murray-Darling Community Advisory Council, and so on and on it goes.

94,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. refer the minister to his portfolio responsibility for the diesel fuel rebate legislation. Minister, has Bligh Ventures or any of the related companies in which it has substantial shareholdings made a claim under this rebate? the member What are the details?",22
95,Mr MOORE,NOES,"After the response from the Minister for Industrial Relations, I am not surprised that the former president of the did not ask the question. He is too ashamed. So he deflected it down here to the gentleman who talks about giving business the big Labor stick. As a consequence of that, I just want to point out a couple of relevant facts which apparently have been overlooked. Just to extend the way in which the Labor Party does not understand commercial use in nation, they have no understanding of company law and they keep on saying these extravagant views. But it does know, when they go and make promises to the employees of the Commonwealth Bank and the union of for the Commonwealth Bank gives them $300,000 not to privatise the Commonwealth Bank and they tum around and three months later privatise it, what it thinks of you. Can I just add one small thing that totally validates what I said in my answer to the first question that if you are a shareholder you do not have anything to do with the day-today management of the company. I quote here no lesser authority than former Senator Gareth The Evans who, in defending the then Prime Minister Keating in his piggery pokery, said that the Prime Minister was a shareholder in the company and had no involvement in the the day-today management of it. Taiwan",22
96,Mr FORREST,NOES,My question is addressed the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Can the minister confirm that Australia has concluded bilateral market access negotiations with Taiwan? What gains were achieved for Australia? What does this success tell us about the government's approach to trade policy?,22
97,Mr TIM FISCHER,NOES,"I thank the member for Mallee for his question. This answer will demonstrate the government is getting on with the task of boosting our export market access, and doing that both in the multilateral context as well as the bilateral context. I confirm that, in liaison with Minister Anderson, it was agreed to conclude a bilateral market access package with the APEC member economy of Taiwan within the broader context of negotiations on Taiwan's application to accede to the WTO. The key elements of this package begin next year as well as at the point of accession. From next year, the Australian passenger motor vehicle industry will gain access for the first time ever for 2,000 cars to go from Australia to Taiwan, increasing to 6,000 cars when Taiwan joins the WTO on the date of accession and thereafter growing by 10 per cent a year. This will underwrite the future of our automotive export industry in this market. On the critical matter of beef, which is going through a very difficult time, as Minister Anderson and others have pointed out, there has been a 40 per cent cut in the discrimination faced by Australian beef exporters to Taiwan, with a reduction of the actual tariff by 10 per cent, and this is to phase out completely when Taiwan joins the WTO. There has been a doubling of our apple quota to 2,400 tonnes. There is to be a new citrus quota of some 600 tonnes, which I know is of particular interest to the member for Wakefield, the member for Mallee, the member for Riverina and others. There is a new quota of some 1,000 tonnes which can be used to export either plums or peaches. This interim package, which comes in immediately in the course of calendar year 1997, is worth some $30 million. When Taiwan joins the WTO after satisfying all the necessary conditions, there will be further progressive liberalisation, and that will cover some 800 tariff lines and will be worth a great deal of extra market access for Australian exporters. I highlight to the House that it will cover products as diverse as dairy products, sheep meats, seafood, fibreboard, aluminium products as well as rice. So we see another Asian country opening up for the first time ever its rice markets for imports from Australia, and I welcome that. I might add that Taiwan will also provide commitments not to reverse liberalisation in the future. This will help provide security for Australian exporters, including those which currently do not face tariffs such as mineral ores, coal, hides and skins, wool and cotton. This is a substantial breakthrough. It represents the continuing activation of the coalition trade policy on a bilateral, regional and multilateral basis. It is one which will help Australia get on the front foot and it demonstrates that the federal government is not unduly distracted by the shenanigans being put forward by this opposition. Minister for Industry, Science and Technology",23
98,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Yesterday the Prime Minister said that it was not appropriate for a minister to hold onto his shares until they reached a reserve price set by the minister. He later clarified the point, saying he did not expect the minister to sell if it involved a significant loss. In deciding on the future of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, did the Prime Minister ascertain the price at which the minister purchased the shares in Bligh Ventures and did he ascertain the reserve price he has set on the sale of his shares?",23
99,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"I have had no occasion to decide upon the future of the industry minister because, in my view, he has not been in breach of the guidelines. Trans-Tasman Shipping",23
100,Mr ANDREWS,NOES,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Can the minister inform the House whether media reports that the 'illegal' trans-Tasman maritime union accord has effectively been ended are correct; and, if so, what does this mean for users of transTasman shipping?",23
101,Mr SHARP,NOES,I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question.,24
102,Mr MELHAM,NOES,They can walk on water.,24
103,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Banks!,24
104,Mr SHARP,NOES,"I am very pleased to be able to announce that there has been a major breakthrough, an historic breakthrough, in the maritime sector and that breakthrough, that change, will substantially benefit consumers and exporters. The nature of the benefit, as outlined by the honourable member for Menzies, is in the ending of the illegal accord between the maritime unions here in Australia and the maritime unions in New Zealand that effectively banned the carriage of goods by sea between Australia and New Zealand in ships other than those manned and owned by Australian or New Zealand companies. So this ban, imposed illegally by the unions, has added something like 25 to 30 per cent to the cost of carrying goods between Australia and New Zealand, if you compare prevailing rates around the world for similar service. Mr Adams-Where do we compare it with?",24
105,Mr SHARP,NOES,"This breakthrough has come as a result of negotiations that have taken place between ANL, which is the government owned shipping line, also BHP, which is the largest shipowner in Australia and also the largest transport user in Australia, and also the ACTU. I quote from Mr Lance Hockridge, who is the manager of BHP Transport, who said: This really represents the end of the trans-Tasman accord. My view is that this is the most substantial change in the maritime scene in probably 25 yearsI repeat: the most substantial change in the maritime scene in probably 25 years. This, of course, was one of the coalition's major planks to its maritime reform proposals it had prior to the last election. It is an interesting thing that, as this has been in our platform for the last several years, it has also been part of the maritime industry's reform agenda as well-to break this illegal accord. After 13 years of a Labor governmentMr Tanner-You had nothing to do with it. Own up! You had nothing to do with it!",24
106,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Melbourne!,24
107,Mr SHARP,NOES,"people in the maritime sector had become sick and tired of governments prevaricating about fixing this illegal agreement between those unions. After 13 years of a Labor government they had done nothing. It took seven months of a coalition government to implement one of these major maritime reforms, a reform which will directly benefit consumers-people who consume goods like motor vehicles, office machines, computers, electrical machinery, petrol, paper, wood and household equipment. They are the people who will benefit from this decision and the implementation of a coalition policy. This, coupled with the benefits that will be attributed to exporters, will ensure that we have a more competitive economy in Australia and that we can create jobs-jobs, which could have been created by a Labor government with 13 years in which to do it but which will now be created by a coalition government after only seven months of government. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism",24
108,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and it follows on that from the Leader of the Opposition. Is the Prime Minister aware that Minister Moore has been involved with Bligh Ventures since its inception in the 1960s and that, when the company was floated in 1987, its share price was $2? Is he aware that, if Minister Moore sells his current 43,000 shares at the current price of $2.20, he walks away with $94,600a nominal profit of $8,600, on top of the $2,500 profit he has made by his sales already, on top of whatever profit he made on the original float",24

116,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Kingsford-Smith!,25
117,Mr ANDERSON,NOES,"I thank the honourable thereof, member for her question. It is an area of course that interests her very much. She is passionate advocate for rural Australia in general, and for rural women in Queensland in particular. Today is indeed the first World Rural Women's Day. The date was selected to create a synergy with World Food Day, which is tomorrow, 16 October. World Rural Women's Day recognises rural women, for including those who are small farmers and entrepreneurs and who manage much of our natural resources, create jobs across the economy, produce most of our food and care for the next generation. This parliament is the venue this afternoon for a meeting of 14 eminent rural women. They will convey to the government firstness hand their views on the role of women in future of Australia's rural sector. The government's commitment is reflected by the decision of the Prime Minister to join today's program, including what I am sure will be a frank and open round table discussion on how we can better achieve our mutual policy goals. The level of international support and interest is perhaps no better shown than through a message received overnight which reads in part: As we celebrate World Rural Women's Day, we again have the opportunity to recognise the important contributions of farm women everywhere. Producingthis should interest membersmore than three quarters of the world's food, rural play such an important role in sustaining preserving their families, communities and, is World ultimately, their nations. Thank you again for your continuing work on of Australia's farm women and women by Hillary Clinton. I look forward to World Rural Women's Day, and in particular to the Australian celebrations, as a means of further identifying actions which will help us achieve those goals for which rural women constantly fight, with the dedication and commitment which has built for us a rural and regional Australia earning 80 per cent of our merchandise exports and the income derived with an economic multiplier benefit of up to four to one. I commend to all Ausa tralians this first W orId Rural Women's Day. Small Business",25
118,Mr ROCHER,NOES,"My question follows that asked by the honourable member for Mallee. Does the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs expect export opportunities small business to improve over the next 12 months? Is the minister aware that several recent surveys, including the August Yellow Pages Small Business Index, the Institute for Chartered Accountants' report entitled Open for business and the University of Technology of Sydney's report What keeps business awake at night, all indicate that small busiconfidence in the government is in the decline? Does stimulation of export opportunities feature in the minister's plans for small business? If so, how will it be achieved?  member for Curtin for his question. Firstly, as he should be aware, the government has in place a number of initiatives to certainly help small business. More particularly, in the area of export markets we have extended and improved the EMDG scheme to give better access by small business to the export market development grants, unlike the previous government. With regard to the surveys that the member referred to, it is disappointing that the uncertainty caused by disruption to the budget and reforms of industrial relations by the opposition, particularly in the Senate, is not helping the rebuilding of confidence in the community. We have set the climate for a growth in confidence and the ability for small business to invest and expand their businesses. The only thing that is holding that back is some certainty from the other side in regard to progress of the budget through the Senate. The member referred to a recent Yellow Pages survey in regard to the compliance cost and burden on small business indicating very much that they were worried about the unfair dismissal, compliance costs and many of the things we wanted set right in the budget. We have set in place a budgetary position that gives certainty and that keeps downward pressure on interest rates and a low ary environment. We have provided the climate for confidence, growth, expansion and access to export markets. It is a great shame that the opposition does not do something to help small business and progress the budget through the Senate. Medical Students",25
119,Mr SLIPPER,NOES,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of concerns about the budget measure to limit full access to Medicare provider numbers to those who have completed appropriate postgraduate training? What is the minister's response to claims that the number of general practice and specialist training places for young doctors will fall short of the demand for places after the new arrangements commence?,26
120,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I understand that there is genuine anguish and anger felt by medical students. Part of that is being fed by very wild claims that are simply not sustainable. The member asks specifically about training positions. Of course, this is part of the nub of this proposal. Training positions in general practice are easy to ascertain because the Commonwealth pays for them. We pay for 400 a year. Training in specialty positions are much harder to ascertain because the states pay for them and we rely on information we get back from specialty colleges. As best we can find out, there are about 760 new, first-year training places this year. That does not count about 20 doctors who will go into medical administration and does not count about 20 doctors a year that will go into medical research, nor does it count 20 positions opening up next year in specialty areas of general practice, such as sports medicine and venereology. That makes 1,220 places available for training around Australia. There are new places opening up next year because of the work of Professor John Horvath with the Medical Work Force Advisory Committee. They are opening up in ophthalmology, urology, orthopaedic surgery and anaesthetics. The anaesthetics places are inflation- particularly significant. The simple fact is that a person in final year of medical school at the moment will have a substantially greater chance to specialise or pursue advanced training than I in fact did when I graduated 15 years ago. The number of training positions will be substantially greater than the number of doctors graduating. There are other aspects of this proposal that will be of significant benefit. There has been concern mentioned about what will happen in rural areas. This proposal would be overwhelmingly beneficial to rural practice. One of the big problems rural doctors have is trying to get locums. No-one can be expected to work seven days a week, 365 days a year, well so we will be having a system whereby if a person without a provider number wishes to be a locum we will issue a temporary provider number, provided they are going into relieve rural practice. Also, we have had discussions with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, which have given indication that they are happy to sponsor a system whereby a young doctor going to work in a country hospital-it has been particularly difficult to attract young doctors to country hospitalswill have guaranteed access to a training program after a period of time. This will help rural hospitals attract higher quality young doctors than they have been able to in the past. The third aspect of this whole proposal is the number of overseas trained doctors coming into this country. It has been particularly high by international standards and particularly difficult to find the exact number because they come in under a variety of categories. Almost none come in the independent category. The majority come in as spouse nominees, but it may be as high as 600. I foreshadowed as early as May this year that this was utterly unacceptable and that we would be acting on it. I hope to be in a position within a week to make an announcement specifically on that. I accept this is a difficult proposal but we are doing it for two reasons. The first reason is cost. The fact is Medicare is going up by 5.7 per cent in real terms per annum. That is 265 per cent since it was introduced. The Medicare benefits schedule alone at the moment is larger than the budget of the state of Western Australia and we simply cannot afford a 5.7 per cent real increase a year. Most people who look at this accept that is very substantially driven by supply side measures not demand side measures. The second reason we are doing it is that of general practice. General practice is a speciality in itself. For too long it has been the dumping ground of the medical profession. For too long it has been where people ended up if they did not want to do anything else. The net result is that general practice is disillusioned; it is detached from the rest of the health system and it has been progressively deskilled for 20 years. I do not that two years training in neurosurgery qualifies you for anything in general practice and it is long due that we have specialist training for entry into general practice. We still have not as a country adequately addressed distribution issues but this will go some way towards that. I am prepared to look at measures at the edge for selection and training to ensure this is fair and flexible to meet the needs of younger doctors but, in the end, I am not prepared to back down on this one. It is a fundamental reform if Medicare is to be sustainable. The coalition has made its peace with Medicare. If this does not happen we have no prospect of it being sustainable in the medium term. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism",26
121,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister, going to that politics of envy. When the government brought down its budget it said that it had to slash spending on dental care for the elderly immediately. When four million people have lost their dental care immediately, why is this minister for industry allowed to divest at leisure and on his own terms from a company that he himself has determined involves him in a potential conflict of interest?",27
122,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"I do not think there is any link at all between the two. In any event, as I understand it, the effect of the budget decision was that the spending on the dental health program was being terminated only some six or 12 months earlier than what was announced by the former government, so that cannot be categorised as some kind of absolutely dreadful decision. I simply say again to those opposite and to the House that I do not believe the minister to whom he was referring is in breach of the guidelines. On the basis of what has been said by the minister today, he is not required to divest according to the guidelines but he has chosen to divest and he has explained the circumstances. I do not believe that he is open accept at all to legitimate criticism. Family Court of Australia",27
123,Ms GAMBARO,NOES,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. Is the minister aware of criticisms made by the Chief Justice of the Family Court that the government's plans to revamp family law and family services could literally tear heart out of the court? Will the minister advise whether these claims are correct?,28
124,Mr WILLIAMS,NOES,"I thank the member for Petrie for her question and her interest in the subject. I am aware of the comments reportedly made by the Chief Justice of the Family Court about the role of the court's counselling and mediation services. I think it is a matter of regret that the comments were made, first, because what the Chief Justice is responding to was not a government proposal but some alarmist media reports about what the government was thought to be doing and, secondly, because they were made before the government's proposals were revealed. I outlined in an address to the National Press Club at lunchtime today that I am keen to maximise access to primary dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and counselling and to ensure that those are provided in the most efficient and effective way. They offer people a less expensive, less traumatic way of resolving family disputes. They are better than litigation in that respect. It would make disputes within the family context less adversarial and less confrontational if people could deal with them outside the court environment in the community. However, I should add that no government decision has been made on the best mix of court and community sector services, nor will any such decision be made without full consultation with all of the interested parties. I commenced that consultative process today by canvassing the issue at the National Press Club. I want to be in a position to look at the whole range of services and to see whether they are the right mix and at the right location to meet the needs of the community. There has been no final decision about the outcome of such an examination. It may, for example, still be appropriate to maintain a counselling service on court premises to enable easy access by clients who are engaged in litigation or who approach the court in the first instance. The court could also refer people in those situations to community organisations, as I understand it already does. I welcome and applaud the commitment to the primary dispute resolution that has been demonstrated by the Family Court in the past. I look forward to the court's cooperation in ensuring that these services are made available to the Australian community in the most efficient, effective and accessible way possible. I believe that what I have proposed today at the National Press Club is consistent with the coalition's election commitment to provide support to strengthen families.",28
125,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY, SCIENCE . AND TOURISM Motion of Censure Motion (by Mr Crean) proposed: That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Hotham moving forthwith the following motion: That this House censures the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism: (1) for his failure to divest his $100,000 interest in Bligh Ventures since May 1996 despite being required to do so under the Prime Minister's guidelines on ministerial conduct; (2) notes the Minister's failure to divulge that matters had come before him related to the activities of Bligh Ventures including the computer bounty which the Government decided to extend in the Budget by a further 12 months; (3) notes that companies associated with Bligh Ventures received more than $1 million from the Government in computer bounty funding in the previous financial year; (4) notes the Minister's key role in retaining tariff concessions on business inputs; and (5) notes that the battlers of Lindsay and many millions of Australians have been harmed by decisions in the Budget such as those to abolish the Commonwealth dental program, introduction of an average $26,000 for elderly Australians, including veterans and TPIs, to enter a nursing home, increased charges for. child care, cuts to labour market programs and additional costs to go to university; and This House calls on the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism to resign immediately for his gross breach of the guidelines on ministerial conduct.",28
126,Mr CREAN,NOES,"--'-I move: That this House censures the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism: (1) for his failure to divest his $100,000 interest in Bligh Ventures since May 1996 despite being required to do so under the Prime Minister's guidelines on ministerial conduct; (2) notes the Minister's failure to divulge that matters had come before him related to the activities of Bligh Ventures including the computer bounty which the Government decided to extend in the Budget by a further 12 months; (3) notes that companies associated with Bligh Ventures received more than $1 million from the Government in computer bounty funding in the previous financial year; (4) notes that the minister's key role in retaining tariff concession on business inputs; and (5) notes that the battlers of Lindsay and many millions of Australians have been harmed by decisions in the Budget such as those to abolish Commonwealth dental program, introduction of an average $26,000 for elderly Australians, including veterans and TPIs, to enter a nursing home, increased charges for child care, cuts to labour market programs and additional costs to go to university; and This House calls on the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism to resign immediately for his gross breach of the guidelines on ministerial conduct. I move this motion of censure because we have seen in the House today the indefensible position of a minister of the Crown with responsibility for key areas of activity holding shares in companies that stand to benefit from decisions so taken. By any standard, this minister must go. The censure is necessary because the code of conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been breached. I remind the Prime Minister of what the code of conduct says because he moralised so much about its importance. We see him today starting to requalify it, having a review of it within seven months. Why? Because one minister has gone, one parliamentary secretary has gone and another is now being censured and ought to go. The Prime Minister's code of conduct, I remind the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), says this: ... it is important that ministers and parliamentary secretaries avoid giving any appearance of using public office for private purposes. 'Any appearance' are your words, Prime Minister. This is your code of conduct which you are required to enforce. That same code of conduct for ministers says that they 'are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities' . The minister knew he had to divest. If he did not have to divest, why did he put them out to his stockbroker? If he did not think he had to divest them, Prime Minister, why did he ask his stockbroker to put them on the market a day after your deadline ran out for him doing so? What we had in the House today was you the saying, as I understand it, Prime Minister, that he is not required to divest of them. Who is leading on your code of conduct? You have a minister who knows he must divest. His defence yesterday was that he could not divest because he had not got the right price, and you are in here today suggesting that for some odd reason he does not have to divest. Are you saying that he does not have to  code of conduct is now interpreted by you to mean? Do I get any indication at all? Do you know what your code of conduct means? It is clear for anyone to read. It is clear for any person, including the battlers of Lindsay, to read that ministers must divest. Otherwise, why has he sought to place them on the market? Why has he sought to sell them? Today we have the so-called defence that he does not know what the day-today trading dealings are of the associated and related companies. Related companies, I remind you, Prime Minister. That is what you referred to in accepting the resignation of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Gibson. These are clearly related companies of Bligh Ventures. But the minister is saying that, because does not know what they do on a day-today basis and every decision involved, he should not be held accountable. What did the then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, and Senator Gibson have to do with the day-today operations of the companies in relation to which they had to resign? This is a nonsense proposition. You are ducking and weaving because you cannot stand another scalp. I can understand that. If we continue like the rest of the week, we will get one a day. Last week we had a minister resign because he applied the code of conduct but because he was found out. This week the socomputer called reinterpretation of the guideline is that you have got to be found out and you have got to make a profit. Is that what sharing the burden means in terms of the tough budget? Is that the share associated with the sharing of the burden? You have got to make a profit on the shares-is that what we are talking about? The people in Lindsay are being moralised to by the Prime Minister about the need for a tough budget, that people have to share the burden. The only people who have to take brunt of this budget and any decisions associtoday ated with the government are Lindsay. What the ministers on the front bench can do is to wait until they make a profit. No sharing of the burden, no cost no disadvantage to them. They can hang aro-nd waiting for a profit. The fact is that the minister has responsiyou bility for a number of key areas that affect companies that Bligh Ventures has a substanyou tial shareholding in. Let us just look annual report of Bligh Ventures, the report that the government refused to have tabled today. We heard the minister, in his defence today, 'saying that the information he got about the dealings of Bligh Ventures was frQm the annual report. Yet, if you go to annual report, it has a clear the interests of Bligh Ventures are. It has a 20 per cent holding in Bligh Oil and Minerals, 10 per cent holding in Techniche Ltd, a 25 per cent holding in RSM Research and an 18.2 per cent holding in Jtec Pty Ltd. These , - re al- companies which we sought in queshe tIOn tIme to demonstrate would have been beneficiaries from decisions associated either with the computer bounty, the tariff concession order or the diesel fuel rebate. These are 'all decisions over which the minister has responsibility, all areas over which he has participated in cabinet discussions and all areas over which he not only has to oversee the legislation but has to make day-today administrative decisions-and he says that he this for has no conflict of interest. The computer bounty was not the only not bounty-it was one out of five-that was axed in the budget. Interestingly, it is the bounty that gets a stay of life. It gets an extra year. Why, we must ask? Jtec is a beneficiary to the tune of.$1 million. Does the minister say that he simply does not know about these things? It stretches credibility. He has an annual report that identifies the holdings of these companies by Bligh Ventures. These are not insubstantial amounts. More importantly, the minister at the table has been a founding member of Bligh Ventures. He has been in it from the beginning. It defies credibility to suggest that he does not know what it is trading in, he does not know what it is the dealing in. Whatever he comes in and says in a ministerial statement, it just stretchthe battlers of es credibility. Let me remind the minister that what is required here is not to necessarily show that there is a direct conflict of interest, although that we will pursue, but to show that there is an appearance of a conflict of interest. For to have shareholdings in companies that stand to benefit from decisions over which have responsibility, there is that appearat the ance of the conflict of interest. Let us just understand this about the bounty: Bligh Ventures has kept the computer bounty. It is the only 'Bligh' that has kept its bounty. One has to understand the signifithe cance of the minister's knowledge of that statement on what shareholding. Last week we saw Jim Short resign. He a resigned because he was considered to have made an administrative decision which should have been referred off. In the case of Jim Short, what was the administrative decision? It was approval to him, recommended by the Secretary to the Treasury and the Governor of the Reserve Bank, to allow Grindlays to get a banking licence as part of the arrangement with ANZ Bank. This was a straightforward approval that was recommended and which on any other standards you would say, 'You don't exercise a decision, you just tick it off.' Yet on Sunday the Prime Minister said that the new circumstance was that this particular provision was overlooked. If the Assistant Treasurer should have referred off questions associated with any dealings with the ANZ Bank, why is it not also true, Minister, that you should have referred off any decisions that could have had an impact on any of those companies held by Bligh-Bligh Oil and Minerals, Techniche Ltd, RSM Research and the Jtec group of companies? There is a clear appearance of a conflict of interest here. If Jim Short resigned, you must go. That is the simple conclusion that one can come to in this. What do we have in the minister's defence? The minister is still trying to sell his shares. Isn't it a tragedy! Because he can't get the top price, he shouldn't have to sell them! The fact is that in the space of seven months he has sold only 5,000 of his 48,000 shareholding. If he keeps this rate up, he will not have disposed of his share package until well into the next parliament. Is that what you say is an appropriate disposal of interest? You know that you have a requirement to sell them; otherwise you would not have put them on the market. Mr Moore-I haven't got a requirement.",29
127,Mr CREAN,NOES,"Oh, you say you haven't got a requirement. So the Prime Minister has reinterpreted the guidelines for you now. Are you going to withdraw them from sale now? Are you going to give the appropriately named Mr Gamble a new instruction in the Brisbane Stock Exchange as to what you do with your shares? Let us just understand where we are with this. The minister only put his shares on the market the day after the deadline proposed by the Prime Minister. The day after that again he was reported as saying in the Melbourne Age: PoliticiansI am quoting John Mooreshould be able to retain business interests and contacts while in office despite the potential for conflicts of interest, the Industry Minister, Mr Moore says. Despite the potential for conflicts of interest! That is not what the Prime Minister's code of conduct says. You were then reported as saying in an interview with the Age: Mr Moore said continued links with the Australian and international business community were 'absolutely invaluable' for decision making, and described as 'bloody stupid' the view that it meant politicians were 'tainted' or 'bent'. The reality is that this minister does not believe in the code of conduct. He is going through the motions of trying to divest shares and not doing it very well. What he is trying to do is to appear to dispose of shares, not address the appearance of conflict of interest. The code of conduct says any appearance of conflict of interest is the issue at point. That is why he is deserving of censure; that is why he must resign. Let us try to understand the member for Ryan. We had before a reference to the politics of envy. In an interview in the Business Review Weekly the minister for industry is quoted as having said '$5 million; it's just drinking money' in relation to a fee that the government had to put up. This is the John Moore view of life-that you use $5 million, get in the next shipment of Krug, have all your mates around to Bligh Ventures and decideMr Moore-It's the wrong brand.",31
128,Mr CREAN,NOES,"It is the wrong brand for the minister. No doubt there is a more expensive one. If $5 million is just a round of drinks in the minister's mind, it must be very flash indeed. Mr Moore-I got a bottle from Solly, like you.",31
129,Mr CREAN,NOES,"What was that point that you made there, Minister? Would you care to repeat that point? The fact of the matter is you come from a background that believes that you should be able to go on regardless. You come from a background that does not agree with what the Prime Minister says he is trying to achieve. When you were found out, you went through the motions of selling your shares but had no intention of doing it. That is in clear breach of the guidelines and that is the reason why you are required to resignnot because you have made an effort, and not a very good effort, to divest, but because you have continued to preside over decisions that impact on areas of activity referred to and covered by your portfolio. We have the situation of Bligh Ventures being a substantial holder of a company in information technology-a clear beneficiary of activities in relation to the computer bounty. We have companies covered by Bligh Ventures that are involved in agricultural and medical research and development. We have companies that, because of the nature of their operations, have to import components and therefore would benefit from any ability to retain something of the tariff concession order. We have companies in here involved in the mining and exploration industry which clearly were fighting very strongly in the last budget to retain the diesel fuel rebate. You have direct responsibility, Minister, for the in relation to the diesel fuel rebate. We have here an unequivocal case of circumstances in which a minister must resign. I do not think there can be any question about that. If it was good enough for Jim Short to go, you must tender your resignation. You say that you do not know the operations that are being undertaken through the venture capital company about which we have made assertions today in question time. How can that be? Let us go to the details of Techniche's operation. Techniche, I remind you, is the million dollar recipient of the computer bounty. It shares the same chairman as Bligh Ventures, who is a Mr Rod Cormie. It shares the same chairman as the company that got the benefit. Do not tell me you are not aware of what Bligh Ventures is into. Not only does it appear in the annual report of the company, but also it appears in the list of shared membership. It is the same people who run the operations. If you go into the details, Techniche is currently attempting to take charge of its leading operating asset, Jtec, with a $30 million share offer to Jtec employees, which will increase Techniche's state from 58 to 76.8 per cent. Isn't it a bit like controlling the operation? These are not just minimal shareholdings; these are substantial stakes in the operations. These are benefits to companies that are under the Bligh Ventures portfolio. What we have here is a person who knew yesterday that he had to divest. He set in train a series of steps to divest. He set that train in step late because he only acted on the Prime Minister's admonition a day later. But having put it on the market all he did was sell 5,000 shares because he could not get the right price. Last week we had. the situation in which you did not divest until you found out; today it is not until you get the right price. It is a disgrace and you should resign. (Time expired)",31
130,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Is the motion seconded? Mr Latham-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,32
131,Mr MOORE,NOES,"What an appalling effort that was. Four times around the track, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) had no concerted idea what he was talking about. When he came to the fourth time around, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) even yawned. That is what he thought of it all-a great big yawn. All I can say is: if you are yawning, Laurie, it really must be pretty boring because you know what this game is about better than anybody in here. You know what conflict of interest is about better than anybody, and you know what I am talking about. It was really one of the great performances. There is absolutely no doubt that they have problems on the front-bench over there and are trying to sort them out: a failing leader, a deputy leader who helps us out every day, and Simon thrusting through the centre. Simon is after you both. He comes up here and every time he gets an opportunity, he is . up here making statements about things. It does not matter what they are-and he is too good with the truth, either. Mr Crean-No. We are after you.",32
132,Mr MOORE,NOES,"He gets into the radio a station this morning and tells standard Labor Party lies we hear so much about. I am surprised at you, Simon. I did not think you would do that. I can imagine all these other guys doing it, but not you. . thought you were a little bit above that sort caper, so that was a bit of a let-down. I thought I ought to have a look at the censure motion itself. It is a rather quaint gladbag of what might be, what could be, what you would like to think it was, and those sorts of things which you do not You know you are not right, and you are doing your level best to spray it around. Paragraph (1) says: for his failure to divest his $100,000 interest Bligh Ventures since May 1996Mr O'Connor-As per the Prime Minisreality-the ter's guidelines.",33

Even a former president of the ACTU-they certainly know how to chase things; they have a long history of that-would know what I am talking about. Even when you try to chase that number shares out, you cannot get them through market if the monthly turnover was 15,000 last month. Even you can work that out.",33

It states: notes that the battlers of Lindsay and many millions of Australians have been harmed by decisions the BudgetAnd on it goes. What on earth has that got do with it? It is just to fill in the page. no wonder Laurie is yawning. not fill in the page. He couldn't even make a speech. Four times round the block he went, but it was no good at all. It really is one of the weakest performances of trying to censure minister that I have seen in 20-odd years of some of those federal politics. Mr Crean interjecting",33
137,Mr MOORE,NOES,"Simon, if you really want I to get the deputy leader, he's not going of terribly well, but gee, that's a bit of a flop. You've got to do a bit better than that. That really was a pretty poor effort. Mr Crean-Has it sunk in yet?",33
138,Mr MOORE,NOES,"If you are coming up all tomorrow, see if you can do a bit better know. because it is the same sort of story. Mr Crean-What's the answer?",33
139,Mr MOORE,NOES,"For the simple minded, in because there are a lot of people over there who appear not to have any commercial member for Kingsford-Smith has a lot of commercial reality. He knows how to. hide things. There's no worry about that. He knows all about commercial reality. I do not think the mover of the motion, the honourable a few member for Hotham, seems to understand commercial reality, so I want to point it out to him. Bligh Ventures is a company that has been established since the 1960s. It had an original core of investors who believed in the of development of Australia. They put their the money at risk to create wealth and employment-the sorts of things that ought to be done in Australia.",33

Also, it is a company that It is has never received any assistance from the He could not government-not at all.",33
144,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"Are you saying you didn't invest in it? . Mr MOORE-No, I didn't say that at all. I said that Bligh Ventures is a capital investment company which has invested in the future of Australia. As I went from the Stock Exchange into politics, I became purely an investor in this corporation. I was not involved in the management. I did not know what the shareholdings were except once a year when the annual report came out, the same as with every corporation in Australia, every investment fund.

158,Mr MOORE,NOES,"All I want to say in relation to the Bligh Ventures situation is that it is a worthy company which has succeeded. An investment in Bligh Ventures is exactly the same as superannuation, life insurance, a unit trust or a corporation. All of these companies have widespread interests across the board. Do you genuinely think that any member of the cabinet should stop immediately and rush outside to find out what the AMP or a building society have recently invested in? This is quite ridiculous. This is also backed up by some of the former leaders of the Labor Party. Mr Martin Ferguson interjecting",34
159,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,I warn the member for Batman!,34
160,Mr MOORE,NOES,"This refers to the former Prime Minister, who at one stage, in defence of his investments, said: Yesterday he issued a veiled threat to the retaliation against the opposition leadership if it began to attack his personal financial affairs. 'My personal investments and my life have nothing do with my administration of the Commonwealth.' That is what he thought in terms of his standards. That is, you know who, Mr Keating. Mr Bruce Scott-The piggery man.",34
161,Mr MOORE,NOES,"The piggery man. I tum to a further extract: The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has accused the opposition MPs of being jealous of his multimillion dollar New South Wales piggery investment. The politics of envy in reverse.",34
162,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,Would you characterise the Prime Minister as a publicÂ· sector bludger because he doesn't have any unit trusts?,34
163,Mr MOORE,NOES,"I think you would find that he looks after his affairs very well. In terms of the administration of the affairs of any interest at all, I can do no better than quote Mr Gareth Evans, who has been a singular star. He said: The Prime Ministerthat is Mr KEATING was a shareholder in the company and had no involvement with the day-today management of that company. I do not know what on earth the opposition have been up to. They have wandered around the countryside. They have made slurs and innuendos about everybody under the sun. They have not been able to prove one thingnot one thing. On top of that, they have to reflect on their own history of not only what the former Prime Minister had to say but also what happened in relation to the Bell Resources-BHP takeover. In this case I am informed that two cabinet ministers, both of whom had conflicts of interest, advised the cabinet as to what should occur when both of them stood to substantially gain from the outcome. These are matters which reflect on the opposition's history over the years. Coming against that background, I am simply astonished that you should be bothered to comment on these things. Finally, to put this matter to bed, as an individual shareholder in this company I have declared the interest to parliament. I have declared the interest to the Prime Minister. I have offered the shares for sale and they are still for sale. I have at all times adhered rules required of me in this place. In every respect I reject the censure motion.",34
164,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"Werriwa) (3.56 p.m.)After that speech two things are very clear to the House. The first is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has developed a massive migraine in the last 15 minutes having to appreciate what sort of industry minister he has on his hands. The second thing is that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) just does not care. He does not care about people in Lindsay. He does not care about the impact of budget cuts. He does not care about public servants. He describes them as bludgers. He does not care about ministerial standards. Most of all, he does not care about his Prime Minister. It is almost like this minister is begging the Prime Minister to put him out of his misery. Give him his knighthood, send him up the Brisbane River on a yacht and relieve him of ministerial responsibilities. This is a minister who absolutely does notÂ· care. He does not care about all those responsibilities because he has been in this place so long. There is only one thing he cares about-that is, private profit out of public office. That is most of all why this minister should be dismissed. When the Prime Minister told Australians before the last election that he believed in high standards of governance, was he talking about an industry minister holding $100,000 worth of shares for seven months and more in Bligh Ventures Ltd? When the Prime Minister talked about his high standards, was he talking about an industry minister for seven months holding equity in Bligh Oil and Minerals? This is a company involved in the petrol industry in Australia and it is potentially eligible for the diesel fuel rebate. We heard the minister's explanation today. It was very carefully worded. He told the House that, as a shareholder, he has no knowledge of those matters. But as a minister he must have knowledge of where the diesel fuel rebate is being paid out around Australia. When those decisions come before the cabinet table, there are two John Moores: the private John Moore, the shareholder who claims that he does not have knowledge of these matters, to the and the public office holder John Moore, a minister who does know where the diesel fuel rebate is being spent. When the cabinet for four months of big public debate has an argument about whether or not the rebate remains, it is John Moore with a conflict of interest. It is the private shareholder who knows because he is a public office holder that has a financial interest in that decision. So, when the government decides to keep the rebate, it is a minister using his public office for private profit. A minister using a public decision, his responsibilities under the Crown, to line his own pockets. When the Prime Minister talked about standards of propriety in Australian public life, was he talking about an industry minister with equity in Techniche Ltd and ELPRO? This is a technology investment company receiving the computer bounty. Again he can say that as a shareholder he was not aware of the bounty being paid, but as a minister he must be aware of that bounty being paid. A funny thing happened on the way to the forum with regard to the computer bounty. In the budget the government abolished all the bounties, but which one remained? The computer bounty, which put $37,000 into the pockets of Techniche Ltd and ELPRO. It put $37,000 of financial benefit into the coffers of the minister for industry. When the Prime Minister talks about high standards in public life, is he talking about a minister who holds equity in RSM Research with $24,000 being paid across in the computer bounty? When the Prime Minister talks - bout hig- standards in Australian public life, IS he talking about a minister with equity in Jtec, a telecommunications company with a $1.1 million computer bounty paid by this government? That makes him the million ?oll-r mi-ister-making decisions, participatIng In cabInet and putting the public policy on the rec<?rd. All ?f it i.s for the single purpose of holdIng pubhc offIce for private profit. When we talk about Bligh, it is said to be a company dealing in venture capital. How about the Prime Minister venturing into a little leadership? How about the Prime Minister venturing into the leadership which would uphold his ministerial standards? This is - Prime M-nster who never asks for resignatIOns; they Just flood to him. He never asks for resignations; he just receives them. It is interesting to have a close look, to go back and read the preface to the code of ministerial conduct. In the first line, the Prime Minister wrote: This ministerial Guide is intended as a source of quick reference for ministers . . . Quick reference all right. The reference has been so quick that his ministers have not even read it. They have a Prime Minister whom they disregard in terms of his ministerial code. Of course, a few sentences later we get the moral sermon from the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. He says as follows: : .. ad-e-ence to hig- standards by people occupymg pOSitIOns of pubhc trust. The Australian people have this as their entitlement and I seek the cooperation of all ministers ... in maintaining standards. The truth is that-and the House should acknowledge it today in supporting this censure motion-when the Prime Minister fails to sack the industry minister he debases that entitlement. He debases the entitlement he has received from the Australian people. He debases the standards that he has set in his own code. He debases the public trust that he received from the Australian electorate in March. The Prime Minister always reminds me so much of Jim Hacker and that motto 'I am their leader, I must follow them.' Th-t is the style of leadership we have got out of this Prime Minister. He is a follower, not a leader. When it comes to national identity, he is a follower, not a leader. When it comes to racial tolerance, he is a follower, not a leader. Wh-n it comes to the Australian principle of a fmr go for all Australians, he is a follower not a leader. Most of all, when it comes tministerial standards, he is a follower, not a leader. I remember how the Australian people in the 1980s got to know him as 'Little Johnny Howard'. They are starting to recognise that, as Prime Minister, he is 'Little Johnny - oward'. He lacks the courage, he lacks the Integrity and he lacks the strength to deal with ministers who totally ignore his code and thumb their nose at his leadership. Let me have a look at another part of the ministerial code. I am quoting the Prime Minister's own words: Ministers are required to divest themselves of all sh-es an? similar .interests in any company or bUSIness Involved In the area of their portfolio responsibilities. It does not have 'seven months later' in bra-kets. It does not have 'when they finally decIde they can make a profit out of their divestment' in brackets . It is 'responsibilities'-full stop. It is 'divestment'-full stop. Of course, the Prime Minister goes on in his code: Ministers are not precluded from making investments on the stock markets or other financial and trading markets, but they should not operate as - raders - d should exercise careful personal Judgment In respect of transactions. these What has Bligh been doing for seven months? It has been operating as a share trader. Of course, the minister has been party to that. The Prime Minister talks about exercising careful personal judgment. The personal judgment this minister has been exercising is to retain the computer bounty for the benefit of Bligh. The personal judgment that this minister has been exercising is to retain the diesel fuel rebate for the benefit of Bligh. The personal judgment this minister has been exercising as a minister of the Crown is to retain the tariff concession scheme and provide benefits for business. In this whole tawdry exercise, he does not even have the Jim Short excuse. He does not even have the excuse that was used by Senator Short. Senator Short said that he was a shareholder, not a share trader. But this minister, through Bligh Ventures, is an absolute share trader and should be dismissed by the Prime Minister accordingly. He should be dismissed for breaking the ministerial code of conduct. All we are left with out of this process is the John Moore excuse-not wanting to sell, not wanting to tum a loss on his divestment. The truth is that divestment cuts both ways. If the minister is not willing to divest himself of those financial assets, he must divest himself of decision making responsibility within the Howard government. He has failed to do that. He has been making decisions on the computer bounty, the fuel rebate, the tariff concession scheme and research and development, which of course go to the heart of the activity of Bligh Ventures Ltd. We heard the Prime Minister say yesterday that that is no excuse. Divesting seven months after the event is no excuse. He said this yesterday. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) asked the question: Do your guidelines suggest that you are only required to divest when it is convenient and when you do not make a loss, or are you allowed to hang on until, in the effluxion of time, you make a profit?",35
165,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"No. No full stop. N-o, no. That is what the Prime Minister said yesterday. If he upheld that standard today-learning that his minister has been making decisions on the computer bounty, the fuel rebate and the tariff concessions scheme, which go to the heart of the share value of Bligh Ventures-then he would dismiss this minister without hesitation. He would dismiss this minister and finally put him out of his misery. He would do it without hesitation. What is behind all of this is an example of greed. This is tory greed and tory arrogance. It is about a minister who will not divest and who snubs his nose at the Prime Minister's guidelines. Seven months later, having made all of these decisions that go to the heart of the value of Bligh, he is still hanging on to those shares. It is the greed of one of Australia's richest men who wants more. He always wants more-Moore by name; more by nature. It is the tory arrogance. As Russ Hinze, his colleague in Queensland, once put it, 'These are not conflicts of interests; this is a convergence of interest.' It is the old tory style of saying that government business is his business, and that is the way in which this minister has conducted his affairs. The only thing he has to say is the Jim Short excuse that this is somehow an oversight. What it is, of course, is a stunning insight into the way in which this government conducts its affairs. It is personal wealth and the way in which this government works. Senator Short said that $9,000 of profit was an oversight. For the average Australian it is a lot of money. For Senator Short, $50,000 worth of shares was an oversight; for the average Australian, it is two years worth of earnings. When John Moore talks about business he means his own business. There was an example of it-he was speaking six years too early in 1990-in the BRW magazine. He was taking about coalition policy and he had this to say of one of his schemes: The advertising is expensive, but you're raising big bucks. And if you're raising let's say it's $10 billion and total underwriting information costs $5 million, what is that? A round of drinks? That is the attitude that this minister has-$5 million for him is a round of drinks. What does that mean for the $100,000 of equity that you have got in Bligh? Does that mean that the $100,000 of equity that you have got in Bligh can do nothing more than provide an olive to go in your martllll, that your $5 million is a round of drinks? This is a standard and a government that needs to be exposed in terms of old style tory arrogancemixing public office with private profit. Of course they are all in on it: Senator Short, Gibson-he has gone today-Minchin, Costello and Moore. In this particular register that has been tabled in the Clerk's office, the entry for the Liberal side of the parliament reads like the back pages of the Australian Financial Review. They are all in on it. Their cabinet meetings must be more like episodes of that TV show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. When they said 'all of us' at the election, what they really meant was 'all of them'. It means all of them down at the Stock Exchange with the member for Ryan using public office for private profit. In a former life the minister was head of the Brisbane Stock Exchange. No wonder he is comfortable here in this parliament and no wonder he does not even care, because he has moved from one stock exchange to another. He is now running the Liberal Party stock exchange in Parliament House, Canberra. When the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) says this is a government interested in trade, that is right, it is a government interested in trade-share trading. The arrogance of it all. There is the minister, his scalp swinging in the breeze, and a Prime Minister too weak to sack him. By the look of the Prime Minister today he has probably walked out of this place saying, 'John Moore was part of the post-Peacock reconciliation, but why couldn'the have left with Andrew? Why couldn'the have just left this place when Andrew did instead of leaving me with a post-Peacock legacy?' The minister will not resign because he will not take a loss. He will not take a loss on a $100,000 holding. I say to the minister: tell that to the people of Lindsay who are making a loss out of this government's budget. Tell that to the 1,000 students who would otherwise be going to the University of Western Sydney but who will not now be able to get in because of this government's cuts. Tell that to the people-young and old-who are going to lose their dental health program. Tell that to the parents who are losing child-care places. Tell that to the unemployed who are losing labour market programs. Tell that to the commuters who are losing road and public transport funding. Tell that to the people waiting for a spot in Nepean Hospital because of this government's $800 million cuts to public hospitals. If this is a minister who is not prepared to take a loss, he can tell it to the old people who are losing their access to nursing homes in the seat of Lindsay. Tell them that he is not prepared to take a loss. This is a government with two standards: one for the rich and one for the not so rich. They talk about national savings, but this is an instance where the minister has one interest and one interest alone, and that is his own personal savings. The message that he gives to the Australian people is that he just does not care about standards. All we have got is a Prime Minister who talks about standards but who never acts and never does anything that is strong or that shows leadership. The Prime Minister is weak and sneaky. He never asks for resignations; he only receives them. It is about time he received the resignation of the minister for industry.",37
166,Mr REITH,NOES,"The government rejects this motion. You could only describe oily the performance of the last speaker, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), as a grubby, slimy, smart alec performance. It does no credit to this institution whatsoever. Don't come in here and talk to us about integrity and higher standards when we get a performance like this from the previous speaker. This is an absolutely baseless motion. They have admitted how baseless it is because when they got to points 4 and 5 they had so run out of arguments that they talked about the budget. For heaven's sake, what a pathetic effort! When you look at the substance of the motion, the previous speaker was quoting from the ministerial guidelines. I say to the previous speaker that I brought my copy in as well. Don't think you can get away with a selective quote. You don't get away with a selective .quote. You did not go on and read the balance of the guidelines because you are not interested in a fair, reasonable and proper appreciation of the issues. You are just running a silly party political point-scoring exercise which the Australian people will reject absolutely outright. Let me quote from the second dot point, the one that the previous speaker failedomitted-to mention. It says: Ministers are not precluded from making investments on the stock markets or other financial and trading markets, but they should not operate as traders and should exercise careful personal ment in respect of transactions. The minister has not acted as a trader. He has had the shares since 1960. And you reckon he is a trader. What a ridiculous proposition! He is not a trader. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said during question time, he is not in breach of the guidelines at all. That is the statement. Mr Crean interjecting",38
167,Mr REITH,NOES,"I will answer your interjection. Not only is he not in breach of the guidelines, but also he is in conformity with the guidelines because, as I have just read out, he 'should exercise careful personal judgement in respect of transactions'. Mr Crean-Why's he selling?",39
168,Mr REITH,NOES,"I am answering the question. He made the judgment that it would be prudent to divest himself of the shares. This minister has not only complied with this particular point of the ministerial guidelines but also conformed with the spirit of the guidelines. He has been involved in this particular company for 30-odd years. The opposition's argument is that, because this company which is at arm's length from him may have been involved in holdings in other companies, therefore this brings the minister's shareholdings within the guidelines. It is very interesting that they should run that argument because that has been the subject of debate in this parliament once before. I invite members to go back to 1986 when there was a proposed takeover of BHP by Bell Resources. The Labor government of the day decided secretly to set up a committee. One bloke actually asked to go on the committee. We found out later that his mum had 228,000 Bell shares, but I put that to one side. The second minister who was on the committee was the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button. He was on the committee. Whilst he was a member of the committee, it was not a question of his holding shares in a related company; he was a director of a company that held shares in BHP. The Minister for Industry, Science and judgTourism (Mr Moore) is as pure as the driven snow compared with you people. At a time when we had a proposed Bell Resources takeover of BHP, this company, of which Senator Button was a director, was the holder of 58,661 BHP shares valued at approximately $460,000 and stood to make a tax free capital gain of an additional $81,000 if the Bell takeover had succeeded. What an incredible comparison. Not surprisingly, questions were asked at the time: what did the government of the day think about this circumstance? What did the then Prime Minister Mr Hawke say at the time when asked about it? He said: I could not confirm to the honourable gentleman whether I had known whether he ceased to be a director. So the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, a director of a company with shares in BHP, was on a committee and the then Prime Minister did not even know that he was a director of a company. He knew absolutely nothing about it. I remind honourable members, as the minister said, on this matter he has been perfectly frank and open about this. He declared his interests. It is on the public record in his statement of pecuniary interests and he made an appropriate declaration to the Prime Minister. On this very issue about conflict, as the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) says, what did your previous colleague Senator Button say? He was asked about it. He was a director of a company with shares in BHP. He said: I do not believe that any conflict with my ministerial duties is occasioned by that fact. What incredible hypocrisy for you to raise this issue. When you, therefore, look at this censure motion-for the failure to divest his interest-the reality is that, firstly, there is requirement that he divest, but because the minister wishes to be prudent he is in fact divesting. The only reason he has not divested further is that it has been difficult to sell the shares on the market-evidence of which the minister yesterday produced in this parliament. Once you come to the logical conclusionand I invite members to do so based on the facts-quite frankly, the rest of the censure motion falls down. Paragraph (2) is about his failure to divulge matters that had come before him. That is obviously irrelevant, if paragraph (1) comes. Paragraph (3) relates to the investments of this particular company and others. On the basis of the Button precedent, the minister is clearly beyond the strictures which are put upon him by this censure motion. Paragraphs (4) and (5) are absolutely irrelevant and, therefore, the whole call for the censure motion falls down by any fair appreciation and analysis of the issues. We are then entitled to ask about the standards which were set by the now opposition when they were in government. They have been very quick to draw and to make claims and allegations about propriety on this side of the House. The reality is that they would not know a decent standard if they fell over it. For years and years, when they were in government, we had example after example where the Labor Party failed to meet proper standards in ministerial conduct. As I said during question time, no more obvious a case than this was their ongoing conflict of interest between their role as a government and their trade union base. It is to the permanent disgrace of the opposition that when in government they were receiving as an ALP donations from unions at the same time they were handing out taxpayers' money to their Labor mates in the trade union movement-literally millions and millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. Altogether in 1992-93, $5.6 million of taxpayers' money went to 18 union bodies. What did they do? They funded $2.2 million of donations back to the ALP in response. What did the Labor government get for that? One of the things that is of particular interest no to them, and always has been since Laurie got on his bike with the ballot papers which got Paul Keating's preselection organised, is that their close relationship with the trade union movement has been the basis upon which three-quarters of their front-bench got their preselection-as a result of rorting the average taxpayer. In return, they have been doing deals with the trade union movement for the whole of the 13 years. That is one of the principal reasons why the Australian people after 13 years appreciated the fact that, rather than looking after the average worker, these people spent 13 years looking after themselves giving us the grossest case of conflict of interest one could possibly imagine. All the way through, from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), who received a grant from a union for his own campaign, the same union that spent $427,000 campaigning against the coalition, to the shadow minister for employment and training, the shadow minister for education and youth affairs, the shadow minister for administrative services, not to mention the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate-all who hail from the New South Wales Miscellaneous Workers Union-they are, doubtless, delighted at the recent elections for the secretary of the New South Wales branch of the liquor trades union because of that close relationship. If it is not that issue, it is the Carmen Lawrence issue, which again was a revelation of the standards of the previous government. Mr Sercombe- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: we have been listening to the Leader of the House for nearly 20 minutes now. We have had three minutes from the minister and 17 minutes from the opposition. I really think we ought to be brought back to order.",39
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Nehl)There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,40
170,Mr REITH,NOES,"The fact is that, as we go through the censure motion, it is absolutely baseless. I have demonstrated, if I say so myself, in a very fair and analytical way that makes it very clear that the censure motion is baseless. I do not think any reasonable person listening to the arguments being put today would be in any doubt that this censure motion should be properly rejected. I put it to anybody listening that not only should they reject this censure motion on the facts and on the evidence that I and the minister have presented to the House but it should be rejected on the grounds that these people, the opposition, do not come to this debate with clean hands. For years they have been rorting the system at taxpayers' expense and for years they themselves failed to meet proper ministerial standards. A classic case was when the member for Fremantle, Carmen Lawrence, the then Minister for Human Services and Health, was the subject of a royal commission. I well remember the front page of the West Australian which announced the results in the Western Australian inquiry into the Easton affair and there were two words at the top of the West Australian. Those two words were 'She lied' . Members should also go back to the circumstances of the former member for Canberra, Ros Kelly, of whiteboard fame, and the months and the months that that issue dragged on until finally, as a result of opposition pressure, we forced that minister to resign in the most gross and blatant abuse of ministerial prerogatives. I return, in the closing minutes, to look at this baseless censure motion. The fact is, as the Prime Minister said and to which the opposition had no response during question time, that the minister does not face a requirement to divest. The minister in fact has complied with the ministerial guidelines. The minister has had a long standing shareholding and, simply as a matter of prudence, he decided to divest himself of those shares. Some, I understand, have already been divested. He has a standing order. It is to the credit Cameron, E. H. of this government that we have ministers such as this minister who are prepared to abide not only by the letter of the guidelines but also by the spirit of them. On that basis, as a result of the clear evi- Forrest, J. A. dence that this government has in fact met this ministerial standard in respect of this particular matter raised by the opposition, this Hicks, N. J. * motion should clearly be rejected. I am confident that the motion will be, given the good sense of the argument put by the government, and I commend to all sensible members its rejection. Question put: That the motion (Mr Crean's) be agreed to. The House divided. [4.30 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr G.B.

173,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I table for the information of honourable members, with a view to ratification by Australia, amended protocol II and new protocol IV annexed to the Convention on Prohibitions and Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects, also known as the Inhumane Weapons Convention, of 10 October 1980. Australia is a party to the convention and participated fully in the review conference which adopted amended protocol II and new protocol IV on 3 May 1996 and 13 October 1995 respectively. Protocol II deals with prohibitions or restrictions on mines, booby traps and other devices. Protocol IV deals with blinding laser weapons. Amended Protocol II On coming to office, the government ordered a review of Australia's policy on antipersonnel landmines. As a result of that review, the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) and I announced on 15 April that Australia would support a global ban on the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of antipersonnellandmines, a policy we promoted at the final session of the Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference when it met in Geneva shortly thereafter. The new policy also suspended the operational use of antipersonnellandmines by the Australian Defence Force. While Australia has not used landmines operationally for over 20 years and had never used them except in strict conformity with international legal and humanitarian norms, it was appropriate for a country with Australia's strong humanitarian record to demonstrate leadership on this issue. This new policy was and is a major achievement in foreign policy and humanitarian terms. It took Australia to the forefront the international community's efforts to rid the world. of these insidious weapons which kill or maim some 30,000 people a year. Since our announcement, other countriesnotably the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and New Zealand-have moved their national positions in directions which we hope will contribute to the international momentum in favour of a total ban. I believe that tragedies caused by the indiscriminate use of antipersonnellandmines concern all Australians who have a conscience. I have received, both in opposition and in government, an enormous amount of correspondence from people urging Australia vigorously to pursue a total ban. We were disappointed that a total ban was not achieved in Geneva, but the conference did adopt an amended protocol II, which contains much stronger restrictions, prohibitions and other norms and thus provides greater protection for civilians and peacekeeping forces than does the existing protocol to which Australia is already a party. It is an agreement worth having. While it does not go as far as we wished on antipersonnel landmines, it is nevertheless a first step in the process towards a total ban. The fact is that protocol II of the Inhumane Weapons Convention is the only international legal instrument governing the use of and trade in landmines. In the absence of a complete ban on antipersonnel landmines, the revisions to protocol II of the convention provide interim measures which will lessen the devastating effects of these appallingly misused weapons. It is also the only international instrument restricting the use of anti vehicle and antitank mines and so will remain important regardless of when a total ban on antipersonnel landmines is achieved. The new measures embodied in the revised protocol are as follows. First, the new protocol II extends the scope of the original protocol to internal conflicts. This addresses one of the most often cited gaps between the old protocol and the reality of antipersonnel landminemisuse today. Second, the humanitarian restrictions in the revised protocol are considerably stronger: excessively injurious of mines are specifically prohibited; antisensing devices and non-detectable mines are banned; the need to discriminate between military and civilian objectives is further emphasised; and advance warning must be given of the use of all weapons covered by the protocol. We believe the aforementioned new provisions will reduce the blatant use of antipersonnel landmines as weapons of terror. Third, new prohibitions and restrictions on the transfer of mines will help impede the acquisition of prohibited mines and the acquisition of mines by states which are not party to the convention or do not agree to apply the norms it embodies. Fourth, the rules relating to fencing, marking, recording and monitoring of manually placed landmines and the self-destruction/self-deactivation standards required of this type of mine have been tightened. Fifth, the restrictions on remotely delivered mines are stronger, with mandatory recording requirements and the requirement that antipersonnel landmines of this type be short lived. Sixth, the protocol provides for annual meetings of the states parties and a second review conference in 2001, measures strongly promoted by Australia as a means of maintaining pressure for a total ban and for further strengthening of the protocol as an interim measure. Seventh, the protocol provides for penal sanctions against those violating the protocol. Finally, a number of technical improvements should make a practical difference in the field, such as a standard sign warning of antipersonnel landmines and a requirement that mine records be kept at a level of command sufficient to ensure their safety. The protocol also assigns clear responsibility for the removal of mines and minefields and provides a framework for greater technological cooperation on mine clearance. For the reasons I have just outlined, the arguments are overwhelmingly in favour of our early ratification of this revised protocol. Ratification is supported by the Australian Red Cross Society, the Australian network of the international campaign to ban landmines, and many, many individual Australians and other non-government organisations. The Coordinator of the Australian network, Sister Patricia Pak Poy, was a full member of the Australian delegation to the review conference, as well as to expert group meetings which preceded it. The new protocol will enter into force six months after the 20th state party to the convention has ratified it. Australia is keen to among the first 20 to ratify and we will be encouraging other countries to ratify quickly, in addition to our continuing campaign to promote greater adherence to the convention, particularly in our region. In international forums, the Australian government will continue its role of mobilising the strong wave of support for eliminating antipersonnellandmines as a weapon of war. Earlier this month, we took part in an international conference of pro-ban states and nongovernment groups in Ottawa which looked at future strategies for achieving a ban. We will also shortly be supporting a resolution at the 51 st session of the United Nations General Assembly which embodies the objectives of the pro-ban states and obliges others to indicate where they stand on this issue. As well as continuing to work diplomatically, the Australian government has increased its support for practical measures to tackle humanitarian disaster caused by landmines. In May of this year, I announced a de-mining program for Cambodia and Laos worth $12 million over three years. This latter contribution will make Australia one of the major donors to the United Nations sponsored demining and bomb clearance efforts in the region. The program includes: $9 million for the United Nations development program and Cambodia Mines Action Centre project; $800,000 for Australian Defence Force technical assistance to the Cambodia Mines Action Centre; $1.2 million for assistance by nongovernment organisations; $900,000 to the UNDP Trust Fund for unexploded ordnance clearance in Laos; and funds for mine awareness training, particularly for school children. In addition, as I announced at the 51st United Nations General Assembly in New York ,last month, Australia is interested in working with other countries to seek to improve de-mining technology, with a view to increasing the rate and scale of the demining process. Whereas protocol II of the Inhumane Weapons Convention is about remedies, protocol IV is about prevention: preventing, by means of a blanket prohibition, the use and be transfer of laser weapons specifically designed to cause permanent blindness to unenhanced vision. These weapons are still in the developmental phase and to date there is no record of blinding weapons being used in combat situations. The protocol is an eminently humane measure which will also contribute to the safety of our forces in combat situations. It is timely in that it will control such an abhorrent and excessively injurious weapon before it has become widely available on the international market. It has the support of the Australian Red Cross Society and non-government organisations, including-most poignantly-those representing blind Australians. Nothing in the protocol will affect anything the Australian Defence Force or Australian industry is doing or planning to do. I accordingly commend the protocol, along with amended protocol II, to the House. In the accordance with the reformed treaty making process which I outlined to the House on 2 May 1996, the protocols, along with accompanying national interest analyses, will lie before the House for at least 15 sitting days and be open to scrutiny including by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Treaties.",43
174,Mr BRERETON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has tabled, with a view to ratification by Australia, the amended protocol II and the new protocol IV annexed to the Convention on Prohibitions and Reof strictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons, otherwise known as the Inhumane Weapons Convention. As the minister has informed the House, protocol II deals with prohibitions or restrictions on mines, booby traps and other devices and protocol IV deals with blinding laser weapons. All members of this House would be aware, I am sure, of the absolute abhorrence felt the Australian public in response to the horrific toll inflicted on innocent civiliansof men, women and children-throughout the mass destruction. world by landmines. Originally designed to injure or kill enemy troops in order to slow divert their movement and to protect military or other key installations, landmines have increasingly been used, intentionally or otherwise, against civilians. In particular, landmines have increasingly been used by and against guerilla and insurwork gent forces in ways which do not conform with accepted international lar, the Inhumane Weapons Convention. These have included random and large mining of agricultural land as well as the uses of mines as a weapon of terror against civilexpressed ians. Weighing anything from a few hundred grams to a few kilograms and as cheap as $3 a pop to buy, landmines have emerged as the most prolific killer and decapitator of humans. It is the weapon that can truly be said sits waits, and it is indiscriminate. It does differentiate between soldiers and civilians. does not recognise peace or the cessation of hostilities. Some 200 million mines have been laid Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, EI Salvador, Iran, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. It is estimated that there are more than 110 million unexploded landlines spread in some 64 countries around the world. In between two and five million more are laid each year. The vast majority of landmines laid throughout the world have no use-by date. They will sit and wait for years-indeed, decades-until either they are painstakingly cleared or, as is more often the case, they are accidentally detonated. The long-term humanitarian and social costs this global scourge are absolutely astounding. As the minister has said, these insidious weapons kill or lame over 30,000 people each year, and the victims of landmines are overwhelmingly civilian. Many of them, of course, are children. The international community has for many years focused its concern on the elimination of weapons of mass destructionnuclear, chemical and biological weapons. by What we have come to realise in the past decade is that landmines are another weapon mass destruction, a slow-motion weapon of In response to this global humanitarian or concern, the former Labor government committed Australia to work for a global ban on antipersonnel mines, as can be seen in the words of the then foreign minister, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), when he said: Under Labor, Australia is committed to, and will towards, a total ban on the manufacture, stockpiling, use and transfer of antipersonnel norms-in particulandrnines . . . Labor was and is committed to the total scale global elimination of landmines. Our support for such a ban was clearly internationally at the Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference in Vienna in September 1995. It must be said that at that conference there was very little support for a total ban. In the interim, pending the achievement of total prohibition, the and former government undertook not to produce not antipersonnel landmines nor transfer landIt mines to any other country. On 15 April this year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence in (Mr MCLachlan) reaffirmed on behalf of the present government Australia's commitment to work for the objective of a global ban. I use the word 'reaffirmed' quite deliberately. Australia's commitment to this objective has been made absolutely clear by the former government. There is nothing new or novel in this. This is, I should say, and I think minister would agree, a bipartisan objective which I am sure all members of this would support. The other element of the government's ratification landmines policy announced on 15 April the introduction of what was described as unilateral suspension on the operational use APL-antipersonnel landmines-by the we Australian Defence Force. The announcement was presented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence departure from the policy of the former government. It certainly was, knowledge, a great public relations exercise, but it is fair to say that it was purely cosmetic. Australia, as the Minister for Defence was obliged to acknowledge at the time, has not used landmines operationally for many time, years-indeed, not since the Vietnam War. Not one of the millions of mines presently lying around the world was laid by Australian forces, manufactured in Australia or sold by Australia. Significantly, the government announcement of 15 April also included a crucial qualification by the Minister for Defence; namely, the suspension would be reviewed 'in the case of substantial deterioration in our strategic circumstances in which Australia's security was under threat and the denial of an APL capability to the ADF would result in tional Australian casualties and damage to vital infrastructure'. The government at time claimed this to be a great change. Mr Downer today has declared it-you all heard him-to be a major achievement in foreign of policy and humanitarian terms. I put it to the House that that is simply nonsense. The fact of the matter government remains committed to the retention of a stockpile of landmines which, although used only for training and research in peacetime, could be utilised operationally if strategic circumstances change. The government is keeping its options It is committed to work to achieve a global ban. I do not doubt for one moment that and commitment, but the government wants to have its cake and eat it too. It is committed the to retain the option of using landmines if strategic circumstances change, yet it becomes House operationally desirable to do so. Labor is pleased to lend its support to the of the amended protocol IT and the was new protocol IV of the Inhumane Weapons a Convention. As the minister has said, while of the amended protocol IT does not go as far as would wish, it is nevertheless a first step in the process towards a total ban on antipersonnel landmines. The question which the as a government must now face is what can Australia do to further advance the cause of I would acachieving a global ban. As the minister has said today, the failure of the Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference in May this year to agree on a global ban was disappointing. At the same however, the minister would agree that the international support for a global ban has grown considerably since last year, and the government is committed to do all that it can to mobilise international support for eliminating antipersonnel landmines as a weapon of war. A key element in the campaign to secure a total ban is the development of an international consensus that landmines are not a legitimate weapon of war. One way in which Australia can make an enormous contribution to the development of such an international addinorm is by the public destruction of Australia's current stockpile of antipersonnel the landmines, leaving only sufficient modest stocks for ADF training. While other countries continue to use landmines, the ADF must, course, continue to train with them. But the retention of the existing stockpile against the contingency of future operational use is is that the another matter. Public demolition of the current stockpile, with the exception of the minimal stocks required for ADF training, could be carried out in the presence of the international media, and would, I put it to the House, be a tremenopen. dous boost to Australia's campaign for a global ban, a campaign which has gathered continues to gather international support. Against this, of course, is the question of what, if any, strategic advantage the retention of the current stockpile might have for Australia. The answer is, I believe, a very marginal and dubious advantage at best. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was correct when, in an interview in Jakarta on 15 April, he said: . . . as things stand landmines useful strategic weapon from Australia's point of view. He went on to say that the circumstances which the government might consider the option of operational use were unlikely extreme. Those are his words. That is the government's own assessment. Accordingly, after careful consideration, want today to call upon the government conduct a further review of Australia's landForce mine policy with a view to the public destrucmake tion of Australia's present stockpile of antiLabor. personnel landmines, leaving only the is minimum required for training and research 1938-39. purposes. Such an action would be a major contribution to the consolidation of a global norm against the use of landmines, the tial underpinning for a legally binding global ban. Such a policy is, of course, an advance the position taken by Labor when in power. To that, I make the obvious point that the international debate on landmines has moved on from where it was last year. The for a total ban has greatly gathered strength and the government must do all it can to keep the momentum going. Australia can certainly give a lead to the world on this vitally portant issue and we should not hesitate to so. In that, the government would have the absolute and full support of the opposition. Defence Policy",46
175,Mr MCLACHLAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-Today I am our forces. announcing two major initiatives in defence policy designed to increase the bility of the army and the efficiency and effectiveness of the whole Defence organisaRestrur:turing tion. These measures are designed to build Australian Defence Force better able to meet the security challenges of the next few decades. The government's commitment to defence No area of government is more important than maintaining Australia's defence and security. The speed and scale of change in the post-Cold War era mean that there is a constant need to reassess our defence posture and are not seen to be a capabilities. The coalition went to the March 1996 election with clear-cut defence commitments. in We said we would keep defence spending at projected levels and protect the forces from in the budget cuts. We said we would increase spending on the combat elements of the forces by cutting administration and non-combat I activities. In both cases that is exactly what to we are doing. We quarantined the Defence from the other spending cuts we had to to bring down the deficit inherited from But at 1.9 per cent, defence spending at its lowest as a percentage of GDP since At $10.2 billion the 1996-97 Defence budget was in keeping with the previous essengovernment's spending plan. However, we required $125 million a year for the next three years to be cut from administration and directed towards improving combat capabilion ties, training and readiness and personnel retention measures. While these steps were necessary, by themselves they do not go far enough to address pressing financial and campaign capability problems in Defence. In order to maintain and increase the forces' very high level of capability, in order to arm imthem with the most effective technology and do in order to develop the' most streamlined command and control procedures, we need to look at how Defence is structured and how efficiently it is managed. Quite simply, we cannot countenance inefficiency in the Defence organisation. Every dollar spent inefficiently is one we cannot use for improving combat capaPlanning for change The government's first initiative is called the Australian Army. The an army's assessment of its current position is that deficiencies in its structure, training and equipment put barriers in the way of its ability to respond quickly and effectively to defence emergencies. This plan will make the army more responsive, more mobile, better trained and better equipped to handle a wide range of military contingencies-from t1:J.e defence of Australia to offshore operations. Restructuring the Australian Army The task Our key defence aim is to develop forces with the capability to defeat any attack against Australian interests. The defence of our air and sea approaches and our ability to contribute to offshore operations call for a maritime focus for defence. But the Australian Army plays an essential role both in plans for the defence of Australian territory and in possible contributions overseas. The army of the future must be capable of performing a more diverse range of missions, with the firepower, mobility and ready access to information required on the future battlefield. The challenge The army's advice-as well as the advice from military and civilian heads from the rest of Defence-is that its present structure well suited to Australia's defence needs. Some army units are not adequately prepared for combat. In some circumstances the army lacks sufficient combat power to quickly end conflict on terms favourable to us. Some army units suffer from shortages of trained personnel and insufficient equipment. Elements of the force are hollow. While the current structure provides a framework for expansion, it would require substantial warning time and financial expenditure to mobilise for major conflict. There are insufficient night devices, command and control aids and mobility available for widely dispersed, mobile operations on the modem battlefield where high precision weapons may be used. The present army structure is inadequate to meet the demands of widespread concurrent operations. The divisional structure brings together combat elements such as infantry, armour, artillery and engineers into separate organisations with their own command structures. This arrangement was suitable for the concentrated battlefields of World War II but it is not necessarily suited for modem conflict. There are also shortcomings in the capability and readiness of much of the Army Reserves. With some exceptions, like the regional force surveillance. units, reserve units are understaffed, poorly equipped and have low readiness levels. Reform goals The army problems I have described did not develop overnight. They are the result of more than a decade of neglect on the part of the previous government. I have made a point in recent months of giving credit where it is due when the previous government made worthwhile initiatives. The decisions to acquire Collins submarines and ANZAC frigates, the commercial support program and the commercialisation of Commonwealth defence industries were all valuable reforms. However, the army is not one area where credit is due to the previous government. Labor did not seriously address the difficult issue of army reform. The government is therefore setting in train a series of discrete trials for reshaping the is not army which are designed to achieve the following goals. We are aiming to eliminate hollowness in army units, thereby reducing the overall number of units, and redistributing personnel and equipment so that all established units can deploy within shorter readiness times. We will increase the number and effectiveness of combat troops by strengthening the contribution of reservist or part-time soldiers. Most reserve personnel will have an initial six weeks full-time training. Thereafter, ongoing training will be increased to an fighting average of 50 days per year. Infantry, armour, artillery and engineers will be integrated into task forces. This principle is known as embedding. The resulting forces will be independent and largely self-contained. They will be able to deploy to different regions in Australia and to defend these areas. We will create a base for adopting new technology to modernise the force. We will develop proposals for acquiring new equipment aimed at increasing the mobility and firepower of the force, including helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft and more protected vehicles for infantry mobility. Higher readiness elements will contain more full-time personnel. We will ensure that regular forces will be able to be deployed at short notice. The application of these principles will of themselves significantly increase army capability. Capital equipment investment after the year 2000 will be guided by these principles, as well as the lessons learned over the next few years, to further strengthen army capabilities. The shift from the traditional divisional structure towards flatter and more responsive task force structures will create units which will be flexible, capable of a range of independent operations and better able to operate in concert with the navy and the air force. The reconnaissance, mobility and embedded firepower of the task forces should result in a versatile structure able to operate effectively in both widely dispersed and conventional operations. They should also be able to sustain themselves in the field for longer because those elements needed to support and sustain combat elements will be readily available. The plan A number of assumptions underlie the concept I have outlined. Key among these is that the reserve component can be expanded, its standard of training increased and readiness improved. In considering reforms of this scale, the government has an obligation to ensure that change is introduced gradually and with the confidence that trialling and evaluation will bring. While we are restructuring, we will retain the Special Air Service Regiment's counterterrorist capability and the Townsville based Rapid Deployment Force at existing high levels of readiness. This will ensure that current options to respond to short notice contingencies are maintained. Therefore, the government will trial and evaluate these new army concepts using selected formations and units. As concepts are proven, they will be more widely applied. Members may be aware that the plan for Restructuring the Australian Army draws on an internal Defence study called the Army in the 21st Century. In Restructuring the Australian Army, the government has sought to achieve a more immediate increase in readiness and capabilities, and has chosen not to reduce the size of army's full-time combat force. The government's plan achieves a prudent balance of reform and evaluation designed both to increase capabilities now and to lay the foundations for further strengthening after the year 2000. On this basis, the army has already begun to restructure. The decision to end the ready reserve scheme and to increase part-time capabilities is an integral part of these changes. The army's share of the $125 million annual administrative savings detailed in the government's election platform will, over the next three years, enhance capabilities including night vision equipment, radios, satellite navigation equipment, laser rangefinders and simulators. To increase overall readiness, it will be necessary to raise personnel numbers in the combat force. This will be achieved by moving up to 1,000 full-time troops from base support areas into the combat force and by integrating fulland part-time units. Planning has commenced to combine the Ready Reserve 6th Brigade and the part-time 7th Brigade in Queensland into a task force to test integration options. Ready Reserve soldiers will transfer to the full-time army or join part-time uni ts in their home state. The regular 1st Brigade will continue its move from New South Wales to the Northern Territory. In addition to developing concepts for the defence of the north, the brigade will trial unit organisation and command arrangements. The headquarters of the reserve 5th Brigade will be moved from Lidcombe to Holsworthy. It will take command of the full time combat elements remaining in Sydney after 1st Brigade headquarters moves to Darwin. In Sydney theÂ· full-time 4th Battalion will be increased in strength and converted to a regular commando battalion. This unit will develop a counter-terrorist capability in the longer term. In Victoria, the reserve 4th Brigade will have priority for additional resources. There will be a significant increase in full-time personnel within the 4th Brigade. Part-time recruiting, training and employment practices will be trialled and evaluated in Victoria-a key activity in defining the most effective ways to revitalise the reserve force nationally. The reserve 9th Brigade, with units located in both South Australia and Tasmania, will receive a small increase in fulland part-time numbers as a result of the closure of the ready reserve scheme. The 13th Brigade will be the focus for revitalising reserve combat units in Western Australia. Within 18 months, we will raise an integrated full-time/part-time battalion in Perth with the addition of a regular infantry company to the 16th Battalion. Along with the continued presence of the Special Air Service Regiment, this amounts to a major increase in the army presence in Western Australia. At the end of this statement. I will table a map detailing these changes on a state-by-state basis. The approximate cost of these initiatives will be $60 million in 1996-97, $120 million in 1997-98 and $200 million in 1998-99. These costs will be met from within the Defence budget reflecting the army component of savings from our $125 million cuts to administrative costs, savings from the closure of the ready reserve scheme and from reallocations within the army budget. The outcome By 2000, the army's capabilities will be significantly enhanced. The viability of revitalising part-time army forces will have been demonstrated in Victoria and south-east Queensland. Full-time personnel will have been redistributed, and a large amount of essential equipment purchased. A substantial strengthening of units will have taken place in Queensland and Western Australia. We are aiming to create an army in which structural and technological adaptation is regarded as an essential norm. Following trial and evaluation, the army will further modernise after the year 2000 with the introduction of a new range of high technology equipment. Defence Efficiency Review The second initiative I am announcing today is to establish a Defence Efficiency Review. At a time of great financial pressure in Defence, we must ensure that the absolute minimum necessary is spent on administration and that Defence focuses on its core functions. I have appointed a panel of eminent figures from the public and private sector under the chairmanship of Dr Malcolm MCIntosh, Chief Executive of the CSIRO, to review Defence management and financial practices. Dr MCIntosh has been Chief of Capital Procurement in Defence; Secretary to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce; and Chief of Defence Procurement for the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence. He is internationally respected for his expertise in defence policy matters. Other members of the Senior Review Panel are: Mr Ian Burgess, Chairman of the AMP Society since 1994; Mr John Stone, former Secretary of the Treasury and former Senator for Queensland; Mr Andrew Michelmore, General Manager for Business Development, Planning and Technology, Western Mining Corporation Resources; Vice-Admiral Robert Walls, Vice-Chief of the ADF; and Dr Richard Brabin Smith, Chief Defence Scientist in charge of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. Terms of reference The terms of reference for the review ask Dr MCIntosh's panel to identify key Defence management processes; to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of these processes; and to make reform proposals ensuring that Defence management: is carried out in the most efficient and effective manner possible; eliminates duplication between and within Defence programs; takes a rigorous approach to defining 'core' and 'non-core' business; makes appropriate use of commercialisation options; and reflects, where appropriate, modern business practices. I have not given Dr MCIntosh a specific savings target; indeed the review cutting exercise, but rather one designed to ensure that our management processes are as efficient and effective as possible. I do not want to constrain the work of the review panel by setting any savings figure. However, I do expect that significant savings will emerge as a result of the review panel's reform proposals. Savings will be retained by Defence and programmed to enhance combat capabilities. It will not be the role of the efficiency review to make recommendations about force structure or strategic outlook, that is something being explored by other areas of the Defence organisation. It is, however, the role of the review to examine all major departmental functions. The Senior Review Panel should test underlying assumptions about current Defence management processes. I have said to Dr MCIntosh that I fully expect that he will find it necessary in some cases to propose fundamental changes to ensure that Defence management is as flexible' efficient and effective as possible to meet future strategic challenges. In setting up this review I have deliberately refrained from too narrowly defining the areas in which-or the means by which-Dr MCIntosh's panel should pursue its work. I have asked the Secretary to Defence, Mr Tony Ayers, and the Chief of the Defence Force, General John Baker, to provide expert senior staff for a secretariat and for eight or so separate teams comprising both Defence and non-Defence people, each of which will review specific management activities at the direction of the senior panel. The reform task Among the key areas which will be considered for closer review are: capital equipment procurement; personnel management; corporate administration; facilities management and holdings; regional support; industry policy; provision of advice to government; logistics; health and personnel services; recruiting; science; training and financial management. There will be sufficient flexibility in the review to identify and pursue new areas for investigation should they emerge during the study. No one should doubt the is not a costurgency of this study. There are a great many things which the Defence organisation does very well. The ADF and civilian bureaucracy has many highly trained, motivated people. With this skills base, we maintain one of the most formidable and capable military forces in the Asia-Pacific. But there is no large organisation in the country which cannot be made more efficient through a rigorous external review. My experience is that people in Defence are keen to see this process under way and will work hard to ensure its success. The Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) and I take this defence reform challenge very seriously. We are sure that the non-Defence and private sector representatives on the Senior Review Panel-who form the majority of the panelwill add impetus and a fresh perspective to the process. But I am equally confident that the Defence representatives will give a defin- . ing sense of direction to the review. The Defence budget papers show that some $2 billion of our annual $10 billion outlay is spent on areas directly designated as combat forces. Of the remainder, about $3 billion is spent on new equipment, facilities and the modernisation of ADF capabilities. That leaves around half of the budget, $5 billion, spent on everything else-including areas absolutely essential for Defence to function, such as logistic support, intelligence, communications, medical support, industry programs, recruiting costs, everything down to stationery and postage stamps. The task for the Defence Efficiency Review is to determine what value for money we get from spending in all these areas. I have no doubt that Dr MCIntosh's panel will find as many areas of high-quality management as it will find areas in need of reform. I have asked that the completed report of the Defence Efficiency Review is handed to me on 10 March 1997. I will report to the parliament after that time. I have asked the Senior Review Panel to propose an implementation strategy giving effect to its recommendations. In developing what are two of the largest and most ambitious reform proposals in this portfolio for some years, it is appropriate me to record my appreciation of Defence senior management for its work. The rewards of Restructuring the Australian Army and the efficiency review will be the development of a more flexible, efficient and capable defence force-a defence force better able to protect Australia's interests into the next century. I table a copy of an explanatory map showing the army restructuring plan on a state-by-state basis.",48
176,Mr BEVIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-The statement delivered by the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) is important for a number of reasons. It is, in fact, the first significant statement on defence that the new government has issued, certainly in the parliament, and it covers two very important matters: the Defence Efficiency Review, which was foreshadowed some time ago in the media, and a restructuring of the Australian Army, which has been long discussed and which grows from the Army 21 review. There were great expectations about the vision that particularly the Army 21 review might produce for the future direction of army into the 21st century, and I must say I think it has been sadly lacking in the six pages that we have been provided with as part of this statement. I had anticipated there would be a significant document akin to a force structure review because, in fact, that is precisely what we see here. It is a review of the force structure of army, and in previous governments changes of that magnitude have warranted a full force structure review document. Unfortunately, what we have on this occasion is a six-page statement with no detail and with no strategic analysis to support the basis upon which the structure exists. I think that is lamentable and I would encourage the minister to look at that matter. I have no doubt documents of that sort exist. I think it is wholly appropriate that versions of that suitable for public debate should be produced and made available. I want to deal initially with the question of the Defence Efficiency Review, if for no other reason than I think it is the easier of the two to deal with. I must say at the outset that for I have no objection to the establishment of a review of the sort proposed by the government and announced by the minister today. It is, of course, important that efficiency and effectiveness are guaranteed in any organisation. It is sometimes difficult to ensure optimum efficiency and effectiveness in larger organisations, and that is so in the public sector as in the private sector. I think it is worth recording that the importance of efficiency and effectiveness in the matter of armed conflict is nowhere better understood than by those in uniform who put their lives on the line to defend the nation. I suspect they, too, would welcome a review that genuinely sets about improving efficiency and effectiveness in a fair and proper way. I do have some latent concern which arises from an earlier comment the minister made shortly after the election. He referred to Defence as being a business like any other business. I say to the minister and to the government that that clearly is not the case. Defence is not a business like any other business. There may well be management tools that are appropriate to both, but the optimum defence for Australia would not be achieved by adopting the management style and structures of Coca-Cola, the Ford Motor Co. or Western Mining. There are significant differences in the way in which good and proper defence administration should be applied. That said, I repeat my endorsement of the establishment of a review. I welcome the appointment of Dr Malcolm MCIntosh as chair of the review. I have not had the pleasure of personally meeting Dr MCIntosh, but he has a very impressive record and all who have met him and whom I know regard him in high esteem. I have no doubt that he will do a good job in chairing that review. I do, howeyer, want to put on the record my concerns about the appointment of former Senator John Stone. I believe that appointment is inappropriate and unwise. The review is an important one. The integrity of that review and the way in which it is seen by the public and, more importantly, by those in uniform is important. It should be above party politics and it should be above reproach. The difficulty in appointing someone who has clearly been involved in the political process, I think, is folly. What is more, I am not sure what qualities the former senator is going to bring to the position. The simple fact is that, during the three years in which he was a senator in this place and had the opportunity to participate in defence debates, Hansard does not record one speech he made in relation to defence policy matters. It also seems to me unfortunate that the wealth of talent which exists among senior executives throughout Australian business who have had some exposure to Defence, either through previous full-time service or through service in the general reserves, was not utilised. There is a wealth of experience that has not been picked up in that review. I think that is unfortunate. I doubt the value of the appointment of ex-Senator Stone. I am quite sure the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) was not consulted about his appointment. I suspect that he would have been less than enamoured of the selection. The only person I public office who championed the cause of John Stone is a former Premier of Queensland, Joh Bjelke-Petersen. I do not think it an appropriate appointment and I want to make that clear. I also urge the minister in relation to review to make public the outcome of the report, again in a form that is appropriate public distribution. It is important when a significant review of this kind is undertaken in an important government department that the parliament and the public have an opportunity to know what is said and an opportunity to comment on that. Related to that, I should also note that cost of the review has not been mentioned in the statement. I invite the minister to comment at the earliest opportunity on the pated costs involved in the operations of the review. The review does have my support. I wish it well in its earnest deliberations. Let me now tum to the substantial question contained within the statement-that is, the restructuring of the Australian Army; the Army 21 review revised. It is important to recall that the Army 21 review, which was the genesis of this statement today, started during the last parliament. It was, however, an quite initiative taken within army. It was and should be a military study, not a political exercise. I want to quote from the Asia-Pacific Defence Reporter, a fairly well-known defence publication, from May-June this year. When talking about Army 21, it said: Anny 21 is a HQADF initiative with the full support of the CDF and his staff and as such does not suffer from the political constraints of a government-commissioned review and for the first time the Anny has been able to conduct a major review of its force structure with an appreciation based on military professionalism. So it was. The former Labor government made a conscious decision to see a review of the Australian Army structure, its capability and its preparedness be undertaken with clear military guidelines in place and without political interference. That is the basis upon which it was undertaken and I know that was the basis upon which it was conducted by can recall in high army personnel. We should recognise the contribution of army personnel in the work they did. The is army deserves to be congratulated for the way in which it went about examining its own large structure. With all the history that the this army has, it went about doing that with a clean slate. It had a look at what it saw as the for needs for defence of Australia into the 21st century and the role for army in that. With a clean slate, it set about building from the ground up a structure that would best defend Australia. Having done that, it is a matter of some concern to me and the opposition that the the Army 21 document has never seen the light of day. It is no secret that major difficulties have occurred between the minister, the anticiexecutive wing and the Defence Force in relation to detail of Army 21. The fact that communications went backwards and forwards on Army 21 for some four months or so is evidence of that difficulty. It is appropriate that the army's preferred model-the Army 21 report-be made public. There should have been a green paper produced to enable proper parliamentary debate on these issues. It is quite clear that the document before us today is not the document that the army put forward. It varies from the proposal provided by army in a number of significant areas. The minister should clear the air and ensure that the Army 21 document is made available for public consideration so that we can view the difference between what the government has now determined it will adopt and what it was that the army said the defence of Australia required. It is important to state the obvious in a sense that defence of Australian citizens is the fundamental responsibility of any government. When you are talking about something as basic and fundamental as the restructure of the army of the country and when the army, after a period of some 18 months of exhaustive investigation, produces a model which it believes is required, free of political interferbudget ence, it is wholly appropriate that that study be made available for public debate. That has not occurred and it should. However, in the statement provided by the minister there is some welcome commitment to improved capability. The direction that has been adopted in relation to improved capability is supported by me and the opposition. It does continue an ongoing process of former Labor ministers Beazley and Ray. Of course, it is the responsibility of any incumbent government to ensure capability is at its highest level possible. The concept of integrated task forces has been raised in the document encompassing armour, artillery engineers on a smaller scale than a division. That proposal has merit. It is one which has been debated for some time. Some would argue that it is not a lot different to a fully equipped combat ready brigade. In any event, it would be useful if the document provided a little bit more detail to flesh out exactly what sort of composition that task force might have. I might repeat that, when I read the statement, I was waiting to see the document that fleshed these things out. I anticipated there may have been another document which was the force structure review for the army, which was also going to be tabled. It has not been tabled, but it ought to be, because this is only a small part of the detail that is required if there is to be any intelligent debate of the issues that the minister has announced. However, the statement provided by the minister has, I think, a number of political and military shortcomings. The coalition made great play during the election campaign, and the minister repeated it in his statement today, that it was not about cutting funds to defence. In fact, the fine print of the Liberal Party's policy and the fine print of what the minister had to say today was not that defence would not be cut but that there would be no cut in the forward estimates. There is a world of difference between the two. That world of difference was never made plain by the Liberal Party or coalition during the election campaign. But it was made very plain to the defence community when the was finalised, because it did include a cut on the previous year. Worse than that, it did include a cut of $165 million against the forward estimates which we provided. That cut of $165 million on the forward estimates is only the tip of the iceberg, though. The government's own National Commission of Audit includes a recommendation dealing with efficiency targets required of departments. It says: Minimum across the board efficiency targets of at least 10 per cent should be set over 3 years from 1996-97 for the administration of all Commonwealth programs (induding the Department of Defence . . . There is a requirement from the government's own National Commission of Audit that Defence produce a 10 per cent efficiency gain over three years. That is a 10 per cent efficiency gain on a $10 billion budget. The minister so far has spoken about $125 million of that $1 billion that his own government audit requires him to find. The paper makes no reference to the rest of that. Until those matters are cleared up, it becomes difficult to have any meaningful debate about the future direction of the Defence Force structure, be that army or one of the other services. The minister has referred to the fact that there are a number of elements within the existing army force structure which are hollow. That is an issue that has been recognised for some time. There are two sides to that coin. There is the question of how many units you want to have or can afford to have at short readiness notice. There is also the question of what sort of structure you want if, down the track, you need to have a significant expansion of the force. When you strike the balance between those two, in a constrained fiscal situation, you will inevitably produce some units which will be hollow at the current time designed for expansion to deal with contingencies at a later date. It is a totally legitimate thing for the government to want to realign the balance, but in realigning the balance it should ensure that the aggregate capability of the Defence Force-in this case the army-is not disadvantaged. One of the things that amazes me about the minister's decision-and he has repeated it today in his statement-is that, having expressed concern about hollowness within the army, one of the first decisions this government took was to abolish one of the most capable units within the entire armed forces: the ready reserve. The minister has no doubt seen the same charts that I have here, which talk about readiness of different units. The simple fact is, as he well knows, that the ready reserve was the most ready force within army to go to war after the SAS and the Ready Deployment Force in Townsville, yet he abolished it. It was on a shorter notice to go to war than a regular army brigade, yet he abolished it. Today he has expressed concern about hollowness within the defence forces, but he has abolished one of the most capable brigades within the army force structure. There is no sense in that. There is no sense at all. After the election I had, in fact, hoped that you might take a fresh look at it. I think you, like some of your predecessors on your side, became trapped by the ill-informed political allies of the Liberal Party rather than listen the advice you were getting from the army and from the Department of Defence. I, like a number of people, know that the defence forces did not' advise or support the abolition of the ready reserve. It was a decision taken for political reasons, and it was a foolish decision. I would strongly urge you to look at that issue afresh. There is a commitment to increase reserve and permanent force soldier effectiveness. To the extent that that is able to be accomplished, that will be supported. On 1 January this year, on behalf of the government at that time when I was parliamentary secretary, I announced decisions for individual readiness requirements to apply equally to full-time and part-time members of the army. To the extent that this announcement today extends that, I would welcome it. Your statement, Minister, makes reference to six weeks training required for general reserves. Although you do not make mention of the type of training that will involve, I assume it is both recruit and initial employment training. Again, the document that I was hoping might accompany this would help flesh some of that out. I would put to you that it is six weeks training for the general reserve-which you trumpet as an achievement-against six months training that was provided to the ready reserves that you just abolished. On top of the six months initial employment tr!lining and recruit training that the ready. reserves got, they had a further continuous period of six months full-time service. So you are on the one hand abolishing a 12-month full-time service brigade and replacing it with a group that is going to get six weeks training. Somehow you believe that is going to improve the capability of the Defence Force. You have also made some reference in your statement to 50 days being the number of days that the general reserve will now be required to participate per annum. I would appreciate some guidance-I am sure the public would as well in relation to this debate-about whether that 50 days is like the current 30 days that applies to general reserves: that is, some general reserves will do to 70 days, some will do 10 and some will do 30, Is that 50 days a minimum? Is it a pulsory requirement? Is it the average you anticipate the general reserves will meet? Ready reserves at the moment are required to undertake 50 days; that is compulsory for the dearly. ready reserves. But then you abolished the ready reserves, didn't you, Minister? Mr MCLachlan-Indeed we did. And it was very expensive.",53
177,Mr BEVIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"That is simply not true. In relation to the 50 days that you have introtask duced for general reserve requirements, your statement makes no mention whatsoever of the nature of that 50-day break-up. Is it going to be simply more days on a Tuesday night that they turn up for parade or will there an increase in block training requirement? In required. other words, will we now see 30 days operational training for G Res units, or is there simply going to be an increase in the number of days but not an improvement in the type training that is done? If you are proposing simply increase the number of days they turn up but are not proposing to alter the type training they undertake, you will do nothing to improve the quality of the training or the capability of those units. These are things should have been in the accompanying docuefficiency ment. You have made vague reference in the document to 'improved readiness', but is no clarity as to whether you are talking about individual readiness of the soldiers or unit capability and readiness. And, of course, you made no reference to time. Are we now talking about improved readiness of units that units will no longer be on 360 days? 180 days now the agreed maximum or is it 90 days? There is no clarity in the document have produced as to whether you have adseems dressed these issues. Let me also raise a few questions about task forces. I have already commented about vagueness in relation to the size of task forces, but there is no detail in this document that identifies how these task with remaining structures. What, for example, will be the role of deployable divisional headquarters to brigade headquarters? You make reference to the mobility of the task forces being essential-and of course it is. comLand and air mobility of a task force was integral to the basis upon which the Army 21 project was proceeding, yet your government has derailed Project Mulgara and cost industry There is no mention in your document of dollars to support any new projects to meet the mobility requirement. Equally, the need for accurate aerial close-in fire supportwhich was an integral part of the concept of forces-is glossed over in your document. Scant reference was made to it. Little or no effort was made to identify the equipment that would be required to facilitate that mobility and close-in air support for the task be forces, much less any reference to the funds . You took the decision to amalgamate 6 Brigade and 7 Brigade in Brisbane. Having abolished the ready reserve brigade some of months ago, it is high time that you gave to some direction as to what will replace it as 6 Brigade ceases to exist in its current form in of about three months time. Delaying until now-nearly the end of the year-a clear statement about its future structure has done that little to improve either the organisational or the morale of people concerned. It seems to me-again the document is a bit scant-that in combining 6 Brigade and 7 there Brigade you have reduced the number of battalions in Brisbane from five to three. According to the organisational chart, it would appear as though one of those battalions is being shifted to Perth, but there seems so to be a reduction in the number of battalions Is by one. In any event, the much vaunted policy that your party took to the last election you of establishing a 6 Regular Battalion now to have been jettisoned. Again, there is no comment about these matters in the docuthe ment, and it should be there. I do not share your optimism about the way in which the ready reserve people at 6 Brigade will participate in the reshaped army that you have forces will sit announced today. Of the 3,000 or so people in the ready reserve, I believe about 2,400 have already opted for their preferred choice. About 2,000 have opted to go to the general reserve and about 400 have opted to go to the regulars. The rest are still trying to make up their minds. The simple fact is that those people who are in the ready reserve made a conscious decision not to join the general reserve. When they enlisted in the ready reserve they could, had they wished, have gone to the general reserve at that time. They took a conscious decision not to be in the general reserve. The sad fact is that many of those people who are in the ready reserve now will be scattered across to their home towns to join the local general reserve battalion, but before the year is out many of those people will reassess their desire to be in uniform at all. The changes you have announced today will be inadequate to retain those ready reserve people in general reserve units throughout the country. The net result of that will be a loss of very highly skilled, highly trained and highly motivated people. Your statement also makes reference to a new full-time unit for commandos. That is a worthwhile initiative which I am happy to lend my support to. It is appropriate for it to be based in Sydney and I think that, in the lead-up to the 2000 games, it has a lot of merit. I would welcome-as I am sure a number of others would-some clarity as to what you intend with the existing commando unit which is, of course, a G Res unit. That is not mentioned at all in the document, but it is clearly an issue that I know a number of people would want to raise. The minister has said that the government in promoting this document is not seeking to reduce the size of army's full-time combat force, and the table which accompanies the chart includes numbers that would support that. However, again, the current facts belie the rhetoric. The current budget reduces full time uniform strength in the ADF by 1,000 personnel. Your current budget reduces the number of full-time army personnel in uniform by 300. I would be quite happy if in reality your statement bears fruition and those l,OOO out of the ADF and the 300 out of the army that the budget said we will lose are not lost. I welcome also the commitment to the Holsworthy base. I assume that the minister's commitment to Holsworthy means the prospect of Sydney's second airport now being located in Holsworthy is somewhat diminished. Finally, there are a number of matters I wish to raise in relation to the general reserve. One of the keys to your announcement is that capability and readiness of the general reserve will be improved. Your document glosses over the very significant difficulties associated with that. Many of the things that are said in your document in relation to the general reserve echo sentiments that were in the 1994 defence white paper on that matter. As with the white paper, you will have to deal with the problems associated with conflict with those general reservists' private lives. You will have to deal with the question of what compensation will be paid to employers if indeed you do want those general reserves to train together for, say, a month in block time, which would enhance their capability. Those questions are important. Will there be legislation to protect the employment rights of reserves? If there is not going to be legislation to protect the employment rights of reserves, how do you intend to address those issues, or was Victoria selected as the trial for this activity because that state does happen to have legislation that protects the rights of reserves employed in state jurisdictions? Will there be part-time remuneration in line with the pro rata basis of their work? Will it be genuine part time to include leave, superannuation, health care, dental care and pro rata pay? Once you get into that minefield, will you then ensure that reserves' pay is taxed or not taxed? These are the detailed questions which your six-page statement simply ignored. It is all well and good to stand here with platitudes and a six-page statement that addresses the headline issues, but it does nothing unless the detail is actually in the meat of the document. The document you presented today has none of that, Minister. It needs to be clarified. You need to produce a force structure review for army. The sooner you do that, the sooner some credibility will be restored to the government's attitude towards army. I am afraid the performance in the last four months in relation to Army 21 and army generally has done naught to help that.  order. Both the minister and the shadow minister have suggested this is a most important ministerial statement.

187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Order! There is no point of order.,61
188,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would take this opportunity to speak briefly to the motion moved by the Chief Government Whip to refer two matters to the Main Committee. I have no particular difficulty with the two matters that are proposed by the chamber to be moved to the Main Committee. I have no particular objection to the income tax bills being considered by the Main Committee, nor the report consideration of which has been proposed. But we are now contemplating a reference of matters to the Main Committee, and the House should again note the fundamental way in which the government, through its numbers in this House, has fundamentally changed the nature and the operation of the Main Committee. That occurred in this House when last week the government, by way of gag and by way of division, referred the euthanasia bill to the Main Committee. The response that we saw less than a week ago was action by members on this side of the chamber to refer back to this chamber the appropriation bills, using the precise mechanism which the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) used by way of suspension in this House to overridenamely, the capacity of one voice in the Main Committee to refer a matter back to this chamber. The fundamental basis on which the Main Committee was established was that it was done by the agreement of all members of this House. That has been the basis on which this House has proceeded with the Main Commitshould tee, until the Leader of the House, with gag and division, destroyed that basis last week. The Leader of the House, by proceeding in the way in which he did in referring the euthanasia bill to the Main Committee, has destroyed the trust which over a number of years this chamber had in the Main Committee. Members opposite should understand that revisit. the basis on which the Main Committee has operated has been destroyed by the actions of the Leader of the House and by those on that side of the chamber supporting him in gag arid division; and that this House, particularly members on this side, will be very cautious and very chary in referring matters from this chamber to the Main Committee in What did we see last week? We saw last week, by suspension motion, this House point of order. overriding the quorum in the Main Committee and the capacity of one voice to dissent in Main Committee. Mr Reith-You just want to repeat the arguments of last week.",61

192,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEE,"Last week, after the Leader of the HouseMr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. On a point relevance, the member has said that he has no objection to the substance of this motion. He is clearly simply attempting to revisit last week's debate. Now, out of his own mouth, he has made it quite clear that ""his remarks are irrelevant to the matter before the chair. He is simply wasting the time of the House, and he be required to be relevant. Mr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: the motion that was moved by the Leader of the House last week makes provision 'until the parliament otherwise provides'. That is, the parliament is allowed to revisit that motion at any time because his motion saysMr Reith-But this is not a motion to Mr Latham-The member for Perth is allowed to talk about the Main Committee in the context of things that have been happening in this House-and when you make a provision that the House can return to this matter, then the member is totally in order in future. the context of his remarks.",62
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,There is no,62
194,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEE,"Thank you, Mr the Deputy Speaker. Last week in the course of debate on the gag, the guillotine, the declaration of the appropriation bills Nos. 1 and 2 and the parliamentary appropriations being declared urgent, the Leader of the House said the former government established the a Main Committee. The former government did establish the Main Committee; this chamber established the Main Committee. The basis upon which this chamber established the Main Committee was that one voice was sufficient to return a matter back to this chamber. The second thing that the Leader of the House said in the course of his contribution to the gagging, the guillotine and the declaration of urgencyMr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker: my point of order is again on relevance. The member is now simply going over a debate we have already had. That is clearly out of order. It is clearly irrelevant to the motion before the House. It is simply a time wasting exercise to revisit a debate which the parliament has already had. He ought to make it clear whether or not this is just an attempt to delay the further proceedings of the House.",62
195,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEE,"On the point of order: this is a motion to refer matters to the Main Committee. I am perfectly entitled to talk about the operations, the practice, the conventions and the standing of the Main Committee. If I can't talk about it on a motion to refer matters to the Main Committee, when can I?",63
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,There is no point of order. I would ask the honourable member for Perth to finalise his statement so that we can proceed.,63
197,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEE,I am very grateful for your conduct in the chair and I am quite happy to bring my remarks to conclusion. The second matter that the Leader of the House raised in the course of the appropriation debate was that the budget had been referred to the Main Committee with agreement and that was a sensible process. The point is that this House has referred matters to the Main Committee by way of agreement. Last week the Leader of the House destroyed that by referring an important matter to the Main Committee by way of gag and by way of division. In the course of doing that you have destroyed the basis of the Main Committee. You need to understand there is no trust on this side of the House. You cannot expect that you will find very many matters being referred by this chamber up to the Main Committee in future.,63

Mr Albanese-On the point of order: I clearly rose to my feet in order to speak to this motion. You had not put the motion before the chair and I wish to make a contribution to this debate.",63
200,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEE,I want to thank the members for their contributions. I look forward to debating these matters that we have referred today to the Main Committee.,63
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,"Order! Will honourable members resume their seats. I called honourable members to vote on the motion and I apologise to the honourable member for Grayndler. I was not aware that he was on his feet, but I had put the motion and the motion will go ahead. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL Consideration in Detail Consideration resumed from 14 October. Schedule 12.  to: (6) Schedule 12, Part 5, items 26 and 27, page 111 (lines 29 to 32), omit the items. Schedule agreed to. Schedule 13 agreed to. Schedule 14.  p.m.)-Schedule 14 limits the payment of child disability allowance arrears to three months before a claim is made. The Labor Party will be opposing this measure. We think it is unduly harsh on parents who fail to recognise the nature of illness for a significant period of time. There are obviously going to be a number of cases of that. I indicated in my speech at the second reading stage that we would opposeÂ· this schedule and we do so now.",63
202,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"As this is a matter the opposition sees as of some substance and weight, let me make this comment. The basis for the child disability allowance is that the child requires substantially more care and attention than a child without a disability. Currently, payment of arrears can be for a period of up to 12 months prior to the date of lodgement of the claim if the child has a disability and has needed substantially more care and attention throughout this period. There were no other equivalent provisions in the Social Security Act allowing such generous payments of arrears. The payments of arrears for periods before a claim is lodged will still be allowed; however, these will be limited to situations where an earlier claim for a similar payment has been made and the customer qualified for a child disability allowance at the time. As it is particularly difficult to assess qualification periods in the past, these arrears payments will be limited to a maximum of three months. This is a sensible measure having regard to the fact that the child disability allowance is not a compensation payment and that this change will bring the payment more into line with the practice adopted for other social security payments. The change will be effective from 1 January; therefore, customers who are granted prior to that date will not be affected by the change.",64
203,Mr LEE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), who is at the table, read out those remarks. He has a reputation for being someone who is on the small '1' liberal wing of the Liberal Party and a man of charity. I say to my colleague that we hope that is the case. I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt that he does not entirely believe and honestly and sincerely support some of the remarks that he has had to read out tonight. A government that has $8,000 for a built-in wardrobe at the Lodge should be able to afford to backdate the child disability allowance to 12 months for families who have disabled children. The example that we have mentioned in many of the opposition contributions in this debate is: what happens if a family discovers that they have a child who has a hearing disability? Often you are not aware of many of these disabilities until many months have passed. Often families have to go to some expense before they can satisfy the department that their child does have a disability, and there are extra costs involved in taking their kids to see specialists, to get down to their local community health service. We simply say not just to this minister, who we hope would be sympathetic to this argument, but to the government as a whole that if you can afford $8,000 for a built-in wardrobe for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) why can't you afford to backdate the allowance to 12 months for families with disabled kids?

Schedules 15-19-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Schedule 20.  p.m.)-The opposition opposes this schedule. This is the one that seeks to impose a deeming rate on small bank deposits. When we AYES introduced the extended deeming system last year, we specifically excluded small deposits of under $2,000 for singles and $4,000 for couples. This proposal is to apply to pensioners and allowees. The reality is that a good many people in this category will not have access to accounts paying the deeming rate. Consequently, these people who are obviously highly disadvantaged already will suffer further disadvantage. Consequently, we are opposing this schedule.",64
204,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"I will speak on the matter if I am being encouraged to do so, but I thought there was a desire to break for dinner. We regard these amendments as a small change, building on the extended deeming rules. We think it makes the position simpler and easier to understand. It is a system that is more equitable. Most customers will not be affected. The amendments will make no difference to customers who are already getting five per cent or more in relation to relevant money. Further, customers with relatively few assets and small levels of private income will continue to receive a full pension. Because of the income test free areas, the maximum possible loss in the pension is $2 per fortnight. The average loss is expected to be less than SOc per fortnight. The pensioners affected by the amendments set out in schedule 20 have plenty of time to reinvest their money in accounts that will earn more than five per cent, which means that they will be better off despite the small PAIRS reduction in their pension. That is the background to the matter.",65
205,Mr LEE,NOES,"-Government members should understand what the Minister / for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), who represents the minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), is saying. Mr Costello-Choir practice is on; it's too late for you.",65
206,Mr LEE,NOES,"It is clear from the interjections from people such as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) that they agree with imposing this additional impost on aged pensioners and on veterans. The minister's excuse that the system is currently too complicated and that as a result we have to increase the deeming rate on the first $2,000 that pensioners have is really an outrageous twist of logic that he has brought to the debate tonight. So many people out there have a few thousand dollars put aside for their burial money. Government members-Oh!",65
207,Mr LEE,NOES,"Let me repeat it: their burial money. Despite the interjections from the honourable member from Queensland at the back, what you are doing is forcing pensioners to go to all the trouble of trying to find a financial institution that will pay them this five per cent. Many of these people do not have access to a large number of financial institutions that will give them this choice. This minister claims that the current system is too complicated for pensioners to understand and that as a result they are going to be slugged with a five per cent deeming rate. This is just going to cause so much distress and turmoil. Mr Anthony interjecting",66
208,Mr LEE,NOES,"The honourable member for Richmond at the back interjects, making it clear that he is not supporting the pensioners who live in his electorate. I can assure the honourable member for Richmond that my father, who happens to live in his electorate, will be the first person I ring to let him know that his local member is going to makeMr Anthony interjecting",66
209,Mr LEE,NOES,"Not only did he not vote for you, he worked against you. I can tell the honourable member that when my father finds out that you are imposing this extra five per cent deeming rate on him, he will talk to all his colleagues and friends to make sure that the honourable member has even less support at the next election. For all of these reasons, we are going to make sure that every pensioner right throughout the country is made aware of the fact that this government, having expressed opposition to deeming in days gone by, is seeking to extend it and make it more onerous for all of those pensioners who might have a little bit of money put aside in an account to allow them to be buried with a bit of dignity. You people are saying that you are going to make it that much harder for these people to have their affairs put in order. Why shouldn't a pensioner couple have the right to put $4,000 aside in an account without being forced to put all of these deeming matters into an arrangement? We are going to make it clear that these arrangements are unfair to pensioners, veterans and aged pensioners.",66

Schedule 22.  p.m.)-The opposition will be opposing this schedule for the reasons which I outlined in the second reading speech. This is a tightening of the provisions which were introduced quite recently to allow unemployed people and allowees to take advance payments or to take some lump advances on their future entitlements. The idea was to provide that facility to give them a capacity to buy cloth- Pyne, C. M. ing, tools or other items which might be necessary for them to re-enter the work force or to get their car registered or a range of other things that might be prerequisites of gaining work. When we introduced this measure, there was some scepticism or concern about it from AYES some parts of the welfare sector. Some felt that people might end up abusing the arrangement. The result was not that. In fact, shortly before the change of government, I had the opportunity to talk to some of the departmental people who were involved in evaluating this particular proposition. It is very clear that it had been a successful initiative and it is therefore a pity to see that the government is cutting it back. Question put: That the schedule be agreed to. The House divided.

STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND NA ASSISTANCE) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 September, on motion by Mr Reith: That the bill be now read a second time.  p.m)-The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996 sets the framework for the Commonwealth funding of schools for the next quadrennium. It deals with the great bulk of the $14 billion the AYES Commonwealth will be contributing directly to the funding of both government and nongovernment schools during this period and it NOES succeeds the former government's 1992 bill. Obviously, this is very important legislation and it deserves close scrutiny by the parliament. We intend to give it this level of scrutiny. I will be moving a number of detailed amendments designed to rectify what we in the opposition see as major deficiencies in the present bill. How to sum up our assessment of the bill? I am reminded of the analogy of the curate's egg-good in parts, but rotten in other parts. The government claims that its decisions will provide a significant funding boost for schools. I intend to rebut that claim and show that, for government schools in particular, the decisions in this budget will have a quite insidious impact. PAIRS We are particularly concerned about the proposals to abolish the new schools policy for non-government schools and to reduce the current government school funding in recognition of the supposed financial windfall flowing to the states from the enrolment shift from the government to the non-government sector-the so-called enrolment benchmark adjustment. I will be dealing with these matters in detail later in this speech. This debate provides an opportunity to make some general comments about the government's performance to date on schools funding. It is important to say at the outset that the Commonwealth funds schools both directly, mainly through this legislation with certain items covered in the appropriation bills, and indirectly, through general revenue assistance to the states. In regard to the government schools in particular, the direct Commonwealth contribution amounts to only around 12 per cent of the cost of educating each student, with the rest provided by the states. Therefore, I contend that it is impossible to divorce consideration of the impact of what the government is doing through direct schools funding legislation from cuts to the Commonwealth general revenue assistance to the states. This is a key point when considering the rationale for the enrolment benchmark adjustment. Let us start by considering what has been done in terms of direct Commonwealth funding for schools. During our period of government we attached a high priority to raising retention rates and improving our schools. Over 13 years, the real level of direct funding for schools was raised by around 58 per cent in real-and I emphasise 'real'terms. In its budget propaganda this government has claimed to have increased funding by five per cent. Where does this figure come from? It represents the nominal expenditure growth in schools funding budgeted for 1996-97 when compared with actual expenditure in 1995-96, an increase of some $167 million. This percentage does not represent a real increase. Even less is it the result of decisions taken by this government. As with other areas of education and training spending in the budget, the government relies on what it hopes is people's ignorance of forward estimates arrangements for expenditure and the automat1995-96 Actual Outlays Programme Costs Annual Appropriations Reductions due to conclusion of funding for National Professional Development Programme Reductions due to conclusion of funding for Key Competencies Programme Rollover and increased funding for Civics and Citizenship Education Special Appropriations Reduction in capital funding for non-government schools Estimate of cost supplementation Grant level increases Enrolment increases BM4* Maintenance of 1996 Capital Funding for NonGovernment Schools BM5 Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment in Schools BM6 Additional Capital Funding for Non-Government Schools ic mechanisms for their adjustment for changes in prices, enrolment numbers and so forth. It is quite spurious for the government to claim any credit for funding increases resulting from these standard adjustments. To get a real sense of the impact of this government's decisions, I suggest that those interested take a look at the tables appearing on pages 25 and 30 of the portfolio budget statements. These give the detailed breakdowns reconciling the spending levels for 1995-96 with those budgeted for 1996-97 for the two subprograms of the schools program. Changes attributable to budget decisions of the government are preceded by the letters BM, followed by a number with an asterisk denoting decisions taken before the election. Since I intend to refer extensively to these tables, I seek leave to have them incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted.

What is the impact of this government's decisions? It is worth running through these tables and looking at the various measures and comparing what this government is doing with Labor's actions and commitments. Starting with the table on page 25 covering 'General Assistance' to schools, we see a $16 million reduction in 1996-97 due to the cessation of the national professional development program. This is an excellent program that the coalition promised the Australian people it would continue-a clear breach of a black-letter election promise. We also see a $4.8 million reduction due to the ending of the key competencies program, and there is a $4.8 million extra for the rollover and increased funding for civics and citizenship education, but this does not represent new money provided by the present government. Then there are some interesting items concerning capital funding for nongovernment schools. There is an additional $21 million representing the Labor government's decision to maintain the existing capital funding program to the end of calendar year 1996. The precipitous drop of $41 million due to the ending of the Labor government's special capital funding for nongovernment schools is only partly offset by the coalition's budget measure to provide $4.9 million extra for non-government schools Amount of Variation $'000 Total $'000 90 (226) 6,588 33,377 366,102 and Youth Affairs Portfolio, page 30 capital. This is an important area of contrast between Labor and the coalition. Labor was committed to doing far more in terms of capital funding, particularly through its support for information technology infrastructure for both government and non-government schools. The coalition committed absolutely nothing in the way of extra capital for government schools, while it promised $30 million extra over three years for non-government schools. As I said, it is nothing like enough to compensate for the funding drop flowing from the ending of Labor's special capital program announced in the One Nation statement. Labor, by contrast, was committed to providing an additional $120 million over four years to both the government and nongovernment school sectors. This would have given government schools a major boost to their information technology resources while avoiding the major cut in capital funding for the non-government sector. Finally, we see an additional cost of $10.4 million representing the estimated half year cost in 1996-97 of abolition of the new schools policy, which I will be discussing in detail later. Turning to the table for 'Targeted Assistance', once again we see a number of increases that have nothing to do with the decisions of the present government. In terms of increases that do flow from government decisions, we find an extra $7.8 million for the national literacy and numeracy strategy for schools. We obviously support the extra spending in this area. This is one of the good parts of the curate's egg, although the funding falls short of Labor's commitments and the benefits will be vitiated by cuts in other areas. However, I wish the present Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Traning (Dr Kemp) would give credit where it is due. From his rhetoric you would think that it was only due to his wisdom and beneficence that anything at all was being done about early literacy. fact is that this area was given a good deal attention over the past few years. In 1992 we had the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled The literacy challenge in response to a reference from the then minister Kim Beazley. A number of developments flowed from this. In the 1994 Working Nation statement, the government committed $3 million for the national literacyÂ· survey and, in that same year's budget, $8 million wasÂ· committed to target the literacy and. numeracy needs of children from kindergarten to year 3. A further $9 million was allocated to extend the program to 1996 in the 1995 budget. Late last year, trials took place to test the methodology for the national survey. Before this year's election, the Labor Party committed itself to lift the level of direct literacy funding in the early years of schooling from $9 million to $16 million annually, exceeding the current government's commitment. Furthermore, we would have continued funding the national professional development program to the tune of some $64 million over four years. With its abolition, professional development in literacy and a number of other areas will have to come from within the overall envelope for each program, thereby significantly reducing the effective resource levels for these activities. The other significant discretionary spending increase identified in the table is an extra $5 million for the implementation of the modem Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system in schools. This is the 1996-97 component of the additional $23 million to be allocated over the forward estimates years to be used for the professional development of teachers engaged in teaching vocational courses. Again, this is an initiative that we broadly support, while expressing a degree of caution about the risk of replicating expensive training infrastructure in schools when utilising TAFE facilities may be a more costeffective option in some cases. A former head of the VET Division in DEETYA, Des Fooks, made precisely this point in an article in the Canberra Times last The week. Again, you would think that nothing of was being done in this area before the present minister appeared on the scene. The fact is that there has been a good deal of activity in this area in recent years. In New South Wales alone, some 40,000 secondary students are currently taking vocational courses. The fact is that much of what this government proposes to do builds on initiatives of the former government such as the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation which funds initiatives to provide vocational training and work experience placements for school students; and the Jobs Pathway Guarantee, which helps students taking vocational subjects manage the transition from school to work. The government is also proposing to earmark some $20 million of vocational education and training funding a year over the next four years for the support of vocational education in schools. While we are broadly supportive of this move, this does not represent new money, merely the earmarking of existing funds for a specific purpose. In summary, what is the impact of the government's decisions on direct school funding for 1996-97 when compared with 1995-96? It is certainly nothing like the five per cent or $167 million the minister boasted of in his budget press releases. If you add up the financial impact of the schools program budget measures-conveniently set out on page 22 of the portfolio budget statementsyou get a figure for the total increase, excluding pre-election measures, of a bit over $26 million. The equivalent total figure over the four years of the forward estimates is $108 million. So far I have talked only about direct Commonwealth funding for schools. However, it would be absurd to fail to take account of the. impact on schools of this government's declsions concerning general revenue assistance to the states. This is important for government schools in particular since Commonwealth direct funding accounts for only about 12 per cent of the total. At the meeting of COAG on 14 June, the Commonwealth cut financial assistance grants to the states by $1.5 billion over the next three financial years. States spend on average around 17 per cent of FAGs grants on schools. This means that a cut of $1.5 billion in FAGs grants translates into a cut of around $255 million in schools funding over this period, assuming people maintain the same proportions. The effective cut to schools from this exceeds the $108 million in increases due to budget measures relevant to direct schools funding by a substantial margin. So far I have discussed the effect of this government's action on schools funding in aggregate, poth government and non-government. However, the combined impact of abolition of the new schools policy and the enrolment benchmark adjustment will also have a significant effect on the distribution of funding between the sectors, to the detriment of government schools. Cutbacks in general revenue assistance to the states will obviously impact disproportionately on government Schools in the States and Territories Government $m Non Government $m Joint Programs $m Aboriginal Education $m Strategic Initiatives Program % Other Assistance $m Sub-total $m Overseas Student Charge $m schools, since these derive a much higher proportion of their total funds from state governments than do non-government schools. Abolition of the new schools policy is projected to cost around $150 million over the forward estimates years, largely offset by a reduction of $128 million in funding to the states for government schools. However, the funding reduction is not just related to the enrolment shift flowing from the new schools policy abolition. It is intended to be a permanent mechanism which will progressively erode the funding base available for government schools as the years go by. A useful perspective on the effect these changes are likely to have on the distribution of funding between the government and nongovernment sectors is provided by comparing the relative growth figures for funding for the government and non-government sectors in this year's Budget Statement No.3 and last year's equivalent statement. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to have these two tables incorporated in Hansard. I have shown these to the minister and he did not object. Leave granted.

I acknowledge that the precise numbers for . total funding are not strictly comparable between the two years since assumptions about price and enrolment changes will vary over the course of the year separating the two budgets. However, I am interested in the broad picture as to the overall rates of funding growth of the two sectors. In this respect the __ picture is pretty unarguable and disturbing. Last year's budget papers show that in 1997-98 funding for the government sector was estimated to grow by 4.1 per cent over the preceding year, with funding for the nongovernment growing by 5.6 per cent.

There is a similar picture for 1998-99. It is particularly worrying when set against the general background of what has been happening to funding of the two sectors in recent years. I refer members to a recent speech by Ms Ann Morrow, outgoing chait of the soon to be abolished Schools Council, in which she analyses the pattern of funding for each sector from both the Commonwealth and state governments. She cites figures showing that over a five-year period from 1988-89 to 1993-94 the balance of total funding between the sectors shifted substantially as a result of state and territory governments increasing funding per student in the non-government sector far faster than for government school students, with the Commonwealth only partly offsetting this trend. The outcome was that total Commonwealth plus state funding per student rose three times faster for non-government students than for government students. It is plausible to suggest that the long-term shift in enrolments from government to nongovernment is at least in part related to changes in the relative levels of subsidisation of each sector-or at least this is what conventional economic analysis tells us is what should happen. The position is likely to have been compounded since 1993-94 as a result of substantial cuts in some states. It is a serious worry for those committed to the provision of quality public education. I think it was Professor MCKinnon who coined the term 'residualisation' of government education to describe where continuation of these trends might lead in the long term. By this he meant a state of affairs where a clear majority of those seriously concerned about their children's education, and possessing the financial wherewithal to do so, moved their children out of the government sector. This might not worry the present minister, but it should. It should also worry the more perceptive in the non-government sector, since it threatens a full bottle revival of the kind debate about state aid that we saw in the 1960s and early 1970s. It threatens the political consensus that has developed since that time that accepts the legitimacy of a dual system of education with both sectors receiving government support. This brings me to the budget measure described somewhat cryptically as the enrolment benchmark adjustment. This is a proposal to reduce funding to the states for the recurrent costs of government schools by $128 million over the forward estimates in recognition of the supposed savings to the states and territories arising from the shift in enrolments from the government to the nongovernment sector. The argument hinges on the difference in the cost to the states and territories of a student in a government school compared with a non-government school and takes as its starting point the figure for average per student expenditure in government schools for 1993-94 published in the 1994 National Report on Schooling. That figure is $4,757 per student. From this is deducted an amount of $305, being the per student expenditure on buildings and grounds-in other words, capital-and the average Commonwealth per capita funding of around $400. That is average per capita funding for primary and secondary students. This gives a figure of slightly over $4,000 per capita for average state recurrent costs of a student in a government school. The school's price index is then used to adjust this figure to current prices, yielding a figure of around $4,300, from which is deducted $900, being the cost to the state of a student in a non-government school. This yields a figure of $3,400 as the saving to the state or territory arising each time a student switches from the government to the nongovernment sector. Through the enrolment benchmark adjustment savings measure the Commonwealth is seeking to recoup half of this saving to the states-that is, $1,700 for each student making the switch. That is an eminently reasonable proposition, the minister would have us believe. Well, no, it isn't. There is a great deal wrong with this of argument. Let us start with the basis of the calculation. The first point to note is that the calculation is based on a comparison of the average cost to the state or territory of a student in a government school compared with one in a non-government school. The presumption is that the average cost can in practice be realised as a saving as numbers in the government system fall. This is palpable nonsense. It is ludicrous to equate the marginal saving accruing to the state system with the average cost of a government school student. Even excluding the capital element, there are very substantial unavoidable overheads in running a government school. A marginal fall in enrolments may lead to a reduction in the number of face-to-face teachers, though more typically this would result in a marginal reduction in class sizes. There are major overheads in running a government school system. Even where reductions in teaching staff are feasible, this would not proportionately reduce the cost of principals, deputy principals, head teachers, administrative staff-many of them the most highly paid staff-not to mention the state bureaucracy involved in administering the system, developing curricula, administering examinations and so on. The requirement on the state system to provide universal access to all students adds an additional element of inflexibility, making it considerably harder to achieve savings through school closures. The New South Wales government has done its sums and claims that in practice only a fraction of the alleged savings are realisable using standard staff/student formulae and other factors. It claims that the realisable savings arising from, say, a two per cent enrolment drift will amount to around $37 million. When account is taken of the lossÂ· of Commonwealth per capita funding for government school students, and the added cost to the state of educating more children in a nongovernment system, the effective saving, the New South Wales officials claim, is reduced to around $24'12 million. Yet the enrolment benchmark adjustment would presume savings of over $70 million, half of which would be taken from the state. The net result-and this is the New South Wales officials' calculation-would be that New South Wales would be out of pocket to the tune of over $11 million on this scenario. More fundamentally, as I mentioned earlier, it is simply absurd to talk about these matters without taking into account the cuts to general revenue assistance that this government has imposed on the states. As I argued earlier, these cuts amO!lnt to a reduction of over $250 million in the total funds available for schools, with the impact falling overwhelmingly on government schools. When being briefed by the department about this bill, I was advised that. there are two mechanisms by which the enrolment benchmark adjustment can be affected. It can be done either by a further reduction in financial assistance grants to the states or by the minister determining an amount for payment to the states for recurrent government school funding less than the amount prescribed by the per capita formula that appears in the bill. At the. end of the day, we cannot prevent the government from making this cut. But we do intend to create every obstacle we can and to make the whole business as transparent to the Australian public as we can. For this reason we will be moving an amendment in the consideration in detail stage specifically designed to cut off the second of the two options-that is, the minister determining an amount less than the formula. The bill currently gives the minister the discretion to do this. We will be moving an amendment to remove this discretion. Let him then go back to the states and tell them how lucky they have been to have reaped this windfall and how the Commonwealth, therefore, feels a further FAGs adjustment is warranted. Some at least will no doubt then inform him of the pressure on them arising from the earlier $1.5 billion FAGs cut. I would have to acknowledge that the general position with FAGs grants has been pretty tight over the past decade, even under the relatively more benign climate provided by Labor. I turn now to the matter of the new schools policy. This was a coalition pre-election commitment and it is one they have chosen to keep, despite its not inconsiderable budgetary impact. Obviously, it is a core promise, but a singularly iII-considered one. As I mentioned earlier, we do not dispute the need for the policy to be reviewed and modified. That is why we commissioned Professor Ken MCKinnon, a distinguished educationist with a long background in school policy issues, to conduct a major public consultation review. The final report from his review was handed to the previous minister during the caretaker period before the election. The new minister chose to sit on it for three months, only releasing it after I asked a question in the parliament. How do we account for this lack of enthusiasm to release the report? There is no great mystery here. MCKinnon's report specifically debunks some of the central points in the minister's rationale for dumping the new schools policy, such as his ridiculous claim that, since the average cost to governments of educating a child in a nongovernment school is significantly less than for a government school, there can be no genuine resource allocation issue arising out of abolition of the policy. As Professor MCKinnon points out, average cost comparisons are irrelevant in the circumstances in which the presence or absence of the new schools policy is an issue. This is intended to address cases where the creation of a new school will result in the suboptimal use of expensive buildings, infrastructure and teaching resources in government and other non-government schools-either this or the government schools in question will suffer a significant loss of breadth of curriculum offerings. In terms of resource allocation, it is simply absurd for the minister to maintain that the Commonwealth should wash its hands of the matter. The fact is that the totality of public funds available for school education is finite and the Commonwealth must take some responsibility for ensuring that the funds are used sensibly. This is particularly so given the removal of the category 6 cap, which we do not oppose. Without some form of planned educational provision requirement, we can expect to see cases in which government schools end up in wasteful competition with non-government SEPTEMBER 1996 NA curriculum Yes Yes physical environment Yes Yes teacher qualifications Yes Yes minimum enrolments No Yes (2) financial viability No No impact on other No No schools likely review after not yet- not yet abolition of New probably decided Schools Policy (1) the relevant Act requires all teachers to (2) Victorian minima: 20 students for primary and where 11 is the minimum of primary) and special be an average of 10 per schools, which also derive the great bulk of their funding from public sources over a stagnant or declining enrolment base, with both schools being of suboptimal size. The losers will be Australian students. The minister talks a great deal about the importance of choice. We agree that a choice of schooling options is desirable, but we also believe that a key dimension to such choice is the universal availability of a quality government school education. This is particularly important to the more disadvantaged members of our society for whom the choice of paying substantial fees to go to a nongovernment school is not an option. Governments have an obligation to ensure a quality education to every child in Australia, and the capacity to do this will be diminished if this policy goes through as proposed. The minister's proposal to rely on state registration requirements to ensure that reasonable quality education is being offered is simply absurd. Registration requirements vary enormously from state to state and are singularly unsuitable for this purpose. Time does not permit me to talk about this in any detail, but I seek leave to incorporate into Hansard a table which sets out the requirements operating in each state and territory. Leave granted. The table read as followsStaterrerritory Non-Government School Registration Requirements NA Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes (I) Yes Yes Yes No (3) No No (3) minimum No No (5) of 2 families Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes No (4) No (4) No No No Yes review done not yet Yes Yes Yes not known 1996 otherdecided wise not yet decided be registered by the Teachers Registration Board secondary schools (except in selected rural districts registrations schools 11.

We will be moving a number of detailed amendments to the bill which seek to restore an element of planned educational provision in the government's consideration of the funding of new non-government schools. We have not sought to simply restore the old arrangements. Rather, we have picked up the key features of Professor MCKinnon's recommendations, which differ in some important respects from the existing criteria. In particular, he has reformulated the key concept of planned educational provision so as to recognise the dual objectives of choice and the universal availability of a government have defacto status because schools deemed ineligible Statefferritory Procedures for Non-Government School Registration NA 6 months 3 months I month 2 years 9 months 2 years No but flexible for new schools Yes No (I) Yes No No Yes for I Yes for I year year No expiry No expiry No expiry Up to 5 Up to 2 Up to 5 No expiry years date date date years New years years date school I year Each 6 None speciNone speciEach 5 Up to 6 Each 5 None speciyears years . fied fied years years or 10 years fied mlDIIDum minimum minimum years if minimum New schools schools 2 years and doing selfschools evaluation selected at random Each 6 None speciNone speciDependent None speciEach 5 None speciyears years fied will infied on review fied will inyears fied minimum mIDlmum spect if spe- team recomspect if speminimum New schools cific com- mendation cific com2 years and plaint re- plaint reschools ceived ceived selected at random - - - - - - separate to recognition as a school in receipt of State Appeal Tribunals. set up specifically to deal with right of appeal to State Supreme Courts school education. He has eschewed the problematical notion of trying to decide on an appropriate balance between the sectors. We have not followed MCKinnon in all respects, however. The most significant difference relates to minimum enrolment requirements where we think his numbers are a bit low to enable adequate breadth and quality of educational opportunity. We favour sticking to the current numbers while following MCKinnon in allowing averaging. Just about everyone with any significant experience of running a school system accepts the importance of minimum enrolment criteria. The Catholic system representatives were explicit on this point in their recent statement of principles. So, too, is the Kennett government which, in its reorganisation government schools in Victoria, has used minimum enrolment numbers far higher than the the ones we propose. This is all spelt out an interesting report by the Victorian Auditorinvolved General which came out in October of last year. The final matter I would like to mention the broadbanding of targeted assistance, with increased capacity to shift funds between various elements. In principle, we do not have a problem with this, provided that a proper basis of accountability and maintenance of effort by the states is maintained. The legislation required specific agreements with the states in respect of each of these areas targeted assistance. The new arrangements replace these provisions with broad generic requirements, requiring agreements states on educational accountability and outcomes reporting across the board. We will be paying close attention to how these arered rangements work out in practice. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) is of the opinion that the maintenance of a universally accessible system of government schools able to provide appropriate curriculum offerings comprehensive enough to meet the needs of the students enrolled is a national priority; (2) expresses grave concern at the damage likely to be done to government schools by the Government's mooted abolition of Commonwealth requirements for funding non-governa ment schools, with the significant cost offset by a reduction in Commonwealth grants to the government sector; (3) condemns the Government for refusing to its responsibilities in ensuring that a quality education is accessible to every Australian child.""",66
211,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,Is the amendment seconded? Ms Macklin-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,79
212,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,"The vast bulk of Commonwealth funding for schools comes under the ambit of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary of Education Assistance) Bill 1996. Although primary and secondary education is essentially responsibility of states and territories, the in Commonwealth government has become more in schooling Australian students. The purpose of this legislation is to implement the government's commitment to mainis tain stability in Commonwealth funding for primary and secondary education in Australia the over the next four years. The Commonwealth presently funds approximately 13 per cent of total spending on government schools, the balance of funding coming from the state and old territory jurisdictions. The Commonwealth also provides approximately 36 per cent of of total spending on non-government schooling, with 18 per cent being provided by other governments and 44 per cent coming from with the private sources. The coalition's election commitment to basic resources for education has been delivin this legislation. This bill gives more educational opportunities for parents so that a they can choose the most appropriate school for their children. It also simplifies and consolidates a number of standard provisions, including provisions covering financial and educational accountability. A $14 billion program for schools for the 1997-2000 quadrennium, as promised in the 1996-97 budget, is implemented in this legislation. The program will do more than just simply maintain schools funding. It abolishes the previous government's restrictive new schools policy and replaces it with fairer and more flexible process that is less being obstructive and more responsive to communidirect ty and parental needs. The coalition has delivered on its premeet election promise of strongly supporting planning in the development of new schools. However, the Labor government's new schools policy-often referred to as the no new schools policy-contained numerous measures which caused inequities and disincentives to new non-government schools, regardless of community needs or parental The government aims to institute a more equitable new schools policy. This policy will enable non-government schools to qualify for Commonwealth funding if they have state or territory recognition and meet other simple eligibility requirements. The revised arrangements simplify eligibility requirements, significantly cut red tape, give parents a real choice in schooling for their children and make eligibility for funding more clear cut. The bill will provide an increase in funding to $56.7 million for Asian languages and cultural studies. It will also provide an additional $45 million for national literacy and numeracy strategies and an additional $30 million for non-government school capital works. The emerging depth and breadth of the Australian economic interest in Asia requires a fundamental reappraisal of the adequacy of our national linguistic and cultural This government recognises this challenge and has committed $56 million increased funding throughout our schools system for Asian languages culture studies. It is vital we equip young Australians with a capacity to differentiate between the different languages and cultures of the Asian region. The importance of Asia to our economic interests cannot be underestimated. The national literacy and numeracy strategy is of great significance. Past research indicates that up to 90 per cent of children cannot read or write adequately by the end of their schooling. Estimates of the economic cost of illiteracy range from $3 billion to $6 billion annually. Currently, one in five children leave school with literacy or numeracy problems. The national literacy and numeracy strategy will focus on children in the first three years of primary school to find out whether they need extra support in literacy and numeracy. The additional funding will be directed to both state and territory government and nongovernment schools and may be used for basic skills programs supporting educationally disadvantaged students in the levels from kindergarten to year 3, professional development for teachers in intervention strategies, developing better screening strategies to identify children with literacy and numeracy problems and developing parent tutor programs. It is this government's policy that literacy and numeracy should have first call on the education dollar. A proportion of the funds will be used to support national initiatives such as developing Australia's first national literacy benchmark at year 3 and year 5, reporting of national outcomes, developing and promoting shared national information networks, commissioning research, developing curriculum materials and professional development for teachers and parents. The government proposes to establish benchmarks based on the results of the National Schools English Literacy Survey, the results of which will be released next year. General recurrent and capital grants programs will continue to operate under the bill. This establishes clear links between the Commonwealth's objectives for schools and the program tools being used skills base. to achieve those objectives. Over the past three years Labor effectively decreased general capital funding to nongovernment schools. They completely ignored the real needs of schools and the fact that school infrastructure must keep pace with curriculum and structural changes. In spite of repeated requests from non-government school authorities, the Keating government failed to act. The coalition government have addressed this shortfall in capital expenditure by increasing capital grants during our first term in government. This bill provides the flexibility to apply funds to new priority areas as they emerge. This process is referred to as broadbanding. This reduces administrative burdens and gives the states and non-government school authorities more discretion to use funds in a way that best meets t-e national schooling objectives. The government will reduce the number of targeted assistance programs from over 40 to five priority areas. These areas are the literacy program, the languages program and the special learning needs program, which are all included in this bill, and the school to work program and the quality outcomes program, the funds for which are included in other legislation. Although the number of targeted programs has been reduced, decisions in the 1996 budget have resulted in increased funding for these programs over the forward estimates years. Broadbanding will place emphasis on priority areas identified by the government, and the minister will have the power to transfer funds between certain groups of similar programs as priorities emerge. Furthermore, broadbanding will still service the needs of the educationally disadvantaged. The ultimate effect of broadbanding provisions will be to give school systems and school authorities added choice and flexibility in determining some of their priorities for targeted funding. Provided in this legislation is our $187 million election commitment for vocational education in schools. Massive youth unemployment, changing industry needs and altered societal expectations of our schools have to modify the traditional approach of schools to the post-compulsory years of schooling. Unfortunately, one of the saddest things about Labor's 13 years in office was how they neglected young Australians. Over the past six years the number of apprenticeships has fallen from approximately 62,000 to 50,000-the lowest level in 30 years. It is little wonder that youth unemployment hit over 50 per cent in some areas under the iast government. Within the electorate of Lilley, Nudgee College has developed a range of vocational offerings for students in their senior years of secondary school. The college provides a flexible curriculum which will enable the school to meet the variety of learning styles of its students. The college stresses that vocational education needs to be responsive and that the school needs to be given the option to work as a private provider of vocational education and training in its own right. With regard to post-compulsory education, Nudgee College is guided by the following principals: industry and community consultation, structured work experience and industry placement, entry level training for students, the employability of students and the valuing of a variety of career paths for students. The college has adopted workplace learning as a valuable learning experience for its students. It argues that assessment in the workplace needs to be recognised as a valid method of assessing the application of vocational skills. I applaud the work being done at Nudgee College. As a government, we must encourage secondary schools to enter partnerships with TAFE, private providers and industry to ensure that courses on offer to students meet the skill requirements of business and industry and provide credit transfer to further education and training. I will support Nudgee College and other schools interested in developing appropriate vocational education programs every step of the way. This bill also commits $17.4 million for civics education. It is important that the next generation fully appreciates what it means to be an Australian and that they understand our history and cultural diversity. The program will cover areas such as the constitution, the parliamentary structure and citizenship. The aim of the program is to inform students about their rights and responsibilities as citizens and the role of government in our society. The $17.4 million civics program will enable young Australians to make a lasting contribution to the economic life of the nation. The coalition government is committed to ensuring that students leave school.with an understanding of, and a pride in, what it means to be an Australian. Currently, there is a significant shift in students from government to non-government schools. This has increased from 24.4 per cent of total enrolments in 1983 to 29 per cent in 1995. When students transfer from government to non-government schools there is a net increase in costs to the Commonwealth and a net decrease in costs to states and territories. The enrolment benchmark adjustment will enable the Commonwealth to preserve 50 per cent of the net recurrent savings to a state or territory when a student shifts from the government to the non-government sector. The government's policy is expected to cost the Commonwealth some $152.8 million over the forward estimate years. Some $128.6 million of this will be offset by the enrolment benchmark adjustment. This will allow the Commonwealth to share in reduced costs arising from the transfer of students from government schools. This means the states and territories have saved more than $3 billion in the cost of educating students in government schools. The enrolment benchmark adjustment will allow the Commonwealth to share in these windfall savings which up until now only the states and territories have enjoyed. The government's provisions are intended to give the Commonwealth an equitable share in the reduced cost to state and territory governments from any shift in student enrolments to non-government schools after 1996. It is expected that this continued drift of students to non-government schools will result in a net saving to state and territory budgets. The Commonwealth's share of the savings is expected to be about $120 million over the four years. This bill provides the appropriation of some $12.5 billion in current prices for recurrent funding and $1.2 billion in current prices for capital funding. In total, the bill appropriates $13.7 billion in current prices from 1997 to the year 2000 and, in accordance with the government's policies, these amounts will be adjusted for price movements. In conclusion, the government intends to ensure that we help give our children the best possible start in life. By effectively addressing educational issues, particularly literacy, we are targeting a source of challenges being faced by young Australians, the key challenge being youth unemployment. With improved literacy and numeracy skills young people will be better equipped to face the challenges that confront them coming into the 21st century. This is why the government places so much importance on bills such as this States Grants (Primary and Education Assistance) Bill. We must give the students the ability to control their futures. I commend this bill to the House.",79
213,Ms MACKLIN,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,"It is the case that education is one of the most fundamental issues confronting any government. It will be the case that in the world of the 21st century education becomes even more important. If we are to maintain our standard of living and, equally, maintain our standard of society of social cohesion, understanding and tolerance, then how we handle the issue of education will be fundamental to the type of society Australia becomes in the years ahead. The issue of a tolerant society is one that recent statements by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson)-I am pleased to see her in the chamber-have tended to place in sharper focus. I would have to say that there is nothing the member for Oxley has said with which I have any sympathy at all, but the fact that she has made her comments and the apparent enthusiasm with which they have been received in certain parts of the country simply provide even stronger demonstration to me of the importance of education. In this instance, it is education as a counter to ignorance, education as a means of providing rational argument against irrational emotion, education as a means of providing facts as a counter to superstition and blind prejudice. There are also critical economic imperatives that demand we provide our children with the best possible education. The world of the 21st century will be particularly unforgiving to nations where the work force is not highly skilled and qualified to undertake the most complex of tasks. Plus there are both vital economic and social imperatives that demand that the people of Australia be educated to the highest possible level. To be specific about this, I do think the target set by the Australian Education Council Review Committee in 1991 provided a reasonable benchmark when it targeted the year 2001 as the date by which 95 per cent of all 19 year olds should have completed year 12. The key point here tonight is that these should be targets for the whole of Australiaas the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was so fond of quoting during the election 'for all of us'. Unless it is for all of us, we will never attain the degree of social cohesiveness or across-the-board levels of prosperity that will be the hallmark of a truly civilised nation in the 21st century. Let us look closely at the legislation the government has before this parliament. In the view of the opposition, this legislation will fundamentally change the funding structure of Australian schools. In essence, what the government is proposing is to fund future growth in the non-government sector by cutting funding to government schools. In my way of thinking, this is not for all of us. This will not improve the cohesiveness of our society. Taking money away from government schools reduces opportunity and reduces cohesiveness. Unfortunately these days, most Australians have become desensitised by the constant battering of economic rationalist rhetoric. No doubt we will hear lots of this from the other side as this debate goes on. We will hear terms like 'choice' and 'individual rights'. They will probably claim that they are merely levelling the playing field to allow private schools an equal chance to compete. There will be a good dose from the other side on eliminating inefficiencies and reducing waste and duplication. Then they will probably add in a dash of employer concern about declining standards-the whole lot underpinned and justified by a sense of crisis about government revenue. This is the sort of language that we now come to expect from the other side in every single area of government expenditure. It is the same argument we are hearing in the child-care area where they are taking $100 million from community based child care by the removal of operational subsidies. Never mind that community based centres are going to be found in lower income areas and are going to provide care for more expensive categories of child care, such as babies and children with special needs. In my view, it is a philosophy that devalues the contribution and capacity of the public sector. It is also a philosophy that has no conception or desire to engage with notions such as the public good, access and disadvantage. Rather, they prefer to stress competition, efficiency and autonomy. To this government, the complexities of life and society, which education underpins, are to be ignored or glossed over. Education is just another commodity in their view to be traded in the marketplace. Let us look specifically at what this legislament tion is trying to do. In terms of federal government funding policy, there are three policy changes that will result in an increase in recurrent outlays for rion-government schools. First, the abolition of the new schools policy which sets limits on the establishment of federally funded non-government schools. Secondly, the abolition of restrictions on the level of funding that lion-government schools can receive. This gives new nongovernment schools access to higher levels of general recurrent grants than before. Thirdly, the abolition of minimum and maximum enrolment limits on non-government schools. This will entitle all non-government schools to receive federal recurrent funding for any number of new students they can attract. But the most insidious point about the funding of these changes is that they will be met by cuts to government schools. My primary concern with the legislation before us tonight is in fact the impact of the government's funding changes on government schools. I want to refer to a paper by Louise Watson from the Australian National University. She has worked out the effect of removing all the funding restrictions in the budget. She estimates that there is likely to be a cut of 23 per cent or $207.8 million over the next four years for government schools. She goes on to say that, on the basis of her analysis, the government has underestimated the cost of its policy changes by $50 million. However, the effect of this underestimation will not be a blow-out in the budget. Rather, it will be a cost that will be met by cuts to government schools-further cuts than those estimated so far by the government. The second serious matter that arises from the changes introduced by this legislation is, as Louise Watson states: The incentive for cost-shifting by State and Territory governments will increase as the Federal budget decisions take effect. Over the next four years, the Commonwealth expects to reduce its recurrent grants for government schools by $150 million, thus increasing the cost to the States of educating students in governschools by $150 million. While the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment will have the cost-benefits to the States of student transfers in the short term, it will put in place a new structure that will increase the incentive for States to encourage the transfer of students to the non-government sector. The progressive reduction in Federal funding for government schools will mean that the States will incur an increased proportion to the cost of ing students in government schools. The complete withdrawal of Federal recurrent funding for government schoolssomething recommended in the National Commission of Auditwould require the States and Territories to find an additional $1 billion from their own budgets. As the Commonwealth reduces its funding of students in government schools over the next four years, the States and Territories will have a strong financial incentive to shift the cost of educating students the Commonwealth. Through its Budget decisions, the Federal government has increased the financial incentive for State and Territory governments to encourage students to transfer to non-government schools. Any State or Territory that decided to pursue such a policy could either increase their level of grants to non-government schools or reduce their expenditure on government schools. These are very serious incentives for cost shifting and should be a policy concern of the federal government. We are facing challenging changes to government policy for schools funding which will have the effect of concentrating in disadvantaged schools the children of low income earners. It is our responsibility--certainly our responsibility on this side of the House-to challenge policies that are bad. If a highly educated populace is underpinning those societies that willÂ· be successful in the 21st century, then to create policies that ensure a large part of the population have no chance of reaching those education levels is to disadvantage the whole nation. The effects of socio-economic areas on a student's likely educational success are not matters of speculation; they are well documented. A detailed study has been carried out at the University of Melbourne of the correlation between a range of socio-economic factors such as parental income, level of education, home ownership and geographic location against results in English at year 12. Of course the results are quite startling. The students' English results improve uniformly as one moves up the scale of determinants from disadvantaged to advantaged. We have seen the serious effects from the Kennett government's cuts to education. I refer to an article from the Melbourne Age which sees yet another effort by the Victorian educatgovernment to take another $60 million from Victorian schools. Under the plan that they have in place, which is now going to be reinforced by the federal government's policies, we are going to see the closure of schools, primary schools and secondary schools, that they consider to be at risk. The way they have estimated this is that primary schools with fewer than 64 students will be considered at risk and secondary institutions with fewer to than 400 students will be considered at risk. We have seen some very serious changes take place in the Victorian education system. I will quote from a study by David MCCrae, who undertook a survey of government schools to assess the impact of the huge funding cuts that have taken place in Victoria over the last three years. We have seen cuts in the number of teachers, cuts in the number of secondary schools, cuts in the provision of languages other than English and cuts in physical education, art and craft and technology studies. It is the case that Victoria is now worse than the national average for staff student ratios. Class sizes in primary schools have increased. It is commonly believed that the most negative impact of the cuts is loss of staff and the consequent increase in class sizes. Mr Charles-What does that prove except that the teacher unions are unhappy?",82
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,"Mr Quick)Order! I would remind members of standing order 55, that members should be heard in silence.",84
215,Ms MACKLIN,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,"I make sure that the members opposite are aware of MCCrae's study. He said that the goal of the 1993-94 cuts was to decrease government spending on public education. If that was their goal, they have been conspicuously successful. If the goal was to get teachers working harder, they have certainly achieved that through increased class sizes and allotments. That is not to say that teachers are working more effectively, that students are learning more, that they are happier in their studies or that the reach of education into the whole student population is increasing. If the goal was at the same time to maintain the quality of education in government schools, it has certainly not succeeded. The study also said: The loss of quality in Victoria's government schools is now evident, he argues, by reference to four criteria: the reduced capacity for schools to provide inqividual attention because of increased class sizes and increased staff loads; the provision of comprehensive programs; the elimination in many schools of specialist options especially in such areas as music, art/craft, LOTE, sport, remediation, library and computers; and low morale and workplace duress for the state's committed and caring teachers. It is obviously something that those opposite do not care about. The study went on to say: A year later and the outcomes identified by the MCCrae survey have worsened. The overall picture for the past two years reveals expenditure cuts of more than $400 million; 300 school closures; over 8000 teachers removed from the system (approximately 20 per cent)this is before we face this latest round of cuts of another $60 millionthe removal of several thousand support staff; a marked increase in class size and pupil-teacher ratios across the state; andmost significantlya decline in student retention to year 12. The retention rate to year 12 was something which we in Victoria had previously been very proud of. So, when this government came into power in Victoria, we saw very significant changes. It is not just people from the education sector who are making comments about the serious impact of the Liberal government's policy changes in Victoria and the changes that will be wrought by this federal government, which will only make things worse. It is also the Managing Director of BP Australia who is making comments. In a speech to the Education Foundation Awards Ceremony in 1994, he said: In Victoria ... we have seen a virtual decimation of the education system to the point where teachers and schools are stretched to the limit. The state government's practice of excluding interested parties, divide and rule can only lead chaos. Vital support has gone from a number of areas for no other reason, in some cases, than political expediency. As a result, programs such as those offered by the Education Foundation and industry are having to help fill the . . . gaps left in the system, rather than enhancing and extending programs which should rightfully be funded by the state. It is interesting that Premier Kennett set up his own commission of audit to provide him with the excuses to do these terrible things to reductions in education in Victoria. We saw this government follow the Kennett model. They, too, have had a National Commission of Audit. We see that in that National Commission of Audit they are recommending that funding for primary and secondary education be the sole responsibility of state governments and that Commonwealth specific purpose payments for schools be transferred to untied financial assistance grants. In other words, it is to provide a scenario where governments like Jeff Kennett's can be open slather, completely unchecked by any Commonwealth restriction, supervision or guidance. This is the kind of system that this government is now trying to spread to the rest of Australia.  Baldwin) said, and I want to strongly endorse his comments, governments have an obligation to provide a high quality universal school education. That is what we stand for on this side of the House. That is what the heart of our objections to this bill absolutely are. This bill moves away from a strong universal education system for primary and secondary students, which is something that we oppose. We will stand up for it for a very long time to come.",84
216,Mr CHARLES,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,"I have to say at the outset of this debate about the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996 that the speech by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) would have to be the most vitriolic read speech that I have heard in this place for a long time. I do not know who wrote the member for Jagajaga's speech, but it was absolutely disgusting and despicable. It did not relate to the issues whatsoever. I will to address sqme of the things that she said later in my comments tonight. I want to address three issues associated with this bill: firstly, literacy and numeracy, which I think I have some platform to speak from; secondly, the new schools policy; and, thirdly, increased funding for the study of Asian languages and culture. If we have a major problem in our education system today, it is the failing literacy and numeracy ards of our school children. You, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, who joined me on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for three years, from 1993 to 1996, are well aware of the problems that we have surveyed in our schools around this nation. In 1991 our standing committee brought down a report on literacy needs in the workplace. I remind the House that during the currency of that inquiry I took the opportunity of asking every respondent to the inquirywhether they came before a committee hearing in Canberra, whether we talked to them as we went from workplace to workplace throughout Australia or whether we interviewed respondents to the inquiry in various states-whether the problems we were experiencing in poor literacy, numeracy, spelling and grammar with adults in the workplaces in Australia were associated with a decline in standards in school or if schools were still feeding the problem. I say to the member for Jagajaga that the answer from the teachers unions was inevitably no, no, no. The answer from the state bureaucracies was no. But the answer from many private individuals, private educators, teachers and university professors was uniformly yes, they were. As part of that inquiry in 1991 I brought down a dissent to the report which related to testing. In that dissent I recommended that we undergo a national testing system to find out where we were with literacy standards in this country. I remind honourable members that the last time this nation really knew where we stood in comparison with the rest of the world was in 1975 when we carried out a national survey of literacy standards of primary school students around the country. We attempted such a survey again in 1980 but it was flawed because the teachers unions in Victoria refused to participate and the results then were not accountable. In that dissenting report I said: One of our membersthat was measked witness after witness; ""given that we accept that we have an unacceptably high level of people in society with poor literacy skills are we still stand- growing the problem in our schools?"" In 1992-93 the same House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training undertook an inquiry into early childhood literacy development around this nation. That report, entitled The literacy challenge, formally tabled in this place in May 1993, has become the bible for the debate that currently rages around our nation on whether or not our young people have adequate literacy standards to carry them into adulthood and to enable them to get meaningful jobs and to live meaningful lives in modem Australia. The literacy challenge report was scathing. It said that we not only had a problem but that we did not know the extent of the problem. I say to this House that all the members of the Labor Party-including the member for Jagajaga, who stood at the dispatch box a few minutes ago and tried to slam this government and the Kennett government in Victoria for poor standards-refuse to back national testing to find out where we are. For some reason it is an ideological hang-up associated with the teachers unions that say, 'You can't possibly test the little dears to find out where we are because somebody might find out that the teachers aren't doing their job.' One of the things the member for Jagajaga said was that the ALP is committed to caring for teachers and that those opposite obviously do not care about such teachers. What a lot of rubbish that is. I grew up in a household of teachers. I greatly respect teachers and the magnificent job that they do for our children. I think that the majority of teachers are dedicated individuals who do the very best job they can. I am not convinced that the teachers unions have done the best job for the teachers, for our children or, indeed, for our nation. I have some very good reasons for believing that. The diatribe I have just heard absolutely works me up to comment on this point. The teachers unions have, if anything, denigrated their own profession by convincing Australnational ians that teachers are more interested in own welfare than they are in the outcomes their students. When we talk about literacy difficult. and numeracy, we are talking about outcomes for students. There is no more important outcome than that every child in Australia has the opportunity to exit school with numeracy and literacy standards that meet our expectations so that they are able to live full lives in both a social and workplace sense in our country. They need to be able to read and write competently in English and to be able to spell. It would also be nice if they understood basic grammar. These are very important basic concepts. I support anything that we can do down this path. This bill commits another $45 million-in of testing. excess of the $150 million a year-to literacy and numeracy strategies. This is a Commonwealth government. We do not run schools; the states run schools. But we are so concerned about this national problem that we believe it needs additional funding to try to ensure that every child has a chance. Through this program we are going to reduce the number of targeted programs. That is not bad. When there is a wide proliferation nobody knows for sure exactly what it is. You have to be really in the know to know when you can get money. By reducing the targeted program, we can make them more applicable to try to achieve positive results. I have toÂ· say to that point that one of things that the Minister for Schools, Vocationin al Education and Training (Dr Kemp), at the table, has been about is outcomes, and he has demonstrated that time and time again both in this place and in this legislation. Rather than being concerned about inputs and those problems that might affect the industry, he is concerned about achieving better outcomes.  talked about a $3 million national literacy survey that the ALP put forward in the last parliament. That is terrific. The problem is they never did the survey. Where is it? It not here because it was never done. Why? Because the teachers unions vetoed it time and time again. We are undertaking the survey. We are going to get results. their I do not know if we can compare them to of 1975. I wish we could, but that is probably There are no justifiable reasons for not finding out where we stand and where our schools stand. All the reasons that are put up by teachers and others amount largely to such issues as the fact that tests measure inappropriate outcomes, that there are differences in test results which are influenced by curriculum differences, that test results are often misused or misunderstood, that tests do not adequately measure higher order skills and that testing leads to teaching to the tests. These are all arguments which are not against testing; they are against the inappropriate use I maintain, as I always have, that we need to know where we are in order to improve the curriculum, to give more time to literacy training in early years of primary school and to use the right methodology. I remind the House that in the early 1970s we changed our teaching methodology on how to read and how to write. We went from a system which was based very solidly on phonics, on sound shape coordination, to a system called whole word, where we encompass the enjoyment of reading and we learn to look at phrases or groups of words and try to make meaning out of the word. If you did not understand what a word was then you tried to make meaning the out of it in the context in which it appeared the sentence. If you did not understand the who is sentence, you were lost. That is fine for 70 per cent of the kids. I accept that. Seventy per cent of the children probably are going to learn to read no matter what we do, as long as we give them, I suppose, a reason for learning how to read. If we are a bit enthusiastic about it, they will learn how to read. I am concerned about the bottom 30 per cent. The bottom 30 per cent has been shown, over and over again, in this country, in the United States and throughout Europe to have great difficulties if we do not is teach them decoding skills-how to decode what is on the piece of paper. It is not something that you learn from birth because writing is not a natural phenomenon. Speaking is pretty natural, isn't it? We make sounds naturally and we copy other people's sounds. But we do not copy language because language is an artificial mechanism to transfer sounds to a piece of paper or a visual image transferred back to sound again. Kids need to be taught how to do it, and I make that point strongly. The national survey will help us find out where we are and, as it is repeated over and over again, we will put more pressure on the states to do a better job of imparting good literacy skills to their primary school students. About three weeks ago, I ran into the prep teacher who taught my three children in prep. She is now retired. We were chatting about this issue. She is a fantastic lady; she was a really good teacher. She said to me, 'Bob, it is almost as much a problem with methodology. We have crowded out the curriculum with so many other things in the early years of primary school that we have forgotten the basics. Children don't get concentrated time from their teachers.' She said, 'It doesn't matter whether I had 30 children in the class or I had 10 children in the class. If I've got only 30 minutes to teach reading then I have only 30 minutes. If I take the whole morning to teach reading, writing and math, then I've got the basics. Leave the rest of the curriculum, the other stuff that the social do-gooders want to do, the afternoon when the children are sleepy and tired and they can't take it in. But make sure that, in the morning, we teach them how to read, how to write and how to spell-that is important too-and what grammar is all about.' I recommend that to our states. The Commonwealth does not control this issue but I recommend it to state ministers. In our study into violence in schools-I think it was in 1994-95-one of the things that we learned is that those children who tend to violence, who tend to have problems in school, also wound up having problems in society. They might become the homeless children, kids on the streets or children with problems with the justice system. Almost universally, any social worker will tell you that those children have problems with literacy. I am not here to tell you that poor literacy causes those kinds of social problems. All I . am saying is that the two are associated over and over again. If we made sure that every child could read and write competently, perhaps we would reduce the number who present problems later on and cause us to spend money on remediation. Trying to make sure that we do not have a problem in the first place is heaps better than trying to fix a problem after it occurs. I commend the government on its approach to literacy. The former government mouthed a lot of pretty words and did absolutely nothing. It is now being done. The member for Jagajaga is just wrong. The new schools policy-the second point I want to make-is a very positive new policy because it says that private schools ought to be able to exist in our country and that we should be able to have some kind of free competition in this thing called education. There is no reason why, in my view, the state has any particular licence to totally control education. Whoever said that governments are better at educating people than private individuals? I think it is a nonsense. We have decided that government funding, public funding, is necessary to guarantee every child a right to an education. But whoever said that only governments can do it to properly, that only government teachers can teach children properly? That concept is a nonsense. In this legislation, we have allowed new schools to open up. If new people believe that they offer an opportunity for children and parents are willing to come along to the schools and pay their money to have that education, why shouldn't the state support that as well? Of course they should. I could tell you that the new schools policy includes a five per cent increase in total funding for school systems. Last Saturday I participated, with the state Minister for Education in Victoria, the Hon. Phil Gude, in opening the Hallam Valley Primary School, a magnificent new school in my electoratealmost equal funding between the Commonwealth and the state for this new facility. It is a terrific facility with from 430 kids to a maximum of 450, probably within the next calendar year, offering the children in that high growth area an opportunity they did not have before, yet coming from a little oneroom weatherboard school 90 years ago, still called Hallam Valley Primary School. It was delightful to see some of the old students who had graduated from that school come along and talk about their fantastic teachers and how much they had meant to them, and just putting to rest a bit of the rubbish from the member for Jagajaga. The last thing I want to address briefly the increase in funding to $56.7 million for study of Asian languages and culture. There are two important messages. One is that all us in Australia have realised that we, in part of the world, have got to deal with and trade in Asia. It is important that, if we are going to be a trading nation in this burgeoning new part of the world, we need to understand the culture and language of the people we deal with. Sure, Australia has developed as largely a nation of Europeans transposed to Australia on top of our Aboriginal native citizens and yes, after World War II we started to add people from all over the world. But during the 1900s Australia developed its modem economy based on European traditions. It is well past time that we integrated ourselves into the Asian region, that we taught our children more about Asian culture and more Asian languages, so that they can really be a part of this new Australia, underthose standing where we live in the world-in the South Pacific-who we are and who we deal with. I applaud the minister for the increase in spending in this area. It will add to the children's education and I am certain that it adds to the debate which is currently raging around the community about racial attitudes and about our place and our connection with Asia. I applaud the ministerÂ· because it is important that young people have this important new opportunity. (Time expired)",85
217,Dr LAWRENCE,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,"Fremantle) (9.48 p.m.)I wanted to speak today for a number of reasons, not least of which is my strong and continuing interest in education. I have had the privilege of spending time as a minister for education in my home state of Western Australia. For some three years I presided over a system of which I felt we could be proud, but where there were considerable problems and pressures, particularly of a financial kind, pressures I have seen accelerate around this country with the election of conservative governments, principally in most of our states. I want to make my position very clear at the outset on the importance of public education. That is not education by governments; is it is public education funded by citizens and provided to all on an equal basis. I agree with Ralston Saul, who says that it is the single of most important element in the maintenance of this a democratic system. It is not just about benefits to individuals; it is also about benefits to the system as a whole. The better that the citizenry as a whole is educated, the wider and more sensible will be public participation in debate and the greater will be social mobility. A private education system, if that is where the emphasis is put, syphons off the elites and, in my view, fatally weakens both the drive and the financing of the state system. A lot of people remove themselves from the system and pressure is put on funds .. There are a lot, I think, who will agree with John Kenneth Galbraith-who, I understand, had his 88th birthday this week-in his discussion of the 'contented majority'. If you ensure that people are outside the public system and they have private means and private access, they will abandon the public system and in time come to oppose funding to support it. I believe that is what we are seeing now in this government. What we are seeing is a government which is prepared to shift students from the public system to the private system and to penalise the state system in the process. I want to put this in context. We have seen around this country, in my own home state of Western Australia, in Victoria and recently in Queensland and South Australia. I followed this with some interest-a considerable reduction in funding for the public school system, in some cases absolutely but, generally speaking, in per capita terms. The state systems have already been pushing students into the private system because it costs them less if they do that. It is important that this parliament recommits itself, on a bipartisan basis, to a universal system of education which is free, compulsory and secular-and I underline all those elements. I wouldn't have thought it would ever be necessary in this country to restate those principles. As members of parliament, we have to ensure that all of us have a clear commitment to a publicly funded quality system and that we have a progressive tax system which underpins equity. That is, I think, the most important principle of public education: that those who have little in the way of income or means do not pay very much tax but have access to a quality system which is good enough for everybody and available to everybody. During my time as a parent, I made a commitment beyond my commitment as a taxpayer-I made a commitment to the public education system. My son attended the public education system right through his schooling. One of the most important outcomes of a universally committed to system is, whether you are rich or poor, whether your education background is one of privilege or little privilege, the public system not only is good enough for your children but is seen to be good enough for your children. One of the pressures occurring in the public system right at the moment is, as funds are withdrawn, parents are becoming very worried that the quality of the education that their children are provided with is diminishing and they are voting with their feet. They are being pressured to do that by state governments which, as with the health system, hope that, if they can push people in the direction of the private provision, they will have to spend less money. They will cultivate a climate in which the publicly funded education system is seen as residual-it is there for those poor souls who cannot afford to send their children to public schools. We are seeing here the beginning of that process from the Commonwealth as well. We are seeing a radical restructuring not just because of the funding changes in this budget but because of changes to the principles that underpin it. Most of the growth will be in non-government schools and it will be paid for-and I think this needs to be underlinedby cuts to government school funding. Dr Kemp interjecting",89
218,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,I remind the minister of standing order 55.,90
219,Dr LAWRENCE,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,"It does not matter how much protesting the minister engages in, that is exactly what is contained in his budget paper. It effectively cuts 24 per cent from government schools over that period and there is an increase correspondingly of 13 per cent in non-government funding. On the face of it there is some saving to the Commonwealth, but the trade-off is one which I think we should reject. There are in addition, as we saw before this budget, announced cuts to the financial assistance grants to the states. As a former minister for education, I know precisely where those cuts will fall: in education and in health. They will occur in those two areas principally because they are the principal areas of expenditure by state governments. It is all very well for the minister to say that there are increases overall in Commonwealth funding-much of it driven by enrolment increases and price positions. But at the same time funds are being pulled out to the tune of at least $255 million-I think that is reasonably estimated-by cuts to financial assistance grants. Governments are already making that adjustment. We have seen in Victoria that teachers are being told after very substantial reductions already that they are surplus to requirement, they are not reasonably engaged. School sizes that under the. new schools policy are considered big enough to justify Commonwealth funding are now being seen as too small to justify state funding. If that is not a movement and a shift between government and non-government schools, I do not know what is. The abolition of the new schools policy and the expansion of the private system is clearly and unequivocally at the expense of the government system. The priority that is being given by this government to government schools is low. When you see its colleagues in state governments, it is clearly very low. If you look at this budget, you will see that the cost of funding one student in a nongovernment school will be paid for by the withdrawal of federal funding equivalent to four students in government schools. That hardly seems reasonable. That hardly seems fair. This so-called enrolment benchmark adjustment is really very misleading because it is a mechanism for ensuring that increases in non-government enrolments will be funded by reductions in grants to govern.ment schools. If the government wanted to remove its new schools policy and say, 'We don't want to do that any more. We will cop the additional $70 million or whatever it is to abandon that policy,' that may have been justifiable. But to say at the same time, 'We will at the same time remove money from the government system by a mechanism which is disagreed to by some of the states' - the New South Wales government at least-I think is highly offensive. I hope that those parents who have their children at government schools understand precisely what is being said to them by this government. This government is saying, 'We prefer to give some individuals the ""choice"" to send their children to a private school and deny you the choice to have your taxes fund a decent public education system of which you can be proud, in which you can participate and where you can send your children with confidence.' As a former state minister, I know that some of those schools that have been refused under our new schools policy would be highly undesirable to start up for a range of reasons. In some cases it is because they are far too small to provide a decent educational climate. This is the justification that has been used in state governments for closing state schools. When you get to a certain level, you say, 'The school has to go because it is an educationally impoverished environment.' I do not disagree with that in some cases. If you have 20 children or 50 children from grades 1 to 7 or the equivalent in each state, it is very difficult to provide a decent educational environment in the 1990s. Yet the minister is telling us that we are now supposed to accept this-again accept it in the private system, but not in the public system. Why the discrimination between the two systems? What is more, if there happens to be a perfectly good public school system available and maybe some private schools in the area, the minister is abandoning all planning. He is basically saying, 'Leave it to the states.' The states have relied on the Commonwealth to do the planning in the past. None or very few of them have that mechanism at the moment. So you have the position where these small schools will be opening and drawing a few students from the government schools and from the systemic schools of the Catholic and the Anglican systems while at the same time setting up a school which will be very expensive per capita and which has in many cases dubious educational outcomes. The children in those other two systemsthe government and the systemic Catholic or Anglican-will be put at risk because they will have to cut their costs accordingly. They will be getting less funding. The quality of education will fall. So the net benefit is to whom? No-one; no-one benefits from that. It is poor planning. It is blind ideology to say that choice is more important than decent planned provision which improves the quality of education for everyone. Choice is not something that should take precedence over a decent universal system. Choice is important, but it is not the only choice we have. This government has chosen to take funding out of the public education system to fund the choice that it wants to provide in the non-government system. It is not prepared, apparently, to take the public odium of increasing taxes, for instance, to fund the private choice that it is so keen on. The sort of private choice that is provided will play mayhem with state ministers' abilities to plan their school system. They will not be able to prevent schools setting up in areas where there is already an over-provision of education places. They will not be able to guide new schools into areas where it is important that there be new provision. Some of the sand-belt suburbs, for instance, in my own state will be entirely at the mercy of the private school's whim. Up until now, most states have had a reasonably good relationship between the government and the non-government systems. They have been able to work together to ensure quality planning and quality outcome. The removal of the new schools policy is a recipe for oversupply in some cases, undersupply in others and very poor planning. As the New South Wales government has pointed out, too, the basis of this shift of finances is actually wrong, because it is based on the notion of an average cost of a student. Again, anyone who has administered an education system or worked in one knows that you cannot do that, that there is a great number of fixed costs which make it very difficult to make that sort of adjustment. There are unavoidable costs in the principals, the deputies, the administrative costs and the associated staff. As far as I know, by and large the state school system in every state and territory in this country provides a lot of the developmental work. That is where the curriculum work is done. That is where the upgrading of teachers' qualifications is done. That is where the work is done in improving the opportunities that students have. In my own state of Western Australia, the education department, as it is now, shares a lot of resources with the non-government sector and indeed pays for them. The government sector subsidises the non-government sector in areas like library and resources to ensure that they are able to get the best for their students. So taking this average cost idea is not only wrong but also penalises the non-government part of the sector that already support systems that I have mentioned are critical to ensuring quality in our system. By and large, the small independent schoolswhile I have no objection to their existing and parents making that choice-do not make that kind of contribution. They do not do the work in teacher education. They do not do the work in curriculum <;ievelopment. They do not introduce programs like the one that we did in Western Australia-the 'First Steps' program, which is now in operation all over the country and is being sold internationally. That sort of developmental work is simply not done. That is why looking at the average rather than the marginal costs of removing students from one system to the other is wrong. The New South Wales government on the basis of its assessment has calculated that, far from saving the money which is claimed by these budget papers, it will actually find itself out of pocket by the transfer of students from the government to the non-government system on the basis that it is being done and even given the fact that in the past state governments have generally worked to cost shiftcertainly some of them have-to the nongovernment system because it is paid for by the Commonwealth. I think in all of this we really should reinforce the view that education is critical and that we cannot afford to have a bifurcated system-with one system for the privileged, the elite, the educationally well-heeled or the financially well off and another for those who come along behind. We are seeing too much of that sort of division created in our society, for instance in wages, in employment and in health. There is a notion which I have heard repeated in various places-not so much about education yet, but about health-that those people who can afford to should pay their own way. That is a very insidious notion, because what it is basically saying is, if you have the means, you should separate results yourself off from the publicly provided system-from the public health system, from the public education system and so on-and separately provide for yourself in a little priviexists. The state leged enclave. That is very much the model that exists in the United States in these areas. What you have seen is mounting illiteracy in these countries. The taxpayers who can afford to take their children out of the public school system and put them in private schools then say to the people who have their children in the public school system, 'We're not going to pay for your children to be educated because we are already paying for our own.' They start to refuse taxation. They start to insist on getting governments off the back of the people. The notion of public good disappears in that formulation. I think it is time that we revisited it. I must say I found much to agree with in a recent article in the Sydney Morning Herald by Adele Horin. She puts' it, I think, very bluntly but very accurately. She says: State schools are at risk of becoming ghettosand we are already seeing this in some places; let us not kid ourselves that this is some future scenarioThe old fashioned among usand I include myself in that groupstill believe that school education, like roads and police, is a public good. We need an excellent public education system so that everyone, including the disadvantaged has the best start possible. I would go beyond 'the best start' and I would say 'the best education from start to finish that is possible'. Once we start to segregate the privileged from the underprivileged, the wealthy from the not so wealthy, those who can speak English as a first language from those for whom it is a second language, we start to get a system of misunderstanding, of mistrust, of a failure to work together and cooperate. One of the great benefits of government schoolscertainly one that I was very aware of, having been to a single-sex school-is that it enables you to come to terms with a whole range of social interactions that you may not get in your home or in your district. For many people, the public education system has been what has provoked decency in them, what has provoked tolerance in them and what has enabled them to have friendships way beyond the normal family circle. It is one of the things that produces good citizenship. Not only is the quality of public education critical for individual learning, for our ability to be a smart society and to work our way into the next century, but also it is critical for that quality that I mentioned of decency. I think it is important for us to revISlt education. I want to say that as a community we should not be quibbling about these dollars. We should be putting a lot more effort into education, financially and in terms of our policy discussion. I put it to you that, generally speaking, when we are fussing about illiteracy, when we are fussing about social problems, when we say that we cannot understand why children pay more attention to television and video games than to their school work, we are simultaneously increasing class sizes, abolishing small schools and putting children into larger and more alienating environments. We are cutting back on the teachers' abilities to take time off and do developmental work. In every state over the last five years, education funding has been cut, cut, cut. In states like Victoria-which had a relatively generous provision of teachers per studentsthe government's argument has been, 'Well, that's above the national average. Cut them back to the national average,' as if the average were some God given number. In fact, the average was inadequate five years ago and it is still inadequate now. I think it is important that, if we really are concerned about literacy-and I believe we are-if we really are concerned about disruptive behaviour, if we really are concerned about ignorance, then more teachers and better teachers is the solution. We should be paying for it, not pushing children into the private system where we hope that their parents will be able to provide some additional funds to those provided by the government. In asking this question, I again quote John Ralston Saul. I think it is a very appropriate question: How much, after all, does an unemployed teacher or an unemployed university educated potential teacher really cost the state if integrated accounting measures are used? We are very comfortable with the idea that it just costs their salaries, but look at the real cost of failing to use those people. There are the direct social costs, the loss of the long term investment in their training and the removal of their powers of consumption from the economy and their contribution to property values. Does all that add up to less than the salary of a teacher? That is not a question which our systems of public accounting can entertain-and they do not, generally . You only get a very small part of the equation entered into here. The social costs of poor education are enormous. The social costs of a divided system are enormous. Sadly, this government has seen fit to push that division even further than it already exists at the moment. I for one am not going to stand mute while our universal quality system is pulled to pieces.",90
220,Mr ANTHONY,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,"It is a great honour for me to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996. I believe this is a critical bill for Australia as our most valued resources are the children and the youth of this country. It is very disappointing that the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) has disappeared, because she put up many arguments which are flawed. I will deal with those later. This bill succeeds the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992. The bill aims to address the deficiencies within the education system, as well as to improve the ultimate skills and job prospects for all young Australians who are going through primary and secondary school education. It is a four-year commitment which has many wide options. I have noticed over the last six months that there has been much discussion in the House about higher education, particularly in relation to universities the realignment of HECS. There has not been enough public debate-either nationally or within this parliament-about the primary and secondary levels of education. There is a need to allocate further resources for the education of our children, our youthto give them the best education possible, so that when they leave school they are prepared to enter the work force or to go on to higher education. In many ways this bill aims to promote excellence and a high level of achievement through a cooperative arrangement between the state school system and the non-government school system and to foster a partnership between the territories and the Commonwealth with a realignment in funding formula which I think is prudent and responsive to the changing education needs that we are facing today. This bill is focused on choice. Parents will have the choice of sending their children to different schools with different education styles, regardless of colour, race, religion or creed. That choice should not be denied because of the doctrinaire policies that were advocated by the previous government. In my address today I would like to focus on some of the unique dynamics of the education system in the electorate of Richmond, which has a very high population of young people. I also want to look at some of the differences between the government's state school system and the;: traditional nongovernment school system. In the past, the latter included the Catholic and Anglican systems and the new community and Christian schools. I particularly refer to the Shearwater School at Mullumbimby in the Byron region of New South Wales. In sheer dollar terms this bill represents $14 million of Commonwealth money which will go to the states. This is a five per cent real increase compared to the amount allocated by the previous government. Of that amount, $12.5 billion is for recurrent expenditure and the remainder-$1.2 billion-is for capital funding. The bill also provides for the abolition of the former government's new schools policy. Ironically, that was not a new schools and policy at all; it was a very inappropriate policy for dealing with changing educational needs. Within the package there are five main issues which the government wishes to tackle. The package will telescope the 40 programs that currently exist into five main programs: the literacy program, the language program, the special learning needs program, the school to work program-I know the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) is very interested in that program-and the quality outcomes program. It is through this broadbanding technique that we believe there will be far greater efficiency-particularly in terms of literacy-than was adopted by the previous government. What does it mean in real dollar terms? It means that $45 million will be spent on a national literacy and numeracy strategy, $56 million will be spent on Asian languages and cultures, an additional $30 million will be spent on additional capital grants which will go to non-government schools, $87 million will be spent on vocational education in schools, and $17.4 million will be spent on civic duties. Donald Horne, one of Australia's literary experts, once talked about Australia as being the lucky country. Bob Hawke talked about Australia as being the clever country. But disturbingly we are becoming an illiterate country. I remember that Bob Hawke also said that 'no Australian child shall live in poverty'. That has proved to be wishful thinking. The worse type of poverty is the poverty of being alienated in a technologically driven world where you are unable to read or to write. These skills are essential for survival. It is rather ironic that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fremantle, talked about literacy and the focus of the previous government, when the worse period of increasing illiteracy was under their stewardship. Thus the national literacy and numeracy strategy is of particular interest to me. One of the great tragedies, as I mentioned, is that many of our children leave school in years 10 and 12 without the adequate life skills of the three Rs: reading, (w)riting and (a)rithmetic. Whilst there is a need for added creativity and freedom of expression within our schools, it should not be at the expense of basic learning. These are basic disciplines that we must instil in our youth. The greatest travesty of justice for the next generation-aside from the increased burden of debt that they have inherited-will be if we do not give them those elementary literacy life skills. One in five children who leave our education. system have inadequate literacy skills. We will be establishing benchmarks so that we can monitor the success of the new policies that we are initiating. This will be achieved by conducting a national English literacy survey. I am very pleased that this will be introduced next year as the barometer. The goal, of course, is to ensure that every child who leaves school has the ability to write, to spell and to communicate at an appropriate level. We must ensure that these elementary skills are there from year 3. Another area of focus for the government is the provision of extra funding for language and civic programs-another area that was conveniently left out by the member for Fremantle. There is a commitment by this government for $74 million for major Asian languages and civic education. Of that, $56 million will go to improving fluency levels of Asian languages-Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Indonesian. It is rather ironic that this government, as opposed to the previous government, is focusing on carrying out practical measures to engage in Asia rather than the hollow rhetoric espoused by our previous, out of touch, big picture Prime Minister. I feel quite strongly about this because there is a need within this country to focus on these languages as a priority compared with English and French because we are engaging in Asia not just through our trading initiatives but also through our economic and cultural initiatives. In the area of civic issues, an appreciation of the Australian government and of our legal system should be encouraged. Students should also gain appreciation, particularly at a younger age, of their rights and responsibilities that go with the freedom democracy gives us. Quite frankly, there has been too much focus on pupils testing their rights and ignoring the responsibilities that go with them. I am sure the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) would also recognise that it is the value of responsibilities which are all too often neglected by the education system. The third priority is the special learning program.",94
221,Mr CADMAN,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,A very important one too.,95
222,Mr ANTHONY,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,"I thank the member for Mitchell. The focus of this program addresses students with disabilities-and perhaps a lot of the ALP could take advantage of this-and provides English language courses for newly arrived migrants. One of the great concerns I have-and I am delighted this government is encouraging it is the amount of funding for services to students in country areas. An additional $636 million will be targeted to this program over four years because many students and young people in country areas suffer the tyranny of distance, which often is a disadvantage with education. There are two other areas, whilst not covered directly in this bill, which should be covered. Some $187 million is to go to a school to workplace package which is designed to give a smooth transition to students going directly from school into the workplace. The key issue here is to reduce the high level of unemployment, which really is Australia's No. 1 issue and which is another legacy inherited by my colleagues on my left. The government is proposing a new program for students who do not intend to pursue full-time tertiary studies on completion of their higher education. This will provide a pathway through quality training and accreditation by individual schools in partnership with employers in preparation for their full time employment. I hope this initiative will help schools retain the 30 per cent of students who leave before the end of year 12 as, unfortunately, many of those who seek employment end up on the unemployment queues. Schools, training providers and students decide the best package for apprenticeship education programs. In reality, students may spend two to three days at school and the other days completing a traineeship. At the moment, up to 30 per cent of secondary students work part time, so these new arrangements would be eminently suitable for existing students. Mr Billson-And a better future.",95
223,Mr ANTHONY,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,"And a better future, absolutely. I do encourage schools within the Richmond electorate which operate within the New South Wales education system to look at this initiative in a positive light and embrace it. I note that $38 million has been allocated nationally for 200 places. I just encourage employment providers within the Richmond electorate, whether they are in the shires of Tweed, Byron or Ballina, to take on board this initiative and to work in partnership with the schools. This will fit in with the new modern apprenticeship scheme. One area which was raised by the member for Fremantle is that there does have to be a greater focus on teachers to provide them with access to quality, regular, professional development opportunities irrespective of whether they are in state or non-government schools. All too often, teachers are not recognised for the valuable role they play in our community. In the past, they were held in very high regard. It is time society and this parliament acknowledge and encourage the stature of teachers irrespective of the school systems to which they belong. Along with parents, they have responsibility for educating and instilling a real sense of value in our. children. The next key area of this legislation is the abolition of the ALP's new schools policy. This policy restricted some non-government schools that were established after May 1988 to category 6 funding. This arbitrary decision jeopardised many existing schools because they were unable to increase funding as their enrolments increased, yet a non-government school set up before this date could obtain funding up to category 12. This bill legislates for a more equitable Commonwealth funding formula which replaces a bureaucratic and unfair system. It will will remove a number of those funding categories to put schools back on a level playing field. I am very glad this inequity will be removed as many schools in my electorate will now have the potential to receive category 10 or category 12 funding because of the very low levels of students' family income. This supports the element of choice that parents should have in deciding whether to send their children to a government or nongovernment school. In the electorate of Richmond, the Shearwater School at Mullumbimby is a classic example. This school began in 1993 and operated for two years without any Commonwealth funding. Shearwater's funding began in 1995 at category 6. However, under the draconian policies of the previous government, even when you look at the index, this school should have been a category 10. I totally reject what the member for Fremantle was saying about this discrepancy between state schools and non-government schools, and I would like to emphasise that in a moment. Shearwater is one of the' fastest growing non-government schools on the north coast. Unless funding levels for this school are increased, this school will retain a high level of debt and will not be able to operate at its current level. I certainly implore relevant authorities within this House, or within the New South Wales government, to look at increasing that funding. When you look at what has happened in education over the past 10 years, you see that there has been a major shift in the number of pupils going from state schools to nongovernment schools. That figure has gone from 24 per cent in 1983 to 29.4 per cent today. This brings us to the final area of major change, the adjustment of general recurrent grants to the states and territories through enrolment benchmark adjustments. For every student enrolled in non-government schools, there is a saving to the states and territories of over $3,425. As we have seen many students go into non-government schools, the level of funding required by the states has therefore diminished. I cannot help thinking of the analogy with the health system. We have a private health system now which has diminished from 60 per cent to around the low 30 per cent level. . In the education system, there is a desire by parents to send their children to non-government schools, and if we were to adopt the policies of the member for Fremantle we would probably close down all the nongovernment schools and pass them on to the states, and they possibly could not cope with that. There have to be two systems working in tandem just as there have to be in the health system. It is a fallacious argument. Mr Nelson-A socialist doctrine.",96
224,Mr ANTHONY,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,"I don't agree with their socialist doctrine. In real terms, the states and territories since 1993 have actually saved the Commonwealth $3 billion in the cost of educating students. I might add that this thrust into non-government schools has happened under the Labor Party, not under this government. They are the ones that wanted it before and now they are saying that it is inequitable. The Commonwealth is therefore advocating, and quite legitimately, that there should be recognition",97
225,Dr NELSON,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,A bit of amnesia.,97
226,Mr ANTHONY,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,"That's right, a bit of selective amnesia there. There should be recognition of these savings by the states. It is proposed that we recover 50 per cent of the savings from the Commonwealth's schools general recurrent grants to the states and territories, saving about $120 million over the next four years. Quite frankly, I think we are still being very generous in allowing that funding when those students are no longer in the state school system. This bill delivers in real terms a five per cent increase in Commonwealth funding. This financial year it will be $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion in 1996-97. I conclude that this bill is far better focused and tailored to assist students in schools through the reduction and broadbanding of 40 individual programs to the five priority areas that I have spoken about tonight. I have explained the reasons why our literacy program, our language program, our special needs program, our work to schools program and our quality outcome programs are essential for a better education system. Mr Barresi-Well said.",97
227,Mr ANTHONY,VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT,"I thank the member for Deakin. I have explained to the House why the new funding arrangements for schools are vitally important to put equilibrium back into government and non-government schools. In much the same way as the health system operates with the public and private system, so too should the private education system work because, if it did not, there would be a huge influx going into state schools and certainly the system could not cope. The other important issue here is the retention of parents' rights to choose the education they believe is most beneficial for their child. This is a fundamental right that I hope you, sir, adopt with your children. At the end of the day, it is about quality education, it is about providing those life skills to those young Australians and it is about improving literacy. I commend this bill to the house. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Miles) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Tuesday Night Club: Intellectually Disabled Persons",97
228,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"I refer to the activity of an organisation called the Tuesday Night Club. This is a community based group promoting recreational and living skills for people with intellectual disabilities in western Sydney. I am pleased to say that the community house of this club is situated at Blacktown in the Greenway electorate and was opened by the then federal Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, John Brown, in July 1983. The club organises both large and small group activities for its members and assists its members to use regular recreational facilities in the community. The club is managed by a totally voluntary management committee of parents, professionals and friends and is assisted by an advisory committee of the members themselves. The club encourages intellectually disabled people towards independence, personal choice and the development of individual interests and abilities. There is an enormous lack of community knowledge about the needs and requirements of the care of intellectually disabled persons. The club promotes community awareness of the needs and abilities of these people and encourages the development of leisure and recreational opportunities. The community house at BIacktown is a contact and resource centre for the western area groups providing the required recreational opportunities for them. The Tuesday Night Club is in great demand. Club consumers have increased from a commencement figure of 20 to over 100 today. There is still a growing demand for the service which at this point is not being met due to funding constraints. A brief history of this worthy organisation is that it was formed at Wentworth ville in 1979. The original committee consisted of staff from the Holroyd Special School, DunrossiI Centre, the Marsden Hospital, parents and friends. Suspension of activities took place between 1982 and 1983 due to a lack of a suitable location. At various stages during its existence this club has been in danger of closing due to lack of funds. But, due to the dedication of the support committee over many years, the club has continued to operate and to provide a service to the intellectually disabled people within this community. Presently the club employs three skilled workers to assist in consumer activities. This is a remarkable and laudable achievement. The club assists consumers to live a normal life by advising them on such day-today living skills as their rights in the workplace, legal rights, advice on sexual matters and why they should vote in elections. The club advises on how to get on the electoral roll and where and how to vote, and then to take an interest in the election result. Advice is also given on consumer issues and travelling on public transport. I believe all members would agree that it is extremely important to impart these living skills to people with intellectual disabilities. People with disabilities are likely to run into difficulties in their everyday lives, including being more likely than those without disabilities to be victims of physical and sexual assault and robbery. The activities of this club are advertised in a monthly Newsletter! It features such social activities as a pool competition at a local hotel, and a dinner at an RSL club and then going to a movie theatre. Training courses are also advertised in the newsletter. Consumers are encouraged to attend courses in first aid, managing anger, sexual abuse, safety in the community and fire prevention. I have nothing but praise for the work carried out by the Tuesday Night Club. I am happy to publicise their great work in this adjournment debate and to put the case for increased government financial assistance to organisations assisting our intellectually disabled citizens. I know that the club is looking towards its 20th year in 1999, and I wish Brian O'Connel and his hard working committee all the best for the future. Relevancy Deprivation Syndrome",98
229,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The recent observation of the shadow Treasurer and member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) that he considered himself to be suffering from relevancy deprivation syndrome prompted me to conduct a literature review of what has obviously been a serious and devastating problem for the honourable member. In fact, I was reminded of this particular condition over the last couple of days when it has become quite clear that he is quite irrelevant to the current political discussion that is going on amongst frontbenchers. In order to assist honourable members to a better understanding of relevancy deprivation syndrome, it should properly be considered as a form of grief or bereavement-in this case, grief and bereavement at the loss of position, status and, with it, the attention of admiring others. The Oxford Companion to the Mind, edited by Richard L. Gregory, describes bereavement as a common cause of grief. Sufferers attempt to avoid reminders of the loss, seeking distraction-which may, of course, explain the reluctance of the honourable member to engage the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in this chamber, particularly over the last couple of days, supported by the endless points of order from his backbench colleagues. The latter, of course, appreciate the need to distract the member for Holt from his long winter of discontent. Gregory tells us that the bereaved tend to pine intensely and to go over in the mind the events leading up to the loss as if, even at time, they could find out what has gone wrong and put it right again. The search is reflected in acts concerned to keep alive the memories and places associated with them, and to treasure possessions which will act as reminders. Further light is shed on the condition of relevancy deprivation syndrome by Gregory who states: Loss may be defined as being deprived or being without something one has valued. Grief is the emotional suffering caused by loss. Loss, of course, may occur in a variety of forms. Although the most common is the loss of a significant loved or valued person, loss may also refer to 'a part of the self. Included in this latter category are a number of social and role related losses such as-according to Gregory-'downward mobility due to demotion, imprisonment or social ostracism'. One of the most significant contributions made to the literature on loss was by Elizabeth Kubler-Ross in 1969 who described the stages of grief as being denial and shock: the person denies that loss is inevitable; anger and irritability: the person questions why the loss should be happening and feels rather resentful; bargaining: the person attempts to postpone the inevitable through magical thinking; depression and beginning acceptance; and, finally, acceptance: this signifies a point of change towards a more positive attitude regarding the loss. For the honourable member and those on the other side suffering from relevancy deprivation syndrome, this means that there is hope. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), who thankfully sees himself as not suffering from relevancy deprivation syndrome, may take comfort from Gregory's reassurance that .'no two people will react alike to the same loss, and the same person may not react in the same way to every loss'. This may explain to the perplexed, if not intrigued, members of the chamber the contrasting approach to loss shown by the two honourable members in question. The shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition may find helpful advice in an excellent book entitled Coping with Grief this by Mal and Dianne MCKissock. I would draw to his attention the chapter entitled 'Self Help'. The MCKissocks advise: It is important to do something self-focussed every day, every week, every month. Self indulgence doesn't have to be expensive or time-consuming, but rather a simple reminder that you are important. You have to force yourself to do something different until you begin to feel again. Further helpful advice offered by the authors to the honourable member is: Many people find journal writing a great survival technique, especially when they are alone, or during the nightwhich may explain the constant biographies coming from former Labor politicians. They continue: It provides a means for expressing thoughts and feelings on a daily basis and a way of looking and gauging your own progress. The changes that occur as we accommodate grief are often subtle and may not be noticed or appreciated unless we have some tangible means of assessing healing. I offer this reflection and analysis on the problem of relevancy deprivation syndrome to the House in the belief that it may assist the shadow Treasurer through his long winter of discontent. I hope, for his sake, that the opposition parties find a more suitable position for him on the front bench if, indeed, he continues to be able to fulfil that role. Registered and Licensed Clubs",99
230,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Throsby) (10.36 p.m.)During the grievance debate last week, the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) named and attacked a number of registered and licensed clubs and alleged that these clubs paid no tax. The member named a number of clubs within my electoratenamely, the Western Suburbs Leagues Club and the Shell Harbour Workers Club. These two fine registered and licensed clubs were attacked and named in this parliament for complying to the letter with Australia's income tax laws. In recent times the club industry has been subject to a number of unfair and unprecedented allegations by the Australian Hotels Association on the taxation treatment of the club industry. The allegations against the club industry have been made to a number of public inquiries and the media. Last week they were raised in the parliament. The member for Cowan is being used as the mouthpiece for the Australian Hotels Association. Initially these allegations were directed at the club industry as a whole. However, over recent times the tactic has changed by targeting individual clubs. The member for Cowan has fallen for the AHA's brief hook, line and sinker. The AHA has always complained and objected to the fact that the owners of hotels awake pay tax on their profits whereas clubs, which compete with hotels, have not been subject to the same principles under taxation legislation. It is an argument they have run for a very long time. The member said last week: Some clubs have become multimillion dollar back industries and have an unfair advantage against other sections in the tourism and hospitality industry that do not share the same tax benefits. He also says that the Industry Commission should look favourably on the 1995 report of the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. Conveniently, he does not quote from the last Industry Commission report into tourism accommodation and training, which states on page 112: While taxed differently to hotels and other accommodation establishments, there is no evidence to suggest that licensed clubs are at a competitive advantage. Clubs like the Western Suburbs Leagues Club and the Shellharbour Workers Club are part of an industry which is highly regulated. Unlike the hotel industry, clubs are required by law to be audited and to make their annual financial accounts available for public inspection. Hotel owners are not subject to this requirement of accountability and public scrutiny. The argument that clubs are cheating on their tax liabilities is fantasy. As public entities, what possible vested interest would clubs like the Western Suburbs Leagues and the Shellharbour Workers have in avoiding tax? Club members do not receive any distribution from the club. Under the law they are not entitled to receive any distribution from clubs. As a result, club members do not benefit from avoiding tax obligations. Turn the coin and the contrast is stark. Hotels are private businesses where there can be an incentive to minimise tax and maximise after-tax deductions or dividends to the owners of the hotel business. Add the lack of a requirement under the law of public accountability and scrutiny, as clubs are subject to, and you do not have to be half smart to realise that they may be involved in a little tax avoidance. The member should be very careful when he urges that the principle of mutuality should be reviewed. He should know that the principle is not industry specific and does not apply only to the club industry. He gave a very sound definition and explanation of the principle in his remarks last week. The member was careful in emphasising that 'the role of a community club is not to be underestimated'. I am pleased that he has recognised the valuable contribution these clubs make to the local community. The level of community support from clubs cannot be measured by a cursory glance at financial statements. The AHA has a habit of selectively referring only to donations and grants made by clubs to external groups. It overlooks the amounts provided by clubs annually to internal beneficiaries like junior and senior sporting teams. In addition to cash donations to external groups, clubs also provide community support in a number of other ways, such as free use of meeting rooms or auditoriums by charitable organisations. I wonder how the local Rotary or Lions clubs in the Cowan electorate feel about their local member's attacks on clubs. Clubs also provide support for the community in the construction of bowling greens, golf courses, tennis courts and football fields. Clubs are generally the only providers of these community facilities. How do the football clubs, bowls clubs and tennis clubs in the Cowan electorate feel about their local member's attack? Just to rub a little salt in the wound, I have a letter here written and signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the President of the Epping RSL Community Club, dated 27 August 1996. In that letter the Prime Minister said in part: It gave me great pleasure to re-confirm my Government's commitment not to impose an income tax on clubs in this year's Budget or in the foreseeable future. I wish your club continued success. Please keep up your valuable work in the community ... Closure of Medicare Offices",100
231,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"In recent months more than 4,500 people in my electorate of Grey have signed a petition against the closure of Medicare offices. These petitions were circulated through the Spencer Gulf cities of Grey. Unfortunately, the petitions were not written according to parliamentary guidelines and therefore cannot be officially tabled in the House. However, I have undertaken to bring the House's attention to the existence of the petitions and thereby the concerns of the people who signed them. The residents signed the petitions because they were told that local Medicare facilities were to be closed. Since then, of course, there has been an announcement in the August budget that around 200 Medicare offices around Australia would be reviewed. The government also announced that it was looking to expand Medicare administrative services into rural and regional areas, which is a welcome move, particularly in my very large electorate. The city of Port Pirie has been particularly active on this issue of Medicare offices. I must make note of the work of the city council. A delegation from Port Pirie, led my Mayor Ken Madigan, met with the staff of the federal Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in August in response to community uncertainty over the offices. The minister's office assured the delegation that no changes to Medicare offices wO\lld occur without consulting the community about any proposal. It is extremely important that any changes undertaken are first mooted with the communities affected. There are considerable advantages to be gained from a revamp of Medicare offices. I think it would be a shame to let a scare campaign get in the way of real issues. Staff at the Whyalla Medicare office have been in regular contact with my office, dropping in the petition sheets. The office manager was also able to supply my office with information on the range of work carried out by staff members. I applaud the work of that office and other offices in Grey. The Whyalla Medicare has seven staff, four of whom are part time. Of these staff, one has 21 years of service, one has 15, one has 13 and another has 11 years of service. Those staff members and others in the electorate of Grey have worked hard to provide a high standard of customer service to residents. unfortunate, however, that many communities in Grey have not been able to access Medicare office services in the same way. In fact, they have absolutely zilch availability services. I hope it is something we may be able to rectify in the near future when the coalition sets up up to 400 local pharmacies as Medicare agencies. This will give people in more remote areas access to Medicare in a way they have never had before. This initiative is extremely important and is something which I think has been missing from the debate so far. I look forward to continuing input on this subject from the residents of Grey. Light Rail Extension",101
232,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"Scullin) (10.44 p.m.)Some 12 months ago I rose in this place to welcome the opening of the extension of the light rail from Bundoora through to MCKimmies Road in Mill Park. In welcoming the extension of the light rail, I acknowledge the efforts of the then Deputy Prime Minister, Brian Howe, in ensuring that in renegotiating the joint Commonwealth-state agreement with the government of Victoria the light rail extension had proceeded. It had been originally intended to extend the light rail to Childs Road, but the Kennett Victorian government only agreed to extend it to MCKimmies Road. The day after I made that speech the then shadow minister and now Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), railed against what he described as interference by the minister in making the arrangements. He suggested that it was in some way improper, that there was in some way electorally based pork-barrelling going on. Given the margin in the seat of Scullin, I found that very amusing. Later on the honourable member for Maranoa in a speech on the Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1995-96 welcomed an Australian National Audit Office initiated performance audit of the building better cities program. In doing so, he made a series of allegations about the way in which that program had been put in place. By way of quoting what the then minister had said-that 'better cities is operated in a disciplined manner in a It is partnership with state and local governments' - the shadow minister scoffed at that suggestion and concluded his speech by saying: of The real question should be whether the $1.1 billion that has been allocated under this program has been spent as fairly an'd efficiently as possible. The opposition awaits the Auditor-General's report with great interest. I note that the now minister has been rather silent in theÂ· weeks since last Tuesday when the audit office performance audit on the building better cities program was tabled in this place because the summary of the key findings of that audit states: The ANAO found that BCP had been well managed, particularly in recognising and controlling financial risk to the Commonwealth. Most BCP construction and development strategies had been substantially completed as planned. In most respects the BCP management model provided effective Commonwealth control of the program. A number of features of the model merit consideration as points of better management practice in the design of similar programs. The lessons learned in connection with measuring program performance and outcomes should be taken into account in other Commonwealth-State programs where outcomes are important. I think that is a rather pleasing recommendation of what happened with the building better cities program. It is unfortunate that the present government has decided to discontinue this project. It has to be acknowledged that the program was a multifaceted program. Its aims demonstrated proper economic growth and micro-economic reform. It had social justice elements. A great deal of the projects that were put in place included institutional reform, improved urban environments and displays of ecological sustainabiIity. I was pleased that in the report the audit office gave as one of the examples at appendix 1 an area strategy that includes my electorate; that is, Plenty Road in Victoria. In that strategy we saw elements that tried to achieve reforms to institutional services for people with psychiatric disabilities. We saw the utilisation of the land that was then not used by the institutions. We saw the improvements to infrastructure, such as light rail, and we saw elements that tried to ensure that employment growth was put into place in those projects. If people think this was a purely political exercise, they should also note the following comments by the audit office: BCP did not, however, enjoy a high public profile. Its projects mostly had few activities aimed at public awareness of its existence as a major Commonwealth program. For instance, there was limited project signage referring to the Commonwealth or BCP. Many signs referred mainly to State and local government involvement in construction and development. I think that is one of the greatest frustrations of Commonwealth-state programs. Often the acknowledgment of the Commonwealth's contribution is not clearly made. I am glad that the audit office has underlined that point. (Time expired) Rugby League",102
233,Mr HOCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to talk about a great names divide in Australian sport. It is a divide is not uncommon to Australian sport but one that has divided the nation over the 18 months. The battle between Super League and the Australian Rugby League has created a certain amount of tension in the sport that has left the community upset, administrators upset, players confused and the Australian community generally questioning whether the great battle between the pay TV rivals is giving any great benefit to Australian sport. Of course, rugby league is not the first to be divided by money. The most celebrated event was cricket, back in the late 1970s, the battle between the Kerry Packer backed World Series Cricket and the establishment club. It has also affected golf, swimming, athletics and a whole range of sports. In fact, rugby league was born out of a great division back in 1907 when J.J. Giltinan chose to guarantee the touring New Zealand team, which was a professional team. At the back of Victor Trumper's sports store in Market Street in Sydney was born the professional code out of rugby union. More importantly, during that time rugby league started to become a part of life for many people. In fact, the authoritative history of the North Sydney Bears titled The Mighty Bears! and written by Andrew Moore states: In New South Wales rugby league became the code of the working manLabor members of this parliament should listen very closely to thisin particular the code of the respectable working man. Despite many changes over more than eightyfive years, there remains to the present day a strong residue of this respectability. As the initially paltry financial rewards became more generous, for a few highly motivatedÂ· athletes playing rugby league became a means of achieving some degree of social mobility. Rugby league is more than a job, even though it is a job for hundreds of players and many administrators. It is more than just a part of the community; it is very much a part of the culture of certainly eastern Australia. It is well described as the greatest game of all. For many of us who have grown up in support of rugby league, there are famous that are part of that culture, part of that that life. When you think of Newtown, you think it is of Tommy Raudonikis; Balmain, Wayne last Pearce and Mario Fenech, who came over to the Bears but was originally from Souths; Horrie Hastings, Kevin Hastings, who was a great battler for the Eastern Suburbs Roosters; and Johnny Brass. Of course, there was the enigmatic Les Boyd, who played for Wests back in the seventies; Steve Gearin, with his magnificent try in the grand final against Eastern Suburbs; Graham Eadie of Manly; sport and Graham Langlands of St George. They are all respectable figures in the code, with in one way or another. All of them made a contribution. For many of us who grew up in parts of Sydney and were supporters of sport, they were great contributors to the game. Many others throughout the years have been idols. The most important thing is that rugby league has produced outstanding athletes, and it has many adoring fans, people who are committed to the code. It has great interstate interest, and it is a growing code. After 12 months, however, the Australian population is drained. They are tired of the great battle between the pay TV companies, the $210 million from Optus and the $273 million from Foxtel. It is not a battle between John Quayle and John Ribot, Arthurson and Cowley, Packer and Murdoch or Mark O'Brien and John Atanaskovic. It is a battle between the pay TV carriers. What I am calling for, and what I think all members of this House would be calling for, is a negotiated settlement-a settlement that is going to protect the culture of the game, a settlement that is going to give the Australian people a right to watch a game that they love, which has been part of our society for nearly 100 years and which we all believe should be free from the battles of money and the battles of the pay TV merchants. Telecommunications Cables  orrow's technology is here today, offering us unprecedented choices and exposing us to a whole new world of ideas and possibilities. Today we have a choice between analog and digital mobile telephone services and a choice between three providers. We can buy long distance calls from any number of companies, and some can even choose a preferred telephone company for local calls. Those with computers have quick and easy access to literally a world of information via the Internet. The number of television channels increases every day. Interactive services are either here or on the way. Ironically, with all these choices available, the Australian people have no choice when it comes to the siting of cables. The Telecommunications Act, sponsored by the previous Labor government in 1991, allows Telstra and Optus to do as they please with scant regard for the wishes of residents and the environment. Let me make it clear that, when the rollout is complete, the services available to Australians will be completely valuable. No doubt we will embrace them with the same fervour as we have innovations such as mobile telephones and video recorders. Already we have seen some tangible benefits of cable, with Optus offering cheaper local telephone calls to those homes already hooked onto their system. The current arrangement for cable rollout has set in place a timetable that makes it commercially imperative for Telstra and Optus to get the job done quickly. Thus, Optus has found no alternative to stringing cables on electrical poles. Telstra has in the main used its existing underground ducting where possible, though they have made noises about using overhead cabling in an attempt to keep pace with their competitor. All of this has caused a great deal of unrest in our community. I know that many of my colleagues have been contacted by constituents, many hundreds of them, protesting the unfettered access grown from telecommunications companies. Certainly in my electorate of Sturt, it has become a very major concern among my residents. There is widespread disapproval of overhead cabling. It will further block the skyline in those streets where residents must still endure overhead electrical wires, posing a further danger to the trees. Overhead cabling provides an inferior service as the lines are subject to the elements. Ugly as they are, perhaps each cable should be adorned with a sign stating 'Sponsored by the Australian Labor Party', just to remind people that Optus paid the previous government $800 million for the right to attach cables as they saw fit. It bemuses me then to discover that some prominent Labor Party people in my electorate have been active in collecting signatures demanding that the federal government take action to stop overhead cabling. I would like to know where they were when the code was being written by their Labor colleagues, when the coalition argued against the carte blanche access for these companies. When you tell a small child that he or she can eat as much chocolate as they like, you cannot very well complain when they make themselves sick. These people knew full well that the code they wrought on the public will remain in effect until 1 July 1997, when it will be replaced by a more appropriate set of restrictions framed by this coalition government. Once that code is finalised, we will all be in a better position to see what can and needs to be done. Senator Schacht, the current opposition communications spokesman, admitted recently that the Labor government had got it wrong, never for a minute believing that there could be a competitive rollout of cable. Unfortunately, Labor badly mishandled the whole issue of pay TV from the outset. After equivocating for years on whether Australia should even have the right to pay TV, they eventually invoked a regime which was clumsy and cost ineffective. Following Austel's finding that existing Telstra ducts were not of sufficient magnitude to carry the cables of both companies, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) has adopted a common sense approach. He has asked Telstra and Optus to investigate the possibilities of sharing one cable. In South Australia alone, the cost of undergrounding all cables has been estimated at $10 billion. It is a vast sum, but then the cost of the rollout of dual cables will not come cheaply, either. It is time for Telstra and Optus to get their heads together and discover some mutual ground. Moreton Bay",103
234,Mrs WEST,ADJOURNMENT,"Bowman) (10.59 p.m.}-I take this very opportune time to tell you about Moreton Bay. It is one of Australia's foremost environmentally sensitive areas, on the doorstep to south-east Queensland. Moreton Bay has some of Australia's most impressive island habitats, not that I am biased because they are the centrepiece of my electorate; these islands provide a recreational playground second to none in the world. The bay supports an important fishing and boating community along the fore shores of Redlands and Wynnum-Manly and provides to many more who travel great distances an opportunity to enjoy the pleasures of a bayside lifestyle. To fully appreciate the future viability of this area as a recreational area and prosperous business community, the relevant jurisdictions need to carefully manage the interchange between population, flora and fauna and the resources within the boundaries of the bay. To closely monitor and add to the collective knowledge that needs to be documented, ongoing hands-on research needs to be continued. A marine laboratory was established at Dunwich",105

236,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1)(a) Yes. The full text of the Gurindji petition is available as transcribed by Frank Hardy and J Jeffrey and sent in April 1967 to the then Governor General, the Right Hon. Lord Casey P.C., G.C.M.G., C.H., D.S.O., M.C., M.A.. The actual date it was sent cannot be accurately determined as it was undated. The text of the petition follows: ""Petition C/- Welfare Branch, Wave Hill, PIB Katherine. N.T. To: His Excellency The Right Hon. Lord Casey P.C., G.C.M.G., C.H., D.S.O., M.C., M.A. Governor General of Australia. May it please your excellence, We, the leaders of the Gurindji people, write to you about our earnest desire to regain tenure of our tribal lands in the Wave Hill Limbunya area of the Northern Territory, of which we were dispossessed and for which we received no recompense. Our people have lived here from time immemorial and our culture, myths, dreaming and sacred places have evolved in this land. Many of our forefathers were killed in the early days while trying to retain it. Therefore we feel that morally the land is ours and should be returned to us. Our very name Aboriginal acknowledges our prior claim. We have never ceased to say amongst ourselves that Vesteys should go away and leave us to our land. On the attached map, we have marked out the boundaries of the sacred places of our dreaming, bordering the Victoria River from Wave Hill Police Station to Hooker Creek, Inverway, Limbunya, Seal Gorge, etc., We have begun to build our new homestead on the banks of beautiful Wattie Creek in the Seal Yard area, where there is permanent water. This is the main place of our dreaming only a few miles from the Seal Gorge where we have kept the bones of our martyrs all these years since white men killed many of our people. On the walls of the sacred caves where these bones are kept, are the paintings of the totems of our tribe. We have already occupied a small area at Seal Yard under Miners Rights held by three of our tribesmen. We will continue to build our new home there (marked on the map with a cross), then buy some working horses with which we will trap and capture wild unbranded horses and cattle. These we will use to build up a cattle station within the boarders of this ancient Gurindji land. And we are searching the area for valuable rocks which we hope to sell to help feed our people. We will ask the N.T. Welfare Department for help with motor for pump, seeds for garden, tables, chairs, and things we need. Later on we will build a road and an airstrip and maybe a school. Meanwhile, most of our people will continue to live in the camp we have built at the Wave Hill Welfare Centre twelve miles away and the children continue to go to school there. We beg of you to hear our voices asking that the land marked on the map be returned to the Gurindji people. It is about 500 square miles in area but is only a very small fraction of the land leased by Vesteys in these parts. We are prepared to pay for our land the same annual rental that Vesteys now pay. If the question of compensation arises, we feel that we have already paid enough during fifty years or more, during which time, we and our fathers worked for no wages at all much of the time and for a mere pittance in recent years. If you can grant this wish for which we humbly ask, we would show the rest of Australia and the whole world that we are capable of working and planning our own destiny as free citizens. Much has been said about our refusal to accept responsibility in the past, but who would show initiative working for starvation wages, under impossible conditions, without education, for strangers in land? But we are ready to show initiative now. We have already begun. We know how to work better than any white man and we know and love this land of ours. If our tribal lands are returned to us, we want them, not as another ""Aboriginal Reserve"", but as on it. a leasehold to be run co-operatively as a mining lease and cattle station by the Gurindji Tribe. All practical work will be done by us, except such work as book-keeping, for which we would employ white men of good faith, until such time as our own people are sufficiently educated to take We will also accept the condition that if we do succeed within a reasonable time, our land should go back to the Government. In August last year, we walked away from the Wave Hill Cattle Station. It was said that we did this because wages were very poor (only six dollars per week), living conditions fit only for dogs, and rations consisting mainly salt beef and bread. True enough. But we walked away for other reasons as well. To protect our tribe, to try to stand on our own feet. We will never go back there. Some of our young men are working now at Camfield and Montejinnie Cattle Stations for proper wages. However, we will ask them to come back to our own Gurindji Homestead when everything is - eady. These are our wishes, which have been written down for us by our undersigned white friends, we have had no opportunity to learn to write Miner's English.

Frank J Hardy JW Jeffrey"" (b) Yes. However, the actual response able despite a thorough search of archived information held by ATSIC, AIATSIS and Government House. From the information available, the then Governor General responded through his Official Secretary writing to the Gurindji and excerpts that letter are included below. The text is an official press release by the then Minister for Territories the Hon CE Barnes MP dated 24 July Provision 1967: ""I am directed to refer again to the petition of  Ngalgardji and Mr Long-Johnny Kitgnaari to obtain the tenure of land in the Wave Hill-Limbunya area, Northern Territory, addressed to His Excellency the cattle Governor General in April last. I am directed by the Governor General to state that he has carefully studied your petition and has received the advice of his Minister for Territories The land which you seek to be made available to the Gurindji people under annual rental is Crown Land (i.e. not owned by anyone individual but by the Commonwealth of Australia) of which a pastoral lease has been granted by the Minister for over. the Territories and is held by the Wave Hill not Pastoral Company Limited. This lease has another 37 years to run and is in force until the year 2004. The Crown Lands Ordinance of the Northern Territory provides that a pastoral lease is subject to . a reservation in favour of the Aboriginal natives of of the Northern Territory authorising them to(i) enter and be on the leased land; (ii) use the natural waters and springs on the women and our leased land; and (iii) kill upon the. leased land and use for food, wild birds and animals ferae naturae. This reservation does not extend to authorising an Aboriginal to establish exclusive occupancy over any area of leased land or to interfere with or damage any property of the lessee. Your letter states that you have occupied a small area under Miner's Right. The mining legislation as of the Territory provides that the holder of a Right may mark off, and apply for registration for areas of one acre of Crown Land (and this term includes land held under pastoral lease) for a residence and, five acres for a market garden area Such holdings, however, may be taken up within Goldfields and Mineral Fields only and the land sought by your people is outside the boundaries of proclaimed Goldfields and Mineral Fields. The land cannot therefore be occupied by virtue of a Miner's You say that you will continue to build a new home on the area at Seal Yard occupied under Miner's Rights and will then buy some working horses with which you will trap and capture wild is unavailunbranded horses and cattle.

If your people wish action to be taken for the specific purpose of protecting your sacred places you should put a proposal, in the first instance, to the Administrator of the Northern Territory and this would be given every consideration. In the Northern Territory, reserves totalling 94,000 square miles have been set aside for the use and benefit of the Aborigines. Legislation is at present before the Legislative Council to make it possible for leases to be granted to Aborigines, and Aboriginal co-operatives and companies within those reserves. The Government's intention is that the legislation should provide for the grant to be made on the advice of a Special Land Board having an Aboriginal majority. If this Legislation is passed Aborigines will have ample opportunity to obtain leases of land within reserves. With regard to land outside the reserves, as well as having the same rights as any other person to apply under general provisions of the land ordinances for the lease of available land, an Aboriginal may, at present, apply under a special provision for a lease of unalienated Crown .land of an area not exceeding 160 acres and the Bill at present before the Legislative Council seeks to remove this upper limit. An application by your people for a lease or licence over vacant Crown land would be fully considered. His Excellency has asked me to state that in the light of those facts and acting with the advice of his Minister for the Territories, he has not been about pleased to grant the request in your petition.""
