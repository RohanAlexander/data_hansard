0,NA,ZZZZZ,"Is that not the truth? Do we not know that that is what is taking place? Yet so little is done. So little diplomatic international energy seems to be given to this truly disastrous problem. If one picks up the International Herald Tribune of a few days ago one will see on the front page a photograph of an exodus from Beirut travelling south. It is one of the worse looking traffic jams one could ever see. Cars are 10 abreast. Those people are fleeing for their lives from a city that is being destroyed around their ears. The Syrian Army has around 40,000 men in Lebanon. It occupies two-thirds or more of Lebanon. It seems determined, under President Assad, to drive other forces out of Lebanon and to dismember that country. The dream of greater Syria has not disappeared. The dream of greater Syria is there. What do we do for the Lebanese people? We do very little. God knows it is a difficult problem. There is no easy answer, but can we not do more? Can the countries of the world not do more than they have so far? Recently-and again this was reported in the Australian Financial Review of 17 Augustthe Secretary-General to the United Nations convened a meeting of the Security Council. The report states: A declaration, adopted unanimously by the 15 members said: ""The Council . . . urgently appeals to all the parties to put an immediate end to all operations and to all firing and shelling and sea."" The truth is that nothing has happened. The truth is that destruction continues, shelling continues, and loss of life continues. The demolition of the city of Beirut and the lives of its people continue. What I hope the Government will do, as part of its international diplomatic efforts, is give high priority to some coordinated action to bring pressure on Syria to get out-to bring pressure on the other parties, the other foreign forces in Lebanon, to get out. It needs a program of constructive diplomacy. If the superpowers can agree on the resolution that was agreed to in the Security Council they may even agree to work together with the other major powers to put some pressure on Syria to get out in the name of decency-for the lives of the Lebanese people and give them an opportunity to reconstruct their country. That opportunity is being denied them and it will be denied them for as long as Syrian forces remain in Lebanon.",104

4,Mr LANGMORE,ZZZZZ,"The attempt under way to form a solidarity-based government in Poland marks the first attempt at a peaceful transition from a communist regime to one with a non-communist leadership and substantial political pluralism. While noncommunist authoritarian systems have made the transition to democracy, there is no precedent for what seems to be under way in Poland. As Lech Walesa said recently, 'Nobody has previously taken the road that leads from socialism to capitalism'. The Polish developments are important for Australia because of their intrinsic significance and because Australia has direct interests in EastWest security. The next Polish government faces a severe economic situation, with high inflation, low output, outdated manufacturing plant and an exhausted and alienated work force. A Solidarity-led government must try to cope with these problems and simultaneously set up a new structure of political on land authority. The solidarity movement will clearly face substantial internal strains as well, as it moves from a repressed opposition force to be a leading force in government. The political and economic problems facing a Solidarity-led government indicate that there is no room for complacency in the West about prospects for change in Poland. Gorbachev's courageous and audacious policies in Soviet domestic and foreign affairs have created a window of opportunity for peaceful change in Eastern Europe which Poland and Hungary in particular are seeking to use. Change in Eastern Europe, however, needs to be well conducted and effectively implemented; otherwise it will not be lasting. It is clearly in the interests of Western states to support the process of reforming Poland and to give Solidarity a chance to achieve success in its economic reforms. Aid and support must clearly be given in a cautious manner so that it is not seen to be aiming at compromIsmg Soviet interests and not bringing into question Poland's membership of the Warsaw Pact alliance. This point was made recently by a senior American analyst, Brzezinski. What is needed from the West is a combination of material support and rhetorical restraint. There are several ways the West can help. Poland clearly needs substantial amounts of capital to make it possible and feasible for the economy to revive. There are critical shortages of both consumer goods and capital equipment. The West can help substantially by acting to alleviate this capital shortfall. There are grounds for concern that so far some major Western countries are not responding to the pace of change in events in Poland and to the critical need to support moves towards pluralism and democracy in a concrete and not just a rhetorical way. So far the United States of America has committed just $119m in aid to Poland, which is one-fifth of the cost of one Stealth bomber. . The European Community and other interested Western states could organise programs to allow a substantial number of Poles to gain skills in running economic enterprises. Western countries could encourage the process of economic reform and recovery by providing wider access to Polish goods. It is clearly anomalous that exports from East Germany freely enter the European Community through the Federal Republic while Poland's exports cannot. The West did not create the problems of postwar Poland, but it is very much in the interests of Western countries to support those who are fighting peacefully, valiantly and intelligently for political and economic renewal in Poland. At a time of economic stringency this issue, none the less, deserves Australia's interest and support.",104
5,Mr ANDERSON ,ZZZZZ,"Gwydir) (7.40)- Mr Speaker, I, like the honourable member for Fraser ( Mr Langmore), acknowledge that this is the first time. I have spoken before you and I congratulate you on your appointment. I note from the Budget Papers and from considerable discussion on the matter in recent days that Commonwealth road funding is to be kept at alarmingly low levels in the coming financial year. Total funding will be only $1,333m, up from $1,217m last year. An increase of $120m is but a drop in the ocean of real road funding need. It is not much more than a drop out of the bucket of fuel excise returns to this Government. As the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp) pointed out a couple of nights ago, this increase represents only 2.2 per cent in real terms. Furthermore, it needs to be considered against the drop of around 30 per cent in real terms over the last 6t years. It contrasts with the last coalition Budget provision for road funding of $1,203m in 1983; $1,203m several years ago and countless consumer price increases ago against Labor's best of a paltry $1.3 billion this year. I often wonder what it would be like to travel from one side of the electorate of Gwydir to the other on bitumen roads in about 20 minutes, as many on the other side of the chamber and a few on this side can do in their electorates. It must be a wonderful luxury. Under this Government, the principle of user pays is as hollow as the Budget we have just had presented to us. The users have been paying but they have not had much of a return on their investment. This year they will payout an estimated $5,645m in excise tax, and they will not be amused to know that, of that amount, around $4,300m will go elsewhere rather than on road funding. This Government has become very professional at robbing Peter to pay Paul and the Australian fuel user and road user has had enough. He or she recognises this Budget for its hypocrisy in this regard. In the townships which are not connected by bitumen in my electorate-and there are plenty of them. I am sure that the users would find sufficient materials on this issue to tar and feather the Treasurer ( Mr Keating). Has any honourable member on the other side of the chamber been required to send children by bus over 40 or 60 kilometres of rough and dangerous dirt roads-roads that become impassable in the wet? What does that do for family life?",105
6,Mr CAMPBELL ,ZZZZZ,Life is tough in the bush.,105
7,Mr ANDERSON,ZZZZZ,It is indeed. It is a good thing for the rest of us that those who live there stay there.,105
8,Mr CAMPBELL ,ZZZZZ,Have you ever been there?,105
9,Mr ANDERSON,ZZZZZ,"I certainly have; I have lived there all my life. How effective can a schooling system be with this type of difficulty to be overcome? The Treasurer would not be able to comprehend the impact of this lack of provision on families, farmers, travellers and operators of small businesses in rural communities. In places such as Pilliga and Burren Junction-little towns in isolated areas-the reality for many people is no bitumen for many kilometres. Those communities have paid their way in more ways than merely the fuel excise tax, and they de-erve better. Good roads mean better productivity, lower accident rates, less damage to machinery and equipment, and faster delivery of produce to marketplaces and export destinations. Any business manager would know that, if one neglects part of a business, that neglect will cause the rest to suffer. I submit that this Government's neglect of roads will contribute to its downfall. The coalition is committed to a substantial increase in road funding. We are listening to the concerns of the motorists and road u-er organisations, whom this Government has regarded as milking cows for too long. Over the last six weeks or so I have visited every township in my electorate. I can say with absolute confidence that the condition of roads is uppermost in the minds of most of these people there. They have had enough. We have an urgent requirement to address their nee('Js in this area because the prosperity of the nation depends upon their having the wherewithal to give of their best. Labor will not give it to them; the coalition must.",105
10,Mr CAMPBELL ,ZZZZZ,"Kalgoorlie) (7.45)-1 find myself compelled to comment that the honourable member for Gwydir ( Mr Anderson), who spoke before me, comes from the outer suburbs of Sydney, yet he complained about roads. The reality is that, if he wanted to do something rational about improving roads in this country, he would be advocating that we put a lot of money into rail. I believe that there is room for at least $1 billion worth of expenditure to. upgrade rail services in this country. In this way we would be serving some useful purposes. We would be making a rational decision to carry long haul freight on rail, where it is most efficiently carried, and taking off the roads the heavy trucks which do the damage to the roads. The' honourable member talked about people paying. The reality is that heavy trucks do not pay; they cost. The Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport in Western Australia showed that heavy haulage costs far more than is recouped in the way of taxes and charges. So if the honourable member wanted to do something serious about roads he would strongly support the modernisation and· unification of the rail system. If honourable members opposite were to have any policy at all that is the policy they should have. That is something they could berate this Government with. I do not believe that we as a government are doing enough in that regard.",106

14,Mr CAMPBELL,ZZZZZ,"Mr Speaker, I thank you for your protection. This adjournment debate gives me an opportunity to talk about the slaughter house for sacred cows. I believe that a lot of sacred cows deserve to be slaughtered. The particular sacred cow that I want to deal with tonight is the concept of the level playing field. Mr Speaker, it would have been much more convenient if you had not been prompted.",106
15,Mr SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,I will not have any reflections on the Chair.,106
16,Mr CAMPBELL,ZZZZZ,"It was not meant as such. The only people who play on level playing fields are good losers. I think we ought to recognise that it is not the way industry performs anywhere in the world. If we have good and successful industries we should be giving them all the support we can, not trying to make the playing field level. If we are serious about our overseas earnings we must look first at adding value to our natural resources. Herein lies the greatest opportunity to get improvements. I think the Western Australian Government leads the way. It leads the way in adding value to gold and wool. It is desperately trying to get mineral sands off the ground against the strong objection of the environmentalists, or, as I prefer to call them and as they are more accurately called, the prohibitionists. There is nothing in Australia to equal the Western Australian timber trust concept at the moment in the area of forest products. This brings me to the criminal actions of the Victorian Government. I have just spent some time at Orbost and I must say that I am appalled at the Victorian Government allowing 100 tonnes per hectare of usable timber to lie and rot or be burnt on the forest floor. It stays there as half-burnt logs and debris. I am told that that material amounts to about 1t million tonnes. In woodchips alone it is worth $100m to us in income, but a lot of that timber is actually millable timber. It could be milled and only the residue, the waste material, put to woodchips. The Victorian Government seems paralysed in its actions because down there the environmentalists-these prohibitionists-say, 'If we allow woodchipping we will need to get a pulp mill, and if we get a pulp mill political pressure will continue the practice of forestry'. Forestry has a proud history; forestry is an industry that deserves to continue; and forestry, through forest products, is one way in which we can address this nation's $1.7 billion deficit. It is a national disgrace. In conclusion, I applaud the stand of the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran), who has told those silly National Party people in Victoria that the future lies in the development of the industry. Those people are resisting the development of the industry to protect their own selfish, short term interests. They are frightened that, if we get timber workers there, they will probably take over the local government. Would that not be a shame! It is in Australia's national interest that we should· be ensuring that this timber is used, that we are addressing our current account deficit problem, and that jobs are created. I believe that the Victorian Government ought to get a very strong message from the more responsible Ministers in this Government such as the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) that that is the way to go. EmptyHere journment debate certainly provides some entertainment. There has been a broad range of issues discussed today from the closing of pharmacies to the postage entitlement. The airlines dispute was prominent. It appears that the olive branch held out by the airline pilots will be rejected by the employers. That is a pity. I guess that Australia still has a long way to go. As regards the stick hours which have been cited today, my information suggests that the figure is more like 62.63 hours for a Boeing crew. Tonight I would like to refer to some people who are marvellous volunteers in Australia's charities, as we enter sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) week. The Lady Mayoress's charity function, held - ver- two years in the electorate of Adelald-, IS an initiative which supports local fashIon and industry. It was started by Mrs Mary Joseph, who was the then incumbent. She has been followed by Mrs Natalie Bowen; Mrs A. J. Watson; Mrs Rosemary Boucat, representing Wendy Chapman, the Lady Mayoress; Mrs Levaun Jarvis-who does not enjoy good health but who is a very inspiring lady-and Mrs Angela Condours, the wife of the current Lord Mayor of Adelaide. The charities that are being supported this year are the Minda Incorporated homes, the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, Judith House, which is a crisis care centre, skin cancer research, and the Aboriginal Catholic Community. The categories were for student designers and new professional designers who have been in the industry for under four years. I am pleased to link this to some friends and colleagues of mine, and certainly constituents, who have supported this event since its inception-George Gross and Harry Watt, internationally acclaimed couturiers of George Gross and Harry Who Design Co. Pty Ltd of North Adelaide and Gilbert Street. They are international designers in Tokyo and London and throughout Australia. They have supported this marvellous charity since its inception. One of my favourite ladies, who has been a great support to me, is Phyllis Southgate of Impulse Promotions, a marvellous and creative talent. In 1984 I was invited to come down from Blyth in the mid-north of South Australia for the primary producers executive committee to write, produce and play in a revue called On the Sheep's Back-A Jubilant Revue. It was here that we linked together a very exciting concept of theatre and fashion which played very successfully in South Australia in 1986 for the Jubilee 150: Phyllis and I have stage-managed many fashion awards and fashion parades together. This was her final parade. She is, hanging up the glitter and turning off the spotlight on charity functions, including the Lady Mayoress's fashion parades. . I continue with the rag trade theme. I refer to a great enterprising company within the electorate of Adelaide called Saville Row Pty Ltd. Neville and Patrine Quist are the principals of Saville Row. Last week in Sydney they were grand finalists in the prestigious Australian fashion awards. This international fashion house has huge export potential which is being realised.in the United States of America and Europe. I know that the party of Misses Giorgio, Morant and Luca supported Saville Row in Sydney last week and in Adelaide's Quest for Success. The fashion manufacturing, supply, retailing and employment industry is alive and well in Adelaide.",106
17,Mr LES SCOTT ,ZZZZZ,"Oxley) (7.54)-Sport has always been an important part of the Australian way of life. This is particularly in the City of Ipswich, on which my electorate of Oxley is based. This city has a long history of producing many sports stars of both national and international standard in a wide variety of sports, including all the major codes of football. Ipswich has had such high representation in international competition that it has its own international club. However, when we think of sports people, we do not always think of the administrators behind the scenes. Tonight I would like to speak about a man who made a lifetime coinmitment to rugby league. The contribution of that man to ruby league will be sadly missed in Queensland rugby league circles, particularly in Ipswich. That man is John Clark better known as Gov. Gov passed away on 10 June this year at the age of 74 after suffering heart failure following surgery. His involvement with rugby league spanned 59 years, from a fourth grade junior player with the premiership local side through to senior administrative positions. Gov Clark's dedication to rugby league was all-consuming and his long involvement with the game, particularly at the local level, has made his name synonymous with the Ipswich league. As I mentioned, his involvement with the game commenced 59 years ago in 1930 as a fourth grade player with the local premier side. The next year he played half-back for ' the side which was then known as Starlights, and in 1934 became team captain for Norths. His playing career was interrupted by a fouryear stint in the Army when he served in North Queensland at Townsville and Thursday Island. In 1965, Gov became secretary of the Ipswich Rugby League, a position he held for 16 years. During this time he fought long and hard in the interests of Ipswich Rugby League. He had very firm views on the future of the game he loved so much and was not afraid to take on anyone who would try to sway him in those views. This strong commitment often brought him into conflict with his good friend the late Ron MCAuliffe, who was a former boss of the Queensland Rugby League. Ma.ny honourable members will remember Ron as a member of a the Australian Parliament, representing Queensland in the Senate for many years. Gov continued his administrative role as so president of the Ipswich Rugby League for three years and as Queensland Rugby League, Ipswich and West Moreton branch chairman of directors for three years. His role extended nationally as the Queensland delegate to the Australian Rugby League for three years and as a proxy delegate for 10 years. In 1972 he co-managed the Australian World Cup side which toured England and France and attended an international rugby league conference in Paris during the same year. His dedication to the game was recognised when Ron MCAuliffe awarded him life membership of the Queensland Rugby League. I understand that he also received the British Empire Medal about six years ago. Gov Clark's role as an administrator in the local league has no doubt contributed to the production of so many great rugby league players from the Ipswich region, many of whom are still making their impact on the State, national and international competition. His efforts for the game he loved will not be forgotten. His memory will linger in the minds of present and future players and administrators in rugby league circles. In addition to Gov's great contribution to rugby league, he was also a keen Australian Labor Party supporter. He was always proud to display a Labor sign in his· front yard during election campaigns. He will certainly be. remembered in my local area as a great rugby league supporter, worker and player for many years. I offer my condolences to his family. EmptyHere is a chance to put in a couple more minutes in this adjournment debate, I want to refer to the airlines dispute which has now raged over a couple of weeks. Some very salient points come into this debate. A lot of flak has been flying. I have had the opportunity to speak to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, which is easy to contact at 132 Albert Road, South Melbourne. Its phone number is in the book. I was amazed when it was indicated to me that no politicians had bothered to ring up to get a point of view. The pilots recognise, as I said in my press release, that a 30 per cent pay increase is obscene, is difficult to comprehend and is always going to be challenged. The pilots are a group of professional dedicated men who have always said that this dispute was tacky. Their claim has always been open for negotiation. I refer to statements which have been made by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) in challenging the stick time hours. A roster shows that the flight time for a Boeing 767 for the month in question was 62.7 hours. For the A320 roster, the flight time-again referred to by the Prime Minister as the stick timewas 61.68 hours per month. Tonight the pilots have issued a press release saying that they are prepared to work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. I believe that the olive branch that has been held out to the employers has been rejected. Ansett Airlines of Australia has said that it will not negotiate. I guess that its guidelines are that one cannot really go back to work and still be on strike. This country is haemorrhaging and the tourism industry is suffering. Both parties to the dispute have thrust and counterthrust across the· table. I plead with the politicians to ring the pilots to see whether something can be achieved. Surely, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories ( Mr Holding) or the Prime Minister can pick up a phone and dial into Melbourne.",108
