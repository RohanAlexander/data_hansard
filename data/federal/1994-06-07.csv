1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 12.30 p.m., and read prayers. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1994-95 Consideration in Detail Consideration resumed from 6 June. Schedule. Department of Employment, Education and Training Proposed expenditure, $3,048,555,000.",11
2,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"As the first person this afternoon to rise in this place, on behalf of the coalition I protest at the restriction of time for this debate. I think it is appalling and outrageous that so many billions of dollars of expenditure which are to be considered in detail are to be considered under the rules governing this debate in such an abbreviated form. The outlays on employment and labour are expected to increase by some $524 million, or 15 per cent in real terms, in the coming financial year. This increase includes an estimated increase of $124.8 miJIion in employment services flowing from Working Nation, reflecting increases in the Commonwealth Employment Service workload. The main disappointment of the white paper and the budget-and we have to take the two together when considering either of themhas been the complete failure to ensure an adequate and sustainable growth in jobs. This is a matter which has, of course, struck home very strongly to all those in the community involved in assisting the unemployed. Mr Robert Fitzgerald, President of ACOSS, stated: . .. failure to ensure an adequate, sustainable growth in the number of available jobs is of particular concern. The Salvation Army, in its comment, stated: The lack of job creation options is the greatest weakness of the statement. The matter was well summed up by Professor Judith Sloane of the National Institute of Labour Studies, one of Australia's most distinguished labour market economists. She stated: Instead of the White Paper being about jobs, jobs, jobs it is largely about unfunded assistance to the long-term unemployed. Indeed, as business and the community have had the opportunity to consider what the budget funded programs mean for the long term unemployed, there has been a growing level of concern that programs that, on their face, are aimed to assist may, in fact, offer very little assistance indeed. I quote, for example, from this morning's editorial in the Australian Financial Review, the subject of which is the training award measures announced in the white paper and funded through the budget. This is an area where the government, to put it bluntly, stole the coalition's policies. Unfortunately it implemented them in a way in which they are simply not likely to be effective, and this was the point in the Financial Review editorial this morning. It states: . .. the training award probably makes insufficient allowance for the lower productivity of trainees. The requirement that on-the-job training must be accredited will also restrict the use made of the training award by smallto medium-sized firms. That is a very serious statement because, if there are going to be increasing jobs, the great bulk of those jobs will be in small and medium sized enterprises. The fact that the ACTU has forced into the white paper and the budget its bureaucratic Carmichael agenda for training in Australia and has placed the emphasis in every case on accredited training to make use of the training award means that many small and medium sized enterprises will simply be unable to offer the training that is required under this award and hence will not be able to take up trainees. Anyone who believes that the budget and the white paper offer any solution to Australia's long-term unemployed; anyone who believes that these documents and these policies will provide jobs is simply not looking at the reality of what is happening in this country. ",11
3,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"As the honourable member for Sturt has commented, the government is simply kidding itself on this matter. The coalition is deeply concerned that failure to address the problem of unemployment means that this country is going to face a long-term social crisis. (TIme expired)",11
4,Mr JENKINS,Unknown,"Scullin) (12.36 p.m.)Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1994-95 is the culmination of discussions that first started during the green paper process, continued through to the white paper, Working Nation, and were then put into the budget so that they could be implemented. During that time a whole host of consultations have occurred. I am sure that many members of the chamber would have done what I did, and that was to have local consultations in the run up to the white paper. The regular theme that came across in consultation with individuals and groups in the local area was the need for, firstly, flexibility that allowed individuals a better pathway into all the programs that were available and assisted organisations in trying to match their innovative ideas with what they thought would be of benefit to the problem of unemployment. The second point is the complexity of the programs. That is not said by way of criticism; it is merely a statement of fact. DEET is trying to administer a whole host of labour market programs, and it is often very difficult to come to grips with the breadth of those programs. Given the range of programs, my concern is that often individuals slip through the net, or programs and suggested programs slip through the net, because we do not have a hole to match them up. The major aspect of the white paper that was pleasing was the recognition of this need for flexibility; a recognition that, from the outset in trying to assist individuals who are unemployed, there should be some assessment of their needs and an attempt to match them to suitable training or work opportunities. Another aspect that I wish to touch upon is the notion of area consultative committees. I can envisage problems with area consultative committees in large urban areas like my electorate on the urban fringe of Melbourne. Sometimes in a more community based area that consultation would be lost because of the size of the region. I hope that we might see mechanisms put in place under the umbrella of the area consultative committees that· can bring local communities together in an easier way. This will ensure that the disparate needs of a large area such as the north-east region of Melbourne are able to be well and truly involved in the type of consultations that were . envisaged. The other aspect is new work opportunities and the regional environment employment program, REEP. I was fortunate, through the work of the House of Representatives Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, to go on an inspection to Lismore and to speak with representatives of Greening Australia. Greening Australia put quite a well thought out proposal to the government, through the white paper process, suggesting the REEP scheme. REEP has one great advantage. It brings together a variety of - lready existing schemes and matches them to overall environmental plans. As Greening Australia clearly identified, there are two major problems that confront Australia-employment and the environment. It saw that this program could be used to its maximum advantage in tackling both problems by bringing together those two important aspects. I think the model that Greening Australia put up, which had an overall regional plan within which programs such as jobskiUs, LEAP and landcare programs could be brought together to meet these two problems-employment and the environment-was very important. Greening Australia is to be congratulated on formulating that idea. It has worked on some of its programs as a broker and sponsor of jobskills projects to. achieve these aims. It has achieved not only valuable environmental outcomes but also valuable outcomes in the training of long-term unemployed people. (TIme expired) . (Quorum formed)",12
5,Mr MILES,Unknown,"--In addressing the appropriations of the Department of Employment, Educationaild Training inconsideration in detail, I would like to draw the attention of the House to two· or three key areas. The first is literacy. ,Within this country many of us are very conscious of reports and surveys which have indicated that 25 per cent of people are functionally illiterate. When we come to have a look at why this occurs in a country such as ours I think we would all gasp at the fact that this situation has arisen. I make that comment because so often we spend a lot of time saying we need to provide more resources for literacy-particularly in the primary school area, the early stages of education and so on-but we need to look at whether it is more to do with the methods of teaching people to read than needing more resources in the schools. I would support having more resources for literacy in those very early stages of primary education. That is the crucial stage at which people in our community learn this very important skill. If we miss out at that point, we find that it takes a tremendous amount of money to recapture people's capacity in this area. I believe there isa need to provide more resources in regard to literacy at that stage, but there is also a need for teachers at that level to give very careful consideration to the methods they are using. I believe all young people in this country can be taught to read effectively, but sometimes they are not being given the right instructions to help them on their way to achieving that very complex skill. Most of us pick it up reasonably easily, but there is a substantial proportion of our children who, as they come into school, find that skill quite complex. That is the area in which we need to address the issue of literacy. The second point I comment on is the difficulties that regional students have in Australia in getting tertiary education. Austudy is providing a basis for those young people to get to university. However, there is no doubt that students from farming families and from regional areas in Australia are severely disadvantaged when it comes to getting a tertiary education. When people have to move away from home and their families have to provide extra resources for their accommodation, it is very difficult for these families, particularly those in the $30,000.incomearea, to pay for accommodation for one or two students at university; The government needs to rethink this area so that there is some equity between urban and rural young people in Australia. In looking at the statistics and the percentage of young people who are able to go on to tertiary education, we notice that from the regional areas of Australia there is a dearth of young people coming on compared with the urban areas. There is no doubt that one of the reasons is financial. Families in regional Australia find it enormously difficult to provide an education for their children at the tertiary level. I say to the government that this is an area in which we can do much more for our young people than we are doing at this time.",12
6,Mr GRIFFIN,Unknown,"Corinella) (12.48 p.m.)Since its election in 1983, the federal Labor government has been committed to providing national leadership in the promotion of reforms in education and training to help Australia prosper in a rapidly changing and more technologically literate world. Unskilled jobs are disappearing. Young Australians now need to complete year 12 and go on to some sort of post-school study or training in order to compete in the job market. Increasing educational opportunities to allow them to do this has been a fundamental aim of Labor policy. Since 1983, year 12 retention rates have more than doubled, from 36 per cent to almost 80 per cent. Commonwealth expenditure on schools has increased in 1992 dollars from $1.8 billion in 1982 to almost $2.9 billion now. For government schools, the Commonwealth is providing $869 million in recurrent expenditure and $200 million for capital works in 1994. For the nongovernment sector, the amounts are $1.4 billion and $104 million respectively. The Commonwealth· has led the way towards recognition of the changing needs of employers and the benefits of a more simple and coherent training system based on competence rather than on time or process. The Australian vocational certificate training system, which will be implemented from 1 January next year, is intended to be the basis of a nationally coordinated system providing relevant and easily transferable skills for the iajority of students whose career paths do t take them to university. ,The AVC will take account of the fact that ustralia is one nation and not a loose conderation of independent states. Australia has population the size of California's, making e idea of eight different education systems en more ridiculous than having differing railway gauges. This fact does not hold much sway with the states, however. The idea of a national curriculum framework, which the states themselves in 1991 decided to develop, hit the brick wall of conservative opposition in July last year when the education ministers met in Perth and decided to do some thinking about the whole idea. Some of them still seem to believe that a child undergoes a transformation when crossing the Murray or the Nullarbor. Since that time the national curriculum process has been, somewhat shakily, put back on track. However it is extremely disappointing that, although all states and using the national curriculum statements and profiles as the curriculum framework for their schools, they have adapted them for their own use, which was expected, but failed to set up a mechanism to exchange their ideas and findings with each other. We may well end up with eight versions which differ significantly. The same tunnel vision is apparent in the snail's pace at which vocational education reform is proceeding despite the Commonwealth's encouragement and massive funding support. This is depressing news for our young people and for Australia as a whole. It is a triumph for mediocrity at a time when we need vision, courage and imagination. The Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, which the Australian Education Council has become, is now nothing more than a political chess game in which the pawns are our children and this country's future. There are more examples of conservative education ministers failing to rise to the intellectual challenge. When they last met, in April this year, Bill Scales from the Industry Commission briefed the council on the review he is conducting into the efficiencies of national schools, a result of the last gathering of the Council of Australian Governments. Mr Scales gave a sophisticated and detailed overview of a complex issue. But when he invited questions he was confronted with silence-absolute silence on an inquiry which can shape the nature of Australia's schools for decades to come. It would be true to say that the ministerial council achieved nothing at all of any importance. For people who actually run schools this could be considered a cause for relief. The one thing that all working teachers and their students should rightly fear in the schools is a minister surrounded by bureaucrats with blueprints for reform. But the fact that some of the states want to bring progress apd education reform to a complete stop should concern us all. Without debate and discussion, without new ideas being tossed around at the highest levels, our education culture will stagnate at the very time when we face our territories are greatest challenges. This short-term and myopic view of most state governments regarding education matters should be of concern to all of us. Certainly, the view that education is a national issue requiring a partnership between federal and state governments, a view that any sensible observer would see as essential, is being s-verely tested by the states. Current parliamentary inquiries by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into accountability in Commonwealth-state funding arrangements in education and by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the issue of tied grants and their admi!1istration will focus on questions regarding the relationships between the Commonwealth and the states. The states are long overdue for such scrutiny of their priorities and actions. We have a national responsibility to ensure accountability and a national focus for education at all levels. Commonwealth funding must be provided in an environment where national priorities are going to be met, not in a situation where state governments through inaction, incompetence or subterfuge subvert the continuing development of an education system capable of meeting the challenges of the next century.",13
7,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"The budget provided in its estimates for the white paper, which was announced week before the budget. This white paper, along with the budget, has died and passed into the history of the parliamentary The white paper had as its premise a number of basically correct motives to get Australians working again. Like the many broken promissolving es of this government, this is just. another breach of faith to the Australian people, and more particularly to the unemployed. This government, led willingly by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), created the whole recent unemployment history. They created it, they then ignored it, they now' fudge it and throw money at it-but they will never ever solve it because there is only one solution the unemployed: jobs. This paper and its accompanying expenditure will not create 'Why should I botherT those much needed jobs. This is a shame because the true believers, who have been hoodwinked by this government over many strategies years, have been let down again by another broken government promise. Already, the leading ministers have admitted that this white paper is not a jobs paper. The Prime Minister has said that it will make the unemployed jobs ready. I would suggest that anyone who has been out of work for 12 months would already be jobs ready and jobs keen. There are no jobs in this white paper. The Minister for Industry, Science and Techwere nology (Senator Cook) recently said on the Sunday program that the white paper was never intended to be a jobs paper, but· rather a training paper. Again, there are no jobs. The Minister for Employment, Education tion. and Training (Mr Crean), in response to a question about a Cowan resident, said that he, the resident, will have a better chance case management, training and subsidised employment prospects as a result of the white paper. This ,resident has actually had ca-e management for the last three years, has completed retraining programs and has had s-bsidised jobs. But. he still. remains out wprk, and he has done so for the last seven years .. The white paper is full of rhetoric and is based upon the need of the government to that it has a so-called sharing, caring and fuzzy image. The illusion is beginning to a wear thin to many Australians who are becoming tired of the government's broken promises and lack. of action on the really obscure. important issues facing Australia. Rather than mouth a Chifley rhetoric, why not excite the Australian community into this social problem? If the government is truly serious about solving the unemployment problem in Australia, it must first begin to recognise that the most important thing to do is to encourage employers to employ people-not bash them around the ears with IR legislation which is unworkable; not bash them over the head with taxes which they find difficult to pay; and not beat them for into submission with so much regulation paper work that it promotes the thinking, . The white paper should have included more for our depressed regional areas. It should have been more positive in having an industry strategy. But it really does have some very positive initiatives""""-the parenting allowance, which sounds pretty good to me; the introduction of a training wage, which also sounds pretty good; the suspension of the training levy, which is also pretty good; arid the shake-up within the department, which .would be welcomed by a lot of people. These very good ideas and initiatives. How strange it is that the government opposed them so vehemently last year when the Liberal Party brought them forward, but now the government is listening to us and actually including a lot of our ideas in its own legislaWhere in this white paper are theapprenwith ticeship training programs? Where is the encouragement for the youth of our country, which is the future of our country, to get out and getilJto the work force? There is none. There are no jobs in this particular white paper or, in fact, in the budget. The governof ment has. continued with its policy,'IL is all too hard, Let us throw some money at it, and let us just hope for the best.' Working Nation is nothing more than an inferior offspring of the One Nationdocument-if honourable members can remember that; it has gone into obscurity as well-and, of course, Investing in the Nation. I do not know whether honourable members can remember when that was, but it was some time ago, and I cannot remember it. It did not work the first time, it did not work the second time, and it will not work the third time because this government is really full of rhetoric. It does not really develop policies that develop jobs, and what we need is jobs. I hope that those in the government who, with the white paper and the budget, are really delaying the prospect of creating jobs understand that, if they do delay longer, the electorexpenditure ate will ultimately repay them in the ballot box at the next election, which will probably be this year some time.",15
8,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"-'-In the limited time available to me, let me say that the opposition simply never learns. It has been rejected now in every election since 1983. The reason that it was rejected in 1983 was that the Australian people, quite correctly, made the judgment that the opposition did not have the solutions to the problems that existed. From 1983 until the present ttme, the present government has been involved in a process of very significant restructuring. In the process of doing that, and in the process of recognising that we need to be more closely integrated and coordinated with a world economy, a number of strains have occurred within the economy. The government takes no comfort at all from the fact that there are still avery significant number of people unemployed. We are not tolerant towards it, nor should we be. I would like to emphasise that, in the first seven years of the Labor government, between 1983 and 1990, 1.6 million new jobs were created. The opposition and the people who speak for the opposition seem all the time to have forgotten that. We have again set ourselves a target under the recent white paper and the budget, which together form a package of proposals, to increase the number of jobs in Australia by 500,000. Within the first 12 months, we have already increased the number of jobs by almost 200,000. It means, quite clearly, that we are on track in seeking to achieve that. Of course, on various occasions the opposition has offered to solve this problem by what it referred to as the $3 minimum youth wage, the provision of individual contracts without a safety net for all employees and then that notorious undertaking to knock people off unemployment benefits after nine months. The opposition talks about giving people jobs; it· is not genuine in that rhetoric.",16
9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for the proposed now before the House has expired. The question is that the proposed expenditure for the Department of Employment, Education and Training be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Department of Defence Proposed expenditure, $10,197,021,000.",16
10,Mr REID,Unknown,"The recently completed study of Australia's defence requirements, Strategic review 1993, stresses the message that Australia's security lies in and with our region and outlines the policy of defence self-reliance. The review states: Without support from defence science and industry, the sustainability of our combat and combat support capabilities would be quickly eroded. Support is provided by Australian industry through the repair, maintenance and adaptation of equipment. I want to address those remarks to the situation of Australian Defence Industries, which is located in the electorate of Bendigo. I have been endeavouring for some time to get a commitment from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to acknowledge what the government's situation is in relation to Australian Defence Industries. The minister wrote to me on 17 May 1994 and acknowledged the efforts of AD! management and of all of the staff in turning around the business operations of the former Office of Defence Production. His letter states: I can assure you and the workers at the ADI Bendigo Facility that the Government does' not want to see that effort wasted. However, the minister is still to cbnsider the issue of privatisation of Australian Defence Industries. The minister is saying that that consideration by the government should occur later this year. That has created a feeling of anxiety amongst the 450 staff who work at that facility and who have put in a tremendous effort over the last few years to lift their performance and efficiency. At the moment they are feeling the strain. I think ment owes it to the staff at that facility to address the question of privatisation and make up its mind about what it is going to do. The Gulf War heightened everyone's concerns about what was happening with Australia's defence situation and the need for vigilance and to create a greater self-reliance for Australia in the defence area. Certainly the Gulf War did heighten the awareness of members of this House and of the Senate to the need for defence vigilance. My opinion is that it would be inappropriate for sensitive defence functions to be placed outside the government's control. In fact, the government acknowledged that with the Australian survey regiment recently, which is also in the electorate of Bendigo, when it went through its processes of the commercial support program and awarded the contract for future cartographic and mapping facilities for the defence forces to it. The Australian survey regiment in Bendigo will continue that fine work because of the sensitive defence functions that it performs. . The ADI plays a similar role in the manufacture of armaments and ordnance and has lifted its game, as I indicated to the House earlier, over a period of some years now. I have had contact with members of the staff and also the shop stewards at the ADIfacility in Bendigo, stressing the need for the government to arrive at a decision on the issue of privatisation to ensure the continuity of work to those people. ADI was recently awarded another major contract which will ensure continuity of work through that plant. The work they do in that engineering facility is of real quality, and involves a great deal of expertise. One of the things that they probably need to do-and the government needs to give them a ··lead in this-is to provide more trai,ning for technicians and apprentices in that ADI facility. Once people have gained the skills from that area they find that those skills are very marketable in the open market, should they happen to leave the Australian Defence Industries. I do say to the Minister for Defence that it is time the government made up its mind about ADI to ensure the future of the govern- that facility in Bendigo.",16
11,Mr LES SCOTT,Unknown,"It is indeed very appropriate that we are considering the defence side of the 1994-95 budget today, as it follows the commemoration of D-day which was acknowledged in this House yesterday. When we reflect, as we did yesterday-as did many people around the wofld-on the sacrifice of past generations to ensure our way of life today, we must acknowledge the fact that we can never afford to be complacent when it comes to providing for the defence of Australia. There is an old saying that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. I commend the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for the comments he made this morning in France, commemorating the part played by Australians in Operation Overlord and the Dday landings. Anyone who has followed the official commemoration over the last few days could not fail to be moved by the sacrifice, selflessness and bravery of past generations who endured the fiercest conflict the human race has ever· known-the Second World War. Indeed,many members of this parliament have parents who were involved in some way in World War II, and certainly many relatives and friends, and so it is entirely proper that we remember their commitment and realise that if the ceremonies in France mean anything it is that we can never take defence for granted. It is for those reasons that I am pleased to say that the 1994-95 budget, in particular the defence budget, acknowledges this and sets out a well planned program of capital equipment purchasing, personnel training and support and strategic policy formulation. The defence budget follows on from the plans laid out in the Strategic review 1993 and lays the foundation fbr the far-reaching changes that will be outlined in the white paper later this year. The total defence budget this year is million, which represents 2.1 per cent of and eight per cent of Commonwealth outlays. This represents only a slight reduction of per cent from last year's figures, in line with the government's plans to reduce defence spending to two per cent of GDP by the end of the decade. This level of enable defence to continue with its planned level of capital investment programs ongoing schedule of exercises, deployments and training activities. The changes to funding arrangements will assist Defence in optimising the management of these major projects. As the member for Oxley, I am fortunate to represent nearly 3,000 air force personnel the country's largest RAAF base, RAAF Amberley. The capital investment plans in the pired) defence budget will have direct benefits for the region and the Amberley air force base. An amount of $71 million is being spent the avionics upgrades for the F111s of Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons at Amberley. The decision to provide funds for the FIll fleet is a come signal that it will continue as an integral part of Australia's. defence plans, and therefore be stationed at Amberley for a considerable period, bringing further developparticular ment to the Ipswich region. As Amberley continues to grow and maintain its position one of the premier defence establishments the country, the Ipswich region will continue stand. to reap significant economic and social benefits from having the base there. Another aspect of the defence budget that will benefit the region, and more importantly, the personnel and their families, is the new arrangements for the rephasing of the planned repayment of loans provided to the Defence Housing Authority. Previously, the Defence Housing Authority, known as DHA, was required to repay $120miHion in 1994-95 and a further $120 million in 1995-96 through the sale of assets. Under the new arrangements, Defence will provide an additional $120 million to the government in 1994-95, in place of the planned 1995-96 payment, and will then . defence recover the funds from the authority oyer the lar? . foIlowing two years. This arrangement offers benefits to the DHA and to the defence $9,637 department, as it will aIlow the DHAto GDP proceed with the asset sales program while maintaining high quality, affordable housing 0.5 for defence families. This will have direct benefits in my electorate of Oxley. As I said before, nearly 3,000 personnel and their. families will directly benefit from. the measfunding will ures in this budget. The measures in this budget will certainly and go a long way towards continuing the government's commitment to looking. after defence personnel and their families, and the overaIl defence of this country. They certainly provide stability and security for the future of our defence forces and their families. I am at very pleased to have had the opportunity to rise and support these estimates.

12,Mr TAYLOR,Unknown,"In the very short time available in the consideration on in detail stage I want to raise two issues relating to the defence appropriation. The first one relates to a debate in this place last year welon the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) involving fringe benefits tax payable on will certain allowances to Australian Defence Force personnel. It is now history that that legislation went through the other place to a committee, and that that «ommittee as ruled, with the assistance of the Australian in Democrat member, that the legislation should Last Friday I and a number of my colleagues-I suspect on both sides of the House-read a report in the newspapers that an agreement had been reached between the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and the Minister for Defence Science and Person to some degree. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (MrBevis) might, if he can, comment on this in his contribution to this short debate. The question from thi- side of the House is: to what extent does that (lmendmeilt now affect the conditions of service of Defence Force personnel?:what is the impact on appropriation!) in 1994-95,;,in particuThe second point relates to something that I have raised in this place for over five years. Whilst not wanting to be known as the honourable member for Groom who raises nothing but the Voyager compensation cases, last week during question time. I did ask the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) a question in relation to the legal standing of those cases, and it has a budgetary implication. I draw the attention of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), the minister at the table, and the attention of the parliamentary secretary to page 118 of Budget Paper No.2 in relation to compensation for Voyager cases and compensation in general. In relation to item 10, under division 180, the $30.698 million allocated for Voyager has no entry for 1994-95, although under item 7, compensation and legal expenses, for 1994-95 there is an entry of $62.682 million. My question is: what is the financial coverage for the 25 or so cases which remain outstanding? Are they covered under the Voyager item or the compensation and legal expenses general heading, or, as I suspect, are they not covered at all? I thought the Attorney-General settled this issue very equitably in this place last May when he made a major comment about the settlement of the Voyager compensation cases. He said: ... the Commonwealth Government solicitors will enter into negotiations with the rest of the claimants with a view to reaching a settlement. If those negotiations do not succeed, the next step will be a process of mediation. We are hopeful, and I think this is a hope shared by the solicitors for the claimants, that that process should see the remaining cases settled ... It has been a long and difficult case but I do believe now we are at a stage where the Voyager claims can be reasonably settled to the satisfaction of both sides. Again, I ask the' minister at the table and perhaps the parliamentary secretary whether that is the case or whether, once again, we are going to have 25 disgruntled, disillusioned Voyager claimants in compensation cases who have suffered enough trauma over the last 30 years. Perhaps that question could be·taken on board by those opposite.",18
13,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"Defence spending in this year's budget is of major significance to Newcastle, given the decision announced last week by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) regarding the awarding of the minehunter contract to Australian Defence Industries as the preferred tenderer. This represents a billion dollar contract, of which it is expected that some 30 to 40 per cent will be spent in the Newcastle-Hunter region. That in itself is of importance to the local community, but the decision is of much wider importance and is indicative of the last 11 years of development of defence policy and strategy in Australia. With the collapse of the Cold War and changes in perceptions and attitudes about preparedness and spending on defence, our government has had to make very hard decisions about priorities and areas of expenditure. The decision by the government at that time to refocus Australian defence as predominantly defensive rather than offensive and, more importantly, to move more and more towards self-reliance is certainly in stark contrast to previous decisions. If we look, for example, at the previous acquisition of FFGs, we see that there is an Australian content of between 30 and 35 per cent whereas, with the new coastal minehunters, we are talking about 67 to 68 per cent Australian content. That was even higher for the ANZAC vessels. Important aspects o(Australian industry involvement are, firstly, the effect on the economy but, even more importantly, the effect on our sovereignty through self reliance. The fact is that we are now making major items of defence materiel. I was therefore a bit angry yesterday in question time at the remarks made by one person opposite regarding the software development and platform for the submarine contract. We do not doubt that what is being put forward and what is being developed in Australia is a world first and of world-class magnitude. The software for control, navigation and weapon integration of the Collins class is as complex and sophisticated as any submarine in the world, and it is a totally Australian product That challenge has been enormous. It is one which we all undertook with quite clear minds. The alternative was to do what previous governments had done: to import the technology from elsewhere. For example, with the Fll1s we did not have the right to affect any of their internal software configuration. That software was still the property of America and it maintained the rights. With the·Collins class, if we are going to be sovereign, as was the intention, we must develop that software and those systems ourselves. So it is not just bad form; it is bad policy and bad taste for those opposite to blackguard the personnel involved in the way they did during question time yesterday. The companies and naval personnel involved are undertaking what would normally be done by much larger countries than ours. I am extremely angry on behalf of all those people who· are working so hard to achieve that world first. Look at the shift in focus that the defence industry is now giving Australia in the potentialfor exports or-perhaps I should go further-a lack of imports. In 1983, we had some very good Leopard tanks made in Germany. The tragedy was that we could not make the shells in Australia. We would have had to rely on an overseas supplier to provide us with munitions for those tanks if we went to war. We have had to change that kind of attitude. Yesterday'S question regarding the submarine was appalling. In conclusion, I. think this minehunter decision is a major one. It is of enormous strategic importance both in defence termssuch as protecting our sea lanes-and in the development of Newcastle and New South Wales. I look forward to it being a very successful project and one that will bring credit not just to the companies but to the personnel involved.",19
14,Mr REID,Unknown,"In continuing my remarks on the Australian Defence Industries, I wish to quote from a letter I received from Mr Darren Ripper, who is the convener of shop stewards at ADI Bendigo: Late last year, the Macquarie Bank submitted a report to the Federal Government recommending the. full privatization and sell off of ADI. AD! unions understand that the Macquarie Bank report acknowledged that the Bendigo engineering plant had achieved a considerable improvement oil sales in the last couple of years. The Macquarie Bank report further recognized that in the last 2 years Bendigo plant had achieved a 15% reduction in aggregate labour costs and that the Bendigo plant ""has secured some significant commercial contracts"". The staff of ADI is to be commended on the achievement 'of a 15 per cent reduction in aggregate labour costs with improved productivity. The Macquarie Bank's report simply addressed the economics of the plant rather than the defence aspects of it. The Macquarie Bank is noted for its fine work in the economics area. I do not wish to dispute the content of its report in that respect. However, the question of whether it is appropriate for sensitive defence functions to be placed outside the government's control is one which I believe was not properly addressed. The position I have adopted and held for some time prior to the Gulf War-it was certainly reinforced by the conflict; it strengthened my views-is that it is important that the government of the day control Australia's defence matters and defence related production. I have indicated to the House that Australian Defence Industries has now closed down the Maribyrnong plant on the outskirts of Melbourne and relocated all the heavy engineering to the Australian Defence Industries plant at the city of Bendigo. Its quality of work in heavy engineering and ordnance and armaments manufacture is world class. It has competed in the world scene on a whole range of projects. It is involved with the ANZAC frigate work. It is also involved with the submarine project and sources a number of specialised components to the development and manufacture of the submarines. lts work is of 100 per cent quality. I hope the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, is listening because I want him to refer. this to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray),and impress upon him that it is time the government made a decision on the future of Australian Defence Industries in Bendigo.",20
15,Mr TAYLOR,Unknown,"'-The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) referred to a question in the House yesterday about the new submarine project In defence of the honourable member for Casey the (Mr Halverson), I think it was a very reasonable question, simply because the public has a right to know why projects of that magnitude-we are dealing with over $5 billion of taxpayers' money-will result in a delay in that first boat, the Collins submarine, of up to 11 months. I direct a question to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, and, through him to the Minister for Defence (Senator Ro-rt Ray) about the new submarine project. It comes about as a result of the decision on the minehunters which, as the honourable member for Newcastle said, have gone to AD! and which will be constructed in Newcastle. My question to the minister would be a deeper one in relation to the ongoing technology transfer to Australia and the future viability of the Australian Submarine Corporation. From memory, the Australian Submarine Corporation was looking for follow-on orders by the end of 1995 to make sure that that yard does not degenera-e into just an.o-her repair yard for submarines. The deCISIon, welcome as it might be by the honourable member for Newcastle and ADI, has not solved a problem for the Australian Submarine Corporation. I know most people will say, 'Well, that's competition,' but there - re still some question marks about the Australtan Submarine Corporation, about its corporate structure and, indeed, about its commitment to the ongoing technology transfer to this country. It is a major issue which has not yet been addressed. I suspect in the coming months it may be addressed in one form or another, but I just say to the Assistant Treasurer at the table that the Australian Submarine Corporation which is doing a great job at the moment in the construction of those Collins class boats, really needs something to follow on. A number of questions will have to be answered in detail in relation to the systems interface problems that exist in that first boat, hopefully not flowing through to· the follow-on boats. Nevertheless, the government will have to address the future of ASC further· down the pike, and I suppose it depends on the commercial viability of that corporation.",20
16,Mr REID,Unknown,"In the short time that is left in this place on record the importance of the Australian Survey Regiment to the electorate of Bendigo. The regiment is of major importance to Bendigo's economy as it employs 300 salaried staff who earn approximately $1l.7 million per year, and the flow-on effects create an additional 180 jobs in Bendigo, with a net effect of injecting about $4.5 million into the local economy. During the consideration by the government and the Minister for Defence of the suggested privatisation of the defence survey and mapping work, I wrote to' the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, indicating to him the important role that the Australian Survey Regiment played in Bendigo's economic life. It also plays another very important rqle in that the technology and expertise that a lot of the personnel have developed in the survey regiment is shared amongst a lot of other organisations in Bendigo. Personnel from the Army Survey Regiment playa very important part in community life in Bendigo, contribut- . ing to many organisations and activities. Army personnel have often been granted the freedom of the city of Bendigo, and enjoy a very well respected position in the community of Bendigo. When I wrote to Senator Robert Ray I asked him to examine the opportunity to expand the regiment's activities rather than reduce them, and there is scope for that to occur. I believe mapping functions which occur in other state jurisdictions could well be serviced by the Army Survey Regiment and this would minimise the cost. The regiment does high-class work that is recognised worldwide, and the opportunity to do mapping for other agencies throughout Australia would create an opportunity for high-class mapping to be introduced to a number of state government departments. Also, there would be. the opportunity to train personnel at either the Latrobe University Bendigo campus or the Loddon Campaspe Regional College of TAFE. There are opportunities to develop a high level of technological expertise in .the field of mapping and drafting survey work which the Army Survey Regiment in Bendigo debate, I want to is renowned for; I believe there are opportunities which the government has not responded to as yet. I ask the minister who has come to take his place at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), whether he will also bring this matter to the attention of Senator Robert Ray to advise him of the high level of technology and expertise which exists in the Army Survey Regiment and the opportunities for it to expand its field of interest throughout Australia. It is well truly capable of doing work for state and government instrumentalities throughout Australia. It would add a high level of technology to the mapping procedures that are carried out by the Army Survey Regiment of Bendigo.",21
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)Order! It being 1.30 p.m., the time allotted for the proposed expenditure now before the House has expired. The question is that the proposed expenditure for the Department of Defence be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Department of Primary Industries and Energy Proposed expenditure, $503,498,000. Department of Tourism Proposed expenditure, $102,231,000.",22
18,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"I will begin my contribution in the very short time available to me by making the overall point that the problem for primary industry is not in the level of expenditure in the portfolio. In nominal terms that has been flat for 11 or 12 years. In real terms it has undergone a massive decrease, particularly when compared with, expenditure in other areas-even defence, let alone social security arid so forth. That in itself is not a major problem or concern to farmers. The real issue at stake in this budget is the overall approach to fiscal management. The budget spends too much; it taxes too much; and it. soaks up too much of the Australian community's scant savings. This loose approach to fiscal policy is likely to drive interest rates up. It will certainly maintain them at levels that they need not be .at. As a consequence, the Australian dollar will also be higher than it otherwise would have been 01' the level considered desirable. Those two factors are bad news for the farm sector, which is still responsible for about one-third of Australia's export income and 450,OOO-odd jobs and is the basis of our biggest manufac7 turing sector, food processing. I will refer very briefly to some specifics. and Firstly I will deal with AQIS. I recall with some interest that in August last year, shortly after the last budget, the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), and !he then Minister for Resources, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), issued a jointstatement .headed '1993/94 budget: good news for primary industries', in which they said: ""A reduction in Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) Gosts to industry to assist Australian companies' export efforts by reducing the cost of Canberra office and regional activities ""AQIS charging regime will be kept at current rates and reduce over the next four years. Industry will benefit by more than $10 million from this initiative with the biggest benefits going to the most efficient operators .... "" Attachment C to that release claimed: ""AQIS is already implementing $20 million of staff and administrative reductions as a result of an announcement earlier this year. This is on top of substantial reductions in staff (over 500) during the past three years."" If we look at the statement that 500 staff have gone over three years to August of last year, we find that, if each of those staff averaged $32,000 in reduced costs; that should have resulted in savings of around $16 million in lower costs to industry. But it did not happen. Unfortunately, there is not much evidence that it will happen in the future. The budget papers show that over recent years the total average cost of AQIS was $171 million or $172 million. This year it will be $183 million. That allows some $13 million for redundancies. If we allow for that, since 1989-90 the cost of run-ing AQIS has been quite static at around $170 million. . The question must be asked: where are the savings? Where is the $10 million promised by the minister? Where are the savings.of $16 milli.on fr.om getting rid.of staff f.or wh.om in many instances there is simply n.othing t.o d.o? A great deal m.ore eff.ort needs t.o be put int.o this area; It· is w.orth reminding the HHouse that we have a c.ommitment from the g.overnment that there will be a bipartisan approach t.o a Senate inquiry int.o AQIS t.o review the efficacy and the .ong.oing nature .of the ref.orm process in AQIS. That will be kicked .off early next year. We are waiting, we are watching and we want real numbers .on the b.oard. I wish briefly t.o menti.on a c.ouple .of .other things. I believe that it is c.ounterpr.oductive t.o cut 'excepti.onal circumstances' f.or the hard-pressed wool industry just as the industry is catching the first whiff .of rec.overy; Many farmers, wh.o will n.ow perhaps g.o under, might well have made it and their c.ommunities w.ould have benefited acc.ordingly had the excepti.onal circumstances funding been c.ontinued f.or an.other year. The criteria f.or eligibility were t.o.o narr.ow. That has had an unfair impact and the g.overnment, even at this late' stage, sh.ould urgently review the p.ositi.on. In cl.osing, I wish in br.oad terms t.o menti.on a c.ouple .of things. There is a remaining urgent need in the farming c.ommunity f.or the g.overnment t.o tighten fiscal p.olicy, t.o m.ove t.o free up industrial relati.ons and t.obreak the b.o.om and bust management .of the Australian ec.on.omy.

Bef.ore I m.ove t.o discuss that initiative as it relates t.o my elect.orate, I wish t.o draw the attenti.on .of the HHouse t.o .one important t.ourism initiative c.ontained in the recent W.orking Nati.on statement and in the 1994-95 budget.

S.ome members .opposite might ask what is my interest in rural and regi.onalt.ourism. My interest is reflected by the presence .of thehist.orieal Midland-Guildf.ord area in my elect.orate and as.o the beginning .of the Swan Valley, which is a very imp.ortant. t.ourism .opp.ortunity f.or Western Australia. ""I wish t.o qu.ote from an article. in the West Australian setting .out the views.of Ms Kate Lam.ont, the President .of the Swan Valley T.ourism C.ouncil. The article will give the HHouse, s.ome indicati.on .of the great p.otential .of the Swan Valley as a regi.onal tourism centre. In an article in that newspaper f.orthe weekend 9-10 Oct.ober1993;Ms Lam.ont isrep.orted as f.oll.ows: Her plan rests on tourism, which brought a million visitors to the valley in 1992, and the areas cultural pursuits-viticulture, agriculture, horticulture and plain culture. She is quoted as saying: This region has fantastic potential in agriculture and tourism. The article continues: Ms Lamont sees a viable future for the valley in the --ds of s-all business people-the vignerons, specialist horticulture growers, restaurateurs, and crafts people supplying a refreshing change of pace right on Perth's doorstep. Ms Lamont is reported as saying: ""Our survival as a region and as the lungs of Perth depends on the valley becoming a successful shopfront for visitors as well as remaining a significant agricultural producer. That is the direction we must take to preserve and develop the valley"". I agree entirely with those sentiments. As a consequence, I was very pleased that the minister recently announced that this financial year the Swan Valley Tourism Council would be the recipient of a $40,000 grant under the rural tourism program to further tourism in the Swan Valley. The tourism enhancement project will be administered by the Western Australian Tourism Commission and will give a much needed boost to the Swan Valley Tourism Commission. It will help ensure that the Swan Valley region of Western Australia is a viable and attractive tourist attraction not just for international tourists but also for domestic tourists.",23
20,Mr HAWKER,Unknown,"In the brief time. I have available to me in this consideration of the allocations to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, I want to focus on three points which show how primary producers will be adversely affected. The first and most significant point which is of concern to primary producers is that the budget in to to will not keep interest rates low. In fact, I believe that, when 'the current low inflation rate is taken into account, interest rates are still at historically high levels. Despite the number of reductions that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) brags aboutand there is a concern that interest rates are already too high-there is an expectation that, because the government cannot manage the economy· properly and because there is a concern that inflation might rise again, interest rates could rise again. We have already seen long-term interest rates rising since last September. An increase in interest rates is of grave concern to all primary producers, all business people and all those who have borrowed money. There was a warning of this increase in today's Age. Contrary to the nonsense that is spoken by the artists government, let us consider what one of the leading banks in Australia is predicting. An article on the front page of today's Age reads: Westpac warned that interest rates could jump by three per cent by the end of next year because of the - ederal Government's failure to make greater cuts In the Budget deficit. That is a very frightening prospect, particularly for farmers who have encountered so many difficulties over the last three or four years. I suggest to the government that the thought of interest rates rising again does not represent an orange warning light; it represents a red flashing light. It is of grave concern. If the government wants to see a sustained recovery then it ought to take a long, hard look at some of the decisions it has made in this budget. Let us consider what this means for primary producers. Every increase of one per· cent in interest rates will increase the interest bill of primary producers by over $100 million per year. Clearly, if that Westpac warning becomes reality by the end of next year, primary producers will have to payout over $300 million extra in interest over and above what they would be currently paying. There are also some spin-off effects from that. If the government starts to push up interest rates, that is also likely to have some effect on the value of the Australian dollar. If the Australian dollar is to continue to rise, as some people seem to expect at· the moment, that too will have avery negative impact on the income of primary producers. So there is very real concern that the .whole strategy underpinning this budget will be. extremely negative for people in primary production and people living in rural ar-as. The second point which is of concern to primary producers is the increase in taxes that the government does not want to talk aboutthe increase in fuel excise. Although the Treasurer is trying to tell us he is not increasing taxes, the fact is that the fuel excise will go up by 13 per cent this year, on top of an 18 per cent increase last year. Nothing could have a more negative impact on the cost of doing business and, I would suggest, even on the cost of living in rural and regional' Australia than putting up the cost of fuel because the cost of transport affects everything. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing land transport costs over the final product price in some of the major primary industries. Leave granted. The table read as followsIndustry sector product price percentage Mining Primary products Food processing Chemicals and petroleum Manufacturing Retail",24
21,Mr HAWKER,Unknown,This budget sees the removal of all assistance to wool promotion. This is at a time when wool growers have been through four disastrous years. Most wool growers have not seen the current increase of the last few months because they have not yet been able to shear their sheep. To take away not only the support for wool promotion but also the exceptional circumstances on rural adjustment shows a callous disregard for the real situation that many are facing after four disastrous years. This whole budget process is not in the interests of primary producers. (TIme expired),25
22,Mr NEWELL,Unknown,"Richmond) (1.46 p.m.)This is my first chance to participate in these appropriation debates which have been taking place in the House for some time now. It is with pleasure that I enter the debate on the appropriations for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Department of Tourism. As.a member for a rural electorate, I want to confine my remarks at this stage to the primary industries and energy portfolio. That does not mean that I do not have a great deal of interest in the allocations to tourism: I also represent an area that derives a substantial part of its economy from the tourism industry. Returning"" to the primary industries and energy portfolio allocations, one aspect that I wish to comment on, with my ongoing interest in the economic and social aspects of the environment, is that through the Department of Primary Industries and Energy the government will provide some $1 million in each of the next four years to develop economic and social assessments of regional forests as part of the Commonwealth-state assessments of regional forest agreements. My Land transport (road and electorate does not have great areas under rail) costs over final forest, but there are some, as well as some forest timber industries. The honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) would 42 obviously have a much greater area under 6-12 forest in his electorate; I am delighted to lend 18 my support to the assessments of regional 14 forest agreements as they will cover many 13"" other areas of Australia. I must not be too 7 parochial about it-and will certainly be of interest to people in the southern parts of New South Wales and to the electorate of Cowper, and the states of Tasmania and Western Australia. The agreements are intended to secure access to regional timber resources for industry and to facilitate long-term investment in value adding and regional development. It marries in with the government's overall policy and the thrust of certain policy issues announced in the white paper. It will also provide some secure protection for the high conservation values and assist in the establishment of a comprehensive, adequate and repr,esentative network of forest reserves across Australia. For that reason, it will be of benefit to move towards helping preserve biodiversity across Australia. A further aspect which I am glad the department is backing is the problem caused by nutrient run-off to Australian waterways. Everyone would be well aware of the recent blue-green algae problem that has beset some of our major rivers. I am delighted that we have been able to lend our support to a study which will look at practical options for using economic instruments to reduce nutrients while minimising the cost to farms and households. It is not about taking a stick to any of the agricultural industries. Many of them already recognise the need to marry up the amount of fertiliser input on farms with what is used or needed for plant and crop growth-as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be well aware. To reduce and match up the level of nutrient input on farms minimises not only the. run-off but also the costs if done properly. But as well as reaffirming our commitment to the. decade of landcare through that $102 million, which will be allocated to the nationsation. al landcare program to support ecologically sustainable development in rural communities, one aspect that· does have an impact in my area, obviously, is LEAP-the landcare environment action program. I commend Mr Mark Jackson of Greening Australia Ltd who operates from offices in Lismore. The proabsolutely gram that he runs has seen some 250 people things placed in jobs and undertake landcare and environment programs on the north coast. They are having a significant impact on reafforestation of some of the catchment areas, which fits in with what is essentially state program. The total management of the catchment of rivers started some way back, in 1983-84, by the now retired Jack Hallam, who was the minister for agriculture in the New South Wales government at that time. As I menare tioned, the program fits in with a number other areas and is reaping great benefits. people that are employed there certainly would like to get other jobs and other trainwith ing. (TIme. expired)",25
23,Mr JULL,Unknown,"In terms issues of the allocations for t6urismin this particular budget, 1 draw attention to the fact that· governmeht members have been making reference to the regional tourism grants. regional tourism grants, while they comed, should not necessarily be the prime focus of· the government planning for the future' of the Australian tourist industry;. bring to the' attention of the. government these few minutes that are available to me today some of the very real shortfalls that are happening at the moment in terms of the provision of tourism planning for the rest of this particular decade. There is a very real requirement for that planning. While we pride ourselves on the fact that we have.won the Olympic Games in the year 2000 in Sydney, and that is going to be a tremendous boost to Australia, we should never forget that we are sitting, in the Pacific rim, on the verge of one of the greatest tourist booms the world has ever known. I would like to quote for the government and the government planners the figures that have been released by the World Tourism OrganiThe figures indicate that 140 million Asian people will be travelling offshore for their holidays by the year 2000. The reality is that even if Australia could get 10 per cent of and that business we could not handle it. I really wonder what the government is doing in terms of that planning. It seems amazing to me. When we look at like the partial restoration of the export market development grant whereby tourist operators now can get only 25 per cent of the what they claim overseas as part of the tourism promotional effort-or, indeed, when a we look at the area of landing rights for international carriers or at the development of the common aviation market across the Tasman-it would almost appear that this government is coming to a grinding halt. There are some very real difficulties that we facing. The first one IS the physical of capacity to carry passengers in and out .of The Australia. At a time when the only bilateral negotiations that we have on our books are Germariy-and Germany is an important market'-we see some complete ignorance of that are facing the aviation industry and the tourist industry. Last night in the aviation most debate I made reference to the failure of Australia to reach conclusion with New The Zealand . of the common aviation market are welarrangements across the Tasman. I do not know if people really realise the 'tremendous advantages that .those arrangeI ments are' going to bring to Australia. The in fact is we do have an open aviation market and we have, in principle, an agreement with New Zealand to finalise those arrangements. Australia is on the verge of welshing on that agreement because the whole thing was supposed .to be in place by November this year. The free travel of international visitors across the Tasman is going to be very important for both countries. The traditional saying that people are going to come only to Australia, they want a single destination only, frankly is a load of tripe. is particularly wrong if we think that that is the attitude of the Asian traveIIers; they want multi destinations. We have an opportunity to put into place a south-west Pacific destination to make sure that we maximise our efforts out of Asia and to make sure that we do have comparable product with other competitors in the international tourism game. When Asians go to Europe they do riot go just to London; they do the grand tour. If they go to the United States they are more than likely to take in places such as Mexico and Canada as well. The reality is that, while we have got lots to offer in Australia, we have an infinitely better product if we can offer them the South Pacific, too. But, no, it would almost seem as though the government is welshing on the deal at the moment to conclude that free aviation deal between Australia and New Zealand. I urge the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) to make sure he goes and belts a few heads within the aviation department to make that happen - will One of the things that has evolved in recent years has been a greater profile for tourism in the determination of Australian air rights, but it would almost seem that we are going to that old situation where the airlines are once again becoming masters of tourism rather than the servants of tourism-that has got to stop. The other matter I 'would like to flag is the requirement of the government to start looking at what is going to happen in terms of the provision of accommodation in Australia. Already in places such as Cairns and, to an extent, the Gold Coast, we are seeing sh6rtages of top-Iine accommodation. Around the Asia-Pacific region at the moment there are something like 400 major hotels under COI1struction. How many have we got in Australia? Three! That is because the taxation system is crazy. It is also because we had troubles in the 1980s in terms of the boom, and troubles in terms of the yield that was gained by the hotels. But the reality is that if we are going to take this boom up and service the people in the Olympic Games period, some action has got to be taken now. One thing that we would want to see coming out of the Department of It Tourism is the planning of very real means to get investment going again. (TIme expired)",26
24,Mr NEWELL,Unknown,"Richmond) (1.56 p.m.)There have been some comments made about the rural adjustment scheme in this consideration of the appropriations of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I point out to honourable members present in the House that the rural adjustment scheme is continuing. It is a fact that the hardship provisions have been removed from the scheme, but that does not mean to say that farmers and those who have genuine needs are not in a position to be able to go on and receive assistance from the rural adjustment scheme. With the way some comments have been expressed, one would think that the whole business was being withdrawn. In fact, it is only a small section that is no longer determined necessary. The fact that it has been withdrawn does not mean the sky is going to cave in. I want to address the rural communities access program. Funding from that program bring direct support for counselling to rural Australians experiencing - financial hardship, as weII as education and training assistance for community projects and disadvantaged groups across Australia. OveraII, the funding will assist the establishment of some 400 new business enterprises and will create some 800 fuII or part-time jobs. Funding will also support the development of 50 selfsufficient telecentres. Some of these telecentres are already up and running, including the Byron Telecentre at 33 Fletcher Street, Byron Bay. I give that address in case honourable members wish to drop in there on their holidays to look at it I opened that centre some 12 or 18 months ago . - It provides a service to the community in fermsofbothlise and learning. In terms of uSe, people who are familiar with computers but who do not have the benefit of having one at home can use the computers and the services provided in the telecentre to write out job applications, letters and so forth, and access such facilities as E-mail. It is a tremento dous advantage for people in a rural community to be able to access information via Email, particularly when people can link into universities and libraries to get information. It almost brings the University of the Southern Cross into everyone's home. The telecentre can be used in computer-aided design as well as simply in learning. The telecentre has been a big success. In other areas or regions across Australia that are fortunate enough to have a telecentre established, I would suggest that people get down there very quickly to have a look at how they operate and see the sorts of services, benefits and facilities that such centres can bring to an area. Lastly, some comments about the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service have been made this afternoon. I have two small abattoirs in my electorate, and I am obviously very concerned about the impact of AQIS charges and some of the changes that are occurring. Like honourable members opposite and those on this side, I have taken a very keen interest in the changes that have been foreshadowed and those that have occurred under the guidance of various ministers responsible for primary industry. I am delighted that some $15 million has been put into assist the Quarantine and Inspection Service to fund the cost of redundancies, to continue restructuring the service and to assist the transition to the new AQIS meat charging arrangements that were foreshadowed.",27

26,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"It has been very difficult to make contributions this \budget debate because of the way in which the debate has been programmed, particularly in regard to the limitations on time. We are now faced with five minutes in which to deal with the inordinate number of changes that have been made in relation to social security, and welfare arrangements in particular. I want to. pick up on three issues: first; the extent to which the government has been bereft of policies itself and has had to essentially filch from the opposition most of the substantial changes that it has made over time; secondly, the ad hoc nature of the decisions that the government makes; and, thirdly, the unrealistic expectations that it sometimes creates in people's minds and is essentially unable to realise. I will deal with the stolen policies. The first and most significant one was to raise the pension age for women from 60 to 65. The government said when it adopted that policy that it was doing so because the way in which women are remunerated in the work force had been essentially addressed and we now had genuine equal pay. Is it not interesting that statistics released today demonstrate that the situation of women is. deteriorating significantly in comparis-m with men? But there are other matters: the review of the income and assets test for pensioners; the enhanced compliance testing and review activity for jobseatch-a matter that is still progressing; the increasing of pharmaceutical benefits for the over 65s-the government's seniors card essentially adopted that initiative; the increase in the level of the dependent spouse rebate that we promised, which was really implemented through the HCCA. arrangements; the increases in family allowances for those on lower incomes, which we promised; the easing of the jobsearch rules for the over 50s, which the government implemented through the mature age allowance,: < and the increases in chi1d-care rebate. Even in this document, the extent to which the government tightened up on eligibility for benefits in the hands of new arrivals was a matter first flagged by the opposition and later picked up by the government. But I find one issue particularly of interest, and I want to comment on it in terms of the ad hoc nature of the decisions that the government is making. I want to posit this question in people's minds: why are these decisions being made by announcement when we had a budget only three weeks ago? One issue I wish to raise is that of the new widows allowance. If it involves any extra cost then, of course, one would expect it to have been dealt with in the budget, but it was not. So one assumes that the government has been able to announce it because it' involves no extra cost. If it is only a cosmetic change then I do not think the government should be maintaining great credit for itself for that. If the government is trying to put those who are going to receive the widows allowance in the same position as those receiving the widows B pension, one wonders why they were not put back on a widows B pension. I suspect the reason is that there were no additional benefits to be obtained by the people involved. I also refer to the extent to· which the government made the change in relation to returned service people and their conditions of service. It would not go the whole way and admit that it was wrong, so it fiddled with income testing.' The most disappointing issue of all is that of this government's unrealised expectations. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) went overseas to flag that he was going to save some $500 million for Australians through negotiating a new deal with the New Zealanders. When we look at this budget, we see that he came back with a real fizzer. We now have an indication that the government is going to save something in the order of only $2 million in 1994-95-the first year of operation of the new changes-rising to $53 million in 1997-98. The Prime Minister went to New Zealand, chased by his Minister for Social Security(Mr Baldwin). The briefings that were given to. the press. before they held out that $500 million was able to be recouped. I have never seen such a fizzer by any government at any time. The government, the parliamentary secretary and the minister should hold their heads in shame.",28
27,Ms DEAHM,Unknown,"I will address my remarks in this debate to the portfolio of veterans, affairs. I will leave my colleagues to answer the issues that have just been raised. It is timely to reflect on what we do for our veterans, and I think the House will agree that this week has drawn great attention to our war veterans. Those people, both men and women, who served in wars, from colonial times up to recent times, deserve all the support we can give them. Therefore, I am very pleased to support the measures contained in this year's budget. This budget contains an excellent veterans affairs package. Two of the highlights in this year's budget are the repeal of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act and the bringing of merchant mariners who served during wartime under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. That is something about which many honourable members have had representations for some time; I certainly have. I was delighted that the lobbying from all of us resulted in that change. We are recognising those people who died or were wounded when serving in that field. The expanded health progratns for our the veterans, particularly for those who are now elderly, are also extremely important. The widows and widowers of veterans will now receive their pensions and disability allowances from the Department of Veterans' Affairs rather than from the Department of Social Security, and that is something that a lot of veterans· were pleased about. Likewise, the widows and widowers of service people will now be paid their pensions at the single rate by the Department of Veterans' Affairs instead of half the married rate. That is also an advance. The issue that interests me the most is the new support for Vietnam veterans. The Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service has been greatly expanded.· The 1989 report of the left Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which highlighted this area, has been signifiBlue cant, and that support is ongoing. There is allocation of $20.6 million over four years deal with post-traumatic stress disordersomething which has been identified in a great number of Vietnam veterans. In the past we have been only too wiIling to look at the physical injuries of veterans, not the emotiofriend nal injuries. In the First World War we called people cowards if they ran away; when really they were suffering from stress just as much as more modem veterans are. I had the privilege of seeing a program post-traumatic stress disorder at St John of God Hospital at Richmond in my electorate. When I spoke to some of the veterans after the first week of a two-week program, they were full of praise for the progress they had made. I have strongly supported-and drove the last Minister for Veterans' Affairs nearly mad with my support-the continuation of that program. It was looking a bit dicey for a while, but I think it is now back on - he road. The program for post-traumatic stress disorder resulted from what is now known as the Sainsbury report which was a study into the psychological needs of Vietnam veterans. I am glad that those programs will now be strongly supported. I had the privilege a couple of Saturdays ago of attending, at Lawson in my electorate, the unveiling of a plaque for Vietnam veterans. The unveiling was done by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), who is himself a Vietnam veteran. It was a most enjoyable bipartisan day. The plaque was to commemorate Vietnam veterans but, in particular, two veterans from Lawson who died during that war: Private Ron Field and Corporal Robert BowteIl. Both young men had lived in Lawson, in that mountain community, all their lives .. They went to and suffered the ultimate penalty. I also had the privilege of having lunch with Mrs Diane Field, the widow of Ron Field. She told me-and it really struck a chord-that she was married at 17 and widowed at 18, a tragedy that I hope is not repeated. But Diane Field, being part of the earlier problem, is now part of the solution: she is part of a group which is· offering a Vietnam veterans counselling service in the Mountains which started. only a few an weeks ago. It is part of the program which to has been part of this budget. So I am very pleased to endorse the Veterans' Affairs budget for 1994-95.  privilege in this debate today to follow my the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm). On Monday of last week, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) asked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a simple question: why, despite the Labor Party's for rhetoric, are the poor in Australia getting poorer and the rich getting richer? The Australian Bureau of Statistics published results last week showing that, since 1983, the richest 10 per cent of Australia's population have seen their incomes rise by seven per cent, whereas the bottom 10 per cent have seen their incomes fall by five per cent. We know that Australia needs significant structural reform, we know what this reform and readjustment will cause, we know that social patterns are changing, and we know also that our population is ageing. For all these reasons, we need an effective and strong social security system. No thoughtful person can reasonably accept that the free market, fundamentalist approach to employment and social welfare can work in a contemporary society. We need a social security system that takes account of what is happening in Australia. This does not just mean that we should accept the status quo; it means the opposite. If we are to meet the challenges that will arise as our economy and society changes, we need a social security system that is effective, efficient, well targeted and flexible. In their budget responses, ACOSS and the war Council for the Ageing both spoke of the failure of the government to meet the needs of our rapidly ageing popula.tion. I cannot think of a more fundamental welfare issue that the government needs to tackle. I will not reach retirement age for almost an-ther 40 years, but that does not mean that my generation will be able to solve the problems that this period will raise for the future. Australia urgently needs a more imaginative and better quality contribution to the debate on Juture directions for social security than this budget provides. . Quite recently, many newspapers reported on the growing welfare dependency in Australian society. It is genuinely alarming to see how some groups, like the long-term unemployed, are trapped by the welfare system. At the same time, we should realise that an ageing population and work force will result in increases in the number of people on age pensions and needing disability pensions. We should stop the growth of welfare myths. I discovered that figures showed that only four per cent of sole parent pensioners are aged under 20. We should stop the talkback staple of girls getting pregnant in order to get the pension. We need to look at the fundamentals of the social welfare system. We need a welfare system which cares for the genuinely needy and disadvantaged; we need to ensure that the increasing numbers of aged and retired people are adequately provided for within budgetary restraints; and we need to eliminate poverty traps and prevent the emergence of an underclass. One of our key welfare aims must be to support the family. We need effective family support payments and benefits that will tackle the effect on families of the changes that have occurred over the past 20 years in how we work and live. We know. the problems of crime, poor healtfi- homelessness and drug and alcohol abuse that family breakdown can cause. We should also recognise the basic values of trust, respect, tolerance, reliability, honesty, mutual respect and a genuine feeling for the needs of others that we can learn from families and make sure that we do everything we can to support them. We. need state welfare but we must make sure that it does not c9mmodify assistance, that it does notgenerate an imperspnal mass society that fails to meet any needs other than basic material demands. The best social.assistance is assistance th-t c'ln be provided on a rome. human scale, that can take account of individual circumstances. . . . .. . 'We are already seeing some genuine trends towards private ' involvement in :oUl1 social security system. These are' to be (welcomed, but we must make sure that demands on welfare agencies are reflected in government spending. Egalitarianism is still an important concept to Australians. We must work to keep it that way. Rather than trumpeting. recoveries that only benefit a wealthy few, we can make the structural changes needed to produce a society where everyone has more. We can make sure that we have a social security system that can support the needy and, wherever possible, help them reintegrate into the mainstream of economic life. But to do so we need much more than is contained in this budget.",29
28,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I am pleased to support the outlays and the way in which this government has produced a well-targeted welfare system in Australia over the past 11 years. To quote some of the figures and outcomes since 1983: payments for low income families with children under 13 have increased in real terms by 74 per cent and by 147 per cent for teenagers; payments to sole parents with between one and four children have increased by 22 per cent in real terms; the basic pension rate has increased in real terms by 14 per cent; and rent assistance has increased by between 81 and 141 per cent depending on the target group. A study in 1991 showed how well targeted the Australian social security system is compared with other OECD nations. There was an analysis of how effectively .each welfare dollar is delivered in 10 OECD nations. Australia came out on top with a coefficient of 41.3 pel' cent, followed by the USA with 33.5 per cent, Canada with 30.1 per centand the list goes on until we reach the most poorly targeted nation, Sweden, with a coefficient of 17.3 per cent. This government has achieyed a huge aJ,11ount in guaranteeing the Australian public a weIJ-targeted, effective1 means tested soci!!1 security system. Thegovemmenthas been very interested in recent :times to work out what the opposition policy will be post-Fightback . .The only proposal has come from the opposition's . newest member, the honourable member for Warringah(MrAbbott), who' in his first speech set out a new· family.· payment and child endowment scheme which was repeated in an article in the Australian . last Friday. I was caught by surprise,) must confess, by the sheer dimension of his social security plan. I fully expected in his first speech all the cringing, crawling attitudes ab()ut the constitutional monarchy, totally out of step with the values and views of our generation. I also expected some fiscal responsibility in such an important speech.· We have all heard from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the shadow Treasurer, (he honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), about how the outlays in this budget and the budget deficit, reflecting their fetish with deficits, should have been substantially lower. But the honourable member for Warringah-his proposal is the only proposal that the Liberal Party has put forward on social security-has produced the most expensive, unfunded first speech in the history of the parliament. The article states: The budgetary cost of introducing a family wage of $100 a week for the first child and $30 a week for every further child would be about $7.5 billion a year-$14 billion to pay the family wage less the $6.5 billion cost of the existing family allowance It is extraordinary· that the Liberal Party's only social security proposal post-Fightback is an unfunded, untargeted, non-means tested allocation of $7.5 billion. This is absolutely extraordinary. Where is the equity in this? The article points out the benefits for various family groups. For a family on an annual income of $15,000 and with three children, the scheme would produce an increase of $1,841. For a. family on $40,000 a year and with three children, the increase would be much closer to $7,000. There is no concept of social equity in the social security proposals of the Liberal Party in the 1990s-the greater the income the greater the benefit. In the article the honourable member for Warringah goes on to point out that the Liberal Party should not proceed with income splitting as proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). The article states: The problem with income splitting, at least in its most simple form between husband and wife, is that it helps high-income earners more than lowincome earners. That is exactly what the honourable member for Warringah would do in his scheme. Overwhelmingly, higher benefits go to higher income earners and lower benefits go to lower income earners. There is no equity and no consistency in the Liberal Party's welfare proposals post-Fightback. The Liberal Party knows little about finesse and subtlety in policy making; it always goes in with the sledgehammer. The 15 per cent GST sledgehammer was knocked out at the last election, so the next sledgehammer is an unfunded commitment to welfare of $7.5 billion. I am sure this proposal will be supported by the honourable member for Warringah's colleague the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who nods in agreement. This is an untargeted and non-means tested sledgehammer in the welfare area. The Liberal Party has no interest in equity, proper values and compassion. This is simply hopeless, untargeted policy formulation in the social security area. Mr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member's time has expired and he needs glasses as well because he certainly did not see me nodding. (TIme expired)",31
29,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"It is a tragedy that we have only five minutes to refer to the social security estimates, which is the biggest item in the budget The amount being spent is almost equivalent to the amount of personal income tax receipts, yet we are allowed a short time to debate the many complex issues involved. Over recent times the number of Australians dependent upon social security has increased enormously. Around 9 1/2 million Australians benefit in some way from our national welfare system. The fact that only 7.75 million Australians are in fullor part-time work demonstrates the enormity of our social security budget. It costs the equivalent of more than a whole new Parliament House every year just to administer the social security department before we get around to writing out the first cheque. The growth in social security has also been enormous. The number of people getting unemployment benefits has increased from 13,212 in 1970 to 911,300 in 1993. The number of people getting sickness benefits has increased fivefold, the number getting invalid pensions has increased fourfold, the number getting special benefits has increased sixfold, the number of age pensioners has doubled and the number of. people getting supporting parents benefits increased tenfold. There has been enormous growth in the number of Australians receiving social security benefits. Frankly, such a system is obviously unsustainable in the long term. Our population is ageing, the number of people who are eligible for benefits continues to increase and the drain on the fiscal resources of the nation is stretched further and further. One of startling aspects of budgets over recent times has been the massive decline in the amount of funding provided for capital works. Whereas in the past capital works funding was the biggest item in the budget and sodal security one of the lesser items, now social security is the spender and there is little in the budget at for capital works programs. We prefer to pay unemployment benefits than to have people working in productive jobs. That seems to me to be a very strange list of priorities. There are a score of minor matters that are of importance to individuals that I would like to have raised in consideration of the social security estimates. Time allows me the opportunity to raise only one-the bank accounts that pensioners and welfare recipients are required to have to receive their social security cheques. I think it is wise that social security benefits are paid into bank accounts but obviously a difficulty arises now that banks are increasing their charges, particularly on accounts with very small balances. I am sure all members have received complAints from constituents about bank charges on the accounts that pensioners must have to receive their social security benefits. In November 1991, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration reported on its inquiry into the banking industry and at that time recommended that the retail banks and the Department of Social Security jointly investigate the feasibility of developing a basic banking product to be offered by the retail banks. It was recommended that such a product should allow for a set number of free withdrawals each week and should be targeted to the needs of low income Australians. This kind of a banking product would have. been very helpful to pensioners. That was the intention of the banking inquiry when it was recommended. Sadly, the government has done nothing about this recommendation. It has put in place a proposed code of banking practice, but that really fails to address this particular issue. I think there needs to be some imaginative and creative thinking about the ways in which banks can provide these sorts of accounts as a service for their customers even though they have only small balances. One possible way of achieving this objective would be for the government to perhaps pay the pension cheques into those accounts a day early so that the banks get revenue a day before the big pensioners are able to access the benefits in all their particular account. That would enable the banks to be able to fund any costs associated with keeping these accounts. There may well be other ways. We cannot really expect the banks to provide a service for no cost and I think the government ought to recognise the obligation it places upon every social security recipient to fund a bank account in order to receive their benefits and to find a way that this can be done at little or no cost to welfare recipients.",32
30,Mr LES SCOTT,Unknown,"As with the earlier consideration in detail debate on the defence budget, which I spoke in, this current consideration of the veterans affairs aspect of the 1994-95 budget is timely given the commemoration of the part played by veterans in many countries in the D-day landings. It is because of their sacrifice and dedication that we now enjoy the lifestyles we do today, Accordingly, it gives me great pleasure to be able to support the 1994-95 budget allocations for Veterans' Affairs here today. The initiatives contained in the budget have been developed to address the most pressing needs of ex-service men and women, war widows and widowers and their dependents. The package responds to a range of issues raised by the Baume committee and other groups with respect to problems ·of older veterans of the world wars and the specific problems of younger veterans of more recent conflicts. I a- particularly pleased about the new program designed to· provide assistance specifically to Vietnam veterans. The $20.6 million four-year package dire-t­ ed to serious problems faced by Vietnam veterans is a welcome initiative. The cornerstone of this package is the assistance it will provide for the sufferers of post traumatic stress disorder. Anyone who has had dealings with sufferers of this condition knows how demoralising it is and can be for both the sufferers and their families. Veterans, families and carers will benefit from the package which includes funding for PTSD treatment centres, more resources for the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service as well as money for research into the specific health problems and needs of younger veterans. This package will no doubt bring about an improvement in the quality of life of younger veterans by stressing better health and employment opportunities and improving access to treatment, counselling, rehabilitation and support services. Another significant research project that will be funded by the initiatives in the budget is the Vietnam veterans mortality study, which it is hoped will be able to establish the major causes of early death and nature of the links between PTSD and veterans' death rates. There are other major issues in the budget. There is the establishment of a national centre for war related PTSD to develop best practice standards for the management of social, psychological and medical problems associated with PTSD. They are all very important aspects of this legislation. There is also improved coordination of in-patient, outpatient and support services so the veterans with PTSD can be assessed, treated and rehabilitated. The expansion of the Department of Veterans' Affairs joint committee's scheme to encourage self-help projects by the ex-service community to address social and personal problems experienced by young veterans and their families is also welcome. Finally, as the world reflects on the turning point of World War II that was D-day and looks forward to the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, it is proper that we consider the budget's allocation of funds for the Australian War Memorial. This most sacred of places will receive an additional $8 million over four years for maintenance and restoration work. Another $2.5 million will be provided for the development of its Pacific War Gallery and also focusing on the local conflict. There will be $1.5 million provided for a joint Kokoda memorial project to be construCted by the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments. This will symbolise the importance of the New (Juinea campaign and acknowledge the links that were· forged between Australia and Papua New Guinea. I am particularly pleased in the short time available today to have the opportunity to respond to and support the allocations for both the social security and the veterans affairs areas before us today.",33
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Snow)The time allotted for the proposed expendi.;. tures now before the House has expired; The question is that the proposed expenditures be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Department of Housing and Regional Development Proposed expenditure, $74,396,000. Department of Human Services and Health Proposed expe!lditure, $2,386,188,000.",34
32,Mrs BISHOP,Unknown,"Mackellar) (2.31 p.m.)This form of estimates is a new experience in that the opportunity to ask ministers questions and to get answers on expenditure does not occur in this chamber as it does in the other place. Nonetheless, as the guillotine has been applied and as there is only a··short time available, there are .a few salient points that I would like to put on the record. First of all, I read again with interest the tabling speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) for theappropriation bills. I read with interest the part relat:ing to health, which states: In aggregate this Budget allocates almost one billion dollars over four years for new and expandAustralians ed health programs-without increasing the Medicare levy. One could be forgiven for thinking that that is nothing but a description of a magicpudding solution. The fact is that the amount of money available for health care continues to shrink. As the figures that I have placed on the record during the last week show, the private health insurance sector provides more money for health care in Australia than does the Medicare levy. So that we are familiar with those figures, the figure from the private health insurance sector is $3.6 billion, while the Medicare levy provides only $2.4 billion. Yet the figures' published iiI the 'last year show that 500,000 Australians have opted out of private health insurance. When any Australian opts out of private health insurance, not only does that person lose the freedom of choice but also there is less money in the pool for everybody to share. To put it another way, in statistical terms, for every one per cent of people who drop out of private health insurance, $100 million per year is added to the public health bill. Quite clearly, the reason that people drop out of private health insurance is the government's ideologically driven health policy. If ever there was an area of policy determined by the philosophy that the party in government follows it is the area"" of health. It is the determined policy of this government to force people out of private health care and to see them dependent on the state-and, boy, has it succeeded! The problem is that what we get when the pool is smaller and there is not enough money for everyone to have access to the system when needed is a rationing of the service, and that translates into hospital queues. Again and again we see reports and we hear complaints about the length of the queues of people wanting to get into hospital for elective surgery. The problem is that some of them never make it. The government boasts in the budget, 'Without ever increasing the Medicare levy, we will provide almost $1 billion more over four years for new and expanded health programs.' The bottom line is that ordinary will get less and less access to the health care system when they need it. Statistically, all of us will use the health care system most in the last year of our life. But, personally, I am not prepared to pick which will be the last year of my life, and nor is anybody else. Accordingly, we want access to that system when we need it. The only way we will get it is to have policies of the carrot variety and not of the stick, to encourage people into private health insurance and not force them .out. For that reason, the deliberate government policy of preventing any form of gap insurance is opposed by us. It is our policy direction to have gap insurance and to look at relief for premiums paid. I say very firmly that bulk-billing stays.",34
33,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,Humph!,35
34,Mrs BISHOP,Unknown,"Just in case the honourable member for Calwell misconstrues what I just said, that means universal bulk-billing. The bottom line is that, if we are to have a system which is equitable and just, we should not penalise those people who take responsibility for their health the way. the current system does. Our policies mean that WI:< will get such a system. (1Imeexpired)",35
35,Mr JENKINS,Unknown,"Of the two departments before us today in this debate, I wish to concentrate on the Department of Housing and Regional Development and, in particular, on regional development. I listened to the contribution of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop). We look forward to the opposition coming forward with a distinct health policy that can be part of a continuing debate. In Working Nation, the white paper on employment, there is a chapter on regional development which has perhaps gone a little unheralded in the discussions that have occurred since the paper was brought down. It is important that we look at the way that the Australian economy is developing. We should not be confused that there are overall solutions to every region's problems. As the budget documents indicate, it is correct that the Commonwealth cannot mandate solutions in a uniform way. We really need to look for effort from local communities which shows that they are able to adjust to the problems that they confront and maximise the opportunities that are presented. One of the real difficulties in any debate about regional development is the definitiorial problem of what is a region. Nowhere better can this confusion be seen than in the larger cities of Australia, where, because there are no distincfgeographical relations and some of the economic and employment relations are a little obscure, it is more difficult to define those regions. We need to look at this. I am a little envious of regions that are clearly identified. An example was the recipient of some money through the budget is the Goulburn Valley. Members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts visited Shepparton earlier this year to have discussions with not only the local water board but other regional bodies, such as the regional development board. One very interesting thing that is of great advantage to the Goulburn Valley is that the geography, such as the watersheds of the river systems, the economic relations of the region and, to a certain extent, local government boundaries provide a distinct region that matches up on all those levels. The region has taken advantage of this fact and its residents have been able to get together and develop a distinct plan of action for what they will do. I am sorry that the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) is not in the chamber. I did have a line about his being, most distinctam ly as a Victorian National, a true agrarian socialist. I will never forget this inspection. We were on the bus in the last five minutes of our visit to Shepparton. The man from the regional development board had our ear. There was no escaping him; we wanted to get to the airport. He said that one need of the region was the provision of infrastructure. A lot of businesses that have been starting to develop on the outskirts of the townships there have difficulties because of the lack of proper telecommunications and electricity infrastructure. It was one of those occasions when good rural dwellers could at least come to government, suggest that they had problems and say that they felt the federal governBadcock ment might be able to assist by putting its hands in the bickie bin and producing some dollars. In all seriousness, I am pleased that Goulbum Valley has a regional plan for a major environmental problem in that area. The federal government saw fit to put money towards alleviating the great salinity problem. It is important that that region, which is a major food producer, has the proper environment. Relating that to the remarks about regions throughout Australia, such as the region that I represent,there is a need to look of a region that at infrastructure. The Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, in its inquiry into the urban areas of Australia, said that there was an urgent need for an audit of infrastructure so that we had a clear idea of what were the deficiencies and who should be looking at them. I believe the Commonwealth government has a continuing role to play in the provision of all forms of infrastructure, whether it be in directly supplying that infrastructure or in putting into place mechanisms that can assist and motivate private provision of infrastructure. At the end of the day, for the sake of the Australian economy, the Commonwealth government needs to make sure that it is leading the debate in this area. (TIme expired)",35
36,Mr CLEARY,Unknown,"After the miserable offering of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), I wished I was here to talk about health, but in fact I here to talk about the health of regions instead. In his 1972 policy speech, Gough Whitlam argued that a person's standard of living, job prospects and opportunity for selfimprovement were determined by where he or she lived. He said: This is why Labor believes that the Australian government must involve itself directly in cities. As is pointed out in Loves Labot lost: Whit/am and urban regional development, this interest in regional, economic and social disparity did not last long. It would be fair to say that it was totally eschewed by the Hawke government until partially revived in the better cities program. In the Urban Policy and Research Magazine, volume 2, 1993, Blair argues that the better cities program had more to do with political opportunism than social justice, spatial equity and the like. paper. Chapter 7 of Working Nation is the latest offering on regional development. It is a disappointment. After speaking with Bill Kelty during and after his visit to the northern region of Melbourne, I was under the impression that regional economic development meant serious government participation. Unfortunately, the paper is dominated by the flavour of entrepreneurialism. The report is an insult to people in depressed regions. Page 164 begins with anassessmerit of the role of leadership in the regions of Australia. The minister in his press release on 4 May said: Regions like Cairns and Broome-which are experiencing impressive growth-have developed strong models of regional leadership and are pursuing a strategic vision. The story of their success can be shared with other regions. To imply that the north-west of Melbourne, for example, is in economic crisis because it lacks. regional leadership or vision ignores the fact that global .trade and our inability to control the practices of transnational companies have devastated regional communities. One cannot help noticing also that every case. study identified in Working Nation is from a rural region. This reveals two things. The honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) has referred to this question. Firstly, it is conceptually less difficult to identify solutions for more homogenous rural regions than it is for diverse urban regions; Secondly, it is these urban regions which have been less able to survive in the restructured economy. Rather than acknowledge that global trade has had profound effects on manufacturing in local communities, the paper appears to blame these communities for their problems. This is why the parliament rings with calls for international competitiveness and more flexible labour markets. Although the white paper provides some linking of training with actual job demand, none of these revamped training schemes can answer the needs of depressed regions-the declining regions where there are no jobs. How can training schemes be matched with non-existent demands for labour? A mass of partly skilled part-time workers is not the dynamic social democracy promised by the The funding proposals are totally inadequate. The allocation of $70 million of seeding funds over four years is a pathetic response to the mass unemployment that exists in some depressed regions. It amounts to $3 million less than what will be spent on the development of Badgerys Creek airport. In parts of my electorate, unemployment is as high as 20 per cent. In parts of Batman, the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe), the rate is about the same. The same can be said about the electorates of Melbourne and Calwell. These regions need a lot more than what is· offered in the white paper. Here we are at a time when private investment is pitifully low, despite the fact that profits are at a record high, and when income is increasingly being shifted from the bottom to the top segments of our society, and the government tells us that we must run around our electorates spruikingfor funds. The coalition, for its part, continues with the approach that has seen it lose three consecutive elections. The honourable member for Mackellar tells us that the government is spending too much money, despite the fact that member after member in this House has stood to praise the concept of regional development. Members of the National Party, our agrarian socialists, are always happy to see some government money channelled into their electorates, but their acquiescence enables the government to get away with spending a pitiful amount. The Kelty report at least acknowledges that growth has to be created within the regions. The means adopted, however, are a problem. In the electorate of Wills we have talked about shop-top developments, cultural tourism, the importance of the Upfield railway line, the need for more public housing and the efficacy of drawing on the knowledge that comes from having a very diverse population. J'hese issues need to be taken up and funded.",36
37,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"CalwelIParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (2.46 p.m.)I also wish to support the budget measures for the Department of Human Services and Health. The programs resulting from those measures, especially those involving social justice policy and those assisting the most disadvantaged and the most vulnerable in our community, have been maintained and increased. I think that is an excellent result, light of the fact that we are coming out of a recession and that we have had our economic difficulties. Nevertheless, the government has been able to maintain its commitment to social justice in a very direct way. With respect to health policy, it is important that we have sustained our committhey ment to Medicare. We are looking at ways and means of reforming the private health insurance system. I was interested in the comments made earlier by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop). She answers. came into this House and made a very pitiful contribution to the debate by bringing in usual ideological claptrap from the New Right. She talked about our health policy being totally ideologically driven. What nonsense! The fact of the matter is that the Australian Medicare. system has been overthat whelmingly endorsed over and over again the Australian people. It is about time the conservative parties in this country did what other conservative parties in other Western countries have done: accept the fact that need a reasonable universal health system. It is about time the conservative parties accepted that. Towards the end of her contribution, honourable member for Mackellar made the point that those opposite are finally coming around to accepting universal bulk-bi\ling. This is after four elections. Medicare has here for 10 or 11 years, and those opposite are finally coming around to accepting universal bulk-billing, which is one of the planks Medicare. We welcome that. The honourable member for Mackellar went on to talk about the very difficult problem private health insurance. We had a joint caucus-ACTU working group that looked at this problem in very comprehensive terms. looked at the facts and figures. I can tell honourable members that the analysis given by the honourable member for Mackellar does not even begin to come to grips with the issues. For example, the honOl-rable member tried to say that there was some interconnection between hospital queues and the current lack of a gap payment with private health insurin ance. That is the most simple-minded thing she could possibly say. Of course there are problems, but they do not relate to the gap. If we simply put in insurance for the gap, we would allow the total private health bi\l to grow without the services growing. The very doctors would be able to charge whatever liked in private hospitals. The key issue is: how do we contain the costs of private health through some reasonable insurance system? The contribution of the honourable member for Mackellar simply gave us no Opposition members seem to think that the her only thing to do is come in with gap insurance. If they do that they wi\l simply be giving a big prize to the doctors-and especially the specialists, some of whom earn more than $1 million a year. They are saying those doctors can continue to charge as by much as they like. If opposition members think that costs in the private system do not relate to the costs in the public system, they are wrong. If the costs in the private system we go up pressure is put on the public system. So the honourable member for Mackellar has got the argument completely the wrong way around. If we want to do something the about - private health insurance we should study the proposals being put forward by a number of academics, the joint caucus-ACro working group and other people and work out been a solution that involves some capping of the fees that doctors receive in private hospitals. Unless opposition members do something of on this question, they wi\l not have taken the issue seriously. Until we hear the opposition's ideas in relation to this matter, instead of this of ideological nonsense, we, will not have a proper health debate in this country.",37
38,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"In this the Year of the Family it is timely to speak of a budget initiative which has a direct effect on the entire family. I refer to breast cancer. Breast cancer is a condition that kills six Australian women every day. If an Australian woman were unfortunate enough '. to contract the condition, she would' have a 40 per cent of not fulfilling her life because the mortality rate has not changed for almost 50 years. There is a growing community awareness of the urgent need for research funding into breast cancer. Over the last 10 years, approximately 80 speeches have been made on the issue in parliament. Recently some 100,000 Australians signed petitions and presented them to the parliament seeking that the government· invest more money in breast cancer research. Last October, on behalf of representations made to me by some of the women in Cowan, I introduced a motion to the parliament seeking an increase in breast cancer funding. This followed my earlier speech in August which identified problems with the original ongoing national mammography program. The motion, I recall, was supported by government members. It was pleasing to see the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) take up the issue when she entered parliament. She has had an ongoing interest in this particular area, being a member of the Hancock Family Breast Cancer Research Foundation. There was goodwill on both sides of the House in trying to get a. fair increase in funding for this vital hea.lth issue. The experts House. in this field must have been encouraged by the lifting of the public debate. We all came to realise how close this condition can be' to all of us when our well-respected colleague Senator Jocelyn Newman announced recently she was suffering with breast cancer and required surgery. The issue of breast c.ancer will not go away whilst it continues to ki11 six Australian women every day. We in this place should not rest in seeking solutions for the funding shortfall that currently besets breast cancer research. We should always remember the importance of vital women's health issues to the community because women are the core offamilies which in tum are the very basis of our community. With all this demand for increased funding from the community, medical scientists and politicians, let us now look at the response to these demands by the government. The good news is that the budget did address this very important issue. The minister has to be commended for this. But-and I must say it is a very big but-it seems the grandiose claims of the major new proposals for breast cancer are nothing but cruel hoaxes. A close analysis of the budget reveals that the $237 million committed to national breast cancer screening over five years is simply money to continue a current program. Many members in this place do not seem to reafise that if a woman is screened she requires screening again in two years time. So the money really is only contributing to the ongoing machinations of this particular program. The only other new proposal is $1 million a year for a breast cancer foundation providing the public contributes another $1 million, and $2.5 million going to a breast cancer clinic. It seems a cynical attempt to politicise the issue by allowing the Prime Minister's spouse to head a clinic which as yet has no plan of action. We must never forget that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) publicly stated that it was Mrs Keating alone pushing this issue in the public arena. He.conveniently ignored the thousands'of Australians that signed petitions and the work of many fine members in this There has been no attempt to increase specifically breast cancer research funding, and this issue which is of national importance has been ignored once again by this so-called women friendly government, which it clearly is not. The neglect of this particular issue is of great concern to me, the many women of Cowan and those Australians who were hoping for some positive action in this area. But we got very little in this budget. Let me reinforce .to the House that my work in this issue will not cease until we have an adequate increase in breast cancer funding, and I encourage those opposite who feel strongly enough about this issue to lobby their minister for some real action .. The myth about this sharing and caring government continues, yet every woman in Australia should be disappointed in the continued neglect of this issue by this government. Women, and in fact every Australian, should be concerned about this particular issue because cancer kills six women a day in Australia. It is a very important issue that we all shouldMr Cleary-Under your government outlays would be cut back. Let's look at cutbacks to government outlays. MrRICHARD EVANS-Are you suggesting that this issue should be ignored by us? So you're saying we should ignore it then? Mr Cleary interjecting",38
39,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Wills would be willing to ignore the issue of breast cancer research. Mr Cleary-You know that's not what I said, idiot.",40
40,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Wills will cease interjecting.,40
41,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"The half-back flanker for Coburg was always an idiot. Breast cancer is a very important issue, although the opinion of the honourable member for Wills is not appreciated.",40
42,Ms DEAHM,Unknown,"Macquarie) (2.56 p.m.)Like the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), I will address my remarks to women's health. I am pleased that this government has focused on women's health. In 1989 it instituted the national women's health program and, in last yeaF's budget; this was financed for a further four years. This program looks at all aspects of women's health, including their sexuality, breast cancer and cervical cancer, post-menopausal problems, including bone density testing, violence to women and many other community health issues. This year's focus has been on the issue of breast cancer, as 'the honourable member for Cowan has mentioned. I hope, though; that I will get my facts more correct than he has. The program this year, as has already been said, will focus on three main areas, and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) focused on these in her answer to a question yesterday. The first of these areas is the $236.6 million to be provided over the next five years to continue and expand the screening program. The honourable member for Cowan said it was to continue only what was happening. It is not; it is to expand the program. If he looks around his electorate and those of most other honourable members, he will see those mobile screening units bobbing up everywhere. So expansion of the program is extremely important. The next step is to focus on treatment. Once detection is carried out, we then need to look at treatment. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs is currently carrying out an inquiry into the treatment and management of women with breast cancer. That is a very gruelling inquiry and we are finding out that a lot of things need to be rectified. Much of that will be addressed in looking towards putting a national focus on treatment by the establishment of a national breast cancer centre. This centre will be set up under the auspices of the National Health and Medical Research Council, which will analyse home and overseas research, will provide a great deal of information and will put the focus on national best practice in the treatment and management of this very severe disease from which many women suffer. The third issue is the establishmenf of' a breast cancer foundation, which the honourable member for Cowan again seems to have confused with the centre. He talks about the wife of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) being a sponsor of a clinic. It is not a clinic; it is a foundation. The government is supporting this foundation with $3 million over three years, matched with funds raised from other sources. There is a great emphasis out there in the private sector to support this. Research is definitely being addressed. Of course, we can always use more money for research, but I think this is a great step forward. The government has also increased research funds to the National Health and Medical Research Council by a further $95 million this year and has asked the National Health and Medical Research Council to focus on breast cancer research in its distribution of funds for this year. The national program for detection has been highly successful. The standing committee will be seeking to focus in its hearings on a national treatment and. management program. This is an extremely important area that concerns all women. As we have seen, there are men who do support it. I cQmmend the honourable member for Cowan for constantly bringing forward this issue, even if he sometimes gets his facts wrong. I have great pleasure in suppprting the health budget, particularly as it affects women's health.",40
43,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The time al10tted for the proposed expenditures now before the House has expired. The question is that the proposed expenditures for the Department of Housing and Regional Development and the Department of Human Services and Health be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative.,41

NA North Korea  to the Leader of the House if he is representing the Prime Minister, but if there is no-one guarding the shop then I will direct my question to the Minister. representing the Minister for Defence. I refer firstly, fears that North Korea has a nuclear weapons program and the consequent demands that the United Nations impose sanctions; secondly, that North Korea has declared that it would reg-rd such sanctions as an act of war; and thirdly, and importantly-though oft overlooked-that Australia is a member of the United Nations Command in South Korea whose function it is to enforce the terms of the 1953 a:rmistice agreement. Given these developments and existing commitments, can the minister inform the House what are the implications for Australia of the deteriorating situation on the Korean peninsula? Is Australia, or will Australia be, under any international obligations as a result? Mr Tim Fischer-A disgraceful acting, acting situation ..  member for Kooyong for his question and the Leader of the NatIonal Party for the warm welcome to the dispatch box. We recognise the importance of developments on the Korean peninsula-I think the whole world does-for the security, in particular, of our Asia-Pacific region; I suppose it goes without saying that this government, like our allies, hopes that the current uncertainty can be resolved peaceful1y. North Korea's refusal to meet the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguard requirements regarding the refuelling of the five-megawatt nuclear reactor at Pyongyang is, I am advised, expected to be considered by· the UN Security Council this week. Needless to say, the Australian government is paying very close attention to all aspects of the situation on the Korean peninsula. Australia would support-the Prime Minister has already made this very clear-any actions imposed by the UN Security Council, including sanctions. We are looking carefully at the implications of any deterioration in the situation for the Australian Defence Force. Any comment on the possible commitment of ADF units to Korea would, at this stage, be purely speculating and.! think unwise. A decision would depend on the circumstances at the time, our interests as a natiOn and, as the honourable member has referred to, our to three factors: obligations. Economy: Recovery",41
45,Mr TANNER,Unknown,Is the Treasurer aware of reports that the benefits of economic recovery are not being enjoyed throughout the community? Can he provide any information which would clarify whether or not these reports are accurate?,41
46,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Melbourne for his question. It is the case that there have been suggestions that, despite the fact that we have had strong economic growth-five per cent growth in GDP in the last 12 months....:::ordinary Australians are not getting any benefit from that recovery. This is a rather bizarre sort of accusation. The honourable member for Higgins, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, said in an interview on the Sunday program last Sunday: ... I think if you spoke to Australians out there in the street and cities and regional areas they'd say, 'What recovery?' They're still feeling as if they're yet to see any of the fruits of that and the important thing is to try and get some benefitI do not know where he gets that from. Any kind of analysis of what is actually going on in the community would demonstrateMr Costello-Get out of your Commonwealth car..",41
47,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,42
48,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"that there is certainly a lot of benefit being felt by ordinary citizens. Perhaps the best indicator of that is the index of consumer sentiment. In the last 12 months or so, we have seen a tremendous turnaround in that index. The index now stands at its highest level in the 22 years that the survey has been conducted; it has risen almost 27 per cent since September 1993. Currently, 50 per cent of consumers believe that the economy will face good times over the coming 12 months, compared with only 24 per cent of consumers in the June 1993 survey. It is quite obvious that consumers are expecting better times-and consumers, of course, are the people of Australia. They clearly do not share the view of the honourable member for Higgins. They see that there are benefits coming from economic recovery, and they expect to share in them. Of course, they should share in those benefits because the economic growth is translating .into benefits for them in quite direct ways-by way, for instance, of increased employment. We have had growth in employment of 236,000 in the last 12 months. The opposition keeps saying that there has been nothing happening with jobs. We have had 236,000 additional jobs in the last 12 months, and those opposite try to make out there is nothing happening in terms of employment growth. This is just further evidence of the refusal of those opposite to accept the reality of what is going on in the economy. They live in their make-believe world in which everything is wrong with the economy. Mr Costello-You have put hundreds of thousands out of work.",42
49,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition! Mr WILLIS.....,.With that 236,000 increase il1 emplqyment, t-ere has been a fall in the unemployment rate from 11.2 per cent at the peak-that was December 1992-to 10.1 per cent in April. Of course, in the budget we forecast a further quarter of a million jobs growth in 1994-95 and a""'further fall in the unemployment rate as a result. Of course, for those who are in jobs, there are increased real wages. Real wages are increasing despite, again, the rhetoric from the opposition which would have us believe that real wages are falling. Real wages are increasing. They have increased by four per cent since the trough of September 1991. The budget has forecast that they will increase by a further 11/4 per cent in 1994-95. So we are not in some world of falling real wages; we are looking at rising real wages.,. - and rising real wages in the context of which in this coming year, 1994-95, Australians will benefit from the full-year income tax cuts rather than the 7 112 months they got in 1993-94. So we are looking at a boost to household disposable incomes on an annual basis. Indeed, real household disposable incomes are expected to grow by some 23/4 per cent this year-that is, in real terms-and 33/4 per cent in 1994-95. So we are looking at a society in which people are becoming better off. Their real incomes are increasing; their after tax incomes are increasing; real household incomes are going up; living standards are improving; employment is going up; unemployment is going down-and those are the unambiguous facts that you, the opposition, have to accept, whether you like it or not. Mr Costello-You have created an underclass. You have 900,000 unemployed. Where are you coming from? .",42

51,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, 1 raise a point of order. Perhaps if the Treasur-r observed the nicety of the House of directing his remarks through the chair, we would get a better result here.",43
52,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"There is no point of order. The Treasurer is in order and, in fact, is directing his remarks in the appropriate way.",43
53,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"1 just add to what I have already said that there is other evidence of improvement in living standards for the community, such as the fact that housing has been growing at a rapid rate. Approvals for new residential buildings over the last 12 months total 170,000; the value of housing finance commitinents in March was 35 per cent higher than a year earlier; and housing affordability with low interest rates-the lowest interest rates since the 1970s-is at highest level since December 1984. That means, of course, that home owners are benefiting from the recovery. People who want to buy new homes can do so now more easily than at any time in the past decade. 1 will not detain the House with further evidence. But the opposition is running a line in this country as though the economic recovery is somehow being channelled off in a way which does not benefit the people of Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. The unambiguous facts are that the people of Australia are benefiting in terms of their incomes, increased employment and increased housing availability, and they recognise that. That is why consumer confidence is so strong. Interest Rates",43
54,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"Is the Treasurer aware that Westpac, the National Australia Bank, ANZ, Citibank, Shroders, the Macquarie Bank and Potter Warburg, to name just a few, have all pointed out that interest rates stantially over the next 18 months by between two and four percentage points? Given the Treasurer's statement to parliament that maintaining low interest rates is important for business investment, will he admit that the Prime Minister was wrong when he said on 1 June, 'I do not think business investment has got anything to do with interest rates.' Does he accept that rising interest rates will restrict, not encourage, investment?",43
55,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"What the Prime Minister was referring to in his remarks was the fact that we have a very high level of profitability at present. That obviously is a great boost for business in its capacity to invest. The fact that it can invest retained earnings in a way in which it probably has not been able to do at almost any other time in our economic history obviously gives business a great capacity to invest regardless of the level of interest rates. Nevertheless, interest rates in the longer term obviously will have some impact. If interest rates were to rise substantially, which will not happen, but if they were to rise substantially then that would have some adverse impact on investment. The fact of life is that this interest rate issue its has been beaten to death by the opposition as part of its campaign of trying to sabotage the Australian economic recovery. Those opposite do not· want to see an economic recovery; they want the people of Australia to be frightened off increased expenditures, for instance, by pursuing this line about increased interest rates. They are trying to persuade the Australian people that some gloomy times are ahead when all the forecasts are that we are looking at one of the best economic outlooks this country has ever had. There is every reason for Australian people to be absolutely confident about the future. I would say to the real Australian people, 'Don't listen to this doomsaying opposition, which is concerned for its own shabby political purposes to sabotage the economic recoveryMr Downer-We have heard this for 11 years now.",43
56,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"listen, instead, to what the businesses of this world are sayingMr Downer-But we are. This is what the will rise sub- businesses are saying.",43
57,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Leader of the Opposition has asked the question.,43
58,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"and to what the Business Council of Australia is saying.' The Business Council is saying, 'This is a strong recovery in which many of our members are looking at very large increases in investment' - over 20 per cent-'and. we have a sound economic future on that basis.' That is the kind of thing that people should be looking at-not the doomsaying remarks of the opposition which is just simply trying to use this issue for its own political purposes. Deficit Reduction",43
59,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,Can the Minister for Finance assure the House that the government is continuing its commitment to the deficit reduction strategy outlined in the budget? Is this strategy supporting the economic recovery presently under way? Is he aware of alternative proposals for deficit reduction targets? What are the government's intentions in this matter?,44
60,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for-his question. The government intends to continue to pursue its deficit reduction strategy. I remind honourable members that that deficit reduction strategy will see the deficit fall to below one per cent of GOP by 1996-97 and under half a per cent of GOP by the next year. As I have had occasion to remark before in the House, that is a better performance by a country mile on deficit reduction than virtually any other country in the OECO with which we like to compare ourselves. As I have said before, the Canadians, who have a much praised deficit reduction strategy in place, are intending by that year, in which we fall under one per cent, to be at around three per cent of GOP. The government has no cause to change its mind in that regard. We are being urged, however-to pick up one or two other elements of the question that the honourable member asked-by the opposition to reduce that deficit target somewhat further. The opposition spokesman on Treasury matters said that today's release of Westpac's study indicates that the budget deficit is too high. \ There are a couple of points that ought to be made about that comment because it is yet another example of the right hand of the opposition not knowing what its left hand is doing:-or the right hand of the opposition not knowing what its even further right hand is doing, their not having facing palms. The point that ought to be made at the outset is that the deficit, whatever it is now, is at that level courtesy of the opposition; it is $600 million higher than it would have been had the government's position announced in the previous budget been put in place. In addition to that, while the shadow Treasurer is making his points on deficit reduction other frontbenchers are making their points. We have had mentioned in this place before what the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs thinks the size of the aid budget ought to be. The honourable member for Maranoa has stated that we need to set a figure of between $1 billion and $3 billion for infrastructure spending-that is an unrepudiated commitment that he has put forward. We have had statements on Aboriginal health, and we had a couple of classic statements over the weekend that dwarf even those previous statements in terms of their implications for the budget. As with just about everything it seems these days, these statements came from the honourable member for Mackellar. She has said both - on radio and in her column that it is time we advocated tax relief for health insurance premiums. If it were tax relief at the level of Fightback, it would be $1.5 billion; if it were tax relief at full credit, it would be $3 billion. The honourable member for Mackellar is also talking about introducing some form of coverage for gap insurance-some sort of tax incentive. That would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the opposition's expenditure totals. So we are totting up a pretty formidable list of unrepudiated statements out there about what those opposite intend to do with the budget deficit. From my recollection of the figures that I have just produced, those opposite would add anywhere between $3 billion and $6 billion to the $600 million that they, through their own personal efforts, have already managed to add to the budget deficit during this year. The opposition has to come clean on its policies. It cannot on the one hand masquerade around Australia, sit down and have comfortable little chats with Laurie Oakes or anyone else and say, 'Of course, we are going to have an unprecedented fiscal responsibility', 'We are believers in 1930s sound money' and other quaint phrases that have been reintroduced to the .economic debate in this country courtesy of the opposition spokesman on treasury matters as he learns about economics, and at the same time have the rest of the front-bench parade themselves before the general public and decide to add $3 billion, $4 billion-just think of a number-to the deficit. The opposition will make any promise when anybody raises a problem. Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order understanding order 145. What the opposition does is entirely up to the opposition. It was not something that was asked about in the question and therefore I would ask you to direct the minister to get back to addressing the question.",44
61,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of order. The minister was asked about other proposals in the community. He is answering the question.,45
62,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Fortunately, it will forever rest with the opposition because it will not, at the end of the day, be able to persist in presenting endless contradictory policies the Australian public no matter how much each particular policy makes it section of a community smile. It is hard yards that have to be made ih deficit reduction, and only this government has ever set itself that task. Overseas. Investment",45
63,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"My question is directed to one of the few senior ministers remaining in this country this week,the Treasurer. In the March quarter, excluding exchange rate effects, Australians lent $5.1 billion overseas. Does the minister agree that if this money had been invested in Australia it could have generated around 175,000 jobs in Australia? Mr WILLIS""-'. This is a peculiarly mercantilist kind of approach to economics, which I guess indicates a rather naive approach to economics by the National Party. It is not prising that it was the National Party that was intent on maintaining a high tariff wall around Australia to the great disadvantage of the people whom it represents. In the deregulated financial system that we have at the present time it is clear that there is no restriction on Australians lending overseas. In those circumstances, Australians can invest in other countries and this, in a mature economy, is what we would want to see. To make the decision about whether to invest, people look at the circumstances in this country and elsewhere and decide where it is most appropriate to put .their money. There are essentially no restrictions on their doing that. It is obviously, in those circumstances, important that the nation, having deregulated its financial system, produces an environment in this country conducive to increased investment. That is exactly what this government has done. We have a situation now where there are just tremendous circumstances for investment. The fact that investment has not occurred in the last few years is related to the recession and its aftermath, the fact that companies have been repairing their balance sheets, that they had excess capacity to work off before they needed to invest. Most importantly, they have been able to increase their productivity to so they can use their existing capacity more productively. That is a very good thing for the nation and it means that we do not have to invest more in order to produce more. That means that people can put off the point at which additional investment is needed. Despite all that happening, capacity utilisation rates are moving up and we can expect that business will have to move into that investment phase shortly. That is what the BCA survey is all about. If those opposite read the BCA survey, which tells what it expects its members are going to do, they will see that it says there is going to be a big increase in investment because the conditions that have been holding investment back in the past are in the past and the future is one in which it sees substantial investment occurring, particularly with high profitability, low interest rates, increased international competitivesurness and very substant.ial tax inducements. The environment for investment in this country is as good now as it has ever been, .particularly in the context, with all of that, high levels of demand. There is absolutely no reason to believe that because investments are being made overseas at the present time there is some bad environment for investment in this country. The environment for investment in this country is excellent and we will see the outcome of that in the next 12 months.",45
64,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Before I call the member for Fowler, the member for Gippsland, when he was a bit further along, was a lot quieter. As he has moved closer to me he has gotten louder. Can I suggest he resumes his normal posture. Defence Force: Income Testing",46
65,Mr GRACE,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. What progress has been made in addressing the effects on defence force families of income testing arrangements for social security and employment, education and training programs?  member for Fowler for his question and for his very strong interest in this matter. I note also that a wide number of members and senators have displayed a great deal of interest in this. In fact, I think it was during debate on the appropriation bills only this afternoon tha- the honourable member for Groom raised the matter. I am a strong supporter of the important principle behind the new income testing arrangements that include the provision for a fairer assessment by including certain employer fringe benefits. Mr Downer interjecting the Opposition is not interested in the welfare of the members of our armed forces and their families; but I will continue. There were anomalies in how these new arrangements were relating to defence force members and their families. The method used by the Department of Social Security and by DEET to assess notional rent with variations between metropolitan, non-metropolitan and what they can special areas unfortunately led toinequitable results when applied to our defence forces. In some cases, defence force personnel of of the same rank at the same base in similar sorts of housing with similar numbers of children could, by mere accident-they have no choice about where they live-be receiving up to $122 less per fortnight. Holsworthy base, which I visited recently, was one such example. This is against the background that our defence families have no choice about where they live. Because of this, quite some time ago Defence Force rents were standardised across Australia. This is what is referred to as the all-of-onecompany policy of the ADF. I am now pleased to inform the honourable member for Fowler and other members of the House that a more equitable solution has been found. This entails assessing the notional rent for all defence families at the lowest special rate. This acknowledges that defence families all pay the same rent no matter where they live, depending on rank. It also recognises the unique mobility requirements and the lifestyle that we as Australians expect of our defence personnel. My latest advice indicates that virtually no defence families will be adversely affected and that their additional family benefit and eligibility for DEET payments will therefore now be affected only by family income, which of course can vary. I pay tribute to the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training in achieving this very satisfactory result for our defence forces-and to a number of honourable members and senators who constructively worked for this solution to come about. I conclude by mentioning that this change will take effect from the next family payment payday, which is 9 June.",46
66,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Would you request ministers in future to make a statement to this House when dealing with matters of that ilk? That was demonstrably a matter which should not have been raised by way of an answer to a question without notice, but by way of a statement. I request that you advise· the ministry that you will require that to be done in future.",46
67,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman makes a valid point in respect of the way in which question time and the opportunity for ministerial statements should be taken.

72,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Mr COSTELLO...:... I will repeat that tion so the Treasurer gives a careful answer. Does the government attempt to influence or manipulate the OECD so as to produce favourable reports on its policies? Is it usual practice to do this at the behest of the ACTU?,47
73,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"I can assure the Deputy Leader of the· Opposition that he is barking the wrong tree. There is no way that the government seeks to influence the OECD to write reports about Australia which are inappropriate. As the honourable member would know, there is a consultation process for the annual reviews-lam not sure whether he is talking about the annual reviews-whereby a team comes to Australia and has consultations with all appropriate groups, including the government, I think the opposition, all the appropriate business groups· and unions, and make its a-sessment about the Australian economy. There is then a process of some iteration with the government about that, but the government does not at that stage seek to rewrite anything. If the OECD wants to write anything, it will write it. It is not something that the government influences in a way which you canre.gard as anything untoward at all, I assure you. Tourism",47
74,Mr NEWELL,Unknown,Can the Minister for Tourism advise the House what action he is taking to capitalise on the growth in tourism and to improve the investment profile of the tourisIll industry? Can he also advise of any alternative measures proposed for this important sector of the Australian economy?,47
75,Mr LEE,Unknown,:-I thank the honourable member for Richmond.for his continuing interest in an industry that is very important to his own electorate.,47
76,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to the remarks you made to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence a moment ago. I suggest that this question falls very close to that same category. I therefore suggest that it be ruled out of order.",47
77,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"On this occasion, the minister has been going for 12 seconds. I am unsure exactly what the minister intends to quessay. But I am sure he would have heard what I said before.",47
78,Mr LEE,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I know that you in particular will be very pleased to know that, for the first time ever, we had more than three million international visitors come to Australia in the year. ending January 1994. I do up not know how many went to Wollongong. It probably was not enough as far as you are concerned. But, for the first time ever, three million international visitors came to Australia. I am pleased that today's Australian Financial Review ran an article with the subheading - Australian hotels-better times ahead' as the domestic tourism sector is continuing to recover and build up in strength. Mr Ruddock-Come on; throwaway the statement.",47
79,Mr LEE,Unknown,"The honourable member for Berowra might not be interested in the tourism industry, but a lot of people, including some members on the opposition side of the House, are very keen on seeing the tourism industry continue to grow. It is an industry that has tremendous potential for further investment, great potential for export earnings for Australia and a lot of potential to generate new jobs, especially for young people. In the honourable member for Fadden was cabinet. saying exactly that not many hours ago in another high quality contribution to this debate. One initiative that the government brought forward is the Tourism Forecasting Council. It is a personal initiative of the Prime Minister that was announced last year to .bring together the tourism industry, the finance sector and the bankers to come with more credible figures to encourage the right investment decisions so that we do get another boom-bust cycle in tourism. One of the key initiatives of the Tourism Forecasting Council has been its decision sponsor the introduction of a tourism and leisure industry index on the Australian Exchange. This index will boost the profile the tourism industry and ensure that there better. information for investors, be they superannuation funds or others. The index will include seven companies with a total capitalisation of approximately $3 billion. first report of the Tourism Forecasting Counfor cil will come through later this year. There is an interesting contrast between the initiatives of the government and those of the importance. opposition on tourism. It is very interesting learn that the Leader of the Opposition, determining his sh,adow ministry, made the decision to dump the aviation and tourism industry from shadow cabinet. That was the decision of the new Leader of the Opposition, because-until he became the Leader of Opposition-the honourable member for Fadden, as spokesman on aviation and ism, was sitting in the shadow cabinet with voice at the cabinet table. But this the Opposition apparently thinks one is wrong and that tourism does not a great potential for jobs, investment and export ,earnings. Mr Downer-That is not right; you are pathetic.",47
80,Mr LEE,Unknown,"You were running around the country a few months ago arguing that the GST should be applied to tourism. So it is surprise. You used to think a few months ago that we should decimate the tourism industry with the GST. Now you are arguing that fact, tourism should be dumped from the shadow The difference between the opposition and the government is that the government has had the tourism minister in cabinet since has 1992. The government set up the Tourism Forecasting Council. We have increased funding to the Australian Tourist Commission eightfold in the last decade. The results are that international visitors are up, investment up in tourism is up and employment is up. At this time, we have the opposition saying that not it is downgrading tourism in the cabinet ranking. I conclude by quoting a recent statement to by the honourable member for Fadden. Inmy experience of visiting tourism representatives, Stock I have found that he is a member who has of always been held in high regard. He is someis one with a lot of experience in the tourism industry. He is personally held in high regard as someone with a bit of knowledge about the industry. When asked about the Leader of the The Opposition's decision, the honourable member Fadden's comment on Brisbane radio was: What I just hope is that the industry does not regard this as being a downgrading in terms of its .. to I also hope that the tourism industry does not in think it is being· downgraded because the Leader of the Opposition has downgraded it. I suspect that it will have a different view. But I can understand why that is the view of the honourable member for Fadden. When Mr the Henshaw went on to ask the honourable member for Fadden why the Leader of the tourOpposition had decided not include the a honourable member for Fadden in the shadow Leader of ministry, his comment was: that everyOh, you'll have to ask himoffer that is, the Leader of the Opposition I mean, I wouldn't have a clue how.. he works. Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development",48
81,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Emno ployment, Education and Training. I ask the minister, in the light of the Treasurer's ous answer: is it not a fact that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training asked his department to examine the feasibility of the OECD undertaking a new review of the accord in the hope that this would producea more favourable assessment than has appeared in previous OECD reports? Is it not also a fact that this was suggested to the minister by Mr Grant BeIchamber, an official of the ACTU?",48

85,Mr FREE,Unknown,"The OECD policy report of the employment study is to be released later today in Paris. It is the culmination of a year study involving a multidisciplinary team at the OECD. Some reports of what it might contain have been published in the press. Those comments include conclusions that globalisation and technological change have not contributed significantly to the rising levels of unemployment in the countries of the OECD while at the same time strongly rejecting protectionism-a view which Australia strongly supports and applauds. As I mentioned earlier, the report will be released later today on the specific matter raised",49
86,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order' 145 on the matter of relevance. The question asked by the honourable member for Goldstein was specifically directed to an OECD study in relation to labour market policies of the government and the accord. The minister is talking about a global employment study which is not directly related to the accord at all. He was asked about the accord; he was not asked about some kind of global study. Under standing order 145 he ought to be required to bring his answer back to what was previasked by the honourable member for Goldstein.",49
87,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The minister was asked a question relating to the OECD.,49
88,Mr FREE,Unknown,"As I say, at present the portfolio minister is in Paris. He will be participating in that ministerial meeting and making a positive contribution to the proceedings of the OECD as a representative of his country. I think it is rather a pity that, at the same time, back home the opposition is attempting to talk down the achievements in employment that this government has been able to record over the last 11 years. The honourable member has been unable to acknowledge the reality of job growth in this country since last March-some 230,000 new jobs-and he has been unable to acknowledge the white paper strategy, which I believe we will find accords very well. Dr Kemp- Mr Speaket, I raise a point of order understanding order 145. The minister was asked a quite specific question about whether the Minister for Employment, Education and Training had asked the OECD to two- examine the possibility of producing a more favourable report on the accord than it had in the past and whether this was suggested by an official of the ACTU. It was a quite specific question. The general remarks of the minister have nothing whatever to do with it.",49
89,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I invite the minister to wind up his answer.,49
90,Mr FREE,Unknown,"lam sorry that the honourable member for Goldstein is unable to take some pride in the achievements of this country over the last 11 years. I conclude on the general point that, if comments have been made on emerging conclusions of any particular piece of work, so what! Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. First, I ask the minister to table the document to which he has been referring. The second leg of my point of order relates to standing order 52, which requires order to be maintained by the Speaker. I bring to your notice, Mr Speaker, that in the last few minutes we have had a lot of interjections from the government, none of which have brought forward the response from you which has been repeatedly directed at the opposition today.",49

92,Mr FREE,Unknown,"Yes,they are, Mr Speaker.",50

102,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The .honourable member 'for Bennelong!,50
103,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,I am aware of the fact that some offence was taken from the question asked by the honourable member for Gilmore. I certainly dissociate myself from that.,50
104,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,You can line him up but you cannot,50
105,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Bennelong!,50
106,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,Why? Why? It is true!,50
107,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,"I also dissociate myself from some of the remarks coming from the opposition benches which perhaps were not picked up by you, Mr Speaker, or by Hansard but which were clearly audible to me. I will not repeat them in the interests of your emHerpes barrassment. This is an important issue because the Medical Journal of Australia indicated that some 65 per cent of heterosexual men attending a sexual health clinic in Sydney had been exposed to geriital herpes. That is an extremely high percentage and one far higher than in any previous surveys undertaken. The health department has been quick to reassure me that this is a highly selective sample and that such high figures would not normally be ob;;erved in the general population. More representational studies show that Australia is not very different from the rest of the world in this respect. Nonetheless, there is an enormous amount of work to be done in promoting safe sex, and that is the point of my observations today. There are still a lot of sexually transmitted diseases in our community, the most severe obviously being. HIVAIDS. There has been a lot of concern in our of community particularly about the infection of our young people. I am pleased to say that the Commonwealth government, together with the states, has a number of programs which are operating at the moment to target y<>ung people, as well as GPs to ensureth-t they well understand the risks that are being faced by young people and the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. . I want to draw to the attention of honourable members a docume-tary entitled Sex, Guys and Videotape, which will be aired on the ABC next Wednesday: night. I draw it to the attention of the Bouse because it is a very direct presentation on this question. It is an up-front analysis of men's sexuality and their attitudes and it is very clearly adult viewing. As I said, it has been supported by state and Commonwealth governments. It is important that the message gets through. It is important that those sorts of figures I have talked about do not become a reality. The documentary has a number of young and older men talking about their sexuality, and I think that is a breakthrough. It includes people such as Michael Whitney, Clive Robertson and even Rex Mossop. So we are not talking about a fringe group in the community-at least not in some people's vi""ews. I think for the first time in Australian preventive health men are talking about their sexual health. I agree with Gary Egger from the School of Medicine at Newcastle Universitythat if we are to improve men's health we need to get some openness and up-frontness. He says: Men 'don't go to doctors between the age of about 18 and 55 because you are regarded as a wimp if you do ... Along with the state health ministers, I am keen to encourage more men to take the necessary advice and to have the necessary treatment and ensure that-unlike some of interjections I have had from the .other sidethey do not bury their heads in the sand. Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development",50
108,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"My question is once again directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Does the minister deny that his personal office has a minute from the department received on 3 June in which the department specifically advises against an DECO review of the accord, as. recommended by the ACTU, on the grounds that such a review would 'hold distinct dangers for the government and little by way of compensating advantages'? Did the minister's department in this minute advise that it was the view of the DECO that Australia would be unlikely to come out favourably in a comparison of industrial relations arrangements with New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States?",51
109,Mr FREE,Unknown,"I have no recollection of any such document. As to the thrust of the honourable member's question: it is an absurd proposition that any Australian minister or government department would be in a position to direct the DECO to produce a report in the way being suggested by the honourable member. The OECD is an independent agency which is more than. capable of producing positive, quality, independent and relative reports on employment and other matters, as it has been requested to do in the past. The proposition that any Australian minister would be in a position to direct this organisation is absurd. The tenor of the opposition's questioning on this matter really demonstrates the total absence of any plan to deal with employment growth and unemployment in this country. The opposition fails to acknowledge the reality of the white paper-the most comprehensive statement on employment ever presented to this parliament and a set of initiatives relevant to our economic circumstances. What the honourable member has said flies in the face of employment growth over the last year and flies in the face of the initiatives the government has in place in the white paper, which include the job compact, the training wage, the school to work transition, case management and so on. The opposition is obviously concerned that the white paper has been so well received by Australian business and community groups. The challenge facing the opposition is to develop a comprehensive range of policies. At present it has neither the wit nor the wisdom to address unemployment or find solutions to it. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. On Monday, 9 May last, you issued an admonition to all ministers to shorten the length of their answers for the sake of the proceedings of the House and the fair conduct of question time. I ask that you direct this minister accordingly.",51
110,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,All ministers are reminded of that responsibility. I call the minister.,51
111,Mr FREE,Unknown,"The opposition had a plan but it was the wrong plan. For example, its plan consisted of kicking people off the dole after nine months. This answer is quite relevant to the work of the DECO in relation to employment and unemployment. Quite frankly, we have an opposition which had a plan.. -:.a bad plan-and which now has no plan-This was admitted by the Leader of the Opposition on Sydney radio earlier this month when he was asked - .",51
112,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I raise a point of order. Surely, understanding order 145, this answer fails every test. The minister was quite specifically asked whether he has a minute from the department dated 3 June, and he is rabbitenergy ing on about Fightback. Even you, Mr Speak, er, must agree that that is out of order. Mr MCGauran-Even you, Mr Speaker!",52
113,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I could proceed a little further with that comment from the honourable member for Gippsland, but I choose not to at this stage. I say to the honourable member for Bennelong once again that questions of relevance, and indeed the standing orders and how ministers respond to those, if taken in the appropriate way, will be treated seriously; and I am doing so on this occasion. With regard to the answer the minister is giving: he was asked about the OECD.That, I understood, embraced the question of industrial relations and employment policy. However, I think he has now gone a bit beyond what was being sought, and I invite him to wind up his answer.",52
114,Mr FREE,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Mr Downer-But just go on as you were.",52
115,Mr FREE,Unknown,"As I was indicating, opposition members have no position on these matters. Mr Downer-Oh, Mr Speaker, he is treating you",52
116,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The minister is winding up his answer.,52
117,Mr FREE,Unknown,"Consequently, they are reduced to wild goose chases, the nature of which we have seen from the honourable member for Goldstein.",52
118,Mr ADAMS,Unknown,My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. Could the minister advise the House of the outlook for gold and other mineral commodities in Australia?,52
119,Mr BEDDALL,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Lyons for his question and note his continuing interest in the mining industry. Recently the Tasmanian Chamber of Mines noted that, in the honourable member's own state, the mining and minerals industry provides more than 40 per cent of the state's exports-$300 million-and provides 15,000 valuable jobs. The outlook for Australia's mineral and exports is good for this year, despite lower coal and iron ore prices. It will increase by about two per cent to over $30 billion for the current financial year, as prices and volumes for some commodities continue to rise. In addition, demand for minerals is forecast to recover strongly through 1995. In fact,. gold is one of the great success stories of Australian exports. In 1993-94 gold exports are forecast to increase by 27 per cent over 1992-93, to $5.4 billion. The price of gold is continuing to encourage exploration. I note that, in the electorate of the honourable member for Lyons, two new mines are about to come on stream, one at Beaconsfield, which is a $20 million investment. That mine was in operation last century, and new technologies have enabled it to come back on stream. It will provide 40 to 50 valuable new jobs in the honourable member's electorate and will provide 50,000 to 100,000 ounces of gold per annum. There is also a new underground mine to open up at Henty. This is a $60 million investment and will provide 100,000 ounces of gold per annum by 1996. In relation to other commodities, copper prices have strongly recovered in recent times and copper is the 10th largest mineral export from Australia, with $757 million worth of copper exports forecast for 1994-95. I noticed before that there was a question about Australian investment offshore. The copper industry is one in which we are proud to have investments offshore. Both MIM and BHP have investments in South America; Those Gold investments enable Australia to have substantial equity in not only Australian copper production but also world copper production. In terms of other commodities, aluminium prices have stabilised and we hope that the outcome for coal and iron ore will improve over that of recent years. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",52
120,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Goldstein moving forthwith: That the House condemns the Government for conspiring with ACTU to distort the DECO's unfavourable assessby ment of Australia's industrial relations efforts and their employment effects. It is essential that the government faces up the fact that the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who failed to answer questions during question time about a minute received by the office of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training from the department, should now answer to the House why he is ignorant of the advice that the department has offered to him and to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). I seek leave to table the minute from the Department of Employment, Education and Training to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Leave granted.",53
121,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"What this minute shows-this will be of very great interest to the ministergovernment is that the Department of Employment, Education and Training was approached by the ACTU to produce a new inquiry to the OECD about its reports on the accord. The reason the ACTU approached the department - of course, it is used to approaching the department; it a good friend of the department-is that, in the ACTU's view, the DECO's reports have been very unsympathetic to the accord. The ACTU has been very concerned that the reports which have been coming down have, time after time, identified weaknesses in the rigid labour market arrangements which the government has put in place. These rigid arrangements have been a fundamental cause of the unemployment which Australia has been suffering over the last 10 years and, in particular, over the years since the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), with the support and advice of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, put into place the high unemployment policies. The minute that the department has providOrders ed to the minister makes it very clear that the department, at the behest of the ACTU, approached the DECO to see whether a more favourable assessment of Australia's labour market policies could be obtained. The key thing is that the department and the minister the went along with this inquiry. They were asked the ACTU, and they went along with the reform ACTU because they, like the ACTU, have . been grievously embarrassed by the fact that to the independent international agency has been issuing, time and again, unfavourable comment on the accord which, as we all know, is the centrepiece of the government's program. Let me remind the House that the accord was an agreement that was reached between the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement in 1983. Since that time, every policy that the government has brought down has had to have the approval of the ACTU. That includes employment policies, education policies and training policies. The social crisis which this country is now facing is a direct consequence of the fact that this government has become a highly sectional governmentnot a government on behalf of all Australians, but a government for a part of Australia, a which acts at the behest of the officials, the bosses of the ACTU. This minute makes clear that, when the department approached the DECO and asked it what its attitude would be to such a review, the DECO, to its credit, made it quite clear is that the department would not see any change in the OECD's reports on the accord; any reports it might issue in the future would be in accordance with reports it has issued in the past. This came as a surprise to the ACTU because, schooled in Australian politics, its view was that the problem with the DECO reports was that they had been issued by the economic department of the DECO. But suppose the report were written by the labour market directorate of the DECO. That would be a different matter entirely. Then there tiona] document making by an independent international authority,. the OECD? Mr Swan-So what?",53
122,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"It is not a long bow. It is a very direct accusation and it is true. This Labor government has an unemployment policy but no employment policy. It has never had one. It would not know how to devise one. It would not know how to start oner except for the fact that it has an emp]oym-nt policy to keep itself in governme-.t. a-d Its mates in the ACTU there along wIth It. We know that the President of the ACro has a de facto position in cabinet. Who is the minute to-a minister who is an ex-president of the ACTU. Where is he now? He is in France, is he not? Is he not over there on OECD business? Is he not going to attempt to get the OECD to moderate its c1aims that the industria] relations system in Australia is inefficient and old fashioned? What are some. of the things that the OECD had to say about our system? It said: The Australian industrial relations system is marked by strong wage-.wage links.. - his has favoured the retention of Incomes pohcles long after they have been discarded in other OECD countries. As I reca]] the Prime Miriister(Mr Keating) has said in 'this place time and time again that we cannot control inflation if we do not have a wages policy. The O?CD says c1ea-ly. that the wages policy of thIS government IS meffective and has not progressed enterprise bargaining to the degre.e that we a]] kno- is necessary if we are gomg !o have a flexIble economy. The government has deregulated the real economy but left us with a cosseted contro]]ed industrial relations system, controlled, in essence, from ACTU House through a de facto cabinet position in this government. The Minister .for Employment, Education and Training, ex-president of the ACTU, nowants the OECD to rewrite the rules. What IS the advice of his department? His department says: The key general point is that we would hav- no assurance of control over the outcomes of a .reVIew, and that there is a distinct possibility ofan uncomfortable set of findings regardless of which directorplace ate has principle coverage. That is because the ACTU officer suggested that perhaps the industrial relations division, not the economic division, of the OECD should look at this issue and that it might be more disposed towards a Labor government in Canberra than it otherwise would be. We now have this attempt by the ACTU, in collusion with the federal Labor government, to rewrite. the rules. The Prime Minister did it well, did he not? He freely admitted it to the Canberra press gallery in December 1990. He said: I have Treasury in my pocket, the Reserve Bank in my pocket, wages policy in my pocket, the. financial community both here and overseas In my pocket. He has bloody deep pockets, does he not? And now that mob over there wants the OECD in the government's pocket as well. So the ACTU it seems, has incredibly long arms. This is on- more example of a government of the ACTU, by the ACTU and for the ACTU. This is why we absolutely must suspend standing. orders and debate this incredible contribution to this parliament and the country. (Time expired)",55
123,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"This document that the opposition is touting has, in fact, exposed two things: firstly, that the opposition h-s absolutely no idea about how the busmess of government is conductedOpposition members-Hal Ha!",55
124,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"And those who ought to know have forgotten. The second thing that has been teased out by the production of this document is what the opposition's industrial relations policy is. In its kinder, more enlightened atmosphere, it is saying that we should be taking a more broadly based approach to things. For example, the opposition said it would be a bad thing if a proposition came from the OECD that suggested that occupational health and safety standards should be rev!ewed favourably in the context of wages poltcy or wages development. The opposition is - ffe-­ tively saying that it would be a bad thmg If equal opportunity legislation were to be in in the industrial relations environment in terms of flexibility or whatever and that a finding on that would be welcomed by the opposition when wages policy is dealt with. In fact, those points were specifically made by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who moved this motion. When we actually start to look through this document, as I have been able to do in the last ·15 minutes while members of the opposition were speaking, several things become very obvious. The first is that the OECD does not conduct its discussions in a vacuum. It is not a bunch of judges sitting in Europe arriving at pronouncements about the policy directions there ought to be in the individual countries which happen to be members of the OECD without consulting anyone or without any form of interaction with departments, governments or whatever. The OECD constantly keeps in place a process of consultation with the governments of the day in the countries which it is examining. At the end of the day it arrives at its own conclusions. There is no suggestion anywhere in this document that the government ought to go and sit inside the OECD, get that set of conclusions and rewrite them. It does arrive at a set of conclusions. But it generally arrives at draft positions before it arrives' at those sets of conclusions, and those draft positions are discussed with the governments of the particular countries to see if there is any point they wish to make. This document is about suggesting to the minister that he or the department ought to be making certain propositions to the OECD based on the information that they have seen thus far from the OECD draft notes, which ultimately lead to some form of country survey on industrial relations matters. It is entirely appropriate to advise a government, 'You have to be aware that, if this line is persisted in by the OECD, you will find that certain conclusions are reached almost automatically by the OECD. You might have a point to make to the OECD before it arrives at those conclusions, and these are the sorts of points you might like to make.' That is a perfectly normal communication. The government, which itself does not sit here in isolation talking to no-one, has from time to time had views expressed to it by various people-in this case, in a very minor part of the document, apparently it was an ACTU official concerned with employment policy who said that some sort of view ought to be presented to the OECD that took into account certain features of the Australian situation. Why not? They are Australian citizens. It would not matter whether it was the ACTU or some academic, as many academics do, who put forward suggestions to the Australian government about what it ought to, say in response to draft notes or whatever that came from the OECD before those notes eventually emerge as a final country report. It could have been some members of the business community. Those sections of the peak councils of the business community which have people who trace reporting that comes out of the OECD would, no doubt, also have points to make to the government on these particular propositions and would have been brought into those consultations. The point is that at the end of the day none of that amounts to improper interference. Every government makes its case to the OECD. The OECD has an enormous consultative process. There is not one jot or tittle of a suggestion that, at the end of the day when something is finally produced by the OECD, we need to mug the bloke who runs out of the building with the document to release it to the press so that we can rewrite it. That is the sort of proposition which underpins the opposition's principal objection to this. Now let us see what the opposition was a little concerned about. When we look at this document, we find that the first point it is concerned about is that the draft notes that have appeared to this point contain no refe-­ ence to the white paper or what the government intends to do in that area. The opposition feels that the OECD report ought to at least contain some elements th-t were related to that. We are entitled to wonder why the opposition would think that. Perhaps it would think that because paragraph 13 on page 4, 'The main policy issues raised in this Nqte'-:that is, the Labour Market Note. for AU,stralla which is still in draft form""""""""""7in part states: that temporary wage subsidies to the LTV have been made more widely available in recent years, and that this is an effective way of re-integrating the unemployed. That is an interesting little part of the note that has been put forward by the OECD as something that it might like to consider saying about the Australian system. In relation to the point that the temporary wage subsidies to the LTU have been made more widely available in recent years and that this is an effective way of reintegrating the unemployed, it is no wonder that we would want to have a thing or two to say about the white paper in that regard. That effectively means that if the OECD comes out and turns the note into a draft report it is saying, 'This is a good thing to do and do more of it.' The opposition has been spending a considerable amount of time telling us that that is exactly the wrong thing to do. The opposition is flushed by this particular proposition because it ought to be thought of in the context that the coalition is now the only conservative party in the world that actually opposes subsidised labour market programs to assist the long-term unemployed. That the OECD, which is a fairly conservative organisation on these matters, regards that as a matter to note and as a matter that ought to be put forward is a thundering indictment of the sorts of propositions that the opposition has managed to arrive at. The opposition outlines further things people are worried about that might emerge in the note. The next point in paragraph 13 is: that labour market regulation has increased through tighter occupational"" health and safety standards; equal opportunity legislation; and nonwage labour costs, including the Training Guarantee, Superannuation Guarantee and payroll tax. I am pleased to hear the opposition now supports payroll tax. I am pleased to hear the opposition on the subject of superannuation guarantee. If the opposition complains about us, what must it say about all the European countries, virtually all of whom have some form of taxation arrangements in their wage structures or in their taxation systems that picks up exactly those sorts of points as far as superannuation guarantee is concerned? What is suggested by implication by the opposition in the debate here is that we ought to be totally unmoved by a report that comes out and says that having in place equal opportunity legislation and occupational health and safety legislation is a bad thing and that it increases difficulties with labour market flexibility. These are the sorts of problems the department is drawing attention to. It is saying to the minister, 'You might want to present an argument that this is a reasonable thing to have within a report that comes down on Australia and that ought not be a criticism of Australia,' If the opposition thinks those things add to inflexibility to an extent that is unacceptable and wishes them removed, then it should advocate it. It should have the guts to get out there and advocate i-. The document says: . the need for a· more flexible wages structure which better relates pay to skill and provides incentives for skill formation. That is fine. That is the proposition it wishes to put forward. But it was quite evident from what the opposition spokesperson said that the opposition is still running around with the flexibility downers. It is still running around saying, 'It would be a problem if we had an unfavourable comparison with New Zealand and with the United Kingdom where the working poor do not get paid a living wage.' That is where it wishes us to end up. That is what I said at the beginning. This has teased out a very interesting industrial agenda. The opposition has not understood the document it has had before it. Those opposite cannot help the fact that they have been in opposition for so long that they do not comprehend these things. They have not understood the document they have had before them. They have revealed to the . Australian public what an appalling prospect they have in mind for them on industrial relations matters.

NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",59
133,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I move: That, in relation to the proceedings on the following Bills, so much of the standing and Sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of all the Bills: Banking (State Bank of South Australia and Other Matters) Bill 1994; Bounty. (Fuel Ethanol) Bill 1994; Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1994; Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994; Australian Capital Territory Government (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1994; Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1994; . Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1994; Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1994; and Veterans' Affairs· (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. In one way or another these matters are related to legislation which has to have a start-up date at the beginning of the financial year. Some of them are budget measures which will significantly impact on the revenue and expenditure outcomes of the government. Others, such as the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No.2), are related to matters which the government believes need to be concluded quickly. All of them, in the way in which they appear in the House in the form of a guillotine, are related to the fact that we must have our legislative proposals for the Senate concluded by the end of this week if it is to be able to give them due consideration before that date.·That is not an unreasonable requirement by the Senate. From time to. time. I have had occasion to remark on unreasonable requirements by the Senate, but in this case we are talking about a concluding date at the end of this month and we are already four or five days into it. For the Senate to be able to conclude it by the end of this month, it does need several weeks consideration, which concluding these matters in the next couple of days will give it. Unlike my usual form when moving Orders guillotines, where I introduce the fact that the Senate imposes heinous limits on the House, I can scarcely complain about that in these circumstances. I also note-because I think the point will be· made, and I do not really want to speak again in the debate-that the provisions that were put in place by the government to change the. practices of the House were to some degree intended to militate the need for the guillotining of legislation, yet we still put forward a guillotine. Those measures, I remind the House, include the provision of a second chamber. They also, effectively, include a decision by the government to operate three sittings a year instead of two Service sittings a year and to move away from our pattern of trying to pass everything in one sittings at each point in the two sittings for the year. By and large, we have been able to keep that up. This is by no means as severe a guillotine as we have put in place in the past. At the same time, irrespective of whether or not we were trying to operate without a guillotine at all, if we are actually going to get the benefits of an early budget, a budget produced' in May with a start-up time in the early part of the financial year, some form of guillotining for a fair bit of budget legislation is virtually unavoidable. Hence the guillotine which is in place as of this moment and this guillotine which is suggested for this legislatwn. I do not need to add anything more to that, except to urge the House to support the motion.",61
134,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"A funny thing seemed to happen on the way to the second chamber. The whole idea of the second chamber was to relieve the burden on the House of Representatives in relation to routine legislation. It is quite ironic that the second chamber is opening for business tomorrow, for the first time, and this is the second guillotine we have had in three days. I have heard a lot of motions to bring in the guillotine moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), and none lacked heart quite like the last one. He was not very enthusiastic about it at all. He knows deep down that this one is totally without justification. It lacks any merit. He cannot even blame the Senate on this occasion. He actually said that it is necessary to comply with a reasonable requirement of the Senate. Normally he can stretch it and dredge up some kind of complaint about the Senate. It seems to be bred in those on the other side to blame the Senate when something goes wrong, but he could not even do that on this occasion. I will not delay the House with a long speech. I do not think this motion has any merit at all. The opposition will oppose it and we will call a division.",62
135,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"Ijoin in protesting the seemingly regular occurrence of yet another guillotine. I do not think it would matter what changes this government made to the standing orders; we. would still have guillotines. If we had seven chambers and not two, there would still be guillotines. There just does not seem to be any capacity to manage the business program. We wait until the last few days, until the sun is setting on the sittings, and then a whole stack of legislation which is suddenly considered to be urgent is rushed into the chamber and there is an expectation that it will be dealt with. In the time that I have been a member of this chamber, over half of all of the legislation to come before the parliament has been subject to guillotine. I think that is a pretty appalling record. When I tell my constituents about that, they are amazed that the centrepiece of our democratic process could operate so badly and that so much of our legislation-so many of the important bills and so many of the changes that the government proposes to bring into our way of life-is not adequately debated in the parliament because time is not permitting. The clock determines when the vote is taken rather than the parliament being ready to reach a decision. One of the obvious consequences of this has been the incidence of bills having to come back into the chamber to fix up the mistakes. When legislation is rushed through without proper consideration and without adequate time to carefully review the issues involved, it is inevitable that legislation that is shoddy in preparation or, in some instances, even bad in concept will go through the chamber and then have to be fixed up at a later time. This is really an unsatisfactory way for the parliament of a democratic country to operate. What kind of an example do we set for other parts of the world and the Australian people when we cannot manage our own affairs better than this? I am not a great fan of the second chamber. I do not believe that it will contribute anything worthwhile to the processes of the parliament. When we have to deal with another guillotine on the eve of the second chamber commencing its first sittings, this clearly demonstrates that the second chamber has failed before it has even started. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) said that this guillotine is not as severe as others. There is only one reason for that: the government does not have many bills around at the present time. If it did, this guillotine would have been much more severe. There are only half a dozen bills on this list because that is all that is around. Had there been 20 or 30 bills, they would have all been guillotined. I am aware of one bill on the program that is going to the second chamber because it apparently fits into the non-controversial class that is allowed to be discussed there. But, basically, very little of the legislation is going in that direction. One improvement to the parliament;lry process is the referral of a number of bills to House of Representatives committees. I commend the government on that process. It obviously remains to be seen how seriously the government will take on board the recommendations of those committees, but it is a very positive step which needs to be commended. That will slow down some legislatiop, and I accept that fact. But, hopefully, it will reduce the number of occasions on which legislation has to be brought back in order to have faults corrected. Hopefully, it will also reduce the' number of times that the Senate has to do ourjob for us, namely, tidying the legislation up and correcting the most obvious errors. I am disappointed that, on the eve of the first sittings of the second chamber, we will again be treated to another guillotine. The debate on another series of bills will again be limited. This follows the really cruel limitations that were applied to this year's debates on Appropriation Bill (No.1). We were allowed half an hour to deal with each department. In fact, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which incorporates quite a lot of the substance of government, was dealt with for only 10 minutes because the time allowed for that department had expired so soon after the debate had commenced. That is not a proper way to scrutinise the budget. That is not a proper way to scrutinise the business and the affairs that the government is putting before the Australian people. The government should be condemned for this guillotine. It is right that we divide on it. Walker, F. J. The government will again use its numbers mercilessly, as it will do with each of these pieces of legislation, in order to force this legislation through, irrespective of its merits and, in this instance, irrespective of the opportunity that the parliament or the Australian people have had to examine its contents and quality. Question put: That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to. The House divided. [4.47 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr H.A. Jenkins) Ayes 75 Noes 59 Majority ......... 16 NA Adams, D. Baldwin, P. J.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1994-95 Consideration in Detail Consideration resumed. Schedule. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Proposed expenditure, $2,350,566,000.  the limited time available to me to discuss the proposed expenditure for. the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade I want to focus on bills the aid budget and its consistent decline over the last 10 years of Labor government-its decline whatever way you wish to measure it: its decline per capita, its decline as a age of per capita income, its decline as a percentage of GNP, and its decline as a percentage of total federal government expenditure. Australia's GNP per capita has risen by $4,700 in real terms in the 10 years since this Labor government came to power, but aid expenditure has declined by $5 per capita over the same period. This represents a fall from 0.5 per cent of per capita income when Labor came to power to 0.33 per cent in this year's budget. In responding to a question in this chamber last Wednesday, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) had the gall to suggest that this appalling record could be compared favourably with the record of the previous Liberal government. I want today to correct the minister's misrepresentation of the facts. In 1985-86, in its second full financial year in office, Labor cut the aid budget by 4.8 per cent in real terms which caused the aid to GNP ratio to drop significantly from the healthy 0.49 per cent which it inherited from the Fraser government. The following year, in 1986-87, Labor cut the aid budget again, this time by a massive 12 per cent in real terms, which saw the aid budget drop to 0.38 per cent of GNP for that year. The following year, in 1987-88, Labor again repeated this performance by making another cut of 2.5 per cent in real terms, and in 1989-90 Labor presided over another very large 7.5 per cent drop in budget spending which took the aid budget to its lowest ever level of funding as a percentage of GNP, namely, 0.33 per cent. Had the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, not intervened at the last minute in a desperate response to widespread calls for action from private aid agencies and me, the aid budget would have again fallen to 0.33 per cent. The fact is that the Prime Minister intervened just enough to ensure that the aid to GNP ratio would reach a miserable 0.34 per cent. The Labor government made a very firm election promise to take the percentage of aid to GNP back to 0.4 per cent in this 1994-95 budget. Yet another lie. The government deliberately broke this promise. Indeed, this percentyear the government has made no further mention of any such commitment. The minister and the government have lost all credibility with the public on this issue. In response to the aid budget, the Australian Council for Overseas Aid and Community Aid Abroad have mentioned a number of community concerns about the aid budget: its, geographic focus, its emphasis on commercialism and on large infrastructure projects, and the need for balance between contributions to multilateral and bilateral channels for aid distribution. Indeed, there is now very widespread debate, including within the general community, on all these aid quality issues. The decline in the aid budget, the government's loss of credibility and the widespread community debate on aid quality issues lead me to the conclusion that it is high time the government's aid program was subjected to a full-scale independent review. The consensus achieved through the Jackson committee report on the overall orientation and priorities in the aid program, which was handed down in 1984, has well and truly disintegrated. There are, in my view, well-founded and growing grounds for concern that taxpayers' money is potentially being misdirected and even wasted through the aid budget. There is evidence of actual project failure, there is evidence of inadequate effectiveness evaluation, there is evidence of inadequate attention to environmental and social impact assessment, and there is strong suspicion of related administrative inefficiency and lack of capability. The government is not taking sufficiently seriously the need for periodic effectiveness reviews of aspects of the aid program. Take as an example the fact that AIDAB, jointly with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Treasury, has recently completed an extensive high level review of the effectiveness of our multilateral aid. The review took the time of three senior executive officers and an independent academic consultant. It covered approximately $320 million of taxpayers' money that the government spends on the multilateral agencies. The minister responsible has been disinclined to publish this report. But surely the general public, the taxpayer, entitled to this information. (Time expired)",64
138,Mr FERGUSON,Unknown,"Reid) (5.00 p.m.)Many members on both sides of the House would agree with the push to increase the aid budget and would have some concerns about the deterioration of aid over the last decade, but the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) has a hide to get up on this subject. When we start deploring how bad that budget is, it has to be seen in the context of opposition's Fightback policy to reduce total aid budget by $209 million. That has be seen in the wider context of reducing taxation tal\e and the all the more deplorable reality out there. One point that I would like to commend in this budget is the government's reassert ion its activity around family planning, which relates in tum to the inquiry into its effectivening ness. That expenditure of over $130 million over the next three years will encompass a variety of programs throughout our region. In the Philippines, a network of service providers in 15 municipalities, including two to three the poorest, will be designated by the Philipreiteration pine government. In Indonesia, there is a high rate of maternal mortality, His recogbudget. nised by UNICEF, which is running programs there. In Vietnam, money is allocated for primary health care, immunisation against trachoma, et cetera, and, in the Philippines, the poorest regions of the country such as Zamboanga will have access to family plandelivery ning. This reassertion of the government's activinent ty to this end comes after a thorough inquiry into the effectiveness of our program. After all the complaints which came down to personnel and individuals, and attacks on people undertaking the inquiry, the committee of inquiry came to a fairly strong conclusion that Australia's program was worth merited and should conti'nue. There will be a greater assertion in future programs so that any coercive aspects to family planning will be strongly counted. The current world population of 5.6 billion people is projected by the United Nations population fund to rise to between 7.6 billion and 7.9 billion as early as the year 2015. It is no good is saying that government action and foreign aid activity are not related to it. Similarly, a document by Population Action International,entitled 'World access to birth control: 1987 to 1982', traced the very different levels of improvement or worsening of population growth in a variety of countries. It was not just a matter of things happening in a haphazard fashion; it showed a clear relationship between activity, expenditure and the , improvement. Thus, we have seen certain the countries-even in Africa, with its overto whelming problems in that direction-such as Botswana, Lesotho and Zambia making massive steps forward because of the degree of government activity. It has been estimated that, to meet·the of world's requirements of enough contraceptives to fully meet unmet demand in family planby the year 2000, $11 billion will be required. After all of the huffing and the puffing, all of the capitulation to political pressures and political realities in the Senate, the committee of inquiry came down with a of very strong endorsement and a very strong of Australia's need to act in this very field. That is a commendable aspect of the Similarly, there is a new emphasis, and $20 million within the total DIFF program is being advanced to green projects. That has two aspects: first, it is merited. It is something we should be doing. We should be looking at of sanitation, emphasising clean water to people and making sure that promiprojects just for national image do not take the centre part, but that these other projects with a green and environmental emphasis should be there. The second aspect the is that it counters OECD pressures that are sometimes a bit too restrictive in regard to supposed emphasis on commercial orientation while, in some of these projects. I want very brieflY to talk about the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau's program of training for Eurasia. Some of my constituents, particularly in the Ukrainian community, have raised a requirement that the government should press on with this program which has accounted for $9 112 million over the last five years. I am pleased to say that the government has continued that program, which has helped not only the Ukraine but Slovakia, Kazakhastan, Russia-a whole part of eastern Europe....,.in allowing people to come here for secondment to various companies.

139,Mr ALDRED,Unknown,"Deakin) (5.05 p.m.)Australia's intelligence community is in a state of crisis. Let me make these points: the government has structured its three so-called inquiries to ensure that the relationship between the investigators and the investigated so close as to preclude objective inquiries. Friends are investigating friends. Mr Michael Codd, one of the two royal commissioners for the ASIS inquiry and former secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, ror years had an overview role of those areas he is looking. into in his capacity as Chairman of the Secretaries Committee on Intelligence and Security. Is he now examining his own handiwork? Mr Michael Cook, who is running the general security inquiry, was Director-General of the Office of National Assessments from 1981 to 1989. One of ONA's functions is to report on the efficiency of ASIO. Is Mr Cook also investigating his friends or his own performance? In addition, ASIO's own senior officers are carrying out their own internal inquiry. However, it is common knowledge that the inquiry by the Australian Federal Police into ASIO called 'Operation Liver' was sufficiently alarming to the government to . bring about the present inquiry. External concern has again been internalised. Moreover, given the interconnected nature of so much of the work undertaken by the various services, three separate inquiries are some, duplicative and a waste of taxpayers' funds. Let us look closer at the real problems. Why, for instance, was Valeriy Zemskovafter British intelligence determined from the debriefing of Soviet defector Oleg Gordievsky in late 1985 that he was a member of the elite KGB special reserve-subsequently allowed to enter Australia, despite the federal Labor government being informed of his real status? Why did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-DFAT-push so hard for his entry and who were members of the influence network he built of senior Australian public servants? In particular, what were his relationships with very senior DFAT officers? What is the government hiding? What were the ramifications over time of ASIS officers being married to foreign nationals, including some cases where that foreigner had been an officer of a foreign intelligence service? This is an utterly extraordinary situation which would not have is been allowed in the American, British or other major western intelligence services. I also ask the government: what is really going on in ASIO? Have two Canberra-based Russian translators been forcibly retired in recent months, plus another individual used more ona consultancy basis? Is it true that the government preferred them to go quietly rather than have to take action against them? The public and this parliament are entitled to know. Has ASIO's entire phone system been replaced and are its computers being cleaned out because they may have been compromised by Russian intelligence? The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his government can no longer shield their mates from inspection and parliamentary scrutiny. What, I ask again, is this government hiding? An estimated $203.9 million is being spent on Australia's five intelIigence organisations in 1993-94, about 20 per cent more than the $168.7 million spent in 1991-92. In 1993-94, ASIO will cost an estimated $46.6 million and ASIS will cost $31.8 million. These are very significant amounts of public expenditure. The community properly expects value for money. It also cumber- wants answers from the government.",67
140,Mr FERGUSON,Unknown,"As I was indicating earlier, this particular program has in the past five years of its operation helped train over 200 people from eastern Europe. It involves bridging courses in English, updating computer skills, a graduate certificate in business administration and then eight weeks placement in Australian industry. It is interesting to see not only the diversity of the countries ·from which these people derive but also the diversity of industries and interests they have. It has ranged from running national lotteries, the Rega zoo, the glass industry, international trade, et cetera. . I am pleased to support the continuation of this program by the government. We are all aware of the reorganisation of industry that is occurring in many countries in eastern Europe. We are all aware of the difficulties within their educationalsystems, their funding problems, et cetera. This matter will be of particular interest to the significant number people of Ukrainian descent in my electorate. One matter of concern in the budget is the continuing decline in the amount of aid given to Africa. It is all right for - people to talk about the fact that, overall, there might be many millions more in Asia who are also in dire circumstances. But, indisputably,the circumstance in Africa is such that there is not a real comparison. Many of the countries in Asia that we speak of as having significant problems are those that are quite obviously on the vergeof a major economic upturn. One of those countries is Vietnam; this budget does show a major reorientation and emphasis on the Indochina region. . Between 1960 and 1989, Africa's share of global gross national product has dropped from the low level of 1.9 per cent to only 1.2 per cent. This budget's very minimal increase in aid to that continent, in the face of its monumental problems, is a questionable policy decision. More positive is the $100 million augmentation of non-government funding. In recent years we have seen increased questioning of the operation of the projects of international financial organisations. The honourable  earlier that we should perhaps question Australia's performance in this area. Quite frankly, we would not be the only one in that playing field. Internationally, in cases where a variety of banks have questioned the effectiveness of a country's programs, they have had recourse to outside reviews. They are showing that, perhaps too often, the governments of the day-in societies with very little pluralism or democracy-basically put those projects in directions that are not necessarily for the good of the general population, and that our aid program is basically aiding an infrastructure of corruption and nepotism. What we are doing in this country by reinforcing the NGOs means that there will be an oversight of programs overseas. That will facilitate the strengthening ofNGOs in other countries. It will ensure that the emphasis is not all the time on major capital construction, which has very little value to people. Thousands of farmers are forced off their landjust of because some engineer thinks it is a great idea to build a dam. I congratulate the government for the new rural development program in East Timor. It is necessary that Australia places a degree of emphasis not only on the wider impoverished eastern region but more particularly on Timor. It is important that we utilise this program not only to improve the living conditions of the Timorese but also to manage, through the presence of Australian aid officers, in some way to restrict the degree of human rights abuses by the Indonesian government in that province. (Time expired)",67
141,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"The House is addressing foreign affairs, trade and other related matters in respect of Appropriation Bill (No.1). In the time available to me I want to dwell briefly on trade, especially the export market development grants scheme. It was revealed in an Auditor-General's report that there was inadequate performance benchmarking of the export market development grants scheme. The government, as part of its current review of the export market development grant scheme, has a responsibility to sort that out quickly. The export market development grants scheme is an important scheme, but the Auditor-General's report indicates that it has been drifting in recent times. So it is that the outcome of the scheme has been inadequate. In more recent days there have been some broader criticisms of the scheme. We want to see an effective scheme which is .not in any way rorted or able to be rorted but which does supply real benefit and help to the small business operators and others that pick up on it. Related to that I make the additional point that it would seem that the export access scheme, which I think has some merit as well, is in many ways showing a clean pair of heels with regard to its performance. To cite one example, the venison producers of Victoria took up with the export access scheme last year and, as a consequence, they have had a 150 per cent increase in the success of their exports. This scheme is quite separate from Austrade and quite separate from the export market devel()pment grants scheme. I call on the government to expedite its review of the export market development grants scheme to provide a focus and to provide performance benchmarking, as calIed for in the Auditor-General's report. I would like to believe that the new Minister for Trade, Senator MCMulIan, might respond in the parliament on the outcome of the review of the EMDG scheme. There can be no complacency about the performance of our export assistance programs. I ask the question: how effective are they and how wise is the reliance placed upon them? The proposition advanced by the government that exports to the Asian region have been achieved by government and private sector efforts to improve Australia's share of these markets is simply wrong. Behind the gloss that the government paints over Australia's exports to Asia is the inescapable reality that, irrespective of the injectativestion of funding, we are losing ground as .an exporter to the region. We are losing market share, most notably to such places as Malaysia and Indonesia. While Australia's regional exports are increasing, largely as a consequence of the phenomenal economic growth experienced by the east Asian economic tigers, they are not growing fast enough to keep pace with the markets at which they are aimed. Furthermore, Australia is significantly outpaced by many of our competitors in those markets in which we. have managed to improve our market share. For example, the three Chinas and South Korea more than doubled their share of the Singapore import market last year, as did Japan and others. In Thailand, South Korea more than doubled its market share, while the Chinese economies and Japan also registered an increase in market share. Overall Australia's share of the east Asia import market a- a whole declined from 4 per cent in the early 1980s to 3.5 per cent by 1992. The implication of these outcomes is that we are failing to effectively integrate with the region. Sure, there is some effort. Sure, the Northern Territory government and others are putting a real practical edge to that linkage with Asia. But, when we look at the market share dimension, are we really holding our ground in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand? The truth of the matter is that we are being outwitted; competitors are gaining market share at our expense; and our market share is declining. That is why it is necessary that we see absolute performance benchmarking and real outcome from the programs of export assistance provided by the government, including, most notably, the export market development grants sc.heme-the subject of some provision with regard to the budgetary legislation before the House at this time.",68
142,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"In the time available to me to comment on the Foreign Affairs estimates, I wish to take the liberty of speaking about the recent elections in South Africa, where I had the great pleasure to be one of the Commonwealth represenMr Tim Fischer-And a good representative.",69
143,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"I thank the Leader of the National Party for his comment. It was a great pleasure to be one of the Commonwealth representatives-the only member of this parliament-and to playa role in that very historic campaign. It was quite time consuming in the sense that it took one month. We were established there over a period of time, first in Johannesburg and, in my case, later in Cape Town and Crossroads in particular where the 60 or so members who were the principal members of the Commonwealth party had the opportunity to witness the whole of the campaign. We reported, and reported favourably, on the election. I would take this opportunity to inform the House of some of the conclusions reached by the Commonwealth Observer Group, because it is important to understand the context in which the South African election was conducted. Even in the best of circumstances, the deadlines set for the election were going to create enormous and monumental tasks for the Independent Electoral Commission that was set up to conduct the election and to deliver the goods. It was only set up in December 1993 and it had a very short time frame in which to operate. It was challenged even more so when changes were made to require separate ballot papers for the national and provincial elections, and later the participation of the Inkatha Freedom Party. There was no roll. People did not even know the size of the population. People were free to vote anywhere in the country. Against the context of· those enormous logistical difficulties, it had to run a campaign. It had had no previous experience in voting. It had to conduct voter education programs, to introduce people who were unfamiliar with elections to the concept. It had to put in place arrangements to issue valid identity documents. It had to appoint staff who, in many cases, had no substantial administrative experience to represent the whole of the population. The campaign was one in which there were expected tensions. They were eased considerably as a result of the inclusion of the Inkatha Freedom Party. But, tragically, some bombings and shootings occurred during the time. I was there. There were some concerns about the elections, concerns about the way in which the poll was conducted in particular places, given the difficulties about which I have spoken. The commission was not able to provide proper security for all of the electoral materials that were important to the conduct of the campaign. Regulations and procedures changed so rapidly that a lot of procedures were improperly carried out, even in relation to the elections themselves. There were numerous reports of irregularities, and our report details those. There were problems in the counting of the ballot and the transport and storage of ballot papers. But we have to judge the performance against the difficulties experienced in conducting this particular campaign. For· the majority of South Africans, the election was more than the exercise of a democratic choice; it was a particularly unique opportunity for the first time for most of them to be able to do what we take so much for granted. And, of coilrse, it meant the demise of the apartheid system. In a news release dated 3 May 1994, we state: In the final analysis, the elections represented a free and clear expression of the will of the South African people. The outcome was the result of a credible democratic process which was substantially fair. We go on to ·state: We do not believe that abuses were widespread or had a determinative impact on the overall result. We are confident that the new South African Government will want to reinforce impartial and independent mechanisms for analysing these difficulties in preparing for the next elections. In nurturing the culture of democracy, there is much to say in favour of maintaining a mechanism for organising and conducting future elections which are perceiVed to be impartial and independent of government structures. Hopefully, South Africa will follow up on some of those recommendations. It was an important opportunity and an occasion on which I was proud to represent this Australian parliament.",69
144,Mr FILING,Unknown,"I commend the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) on his courage in participating in that particular observers team. At the time he left, it was quite clear that there was an inherent sense of danger in his participation in that particular exercise. I suppose that one could well say that one could have expected anything during that process, particularly as we saw at the beginning of the election campaign that continuing source of friction between the rival supporters of Inkatha and the ANC. So I commend the honourable member for Berowra for his courage in participating as one of that very important historical team that supervised the recent first general election held in South Africa. I too visited an area which was of concern to many of us and which, of course, as a result of Appropriation Bill (No.1), is a recipient-indirectly, I suppose-of taxpayers' money; that is, Bosnia-Herzegovina. In October last year, I travelled for the third to the region,but for the second time. to Sarajevo, the capital, and Bosnia-Herzegovina on a fact-finding. tour. This time. I was in company with other parliamentarians: Congressman Frank MCCloskey from the US Congress; a team from the House of Commons; members of the Italian and Jordanian parliaments; and two members of the Malaysian parliament. In the brief time available to me this evening, I want to voice my concerns about the way in which our party was treated by the United Nations, particularly UNPROFOR, the UN protection force, which of course is responsible and has a mandate for the protection of UN supplies and also has a mandate in relation to the pink zones in Croatia, the areas that are currently in dispute· between Croatia and the Serbian minorities. But our particular complaint, resulting from a few days that we spent visiting BosniaHerzegovina, was that the United Nations took a peculiar approach to our visit-a visit about which the UN had been forewarned. In fact, there had been reasonably high level negotiations in Washington arid New York prior to the departure of our international delegation to Frankfurt. In the first instance, we were supposed to have flown from Wiesbaden to Sarajevo direct with the United States Air Force in one of its supply aircraft. As it turned out, we arrived in Frankfurt and found that that had fallen through. We all had to go to Zagreb in Croatia. In Croatia we then had to negotiate with UNPROFOR to allow us to go to conduct our visit. That visit, I might add, was, in fact, at the behest of the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In fact, we were invited by the legitimate, elected government of that independent nation, which is recognised by the United Nations. What happened was almost a comedy of errors. We found ourselves in a continuous series of meetings negotiating in an attempt to. get permission for more and more people to go: We had a party of around about 20 people overall. In the first instance, the UNPROFOR administration would only allow two to go. We had the somewhat unsavoury time experience of sitting down and trying to decide who, of all the people who had travelled from all around the world to be part of what we considered to be a significant international delegation, would go to BosniaHerzegovina. This wasat a time, I might add, when there was considerable international pressure, not the least from the Secretary General of the United Nations but also from Bosnia-Herzegovina's government, to accept peace negotiations which would have led to partition and ca.ntonisation-the very same result that had been rejected at the London conference the year before by a combination of the then Secretary-General of the United Nations and John Major, who at the time was chairing the conference on behalf of the European Community. So we had the situation where we were in Zagreb, Croatia, trying to ensure that we could travel to Sarajevo the next day. Unfortunately, we were left negotiating until the lith hour, when it became clear on Monday morning, after negotiating all day Sunday, that we would be allowed to go. The United Nations is becoming a law unto itself. It is an organisation that is a colossal bureaucracy and, in this particular instance, it had the status of a third party. In fact, it was applying pressure on its own behalf to the legitimate government of Bosnia-Herzegovina. (TIme expired)",70
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Rocher)Order! No other member having risen, I call the honourable member for Moore.",71
146,Mr FILING,Unknown,"I suppose the real point of all of this is that we saw first-hand exactly how the politics of emergency or relief supplies was being used. At the very same time that we visited Sarajevo, the government of BosniaHerzegovina was faced with somewhat of a dilemma. At the time, a section to the north-west of the nation was effectively acting independently of the government of the country. This particular section was led by a local politician who was able to negotiate separately with the United Nations, as alleged by the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to provide food supplies to the population in the area. You do not have to be Albert Einstein to work out the enormous power that represents to those who might use that mischievously or to try to overstep the original intent of their mandate. In effect, it means that organisations, such asUNPROFOR, or UNPROFOR and UNHCR in tandem, could be used to lever a result; that is, the unwilling acceptance of this peace plan by the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina on the basis that it was having problems controlling its own territory because of actions relating to relief supplies. That to me was a very significant danger because here was a government with its own self-determinant",71
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Rocher)Order! The time allotted for the proposed expenditure now before the House has expired. The question is that the proposed expenditure for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Department of Industry, SCience and Technology Proposed expenditure, $1,424,614,000.",72
148,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"It is unfortunate that this government has no industry policy and that it has negative attitudes towards science and technology. If there was ever a nation-stuck down here as we are in the bottom of the Pacific all out on our own-that needed to have developed industry to support the excellent productive capacities of its mines, farms and all its commodities which it has freely exported to the rest of the world for 'avery long time, it is Australia. It is a shame that this government has not developed an industry policy. If the government had an industry policy, I think it would fall under the title of slash and bum. Honourable members will recall that under the Whitlam regime we had an overnight instant cut to tariffs of 25 per cent across the board. A great number of companies disappeared into the sunset never to reappear and other major manufacturing companies in Australia never recovered from the WhitIam escapades. Labor's approach to the problems generated by tariffs is simply to cut tariffs. Why do tariffs occur in the first place? They occur because some governments and industry thought that we .needed a mixed economy, that we needed to base Australia's economic foundations on more than just commodities, although those commodities have provided the wealth of the nation. Some of the income from the commodities was diverted into tariffs to protect an emerging manufacturing sector in Australia, so that some industries on our . own shores could, albeit with a small population, manufacture and supply a reasonable percentage of Australia's needs. The Hawke and now Keating Labor governments have progressively reduced tariffs to industry. Unfortunately, with the exception of the automotive industry and minor concessions to the clothing, textiles and footwear industry, it has provided little cost relief in return. Instead of deregulating the labour market first, it deregulated the financial markets and the industry market by immediately cutting tariffs and leaving a cosseted, structured and more or less centralised labour market. This government, not understanding industry and the mentality of those scientists, technologists and engineers who might design and develop products that the Australian population might consume, has cut the foundation upon which they existed. ' There is no doubt that behind that tariff wall we built up some very inefficient manufacturing practices, rotten quality and very poor, if any, marketing techniques in terms of developing marketing for those products which we made, which we might have sold to the rest of the world. It is true, in a sense, that we need government, in combination with industry, to develop an industry policy that will work. If we do not, the day has almost passed when we will be able to survive as a mixed economic nation. We are faced with the growing tigers in South-East Asia. We - re faced with the undeveloped world becommg developed and if we are to have a share of their markets it is long past the time that we started to develop industry. This year's budget contains some measures associated with the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology into government purchasing. While the government has picked up some of the initiatives of that report, it has failed to accept the major impedraw tus, the major recommendation, the major thrust of the report itself which simply was that, if cost, quality and service are equal between an Australian good or service and an overseas good or service, the government will always buy Australian, and it will use its own purchasing practice of spending over $10 billion a year to help develop Australian industry.

149,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,Unknown,"I support the appropriations for the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. In the short time available to me I will make some comments in respect of the extraordinary contribution by the previous speaker, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who displayed two things: firstly, that he has not looked at the appropriations the department; and, secondly, that he has obviously not read the white paper, Working Nation. He has also obviously not heard the views of his party president and members of the Liberal Party opposite who have endorsed wholeheartedly the industry policy which this government has adopted over the last 10 years. A cursory glance of Budget Paper No. 2 under the entry for the Department of Indusand try, Science and Technology gives us some indication as to the flavour of the policies adopted by this government. We find entries such as the industry innovation program, cooperative research centres, information nology . development program, assistance to the pharmaceutical industry-that is under factor F-investment promotion facilitation programs, agrifood industry programs and a whole series of entries to relevant departtrade. ments, including the CSIRO where we see a commitment in Working Nation to increased· funding of $34 million over the next four years. They are the sorts of entries which reflect the commitment that this government has had to ensuring that our industries are internationally competitive, that we have a commitment to developing good Australian ideas and a commitment to trading our way in the world. That is reflected by the Working Nation statement itself. It is interesting, I think, to attention to the success that we have had in the exporting area. Page 55 of Working Nation states: Services exports have sustained real growth rates of over 8 per cent on average from 1983 to 1993 . . . Export propensity in manufacturing rose from 14 per cent to 24 per cent between 1982-83 and 1992-93. Australian exports of elaborately transformed manufactured goods grew at an annual rate of 17.3 per cent from 1984 to 1992-an export growth performance which places us in the top league of countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ... In 1983, East Asian market economies accounted for 30 per cent of Australian manufactured exports. By 1992, these· economies accounted for almost half these exports. That reflects the success that we have had in trying to tum Australia into a modem, industrial trading nation. It stands in stark contrast to the sorts of policies which those opposite to adopted over their period in office when they basically wanted Australia to rely upon commodity prices and be on that rollercoaster. Some of the initiatives in the Working Nation statement are worthy of drawing attention to. The initiatives in the industry policy area which reflect the government's commitment to maximising economic growth include improved access to finance for small medium sized enterprises, substantial improvement to the research and development 150 per cent tax concession; major improvements in the prospect of small and medium sized enterprises commercialising good ideas, techremoval of on-costs and administrative burdens from small and medium sized enterprises by the removal of the training guarantee levy; improvements to government purchasing policy and further facilitation of export and I cannot let the previous contribution of the honourable member go without drawing his attention to matters which the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), has had to say. On the day after the release of the Working Nation white paper, the honourable member for Wentworth was reported in the Australian as saying that he lamented the fact that there was nothing new on industry policy in the statement. The honourable member for Wentworth is now the opposition's industry spokesman. I am sure it has sent shock waves through industry that the visiting professor has returned to the scene of the crime with zero tariffs. The previous speaker ·lamented the government's tariff policy without mentioning that those opposite are committed to zero tariffs, which we on this side' are not. If is interesting to refer to what the Liberal Party has said about industry policy. I refer the House to comments made by Mr Staley, the President of the Liberal Party, as reported in the Australian Financial Review on 5 January under the heading 'Lib president rejects economic rationalism'. Mr Staley is reported as saying: . ""To be - hint, we would not be seeing the present growth in manufactured exportS if the Federal Government had butted out of its responsibilities for the development of industry policies."" ""Industries in which this is evident are the car industry, computer exports, exports of hardware systems in the telecommunications area and the chemical industry."" At the same time, the former shadow spokesman for industry, my colleague from Western Australia the honourable member for Forrest (MrProsser), is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald as saying: ""1 think what Tony Staley was saying was that the Government had been 'you beaut' in industry policy .. , That is what those of us on this side of the House think, that is what the former shadow spokesman for industry has said and that is what the Liberal Party president, who personally helped manipulate the recent change in leadership of the Liberal Party, thinks. The record of the government and its parliamentary commitment to the development of industry are certainly reflected by these facts and these statements. (TIme expired)",73
150,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"'-I wish to take note of the spending on the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO,>which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has rightly described as 'a great national icon'. At the last election the government promised an additional $214 million for science and technology. The government not only has not delivered on that promise but also is trying to cut a very substantial $15 million a year in effective funding out of the CSIRO. The main budget allocation of $423 million is much the same this year as last year but, because of the reduction in a special grant of $50 million a year, which was instituted in 1989 for five years, the Chief Executive of the CSIRO, John Stocker, believes that there is. an effective $15 miIlionreduction. As a result of the misdirected cuts from which the CSIRO is suffering, this national icon is about to close numerous research facilities and shed several hundred staff. The most affected areas are animal and plant production and the wool technology section. In the Institute of Plant Production and Processing alone, seven field stations and four research centres are slated to be sold off and closed down. In the past three years we have seen savage and cuts in CSIRO support for agricultural .research. The chief agricultural divisions have in the last three years lost something like 250 jobs. In the remaining 35 divisions much the same job shedding has taken place. Agricultural research has had to bear the brunt of these misdirected cuts. It is not surprising that the good unionists in the CSIRO are in revolt against the 'policies of this government. In response, the government has tried a dose of good old-fashioned Stalinism. The government has tried to prevent CSIRO staff from meeting with coalition and Australian Democrat MPs except in the presence of a minder from the minister's office. This is reminiscent of the bId in-tourist approach to travelling around the Soviet Union. You could meet anyone you liked provided there was a KGB minder to eavesdrop on the conversation. That is the approach that this government adopts with the union members who are part of the CSIRO staff rightly prot-sting against these misdirected cuts. These staff members are doing the right thing by the nation in protesting cuts not by going on strike but by staging a work-in. Last Thursday night 400 staff at a number of CSIRO research facilities in several states staged a 24-hour wor-k-in. If it is necessary to save money in CSIRO, the way to do it is not by cutting valuable research but by cutting down on corporate services. The two CSIRO headquarters could be rationalised. There is no need have headquarters in both Melbourne and Canberra'-surely one would suffice. What we are seeing at the moment in the CSIRO is misguided managerialism-that is to say, the organisation is constantly being shaken up and shaken out-but the result is more manachieved agers and fewer workers. This is typical of the approach of this government. When a former science minister was told some years ago about the excellent science programs on the ABC- his response - are many. was, 'I reckon Rock Arena is better.' That is the sort of man that this government appointed as minister for science. It is no wonder that Australia is losing its traditional strengths. Last year when the Africans wanted someone to advise them on growing gum opposition trees they did not come to Australia; they went to Finland. That is the equivalent of asking the Egyptians and not the Eskimos to advise on ice production. These misdirected cuts in CSIRO funding are absolutely no at all to produce a clever country.",74
151,Mr LINDSAY,Unknown,"Herbert-Parliamentary would Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (5.46 p.m.)-To make serious contribution to the consideration the appropriations, let me state foremost that the industry, science and technology portfolio is virtually the engine room of government. It is one of the most vital areas of government. The portfolio appropriwhat ations for the financial year 1994-95 of $2.76 billion support the activities of the science agencies, the Australian Industrial Property Organisation, the Textile, Clothing and Footstand wear Development Authority, the Australian Manufacturing Council, Customs,· national standards, anti-dumping as well as the department's activities. The portfolio employs 14,000 people primarily in the science agenagain-t these cies and Customs. The government has challenged the Department of Industry, Science and Technology to play a pivotal role in the micro-economic reform process that has transformed the the Australian economy. What has Labor done out during the time it has been in government? its We now have significant economic growth relative to other major industrialised countries. to We have industrial harmony, historically low interest rates,a very competitive investment regime, low labour costs and historically low inflation, company balance sheets which have substantially improved and a very competitive business taxation regime. The government has tariff reform, corporate tax reform, micro-economic reform, dumping reform and various industry sector policies with respect to steel, textile, clothing and footwear, automobiles, aerospace, bounty support and industry development programs of which there The transformation of the Australian economy has bewildered the opposition, as evidenced by the contributions of opposition members in this debate. What would the do? Its policy-it has not yet been finally repudiated-would flatten the manufacturing sector with zero tariffs. The opposition would abandon workers in this sector. It would also destroy labour relations. We only way have to listen to the shadow spokesman on industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), to know what he do to industrial relations in this country. During the last election campaign those a opposite advocated a base wage of $3 or of $3.50 an hour depending on the age of the first and person concerned.",75
152,Mr COBB,Unknown,What are you advocating now?,75
153,Mr LINDSAY,Unknown,"Why do you not listen to your own shadow industrial relations spokesman has to say? This is the claptrap that we hear from the opposition time and time again. The people of Australia underthe opposition very well. The opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), in a media release dated 3 June 1994, worried about the rise in Australia's lending overseas .. Further on in the media release he worried about the level of overseas lending to Australia.. An article by Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald on 4 June 1994 stated: So what's left is ours. And the value of our wealth in June 1993 is almost four times what it was in June 1980. . In the time that our foreign debt has risen from virtually nothing to about $164 billion, the' value our net private wealth (after allowing for the foreign debt) has risen from $420 billion to $1,570 billion dollars. We're getting deeper in debt every month but, even so, we're getting wealthier every month. We've got a problem, but all is not lost. Australia is lending overseas and Australia is borrowing overseas. These are issues which will always continue in a free market· economy. The internationalisation of the Australian economy is an issue which will stay with us, and so it should,but appears to be a mystery to certain elements of the opposition. The department's work in support of the government's tariff reform and industry programs, as I have said, has improved productivity and raised export competitiveness. In 1993, for example, manufactured exports grew by 7.3 per cent. There area number of initiatives in the budget concerning industry policy. These are setting the fundamental parameters against which Australia's industry is growing at a very rapid rate. We should never overlook the fact that Australia's gross domestic- product is just under the combined GDPs of the ASEAN countries. On all of the indices with respect to the Australian economy we are leading the rest of the world. This is an issue on which the opposition should show pride in our accomplishments afld not come into this chamber denigrating at every opportunity the accomplishments of the government.

154,Mr COBB,Unknown,"I echo some of the sentiments expressed by my colleague the honollrable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) and also some of the concerns of my constituents in the electorate of Parkes by commenting on the cuts the government is making to the CSIRO. It was not all that many years ago that the government was trumpeting terms like 'the clever country'. I think the reality today is that any real chance of a recovery is being held back because we are being run by a dumb government. We are seeing on projections that the CSIRO, which has already been cut back,· will have about $20 million a year wiped off its budget over the next three years. In particular, of the Institute of Animal Production and Processing and the Institute of Plant Production and Processing, two of the most vital divisions in the CSIRO, are going to take more than their fair share of these cuts. These two areas alone employ 47 per cent of CSIRO's staff. On projections so far, there is going to be a net loss of 138 positions, including three research scientists, and to some extent 21 scientists. What alarms me. just as much is that of the 27 .research sites the CSIRO has, 10 are to be sold, indudingsome which have been purchased wholly or in part by wool growers' levy funds. On top of this we are going to see some areas transferred. For example, the Division of Wool Technology at Ryde is apparently going to be moved to Geelong. From what has been said so far, we will lose possibly 90 per cent or more of the scientists there because they are refusing, understandably, to move to Geelong. I will list some of the properties that the CSIRO has purchased with grants from wool funds. At Armidale, New South Wales, we have the Arding Field Station, 325 hectares; the Chiswick Field Station and Research Laboratory, 1,512 hectares; and the Longford Field Station,· 974 hectares. At Prospect in Sydney we have the Ian Clunies Ross Animal Research Laboratory, 57 hectares; at Ryde, the Division of Wool Technology, IVz hectares; at Belmont in Geelong, Victoria, the Division of Wool Technology; 63 hecta:res; at Deniliquin, New South Wales, the Faulkner Memorial Field Station; 2,499hectares; at O'Halloran Hill, South Australia; the Glenthorne Field Station, 75 hectares; and at Baker's Hill, Western Australia, the Yalanbee experimental station, 840 hectares. These were all purchased by wool levy funds: I remind, the government that the wool industry has been particularly hard hit and it appears that at least half the cuts are going to fall on the divisions of wool technology; the divisions of animal production and the division of animal health. The losses are going to be particularly 'great. Rural going to suffer very much. Already since 1991-92 we have had a reduction of 400 staff in the CSIRO overall. Two hundred and forty-three of those 400 have fallen in the Institute of Animal Production and Processing and in the Institute of Plant Production and Processing, 61 per cent of the total retrenchments. It is going to be a double whammy for rural industry. Its funds and resources are falling because rural R&D organisations' contributions are falling off due to the fact that the quantity of wool in this country has fallen and the government contributions have falIen also. Aside from this we have had wool promotion funding by this government slashed from $20 million last year to zero and the exceptional circumstances funding for hard hit wool growers, such as in the electorate of Parkes, is to be terminated totally from 30 June this year. Research and development organisations are becoming disillusioned with the government's handling of CSIRO and will be channelling their funds' elsewhere, into universities and state departments of agriculture"" more than they are now. The government is treating CSIRO in a cavalier and high-handed fashion, not realising the great returns it gets for the taxpayers' dollar that is put in there. The government should be condemned for this. (Time expired)",76
155,Mr LINDSAY,Unknown,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (5.56p.m.)-Two opposition members have raised the issue of the CSIRO. The CSIRO has released a set of proposals which are designed to position itself to provide long-term· sustainable support for its animal, food and fibre industries. Under these proposals the CSIRO will maintain its research effort in the face of the effect of the rural industry downturn, particularly in the wool sector. It will be consolidating from 27 to 17 sites, cutting overheads and administrative costs and freeing resources for research. The CSIRO still devotes about 40 per cent of its budget to agricultural research. This exceeds the rural sector's share of the Australian economy and of Australia's exports and reflects the CSIRO's firm commitment to the research overall is rural sector. Another important point to make is that the CSIRO formally assesses its priorities every three years. This involves a comprehensive assessment of the feasibility of research in the different industry sectors as well as the potential benefit to Australia. Its extensive network of advisory committees are drawn on in this process. Final judgments are made by the CSIRO board based on recommendations drawn up by the chief executive in consultation with the directors of CSIRO's six institutes. Two of these institutes are dedicated to agriculture as are parts of other institutes. I add that the CSIRO board also includes representation from the rural sector. One of the reasons for a lot of the alIeged concerns being expressed by opposition members is that there have been changing industry research priorities and We must have regard to the current downturn of the wool research funding. There has been a downturn. Some of the sites and facilities covered by the current restructure, such as the Ryde site, were partly funded from levies on wool growers to support research. But the CSIRO holds legal title over these sites and these facilities are affected by the restructure. The CSIRO plans a number of major site changes. It is important to place on the record what they are. First is the relocation of the Division of Animal Health's Parkville laboratory into the Australian Animal Health Laboratory of Geelong. Geelong will become a major centre for wool research. Secondly, there is the disposal of the Ryde, Sydney, site of the Division of Wool Technology, consolidating wool textile research at Geelong. There is also the disposal of the Division of Tropical Animal Production's Long Pocket site in Brisbane with relocation of activities to St Lucia; that is, to the Division of Tropical Crops and Pastures site on the University of Queensland campus and to the division's site at Rockhampton-a major research facility. There is also reduced investment in poultry production facilities in Sydney in the Division of Animal Production, including closure of the poultry research laboratories on the North Ryde site. Again, there has been a substantial drop in industry funding. There will be a more collaborative use of field stations in three states. There will also be the disposal some of the Division of Animal Nutrition pn the Glenthorne Adelaide site.",77
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Rocher)Order! The time allotted for the proposed expenditure now before the House has expired.

Department of Industrial Relations Proposed expenditure, $161,044,000.",78
157,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"American Senator Kenneth Keating said of the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961: There is no avoiding shame by assigning blame. That is pretty stirring stuff when one considers that as politicians we should always remain responsible. Responsibility is an interesting concept in view of the many recent backflips of the senator's namesake and of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). Assigning blame is the key in that senator's statement and, as we review the recent statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Industrial Relations, we can refer to it as well. Is it interesting that, for every backflip and figures or results that are not to the level expected, the assigning of blame suddenly takes place by the government? No responsibility is ever taken. This no accountability attitude of the government is so clearly exposed by the continuing poor management of the Australian economy-a sort of put out a 'something nation' statement and hope the community gets it right. This government has got it wrong again with its Working Nation statement for it is short of one thing-the thing that all Australians would like the unemployed to have: a job. What has doomed the white paper is the IR bill introduced last year. It is quite absurd one month to pass laws that act as a disincentive to employment and then introduce a white paper that is supposed to reduce unemployment the next. The white paper addresses symptoms, not the causes. The large amounts of of money in this budget will be spent on training and are. not a substitute for a sound industrial relations policy that promotes the mutual interest of employers and employees. When it comes to explaining the contribution industrial relations reform will make to reducing unemployment, it has nothing to offer but flaccid and exaggerated rhetoric. This government of rhetoric speaks often of understanding the business community, but when one examines the backgrounds of those opposite we get a better understanding of where they are coming from on policy. Of the 108 Labor politicians currently in this parliament, we are blessed with 30 who have trade union connections-either having worked for the union or having been a delegate cum organ iser. Twenty-eight Labor colleagues on the other side were teachers, 15 come from a law background, eight come from the party, and only one has small business experience. I was. surprised when I checked the Parliamentary Handbook, because I would have thought with the rhetoric about industry that in the ministry there would be at least some experience in business. I was disappointed to learn that there is little business knowledge, not no hands-on experience and no understanding of how and where the money comes from. In that particular count, I did not include pig farmers, nor did I include sandwich shop owners. I should have because the recent sandwich shop fiasco was a good example of rhetoric gone crazy. A Labor industry minister asked an employee within his own business not to take wages until a profit was made. That is some sort of enterprise bargaining, I am sure, but it is totally opposite to government policy and so abhorrent to those on our side, for we are. from business and would never be so cruel and ruthless as to treat our employees in such a manner. But that is an example of how this government operates. The government does not actually believe the rhetoridt constantly tells the true believ.ers. Now we, have backflips from the minister concerning ,industrial relations legislation amendments-completely no responsibility. In this budget we see no opportunity for job growth-just continuing handouts. The community requires more than handouts; it really needs jobs. Like last year's budget-a no jobs budget-this particular budget does not provide any jobs.' A no jobs budget is a pretty poor indictment of a Labor government. This government should be ridiculed for its lack of action but plenty of rhetoric on this particular issue. Let us not forget the beginning of this particular' speech and the statement of US Senator Keating. He said that one cannot avoid shame by assigning blame. The sorry story is that 'the government· constantly assigns blame. In defence of its own policies, it continues to refer to other governments of long ago. The government is avoiding its own shame on this particular issue.",78

160,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"It gives me great pleasure to support the appropriations for the Department of Industrial Relations. This government has engaged in a very effective program of continuous industrial relations reform since 1983 .. Who would have thought 10 years ago that Australia would be engaging so actively in the workplace in enterprise bargaining? What we have seen in the last 10 years. are reforms out of the accord process,providing stability on wage outcomes in a very important atmosphere of cooperation with the trade union movement. We have seen award restructuring, producing simpler and more flexible awards. Also.since 1991 we have seen the introduction of enterprise bargaining and the opportunity for flexible arrangements in the workplace. . Just recently, the government introduced the training wage as a very important step towards greater flexibility in industrial relations. Ten years ago we would not have thought those things possible. They were not on the agenda. They were not part of the policies or thinking of the Fraser government when it left the treasury bench. That these reforms have produced sustainable benefits in the workplace, with wage restraint and reduced oncosts; so that in real terms it now costs eight per cent less per unit to employ than it did a decade ago. Australia has the fourth lowest on-costs in the OECD and the lowest number of industrial disputes in more than 40 years. Tangible benefits are the products of continuous industrial relations reform by this government. The opposition not only does not understand but also does not like trade unions. The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) 'cited the business background of honourable members opposite as an advantage. In industrial relations policy, it is a distinct disadvantage because people coming from the big end of town, out of big companies or off big properties, ,bring with them the values they exercised in their own business-that is, the values of old Australia in the workplace where trade unions are seen as the enemy instead of a partner in making the enterprise more productive. These business people think they are stepping down when they come into this parliament, but they step down to continue kicking the trade union movement. That is not a productive way in which to run policy or run industrial relations ih Australia in the 1990s. In question time today we had an example of the absurd and sinister honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) breathing all over the parliament his hatred of trade unions-typical of Liberal Party policy in the 1990s..",79
161,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I find the comment that the honourable member for Werriwa made about the honourable member for Goldstein offensive. He referred to my. colleague as 'absurd and sinister'. I ask that he withdraw that comment, as I think it is well outside the standing orders.",79
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I did hear the comment, and I think it appropriate for the honourable member to withdraw it.",79
163,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"He always strikes me that way when I look at him, but I am happy to withdraw the comment. I am sure through the remainder of the 1990s the government will engage in continuous industrial relations reform. If Australia is to remain a high wage nation, it can compete against low wage nations only through higher productivity. Australia's labour and capital productivity levels are about 10 per cent below the OECD average but they are improving. The purpose of industrial relations reform must be to lift productivity in the workplace. This will be achieved not through confrontation and disputation but by fostering a system which rewards enterprises and employees for their contribution to national income. Incentives, flexibility and gain sharing at an enterprise level are all important. Honourable members opposite would be well advised to read the green paper on employment and its conclusions about Australia's industrial relations system. It is not so much an issue of the rates of pay which result, but of the adversarial nature of the industrial relations system which those opposite left behind in 1983 and which this government is modifying through the enterprise bargaining agenda. Enterprise bargaining is all important in terms of producing a greater feeling of cooperation and shared interests in the workplace. The truth in the 1990s is that good trade unions go out of their way to increase the size of the cake in the workplace and to add to the productivity process. Good trade unions all over the country are engaging in enterprise bargaining arrangements that are more productive and flexible and are producing the sorts of gains that the government talks about in parliament every day. We will see a growth in enterprise agreements from the present 16 per cent of workers with ratified agreements and five per cent of workers with agreements not placed before the Industrial Relations Commission. We will see a growth in enterprise bargaining based on the principles of flexibility and productivity in the workplace. (TIme expired)",80
164,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"Some of the projects being funded in this budget under the Department of Industrial Relations are a tragedy. This government is a joke. This government's estimated expenditure on the International Labour Organisation is about $5 million. There is also an estimated expenditure of about half a million dollars for the implementation of ILO convention No. 156, which claims to be 'a convention concerning the equal opportunities and equal treatment for men and women workers, workers with family responsibilities'. They are noble words, but the hypocrisy of this Labor government is appalling. On the one hand, it claims to be the champion of a so-called indepeT1dent Australia while seeking to pursue the republican agenda of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at public expense on the other. But it should be noted that equal funding is not being given to the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, an organisation which enjoys the support of more than 60 per cent of Australians. On the other hand, Labor signs away our national sovereignty and independence by indiscriminately entering into a myriad of treaties, protocols and conventions. This makes a mockery of Labor's push for so called independence. The reality is that Australia is independent, but conventions, treaties and protocols purport to subject Australia to international obligations and, thus, a form of bondage. Conventions, treaties and protocols are signed and ratified without the consent of parliaments, the states or the Australian people. At the very least, conventions, treaties and protocols should only be entered· into subject to Australia's domestic constitutional arrangements. Unfortunately, it wide High Court interpretation of the external affairs power in the Australian constitution has enabled the Commonwealth to legislate in Australia to implement international obligations in areas that are traditionally matters for the states. This has virtually torn up the constitution and undermined our federal system. Other countries with a federal system of government enter into international instruments subject to a reservation in favour of maintaining the balance between the national 7 June 1994 and state, levels of government. Why does this governmtint not do likewise? I havd, a detailed question on notice in relation tdinternational treaties, conventions and protocols. I understand. that up to 2,000 international instruments have been entered into, mainly by Labor governments. These seriously erode our ability to control our own affairs. Let us return to ILO convention No. 156, article 4 of which states: With a view to creating effective equality of opportunity and treatment for men and women workers, all measures compatible with national conditions and possibilities shall be taken:a) to enable workers with family responsibilities exercise their right to free choice of employment; and b) to take account of their needs in terms and conditions of employment and in social security. Given the mess we are in after 11 years of Labor in Australia, workers with family responsibilities, like other Australians, have no jobs, so people cannot exercise a right to free choice of employment. Without jobs, there are no working conditions. It should be noted that, when an employer reads through the 11 articles of this convention, the temptation will be to avoid employing staff altogether. The so-called jobs recovery is a sham. This convention is only concerned with the rights of workers. It ignores the rights of employers in the same way that those rights are continually ignored by the Labor government. This Labor government's obsession with signing and ratifying international treaties is tying Australia's industrial laws to international laws created by the FLO. This means that our labour market is hostage to the deliberations of this unaccountable international organisation, many of whose members are countries which do not share our notion of democracy. This issue was discussed at some length in the House last year during the debate on the government's disastrous Industrial Relations Reform Bill. At the time, the coalition explained to the parliament the potential nightmare that employers would face under these types of conventions. Business will have to REPRESENTATIVES 1559 consider the hidden cost of hiring potential parents. What a nightmare that would be! The list of conditions that employers must adhere to goes on and on, enough to frighten off even the most benevolent boss. The introduction of ILO conventions into Australia's industrial relations system further threatens employment in this country. The more obstacles that one puts in the place of employment and the more disadvantages one puts in front of employers, the more difficult it is for employers to run their own businesses, and the less likely they are to put on extra staff. It also upsets the federal balance in our constitutional situation. Australia, with to one million people out of work, needs more real jobs. ILO conventions do not create jobs. They simply put up a barrier for employers, and more jobs will be lost. This convention also refers to ensuring equality of opportunity in the treatment of men and women workers, which is a laudable motive and a statement of high and lofty intent. But it is also a joke, considering the government's appalling record in this area. Figures released yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that, under this government, women's wages have fallen further behind those of men. This government's criminal waste of money in seeking to implement international conventions, treaties and protocols and funding the ILO effectively guts our nation's sovereignty and independence and means that, as Australians, we have an ever diminishing innuence over our future.

165,Mr LES SCOTT,Unknown,"Oxley) (6.16 p.m.)This afternoon we are speaking about the industrial relations aspects of the 1994-95 budget, contrary to what the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) just had to say. 'One would have thought that he would stick to the forms of the House and keep to the issue before us.",81

167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Nehl)What is your point of order?,81
168,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,The point of order is that what the honourable member for Oxley said is completely wrong. I stuck to what we are supposed to be talking about.,82
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of order. Please resume your seat.,82
170,Mr LES SCOTT,Unknown,"He is very sensitive. He ought to be, considering the record of those opposite in industrial relations and their attitude in this place over the last 10 or 12 years and certainly long before that. The honourable member was a member of the former National Party government in his state. He was a member of the National Party, but he jumped to the Liberal Party, which has a similar policy on industrial relations-and its policies are always pretty crook. We all know that the honourable member was a Joh man from way back. The industrial relations aspects of the budget are very important. They certainly have not received the media coverage that other areas of the budget have rightly received in the broader community. I welcome the opportunity this evening to make a few comments on the industrial relations aspects of the budget. The budget allocates a total of $356.5 million to the industrial relations portfolio in laws. 1994-95, which incidentally represents a fall of just on 7.4 per cent. It seems to contradict the occasional comments from the opposition that the government is attempting to set up a giant industrial relations bureaucracy that is intent on crushing small business. Nothing could be further from the truth. On the contrary, the industrial relations of the budget will provide some very real benefits for the business community. For example, funding of nearly $16 million will be provided for the work place reform and best practice program, which consists of the following two elements. Firstly, the best practice component will focus on small and medium-sized enterprises with the announcement in August of the successful applicants for initial project funding. Secondly, from 1 July, the workplace reform element will be refocused to promote the spread of enterprise bargaining. It will provide grants to enterprisinitiatives es seeking to include agreements. To ensure bargaining is an inclu,sive process, this program will offer assistance to those engaged in enterprise bargainjhg to deal with the needs of women and otheridisadvantaged groups. This is a very welconJe initiative. Women, particularly young \\fomen, now make upa significant proportion bf the work force, yet they are not equally represented on union executives, some notabl- exceptions notwithstanding. It also follows' on the heels of the welcome appointment 'of a distinguished woman, Justice Deirdre O'Connor, as president of our new Industrial Relations Court. In relation to that issue, in yesterday's media we saw that the wages ,of women are still not keeping pace with those of men. That is an area that obviously needs a lotof work. Some of the initiatives in the industrial relations portfolio share of the budget cover the Asia initiative. Funding of $20.0.,000. in 1994-95 and $300,0.0.0. in later years will be provided to assist Asian economies with the development of sound industrial relations practices. This funding will be spent on issues such as occupational health and safety education programs, labour law and administration, collective bargaining, strengthening tripartisan arrangements dispute settlement, labour inspections, child labour and minimum wages In 1994-95, funding of $20.0.,0.0.0. will be provided for Com tare Australia to assist in the implementation of nationally uniform occupational health and safety standards. There will be $334,0.0.0. provided for the Affirmative Action Agency to meet staffing arm costs associated with an increased workload. Of these funds, $100.,0.0.0. will be to upgrade the agency's information and technology system, and $75,0.00 will be for a project officer to assist with programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. Another very important area-as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, from your experience on the committees that you and I are involved in, particularly in the Aboriginal affairs area-is that there are major problems for Aboriginal and Islander people, particularly women, across the board. I welcome those in the budget. There is also $2 million to be provided for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and registry to meet costs in implementing refonns associated withithe Industrial Relations Refonn Act 1993. With the budget and the white paper, I think we can be very proud of what has happened in industrial relations. (TIme expired)",82
171,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"La Trobe) (6.21 p.m.)Earlier today the House of Representatives heard an incredible story of attempted intervention by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) in an industrial relations issue that relates to a report by the OECD which, amongst other things, commented unfavourably-at least according to the ACTU-on Australia's industrial relations record. It is a sad and sorry record. This government has done nothing whatsoever to help accelerate the pace of change, to give us more flexibility in the labour market, to allow firms to negotiate directly with their employees, and to give us a system that allows high wages and not just the low wage outcomes that we have had for 11 years under Labor. In the government's response today, denying the opposition the opportunity to fully debate this issue, in essence it was saying, 'If you don't like the truth, just get someone else to write it.' That is the view of history the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) takes. He comes into this place and other places and constantly attempts to rewrite Australian history in order to suit the purposes of the Australian Labor Party. The note to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training relating to the OECD report, which we heard about earlier today, went on to say that there is a labour market note for Australia being prepared by the OECD which is stilUn draft form. It said: The main policy issues raised in this Note are: that restructuring of awards and introduction of enterprise-based bargaining are steps in right direction, but progress has been slow; the need for a more flexible wages structure which better relates pay to skill and provides incentives for skill formation; the need to reduce the number of unions with which firms must negotiate to streamline work practices; that labour market regulation has been increasednot decreasedthrough tighter occupational, health and safety standards; equal opportunity legislation; and non-wage labour costs, including the Training Guarantee, Superannuation Guarantee and payroll tax that income support incentives need to be examined ... These are just some among a number of initiatives that the OECD will consider in its report on Australia later this year. The minute advised the minister that, whatever approach he decided to take in order to deal with the OECD so that it came to heel to the ACTU's limited view of what our industrial relations system is like-not the view of ordinary men and women in the working places of Australia,but the view of the Labor bureaucrats: ... there are a number of downside risks for the Australian Government: . the OECD report is likely to be critical of the speed of progress towards enterprise bargaining, and to give only restrained credit to the role of the Accord process as a facilitator for change. That is what the ACTU objected to. It has a view that the accord process has been manna from heaven for the industrial relations system in this· country, not the impediment to progress which all of us in the real world know that it has been. It goes on to say: . . . there is a danger that other labour market policies will also be criticised. The OECD may not take as fanciful and as positive a view of our labour market as does the ACTU and also, obviously, as does the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who is a former President of the ACTU and now a member of the executive government in 1\ustralia. The point is that we have had report after report after report that the criticises our industrial relations system. The government's own green paper, issued not more than three months ago, leading to the white paper on unemployment-not employment-criticised the pace of refonn and said that Australia was lagging behind and we needed to free up the labour market to give industry and business a chance to employ people. That is what it is all about; that is why we want industry-we want employment for Australians in Australia. The High Court is currently planning to hear a challenge from the state governments.

174,Mr COBB,Unknown,"Rarely has a minister heading a department got everybody so offside as has the present Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). He has antagonised everyone with his latest industrial relations bill, barely two months old as it is, The unions are offside with it. The employers are offside with it. Already the ACCI has been to Geneva to protest to the ILO. The states are offside. We have Victoria and New South Wales, at least, with a High Court challenge. We even have caucus brawling over the proposed changes that it will have to make to this bill. At a when we have 900,000 people in this country unemployed, including in excess of 300,000 long-term unemployed, with interest rates about to start edging up again between two per cent and four per cent over the. next 18 months, we have this mess in this area that should be travelling smoothly. The area of enterprise flexibility agreements is a classic case of where this government has botched things. We had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), quite some time ago now, saying that by mid-1993-that is, last yearover 50 per cent of federal workers would be covered by an enterprise flexibility agreement. The situation today is that we have had only one EFA ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission. We have had only four applications before it. The three others have been stalled. The one that has been ratified, IOF Modular Offices, a small furniture manufacturing· company in the ACT with about 20 employees, even had its enterprise flexibility agreement modified. It has now become a part-un ionised site. One of the other three was the WA Engineering Co. The union went in there and argued technicalities about the awards. That has been put on ice. Another one, Able Demolitions, which is it demolition contractor in' Victoria, wanted an EFA without unions, although it was unionised. It is now in limbo because of industrial trouble with the building unions. The other one that went forward for consideration was an· aiuminium manufacturing site in Queensland. It wanted anEFA. The unions wentin there. Now 25 per cent of the workers are unionised. Not only has this dismayed the employer; the site does 1)0t have its enterprise flexibility agreement. This provision whereby the unions can come in and look over the shoulders of the employers and mess up things is being demonstrated only too. graphically in .Australia today. The minister has to make changes in this area-not just in the area of unfair dismissals-if we are going to get proper enterprise agreements in this country. All it is doing is driving employers into other areas. They are setting up individual contracts with their workers. A classic case of this is CRA, time the mining giant. On its site in the Pilbara iron ore fields in Western Australia, so far 1,400 have signed individual contracts with their. employer to exclude the unions.",84

176,Mr MCLACHLAN,Unknown,"Barker) (6.31 p.m.)When we talk about the environment we should also talk about the natural infrastructure of the. country for, as we know, without infrastructure a country ceases to work and the natural 'infrastructure and the biodiversity of its natural ingredients slowly come to a halt. The expenditure as a whole for 1993-94 will be· $180 million for the environment, $115 million for meteorology and $59 million-odd for the Antarctic, which I found a pretty amazing figure. Let us say, however, that it is appropriate. What then becomes amazing is that it is a third of the total expenditure on the environment-that is, leaving out expenditure on Landcare, which comes under 'another departmental heading. So we are spending$7 billion-odd on social welfare and $180 million in the whole of the mainland of Australia on the environment. It is fairly obvious that we do not have much time, so I will deal with three areas only. The first one is the Daintree rescue package, which hinges on a matching dollar for dollar commitment by the Queensland Government. It was a three-year program, it was about cooperative management agreements, it was about selective purchase of privately owned blocks and it was about the declaration of nature refuges, but no money has been budgeted by Queensland. So it looks as though this item has failed before it has commenced. I notice that in the Senate today the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, said he was looking at a new program on tree plantinganother program that has not been implemented-with Ministers Crean and Collins, so obviously Queensland is being. rather difficult. On the subject of the national river health program, an amount of $10 million was allocated in December 1992 by the Prime Minister and set out to be expended, we all thought, this year-in the budget of last year, the current year. Suddenly, on Environment Day, there was an announcement that $6 million of that $10 million would be spent on the health of the river system in Australia and the other $4 million had not yet been aIlocated. Those are big programs, but of course they have not been implemented. I was pleased to see the accelerated drainage proposals for the Murchison-Echuca basin-an allocation of $6.2 million over three years-and for the Sunraysia-an allocation of $2.5 million over· the same period. However, I believe that the environment area of this budget is like so many of the things that have happened in this area over the last· few years-plenty of announcements, plenty of lead times, plenty of putting back the programs and a lot of failure. If we look at the individual areas within the environment portfolio and at the lack of success of the various Ministers, we find quite quickly that for much of this program it is simply a matter of eking out the expenditure, topping up a little bit here and there and trying to, if you like, deal with a matter that has been far too complicated for this Government. I think this government has been very successful at making glamorous noises about the environment but, in every area that you care to take in the corrective sense-that is, correcting the damage that we have done in the last 200 years-I think there is absolutely no doubt that this government has been a failure. You can see, as you go through the financial amounts, the doIlar amounts that come out, that there is a doIlarhere and a doIlar there, always late-in many cases it is simply to set up management plans-and very little of the money. gets through. (TIme expired)",85
177,Mr JENKINS,Unknown,"ldo not dispute the figures that the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) read out about expenditures as outlined in the appropriation bills and I welcome his interest in those figures. But many shadow ministers who come into this place thinking that they are doing the right thing by showing an interest in what is happening in the portfolio area that they have taken over control for the coalition parties often dispute the adequacy of the amount of moneys that are so allocated. I find that all very interesting. The coalition went to the last election very much on the basis that government outlays were to be reduced, slashed. Therefore, it is incumbent upon shadow ministers that when they enter debates such as this and express some disquiet about the total amounts that being allocated they try to indicate where they think the' additional funds can be sourced. I do not dispute that the honourable member for Barker does understand the need for this government to be involved in rehabilitathrough tion of the environment. I take what tonight as .being a true indication of the direction that he is coming from, but then went on to talk about the need for additional funding, or disputed the amount of funding that is put up. It is time that the coalition indicated where it would go for additional funding or what other aspects of government enterprise or government outlays it .would reduce to enable that to be the case. Perhaps it is time, within the Australian community, to look at the funding of our environmental programs. To do that might require our looking at some alternative sourare ces of funding. Of course, this budget does not go to that. But what I propose tonight the context of the comments that have been made is this: let us have that debate; let decide whether we can get a consensus of agreement across this chamber on some of the proposals that are often· thrown up, which would increase the income available and which could then be targeted to increase funding in a number of the areas where this budget already allocates money. I would be quite happy to do that. 1 would be quite happy to revisit reports, such as report of the standing committee on ment, and conservation entitled Fiscal measuresand the achievement of environmental objectives, which was produced back in 1986-many taxation issues were considered in detail in a number of industries that are involved in the use of the environment as resource-and discuss possible measures the increased funding that might be appropritechnologies. ate. Many measures of merit are involved in this year's budget. I want to touch on a few them. I want to touch on the boosted allocaregulatory tion of $3.1 million over the next four-years solutions. that will assist states to develop their management plans under our Ramsarconvention on wetlands. The fact that the responsibility for those wetlands is under that convention is are again an interesting quirk of the federal .system that we have because the wetlands rest within the control of the states and territories. The Commonwealth government is the signatory to the convention and is obliged to try to, its role, organise our efforts, and it he says requires this cooperative effort. The other point that I make to the honourhe able member for Barker is that, when we look at the resources that are available to us for overall environmental management, we have to look at the totality of the effort of all spheres of government in the wider community. If we see the record-(1ime expired)",85
178,Mr MCGAURAN,Unknown,"I wish to bring to the attention of honourable members the existence of an exciting initiative with respect to environmentally sustainable energy technology. There also important implications for regional development. As members' would be aware, in Australian companies are beginning to seriously address the opportunities arising in the us renewable energy sector. In the past, the low price of abundant energy in Australia has tended to restrain development of renewable energy industries as there has not obviously been the incentive to invest in these industries. Of course, solar energy is a proud exception to this rule, and the lucky combination of plenty of sun, long distances, remote communities and world-class scientists has the seen some stunning Australian achievements environand innovations in this field. As governments, industry and the electorate at large continue to' focus on environmental issues, this increased scrutiny is driving technological advances which improve renewable energy technologies. These improvements a in performance reduce the cost differential for between renewable and fossil fuel energy At the same time, more innovative solutioris to meet energy supply requirements are being considered, and governments of are being forced to confront the different and planning implications of these For the foreseeable future, renewable energy systems cannot nearly replace fossil fuel technologies for reasons of cost and practicalities, but an important niche market is developing which I strongly encourage Australian business to examine and enter. A case in point is biomass power generation. In this context, the term 'biomass' refers to wood and wood waste, sugar cane residue, cotton waste, rice hulls, food· crop· residues and municipal waste. The process of gasification of this fuel produces a variety of combustible gases which.can be used to produce electricfty. There is also the possibility for cogeneration at these sites; that is, producing electricithe ty and using the waste heat to drive an additional industrial process. This could be the kiln drying of hardwood for furniture uses or growing vegetables out of season in a hothouse. Due to the abundant supplies of suitable fuel available, biomass is potentially the largest source of renewable energy after hydro-electricity. In the United States, almost half of the country's renewable energy sources are based on biomass technologies. I am pleased to see that an Australian company is grasping the opportunity presented by biomass power generation to position itself firmly in the global market for this technology. The company is Tteelectric Gasification Systems, based in New South Wales. This company has the rights to a new process to produce combustible gases from biomass. The technology involved is a significant improvement on past attempts to harness this resource. In fact, there are strong indications that. this process will provide commercially viable energy generation, particularly at remote sites, wherever a suitable quantity of feed stock is available. Considerable interest in this process has already been shown by high profile companies, and I am pleased to note that Treelectric is focused on export opportunities to win itself a place in this niche market worldwide. The company has exactly the sort of dynamic, soundly based approach to developing innovative energy technologies which is required at this stage of the industry's development. In pursuing its market the company has been at pains to point out the implications of the project for reducing greenhouse gas· emissions and promoting regional development, which I am sure will be of interest to all members. While the development of the national electricity grid is obviously essential and will have many valuable benefits for Australians, there is no doubt that small-scale power generators using local materials are the way of the future for remote or relatively isolated areas. In the United States over 1,000 rural electrical cooperatives form avast network across continent. These cooperatives are very active in the local community and serve as a focus for regional development. This involves encouraging business development but also helping the community with individual housing and social needs. In thisway, the electricity cooperative pulls the community together and can develop the potential of the· whole community. The result is something akin to a combination of a shire council and a chamber of commerce, but on a: smaller scale. This means the focus of activity is proudly local and not diffused over a wide area, as sometimes may occur with the boundaries of shire councils. The link holding the cooperatives together is simply that they belong to the community and serve the community's needs accordingly. This would be a welcome development in any community, and I look forward to the day when companies such as Treelectric have provided the critical energy technology to enhance the viability of such schemes in Australia. (TIme expired) . Mr NEWELL (Richmond) (6.46 p.m.)-I am delighted to follow the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) in his discussion on what I will refer to as his Treelectric program. Both the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) indicated their agreement, in some ways, with the thrust of the government's policy towards, in this case, the environment. Sport and territories seem to be getting left behind tonight, as ltoo want to confine my remarks at this stage to the environment. The honourable member for Gippsland finished his remarks by making the comment that he is looking forward to the time when local .government and so forth can come together to provide a smaller, integrated and locally managed authority or package for the local community as a source of energy. It may surprise the honourable member for Gippsland but I too have in parts of my electorate organisations which are similarly working towards not the same thing as the honourable member for Gippsland has raised here tonight, quite correctly, but a hydropower type arrangement also very suitable for small communities. It is interesting that most of the proposals for these types of energy generation schemes are somewhat lost in the thrust to sell them suitable schemes in many overseas markets. This is regrettable, in the sense that there needs to be a sea change not just within this House-I recognise members see this-but within the Australian community in general. Some of these smaller locally established energy projects can work within many parts of Australia. I know there are one or two that already do that, but I still think the general acceptance is that these smaller locally orienmental tated energy projects are appropriate for the developing countries rather than for a developed country to latch onto. The Rainbow Power Co, which operates out of Nimbin, has developed a very efficient hydro-pulse generator with an adaptor to change direct current to AC. It is very suitable for houses. I.have sent a proposal to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) and also the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) for their departments to look at it again, despite my previous comments, with a view to it going into AIDAB and it possibly providing funds, because it is very suitable for small villages and small town sources of power. I again make the point that it would not hurt if there were a change in attitude across Australia, which I applaud, to a movement towards a national electricity grid. I know there is a general movement towards incorporating localised power schemes and generation schemes right across Australia. Be that as it may, there should be a greater awareness of the possibility of moving away from the large power schemes, the larger hydro-electric or coal-fired power stations, to having more of them being incorporated. While we are slowly moving towards that in our policies, there could be a greater and a faster shift. Having said that, I wish to raise the issue of the move towards the national standards for the environment. The National Environment Protection Council received funding in this budget with an allocation over two years of $1.8 million as the Commonwealth's contribution for setting up that particular council. It was endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments in February this year. I will be as delighted to see that get under way. I know that the state and territory governments, with one exception, as well as the Commonwealth government will be involved in that. The funding is for the establishment and running costs of the Environment Protection Council, which will essentially set up or develop national standards for the environment, particularly for air and water quality. The aim of that council is to ensure environequity for all Australians, regardless of where they live. I understand that legislation establishing it will be presented to parliament shortly. There has been some criticism of the NEPC-(TIme. expired)",86
179,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"As I studied the budget documents, I looked without much joy for the very effective community cultural, recreation and sporting grants program. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may recaIl the program as the infamous sports rorts program. You will recaIl that the House was presented with a report from the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts which unanimously backed the intent of the program and the wish for it to continue. But, alas, this was not to be the case and this very effective program has been jettisoned from the history of parliament. It was a shame because the program was supported by both sides of the House and it was only the incompetence of the minister concerned-which lead her to resign in disgrace early this year-that has' brought disrepute to this particular program. So the claims of pork-barrelling during the investigation may seem well founded, for, if the party of rhetoric were true to its values and wished to help the rapidly growing suburbs of our nation, it would have continued this program. But according to the budget papers, it has not. In my own electorate of Cowan suburbs like Marangaroo, Alexander Heights and Ballajura are fine examples of community motivated residents wishing to develop facilities for their own suburbs. It is truly a that the former member for Cowan ignored the importance of the principles of this fine program and made few representations to her own minister. An examination of records indicates a very low application rate, notwithstanding the very high amount of local groups within my area of Cowan. Mr Deputy Speaker, it would probably not surprise you to know that the Cowan electorate prior to the last election did not receive any funding at all in the last round of funding for this particular program-a terrible slight upon the former member for Cowan. The electorate of Cowan is rapidly expanding and it comprises young families who struggle with poor or no recreational facilities. I have a meeting later this week with senior citizens, play groups and community groups to discuss this matter and their needs, which have grown too great for facilities built some 18 months ago by the state government. These young families require the quality of life their parents had and they are being discriminated against compared with other suburbs closer to the city which were established some years ago. The party of rhetoric, the Labor Party-the party proclaiming social justice-is really being seen in the cynical way it should be: a party that cares about only one thing, and that is the trappings of power and holding on to it. I encourage the members opposite, especially those in the chamber at the moment, to lobby the appropriate minister and to seek the re-establishment of the funding of this particular program. Perhaps, cynically, I could suggest that the government bring on an early election so that we may see the re-introduction of another program similar iints generosity yet much better managed than the whiteboard management of the previous minister. What we need in the fast growing communities is facilities that promote community spirit. Funding of such programs is the answer to these needs, and I ask the government to reconsider its approach to such needs. Continually ignoring new communities will not go unnoticed by those who live there and they will, I am· sure, reflect their thoughts in the ballot box at the next election when they will tragedy be demanding greater representation. I look forward to the reconsideration of this particular funding program by the government. The greatness of our nation is shown not so much by the takers in our community as by the makers. This program really promotes that sort of concept. I encourage those opposite to speak to their minister and perhaps bring forward this particular program at the next budget.",88
180,Mr JENKINS,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker, I have returned to have a second go to speak on the community cultural recreation and sporting facilities program. The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) has caused me a problem in that I do not want my comments to be taken as being in support of what he said. First of all, I dissociate myself from his rhetoric about the former member for Cowan, the minister and a few others that he mentioned. I came into the chamber to express my disappointment that that program was, I think, a glaring omission from this year's budget. In any consideration of a future program of that ilk the Commonwealth should step back and reassess the areas in which it is best suited to have an involvement. In the parliament before last the Banking, Finance and Public Administration Committee undertook a couple of inquiries into sports funding. One of the recommendations put to government was that the Commonwealth government naturally had a role in the funding of sport at an elite level. I do not think there is a great deal of dispute about that. There may be an ongoing discussion about the balance between the funding for elite sports levels and the funding at other levels. A suggestion contained in one of the committee's reports was the precursor to the program that the honourable member for Cowan has mentioned. I think it may have been envisaged by the committee that these projects should be more of a regional nature. It is a matter of trying to provide worthwhile community projects, but providing them at a level that is appropriate for Commonwealth involvement. I could give an example of the city of Whittlesea in my region. That city has put together an international athletics track. The funding for that work was under the local government capital works program out of One Nation. That municipality for the northern suburbs of Melbourne has put together an athletics facility that is quite a number of notches above what is just required by the local community. The Commonwealth could perhaps rethink the overall program and look at providing facilities at that level. I know would be difficult to make definitions about the type of facility that the Commonwealth should be involved in. But we have this breathing space. There seems to be agreement across the chamber that the program was worthwhile. The debate should be seen as a bit more than a lobbying exercise. We have a chance to have a rethink about the nature of that program. I am on the record on a number of occasions as saying that I thought that that program was quite worthwhile. The other matter I just want to briefly touch upon-I am not sure whether it is the light or the clock that is going to beat me-is the funding towards the Omega navigation station. I suppose I am of a generation that is quite intrigued to be coming into this place to speak on the merit of retaining an interest in Omega. During my university days it seemed to be one of those objects of protest because it had connotations of our unholy alliance with the United States government, but I am pleased that it· now has a mor- peaceful operation through supporting our meteorological bureau and in giving worthwhile advice, especially to the smaller nations of our region. I am pleased to see that we are continuing the funding for same.(1ime expired)",89

Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Proposed expenditure, $405,151 ,000.",90
182,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"Berowra) (7.01 p.m.)Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. In addressing these estimates, I simply want to make some brief observations about the immigration program which was a major aspect of the commentary that was given in relation to the same estimates in another place. But I want to observe that it is always of great disappointment to me that in the Senate our colleagues have the opportunity, through the estimate committee system, to be . it able to devote a good deal of time to examining the way in which public funds are to be spent and to test matters of accountability. In this place we are limited to a mere five minutes. In the context of the size of the program and the large range of issues that ought to be covered, it is extraordinarily disappointing to me. I want to take up a number of points that were addressed in the Senate. One of the first matters raised was in relation to the disabled people's international conference to be held this year. But in the context of the discussion that was taking place, reference was made to health criteria and their application to people who might be entering Australia as v-sitors, as well as those who enter Australia permanently. It brought to light a point which r find considerably embarrassing-and I imagine that the government ought to find embarrassing-that the report of the House of Representatives committee in relation to health criteria in particular issti1l outstanding. I find it extraordinary that a report of such major consequence, which could lend considerable assistance to the government in dealing with a large number of difficult issues, remains outstanding, particularly as the chairman of the committee who dealt with that matter is one of the government's parliamentary secretaries in one of the departments that ought to be in concert with the Department of Immi.., gration and Ethnic Affairs ensuring that this matter can be dealt with promptly. It is hot the first time. I have raised this matter, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous) has been known to stand up in high dudgeon-and I might get a second chance to have a go at him today, which is different from what has been the case before-'-to defend the record. But I think it is quite indefensible. If the parliamentary secretary is responsible for the delay, in his guise in the Department of Human Services and Health, perhaps he can explain that. But it is also particularly ant to me that the government is so ambivalent these days about its position on immigration. I remind the House that it was the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who, not so long ago, said that in this recovery the complement to skill formation in the labour market was not going to come from immigration. In past periods of labour demand, immigration has been seen as an important ancillary element of meeting that demand, complementary to training, but the government seems to be abandoning this. One of the things that came out that was particularly important to me were the admissions in the Senate that we are now seeing a deterioration in the skill level of the migration program. I think it is particularly germane, at a time when the government is claiming that it is increasing skilled migration, that we have admissions on the record from departmental officials that there will be a lowering of the skiIled intake. If the officials are looking for that, Mr MCMahon might assist. I am referring to page 42. But it is humane when one. looks at the government's program which is predicated upon skilled immigration increasing, largely because of the accommodation of the 1 November onshore arrivals in the skilled intake-a total of 8,300 additional persons. The interesting aspect about those people is that the skiIl comes from the fact that, whether they were skilled or not, they have been allowed to engage in some employment in the time that they have been in Australia. But, obviously, they are not people who are enhancing the skill level of our immigration program. There are many aspects I would like to discuss but with this outrageous program it is not possible. (Time expired)",90
183,Mr FERGUSON,Unknown,"Reid) (7.06 p.m.)Initially, I would like to put on record my commendation of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs for the increased numbers of aid grants that will affect a large number of electorates like mine. An additional vote of $1.25 million will fund 25 of these grants around Australia. Already, as a recipient of a large number of new arrivals from non-English speaking backgrounds, my electorate has a significant number of these importgrants. That trend is strengthened by the presence of a number of departmental flats in North Auburn. It is a commendable decision to increase this program to ensure that the settlement needs of a large number of the community are met. Additionally, the vote of three-quarters of a million dollars in grants to the humanitarian area focuses on the reality that a number of the groups from which we are receiving people under this program are not those that conventionally have large numbers within Australia; they have no structures already in place, and they do not have large scale communities with those kinds of support mechanisms. On both fronts the total vote of around $2 million will be very beneficial in my electorate. It was interesting to hear the evidence of the Bosnian Foreign Minister who appeared before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. He talked of the suffering in his country. There are 933,000 displaced. persons within Bosnia and the number of displaced persons outside the area of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. is 11/4 million. This is relevant to my electorate because Bosnians have been a particular growth group coming into the electorate under the humanitarian program. The dimensions of the problem in the former Yugoslavia have been seen locally. Over the next four years $5.2 million will be allocated towards the mental health problems of those people who have suffered trauma and torture. That allocation is relevant to that particular part of the world. The government has been criticised for its failure to move on with mental health, but this allocation fits into the government's broad agenda. Another issue involved in the broad migration intake concerns refugees and the question of how long they have to be here to qualify for the age pension, et cetera. There is recognition that people under the refugee classification do not come here freely; they do not come here because cars are cheaper or social security benefits are higher; they just come here and, in those cases that are eventually found to be refugees, they do so to avoid suffering. So the government is to be commended on its agreement to abandon the current limitations and restrictions on when these persons receive benefits. Returning to the humanitarian area, $.625 million is allocated to ensure better coordination of the delivery of government services for those people under humanitarian programs. This group lacks the structures of other groups. There might be efforts by the government to ensure equity in access to government facilities and to benefits but, to a large degree, these people have not been catered for by the government because of their previous non-presence in the community. This allocation ensures that they have more details about the actual facilities and; at. same time, ensures that they do not miss out on obvious benefits in this country. Finally, I commend the retention of a reasonable level of funding for migrant resource centres. There was concern in the last budget that there was a running down in the amount of money they had. Some of them were seemingly finding it very difficult to survive. They are vital to the provision of services to smaller communities, those that cannot receive funded grants or aid in their own right, and whilst there are none in my immediate electorate, in the western region there are a number that are fulfilling a vital need. '",91
184,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"I have spoken a number of times today on particular budget estimates. I did not have the time to comment earlier but, as this is being broadcast, it is the ideal time for me to say that it is a disgrace that, even though we are debating budget estimates today, we are allowed only five minutes to speak'about such issues. It is not really for people like me on this side of parliament to stand up and complain about it, but to those who are at home listening to the broadcast, I say, 'If you want responsibility in government, if you want responsibility in your politicians, rather than, be cynical towards them, you should be demanding more from your local politicians and ensuring that they represent you to the best of their abilities.' Today I want to speak about a very important issue concerning a number of residents in my particular electorate-the Vietnamese community. I would like to take this opportunity to bring to the attention of this House the continuing concerns of local Vietnamese residents about overseas families and friends still resident in Vietnam. Australia's immigration policy must reflect a number of criteria determined by the Australian community through the process of government. In addition to the very worthy goal' of uniting families, one of the most important aspects of our immigration policy must be to provide a safe haven for people who face victimisation and persecution in their native countries. At present Australia is the home to about 130,000 Vietnamese, many of whom have taken refuge here from the brutal and uncompromising regime of the socialist government in Vietnam. I would like to use this opportunity to reiterate in the strongest possible terms my call on the Australian government to do more to end the continual and well-documented abuses of human rights in Vietnam. In addition to this, I strongly urge the government to do more to reunite the families of the Australian Vietnamese community with families still residing in Vietnam. In the years from 1991 to 1993, Australia allowed approximately 3,400 Vietnamese residents to enter Australia under its refugee, humanitarian and special assistance programs. These people are part of the 14,800 Vietnamese residents who 'have taken up permanent residency .in' Australia over the years. In a recent question on notice, I requested the government to pursue the' Vietnamese government over its continued abuse of human rights in Vietnam, to ensure the freedom. of numerous political prisoners presently being held in Vietnam and to ensure that at the very highest levels of government Australia would not compromise in its efforts with regard to human rights in Vietnam. In response to these questions I was informed that yes, the government would continue to pursue these interests. But I am asking the government to do more, rimch more, and to be more active in doing more. I receive many letters from local Vietnamese residents and organisations who tell tales of torment and torture by the Vietnamese government. Many, however,also offer strong advice to the government on· its balance of economic and human rights issues, stressing a very prudent approach to the issues· and stating that our regional stability depends heavily on the political and economic development of countries in the region, particularly Vietnam. Australia's immigration policy should always recognise the troublesome political climate facing our regional neighbours, in particular the abusive nature of regimes like that in Vietnam. The Vietnamese community throughout Australia, particularly in Western Australia, has made a constructive contribution to Australia's ethnic diversity. Where possible it has adopted Australia warmly while preserving its cultural heritage and identity. I would like to bring to the attention of the House Dr Van Phat Nguyen, a resident in my own electorate, who recently stood for the local council and performed very well. Unfortunately, he did not get elected, but it goes to show that the Vietnamese community is beginning to take a stronger interest in the Australian community and is, adding a lot of colour. to our multicultural attitudes. In conclusion, I would encourage the government to further hasten its activity regarding immigration from Vietnam in order to facilitate the reunification of families of Vietnamese origin in Australia.",92
185,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"CalweIlParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (7.15 p.m.)Let me begin by discussing the issue that was raised by the shadow minister about the response by the government to the report on conditional migrant entry by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. I know that this is a matter that concerns him as he raised it once before in this House. I can assure him that I actually pursued the matter,· not simply because he raised it but because I had been concerned about it myself. The matter is an interdepartmental issue and an interdepartmental committee has been working on it. I am reliably informed that many of the recommendations are proceeding well towards acceptance by the interdepartmental committee, but there are some difficult and thorny issues. MrRuddock-It's the government.",93
186,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"No, it is not the government, but the government must await the report of the interdepartmental committee. I have stressed, as has the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator BolkUs), the need for these deliberations to be concluded and for some recommendations from the IDC to come forward. All I can say to the shadow minister is that we will continue to press this matter and hopefully we will get a conclusion in the not too distant future. Mr Ruddock-We might be able to deal with it when we're in government.",93
187,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"I do not think that remark is warranted. I can assure the honourable member that we are taking the issue seriously, as we do the many other issues involved in immigration. Whilst speaking about other immigration matters, let me say that I have been very pleased to see the extent to which the government and the immigration department have come to grips with essentially very complex and difficult questions following the 1993 election. There were a number of very difficult issues to resolve and the department has come to grips with most of those issues in a very sensible fashion. There were a number of humanitarian issues: the very complex question of the Chinese students; the issue of how to deal with on-shore refugees, especially the Cambodian refugees; a number of questions abOut the balance of the immigration program; the question of continuing the humanitarian program from eastern Europe and other places around the world. In dealing with all these matters the department and the minister have managed very well. It is to our credit that immigration is not really a particularly bipartisan issue at the present time. We have some differences of view but in general terms many of the issues have been.,Mr Ruddock-Could you repeat that?",93
188,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"The way in which the minister and the department have approached these questions in the last 12 months or so is to their credit. Obviously, the opposition has cooperated to a certain degree in this matter but one of the main reasons for such an achievement is the way in which many of the very difficult and thorny issues have been so sensibly resolved. I want to join the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson)"" in commending the government on the increased number of grants-in-aid in this budget and for the humanitarian .commitment to the trauma and torture program. They are all excellent initiatives and deserve great support from this House. I conclude by saying that obviously there are some remaining issues. Immigration issues will always be debated in Australia, but I am pleased to see that on the question of immigration there has been much more bipartisan support and agreement. There has been some controversy over the issues of multiculturalism but I will say more about that when I get the opportunity in another debate.",94
189,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"I take this opportunity to make some further observations in relation to the immigration estimates, particularly to develop some of the arguments that I raised before about the nature of the immigration program. I adverted to the fact that the skill level was falling. honourable member who spoke before me, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), mentioned that one of the reasons for the significant increase in the program this year has been that the government is now starting to bring into the program numbers of people who had, to all intents and purposes, been in Australia before; that is, the large number, in the main, of PRC nationals who came here as ostensibly bona fide students and stayed on after the Tiananmen Square massacre in circumstances in which we all recognise there was a need to be of assistance. But as the matter went on for a loqg period without resolution, and with continued arrivals in Australia of family members, we have had people here who have, as the government has admitted in Senate estimates hearings, been taking positions of employment. They are working part time and are now being accommodated within the program. They have distorted the program; they have done so significantly in relation to the program that the government is putting in place now. This has led to a situation in which the skill level is falling. As was also admitted in another place, the impact will be quite long term. The figures submitted by ""the deputy secretary of the department in terms of chain migration show from records of admissions that additional places number in the order of 70,000. That is a significant matter, particularly when we consider that the program this year will have an increase from 34,000 to 36,500 in the preferential family stream. One of the things that worries me and obviously worries Senator MCKieman, who addressed the Senate estimates committees, is the extent to which the government does effectively test the bona fides of many of those people who access Australia through, the preferential family stream. Senator MCKiernan, I noticed, raised issues relating particularly to the marriage and quasi-marriage entry",94
190,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,We put the procedures in place.,94
191,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,The procedures that are in place obviously have had very little impact The upon the issue of whether or not people are entering Australia for bona fide marriage relationships.,94
192,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,What about the twoyear rule? .,94
193,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"That applies only in relation to, as you know-and I have not lost any ofinY familiarity with the subject-those who are applying onshore. Dr TheophanousYes, but that is a significant number of the preferential category.",94
194,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"-.,.No, it is not a significant part; it is a: minor part of the preferential category. The greater part of the preferential category is for marriage partners. The question of boria fides testing is still a significant matter that the parliamentary secretary's colleague recognises ought to be addressed by the government. I want to conclude my remarks by simply saying that all is not quite as the parliamentary secretary would have liked us to believe. There have been increases· in funding in various areas. There have been areas in whiCh the government's commitment has been diminished, partiCularly in relation to the AMEP, whiCh has been under attack for some time and that is still the case. We have, of course, the situation where the government still persists in arguing that it needs to have community relations programs when a good deal more in terms of what can be achieved in this area would be the adoption of sensible programs. . It is a long time, I think, since we have seen a minister in this country unable to go to one of the major cities in Australia because of the way in whiCh the government deals with community relations. I find it a matter of very significant note that we have to be spending money on improving community relations when it is the government's own performance and decisions in this matter that have led to a significant deterioration in relationships such that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) could not visit Wollongong recently to perform an official opening because of the hostility with whiCh he would have been greeted.",95
195,Mr FERGUSON,Unknown,"I think the final comment is as opportunistiC as one could get. To say that because there is a riot by a group of people dissatisfied with a government policy-in this case, with regard to the designation of people in Australia and the recognition of Macedonia-the minister or the government is responsible is inane. It could have been about any decisions. To say that in some way we should be over-concerned that people carryon in this way and that the government merits criticism for it is rather ridiCulous. If it were about another subject matter, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and those opposite would be screaming about the need for police action, new legislation, gaol sentences, et cetera. So to come here today and say that the government should be subjected to criticism because of. the carryon in that partiCular situation is, as I say, fairly inane. One of the other aspects of the budget is the $3 1/4 million in the short term and the nearly half a million dollars over each of the next three years to increase respect for, knowledge of and interest in citizenship, and to lift its take-up levels. That is the subject of a current parliamentary inquiry. I think all of us would hope that we can find the reasons why some partiCular communities have a very low citizenship take-up level. A lot of the reasons why traditionally that was the case have been now overtaken by history and that is another area where the government should be commended. At the same time, I think the government should look at moving towards some manner in whiCh citizenship can be tied to enrolment in this country. I take the opportunity to critiCise the cut-backs in overtime over the last few years in the Australian Electoral Office. They have led to a situation where I would be surprised if half the people go home after citizenship functions and fill out those forms. Something has to be looked at to perhaps tie becoming a citizen to becoming enrolled at the same time. That should be taken on board in the broader inquiry. At the same time, I congratulate the government for doing something about lifting the profile of citizenship and encouraging more people to take it up. The MRCs, as I mentioned earlier,have maintained their funding, despiteconcerns when the last budget was announced. The government has given them the opportunity to be involved in NElS labour markets and the small business sector in being sponsor bodies to come up with projects in that area. I think we are quite aware that this is inter-related with the lack of employment in a number of non-English speaking communities. The fact that some of these MRCs and other groups can come forward with proposals and thereby increase employment in what are really black spots in Australia's overall employment profile, is also a matter we should congratulate them on. Finally, if there were any legitimate broad criticisms of the AMEP we would not be faced with the situation where all the complaints stem from one state. There is no real pattern of national concern with cut-backs in this area. It is, to some degree, a reflection the administrative structure in the New South Wales system and perhaps the industrial skills of teachers in that field in making this an issue in one state alone. Any cut-backs in that area have to be seen in the wider context - of the money that is going into English language skills for those people who have been here for decades and have had jobs, and who are now condemned to possible long-term unemployment because they lacked English skills when they were not really seen as a prerequisite. The government is actively increasing expenditure in that area. There has been a significant uplift. It has been maintained in this budget and to come along and quibble about what is specifically an AMEP is really losing sight of the main situation.",95
196,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"Berowra) (7.29 p.m.)The first people who raised issues relating to Macedonia were government members in the context of an election, and they cannot complain about it afterwards.",96
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Snow)Order! The time allotted for consideration of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has expired. The question is that the proposed expenditure be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Remainder of bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Walker) read a third time. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.2) 1994-95 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 May, on motion by Mr Willis: That the bill be now read a second time.  parliament is debating tonight Appropriation Bill (No.2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill. Both of these bills are quite important to us. Jointly with the Appropriation Bill (No.1), they appropriate moneys to fund the operation of government. Accordingly, I propose to deal with each of of these bills individually. I also foreshadow that, on behalf of the coalition, I will move an amendment to Appropriation Bill (No.2) during this debate. Appropriation Bill (No.2) is a routine bill which is debated by the House every year as part. of the normal budget process. The bill allocates $5 billion for certain capital purposes, including the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, and the purchase of plant and equipment. In addition, funds are appropriated for grants to the states and territories, for certain loans and advances to government bodies, and for new policy measures where the legislation authorising expenditure on those measures has not yet been enacted. Included in this latter category are measures announced in the government's most recent mini-statement, Working Nation. A more expansive list of the purposes for which the money is appropriated is contained inschedules 1 and 2 of the bill. The Department of Human Services and Health is the largest recipient of funds with a total appropriation of $1.4 billion. Grants to the states and territories for health services comprise most of the department's allocation. For example, $139 million has been given for the provision of general medical services, while $225 million is to be directed towards assistance for people with disabilities. The amount of $38 million is allocated to reduce waiting lists for elective surgery. With waiting lists of over 100,000 people, this amount will go only a very small way toward- .al1e-iating the pain of those who are on wattmg l1sts. The Department of Communications and the Arts will receive $336 million in appropriations under this bill. The majority of these funds will be given to the Telstra Corporation as equity contributions. However, $61 million is allocated for the installation of radio and television transmitters, ancillary buildings and other equipment for national broadcasting. Interestingly, a figure of $2 million has been set aside for the Australia Festival in Washington. This seems to be rather a large amount for a festival and is, I presume, over and above the normal funding directed to our embassy in Washington. Exactly how this money will be spent and whether any benefit accrues from it deserves further scrutiny. Other purposes for which the appropriations are allocated include $81 million for new computers in the Department of Employment, Education and Training; $22 million for the construction of a new building for the Australian Geological Survey Organisation; $82 million for new labour market programs; and $78 million for new computer equipment in the Department of Social Security. Another measure which is to receive funds from this bill is the Aboriginal land acquisiliving tion fund. By way of background, the Abothese riginal land acquisition fund was established as part of the government's response to High Court's Mabo decision. A total of $1 billion will be paid into the fund over 10 years for land purchases by Aborigines have been dispossessed of their land but do not gain any benefit from the High Court's native title decision. According to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-and I caution the addition, House not to place too much emphasis this, given the Prime Minister's tendency to given land. say one thing and do another-the land fund is to enable indigenous people to acquire land and manage it in a sustainable way. The is to provide economic, social and cultural benefits for future indigenous generations. The 1994-95 budget provides the first allocation to the fund of $200 million, which is provided for in this bill. This initial funding is to be followed by an annual appropriation of $124 million for the next nine years will be maintained in real terms. The amount of $21.6 million of the allocation represents current ATSIC allocations for land acquisition and management, the responsibility for which will be transferred to the land fund from 1995-96. Funds in the land fund not used to purchase land will be invested so as to provide a capital base which will ensure that the fund becomes self-financing and operates independently of the government. The coalition is opposed to the establishment of the Aboriginal land acquisition fund for a number of very good and sound reasons. The first reason is that nowhere has the government demonstrated that the land fund will have any significant impact on the well-being of indigenous Australians. There are many pressing problems confronting the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, particularly those situated in the outback regions. Poor housing, education and health services are but three. In addition, there are a number of problems unique to these communities, including a lack of infrastructure, poor economic development and a lack of understanding of the indigenous culture. This fund will do nothing to address these problems. n no way will it provide a better standard of for the indigenous people living in communities. In the same way, it will not encourage these communities to develop the their culture or become self-supporting. The second reason for the coalition's opposition is that the land fund simply dupliwho cates other mechanisms which will do the who same thing but which are already in place. The procedure which enables the purchase of land already exists at the state level. In there is a facility available through on ATSIC whereby Aboriginal people can be On behalf of the coalition, I question the - need to establish yet another bureaucracy to land do something which could quite easily be achieved using existing resources. The government's land fund represents a cynical attempt by the government to buy off yet another interest group. We have already seen it do this with environmental lobby groups, the sporting fraternity and women. Now it has which targeted the Aboriginal c<;>mmunity. Finally, the coalition does not believe that simply granting land will help the Aboriginal communities. It has· not worked in the past and the government has not demonstrated how or why this proposal will be any differthat ent. Overall, the coalition believes money could be better spent to help Aboriginal communities overcome their more presswealth ing problems in areas such as health, housing, education and unemployment. Accordingly, move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, House expresses its opposition to the Government's decision to establish and allocate funds to Aboriginal Land Fund and calls on the Government to direct more adequate funding towards aboriginal health, housing and education, and other social needs"". As I pointed out earlier, the funds appropriatbillion ed by this bill total just over $5 billion; is slightly lower than the appropriation sought in 1993-94; which was in the order of $5.2 billion. The fact that the appropriation sought has reduced is hardly a source of pride to government. Indeed, given the size of the reduction it is largely irrelevant. The bottom line is that we still have a budget deficit and this government is still debt-indeed, heavily in debt. ment still has to borrow to finance its programs and its inefficient administration. Over the course of this year the government will borrow nearly $21 billion to flind its activido ties. This represents a slight increase on year's borrowings, which were forecast to $21.9 billion but will actually come in around $19 billion. Of the 1994-95 borrowings $11.7 billion will be used to fund the budget· deficit, $6.2 billion will be spent to redeem. maturing treasury bonds,$104 million will redeem Australian savings bonds, $1.2 billion will spent on maturities and possibly earIy calls foreign currency debt and $1.1 billion will on net payments associated with Commonsource wealth public trading enterprises superannuaits tion. The government will fund the debt it will accumulate in 1994-95 through issue of treasury bonds, estimated to be worth $17 billion,treasury notes and treasury dexed bonds. This will add to existing Commonwealth government debt, which currently stands at $91 billion. This is up a massive 18.6 per cent on the $76.5 billion the government had already raked up by that this the end of June 1993. According to the budget papers, Commondebt will continue to rise, reaching an . expected $104 billion in 1995. To put it into I perspective, Commonwealth government debt equates to nearly 23 per cent of GDP, or one a quarter of everything we produce. Not only is the level of government debt alarming; so too the are the massive repayments which we, the the taxpayers, are forced to make every year. The cost of servicing the Commonwealth debtthat is, the cost of interest payments-will soar by 22 per cent in 1994-95. Repayments will rise from $6.6 billion in 1993-94 to $8.4 in 1994-95. But it does not stop This there-interest payments on public debt will be over $10 billion in 1997-98 based on our current debt levels. Put another way, interest payments currently amount to seven per - ent this of total Commonwealth spending-up from 5.7 per cent in 1993-94. This is more than the government spends on housing, industry assistance, science and research, labour market programs or culture and recreation. It in is a only marginally less than that spent on The governdefence and education. Bear in mind that I am only talking about interest payments; the figures I· have quoted not begin to make an inroad into reducing last the principal. Also bear in mind that they be relate to current debt only. We can be sure at that debt will continue to rise under this government as it continues to run up budget deficits. Australia's massive government debt typifies the problem with Labor's approach to government. Rather than using borrowing-as be a means of finance as a last resort, this of government is content to leave the hard go decisions and use borrowings as a primary of funds. It is happy to spend and buy way into office, but without taking the responsibility that goes with it. It simply puts a further all its promises on Bankcard. If you or I, or anyone else in the communiinty for that matter, ran our household or business in the same way as the government does, we would be broke. Our bank manager would not keep giving us the money. Rather, any normal person or business in this position would be told to go and review its budget and look at ways of reining in expenditure. But not this government. It has no intention of tightening its belt. It has, no intention of tackling the large and cumbersome bureaucracy,of stamping out problems in program administration or undertaking the multitude of other reforms that should be put in place. Rather, it seems content to leave a legacy of massive and spiralling debt to the future generations of Australians. The coalition has long been concerned about this approach. We have been seen as slash and bum merchants, but that is not our approach to this particular problem. We say that. the economy could be better managed and this government is not a very good economic manager. I mentioned earlier the $2 million allocated in the appropriation bill for the Australia Festival in Washington. This should be looked at as a matter of urgency. Why do we need a festival in Wlj,shington? Do we get any trade benefits out of it? If'so, it should be funded from the existing trade or Austrade budget. If it is that important, why does the embassy not fund the festival? These are all very important questions. Similarly, grants to trade unions shquld be scrapped. They are simply a payback to unions for the support they have given Labor and the Labor Party during election periods and as such are a blatant abuse of the taxpayers' money. Overseas travel and domestic junkets for bureaucrats should be abolished. At the very least, travel should be curbed through more stringent scrutiny of the benefits that will accrue to the community from the particular trip. As a demonstration of the magnitude of such travel and indeed the potential for savings, officers of the Department of Industry, Technology and Science spent nearly $1 million on overseas travel in 1993-94. Office furnishings too should be subject to stricter rules. The Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development spent $1.6 million on furnishings and office equipment in 1992-93. There are 'many areas where expenditure can be pruned without compromising the role of government. The resultant savings would reduce the burden on the taxpayer. And, make no mistake, it. is the responsibility of any good government to ensure that it provides to the community the best service' in the most cost-effective manner. As I said earlier, the coalition will not oppose Appropriation Bill (No.2), however we have moved a second reading amendment formally expressing our opposition to - the Aboriginal land fund, especially in light of the many other pressing social issues facing Aboriginal communities. . . ' The second bill before. the House, the Appropriation (Parl iamentary Departments) Bill 1993-94, appropriates funds to meet the current and. capital.' costs of running the parliament-$127 million has been appropriated for this purpose, up $1.1 million on the 1993-94 budget. .Having said that, I should point out to the House that actual expenditure for 1993-94 will come in under budget at $123.9 million. The reduction comes largely from running costs being lower than expected. In the House of Representatives, for example, running costs for 1993-94 'are in the order of $22 million, somewhat lower than the $22.5 million allocated. Similarly, running costs of the Joint House· Department are nearly $2 million lower than budget. . Given that we are debating the management of this building, it is appropriate forme to make some comments on the recent Auditor General's report on the Joint House Department. The Joint House Department is one of five departments which service the parliament and maintain the building. Specifically, the Joint House Department has responsibility for engineering and maintenance services of both the building and surrounding grounds; food and beverage services for members, senators and building occupants; cleaning and housekeeping; and public relations activities. The audit office expressed its concern about the economies of the Joint House Department's operations. While there was no obvious evidence of waste, the audit office noted that the Joint House Department has set very high service standards and that these carry considerable costs. It formed the view that this cost was growing and that perhaps it did not represent good value for money. Accordingly, the Auditor-General noted that there was scope for the Joint House Department to gain efficiencies in service delivery by reviewing the value for money side of its operations. The Auditor-General said: This does notmean compromising the quality service delivery, but the Joint House Department should not discount options because they do meet the"" current high"" standards the Department operates within. The audit office also expressed concern about the gardening and landscaping role of the Joint House Department. Specifically, it noted that the Joint House Department has not· considered alternatives,such as providing service in-house. In effect, the Auditor-. General is saying that the Joint House Department should give consideration to contracting out some or all of the gardening services. the very least, investig;ltion of this option would give the Joint House Department criteria against which to measure its own costs and ""benchmark its gardening services. In making these comments, the Auditorof General has implied that the current means managing the gardens is not the most effecernment tive or cost efficient. It is the responsibility the Joint House Department and, through it, the Presiding Officers to ensure that taxpayers gain value for money. Costs incurred in maintaining this building must be as low possible while at the same time ensuring that the building be maintained in an appropriate manner. The sorts of measures being advocated by the Auditor-General .would result in some savings to taxpayers without compromising the operations of the building or the level of service provided to the occupants.Accordingly, I look forward to seeing their implementation reflected in a lower appropriation fofthe parliamentary departments in' the 1995-96 financial year. Otherwise, the coalition does not oppose this bilL """,96
198,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Is FremantIe the amendment seconded?,100
199,Mrs GALLUS,Unknown,"I second the amendment,' Mr Deputy Speaker. I wish to take up an issue central to the point the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) has been making today. The issue involves the present situation of Aboriginal. health, how money is desperately needed in that area and the consequence of money appropriated for the land fund. I would like to go into the history of what of the government has been doing in this area. Earlier this year, we were subjected to one of not the typical grandstanding efforts on Aboriginalhealth by the now departed-not from this world but from the other place'-ex-Senator Graham Richardson. It was a:lmost a reliving of the environment when we saw the senator out there..., - instead of with the Greens, the trees and everything else-with a group of the Aboriginal people showing to the world, and to Australia in general, the state of their health. It was not a good picture with Graham Richardson in the middle saying, 'This is the At state of health of Aboriginal people in Australia and we should be ashamed.' He was some quite right. We should be ashamed. The ex - Senator then raised the hopes of Aboriginal communities. Having gained a lot publicity .with his trip to the outback, he of then said he w9uldbe approaching the govand asking for $1 billion for Aborigiof nal health: The ""community, knowing the reputation of ex-Senator Richardson, thought that he might have a very good chanc- of obtaining that $1 billion. However, when his as submission went to cabinet, he had reduced his request slightly to. $800 million, which was still a considerable sum. Ex-Senator Richardson went with all the credibility he had and said that he would go to cabinet and obtain $800 million for Aboriginal health. But, despite the declared commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to raising the standard of Aboriginal health and the standard of Aboriginal communities generally in their infrastructure, this $800 million seems to have disappeared, along-it seems..., - withex-Senator Richardson. When ex-Senator Richardson departed from the other place, the· health portfolio fell to the honourable. membecfor (Dr Lawrence). Here it becomes 'curiouser and curiouser' ·because, although the honourable member admitted she had not got quite what ex-Senator Richardson had promised to Aboriginal communities, she.did claim that she had done rather well in getting $500 million in new funds for Aboriginal health, sp""ecifically to go towards the national Aboriginal health strategy. What do we mean when we say we are going to put $500 milli.on in new funds into a project? I think everybody understandS it to mean that the project-the health strategy with all the health service workers, the doc""; tors and the clinics-will go on as it is with $500 million in new funds. That is what the Aboriginal communities believed and, hearing the budget speech, I believe it is what this parliament believed. However, when we look at how the funds have been allocated, we find that this is not the case at all. This $499 million is, in the vernacular, a take. Access Economics was so intrigued that it has produced a paper in which it has tried to follow what has happened with this funding.",100
200,Mr WALKER,Unknown,I'm glad you said 'we'.,101
201,Mrs GALLUS,Unknown,"I am sorry. The Minister for Administrative Services, who is at the table, made a comment and I did not understand its relevancec. If.he,would like to repeat it, I might be able to reply. Access Economics tried to find out where this $500 million extra funding was, and found that it was very difficult. Finally, it did an analysis and, on the current funding to the national Aboriginalhealth strategy, worked out that the funding this year was $70.1 million. If funding were to be continued at that rate for the next five years, this $500 million would become $414 million, which would be necessary simply for the continuation of the present I'fograms. So what happened to our $499 million? It seems to have disappeared into the same program in which it always was. The difference is about $85 million, which is not very much. So much is the commitment of this government to Aboriginal health that it has perpetuated what! think could be described only as a con on the Aboriginal community. I would like to read from what Access· Economics says, because 1 do not think I could put it any bettertnyself: The.Natiomil Aboriginal Health Strategy ... was to have expired i.n June 1995-the money stopped then. That is a quote from the new Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), justifying what she had done in this Aboriginal health strategy. She was still claiming that it was new money. But to claim that this was new money she had to say: The National AbOriginal Health Strategy .... was to have expired in June 1995-the money stopped then. Now there's new money to keepit going. Access. Economics had this to say: Does this mean then, that save for the new Budget commitment, as at June 1995 all the people working in Aboriginal health would be sacked, that Aboriginal health services would be closed, that all works on water supplies, sanitation, housing, etc would cease and, perhaps, that Aborjginal people would no longer get sick? Obviously not. It went on-and I do not think I could do much better than this: The only point about the commitment is that it had not been previously announced (at least in a budget context). Accordingly, there was no provision in the forward. estimates of expenditure. These are facts, but facts of no consequence. The procedure of reannouncing existing programs as if they were new programs is a procedure of crying wolf; It is a procedure of budgetary illusion. It is more' thim that; it is a procedure of based misleading the Australian public and, worse than that, it is a. procedure of misleading the Aboriginal community. I question the sincerity of the Minister for Human Services and Health in this matter. I can put it down to one of two things: either she was deliberately misleading the Australian public or she had been misled about what this funding meant. The minister does have an excuse: she is new in the job and perhaps she did not have a good idea of what was going on. But I say to the government that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has no excuse. He is well aware of where money goes, yet he too put his name to a press release which claimed that this was new funding, and I believe that 'new' in the press release was in italics. It has been revealed as no such thing, although we do acknowledge there .has been a slight increase in the funding. So much for the integrity of this minister, who'I believe prides himself on his integrity in this matter. The minister claims that this was new money and then congratulates the government on its commitment to a land fund. We all know that there are priorities and we must get those priorities right. Last week the federal Race Discrimin-tion Commissioner, Irene Moss, released a report called Water: a report on the provision of water and sanitation in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. That report reveals what is going on in these communities-an enormous waste of money. Infrastructure is put there that does not work. Sophisticated types of infrastructure are put in communities and are then not backed up. I notice that the minister at the table is laughing. I hope he is laughing at something other than the breakdown of the infrastructure. He is not responsible for this portfolio. It is a general finance portfolio, so he could be excused for not knowing very much about it. I point out to him that this report found that 34 per cent of these remote Aboriginal communities did' not have water quality that reached the standard of the NHMRC. That is really a condemnation of what has happened to these communities. It demonstrates the failure of this government to provide adequately for those communities. The report also found that 46 per cent of these communities would not have adequate water in the next six years. These are enormous problems. I will not go into the health problems ()f the Aboriginal communities because I think we all know what those problems are. Those problems are based very much on these public health measures. The great advances in human health did not come with the medicine and technology so much as it did with the changes in public health measures, the access to clean, pure water, the access to sanitation. These are the very things that are being denied those communities. The, con that has occurred on the national Aboriginal health strategy' is a tragedy. The majority of the money allocated to the strategy goes to providing infrastructure-environmental ,health infrastructure, water,sanitation and housing. Those are the fundamentals of living that these communities need if the health of the children is going to be protected. In conclusion, I give my support to the amendment moved by my colleague the honourable member for Forrest.' , Amendment negatived. , Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read it second time.

LOAN BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 10 May. Second Reading",101
202,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the loan fund rather than from consolidated revenue and to supplement the moneys available to the consolidated revenue fund. Legally, expenditure from the consolidated revenue fund cannot exceed the moneys available to the, fund. Successive gover,nments have adopted, the practice of introducing ,a loan bill to authorise the issue of mone,ys from the loan fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the parliament, but fQr which insufficient funds are available in the cQnsQlidated revenue fund. The purpQse Qf this bill is to. make provi'siQn fQr the financing Qf the prospective deficit in the cQnsQlidated revenue fund. The budget deficit Qf $11.7 billiQn fQr 1994-95 gives rise to. a prospective deficit in the cQnsQlidated revenue fund Qf abQut $18.9 billiQn. The difference between the two. deficits arises because appropriatiQns frQm that fund include variQus items which are functiQnally classified as financing transactiQns rather than Qutlays, and thus do. not affect the budget QutCQme. These items include payments to. the natiQnal debt sinking fund to. redeem Qr repurchase CQmmQnwealth securities and superannuatiQn payments made by the) CQmmQnwealth Qn behalf Qf public trading enterpl""ises. The bill provides authority fQr the IQan to. meet defence expenditures incurred in 1994-95 after the passage Qf the bill that WQuid Qtherwise have been met from the CQnSQlidated revenue fund and, if necessary, to. supplement the cQnsQlidated revenue fund so. that it can meet its Qther cQmmitments. The bill also. provides the authQrity to. raise IQans to. CQver these payments frQm the IQan fund. Except fQr IQan raising expenses, which are currently estimated at $14.7 milliQn fQr 199495, the bill dQes nQt authQrise expenditures additiQnal to. thQse already apprQved by, Qr currently befQre, the parliament. I emphasise that the bill dQes nQt in any way impinge Qn the prerogative .Qf the parliament to. appropriIQng-term ate mQneys, but simply prQvides the means to. finance expenditures previQusly apprQved and appropriated by the parliament. I cQmmend the bill to. the HQuse.  LQan Bill 1994 is all abQut gQvernment spending and debt. So., as the bill passes thrQugh the HQuse,it is an appropriate time fQr us to. take stQck Qf the Labor gQvernment's recQrd in these areas. Over the last 12 mQnths the gQvernment has made a great deal Qf its deficit reductiQn prQgram. It has a plan to. reduce the budget deficit to. less than Qne per cent Qf GDP by 1996-97 and it hQlds this up as an example Qf its cQmmitment to. resPQnsible financial management. The gQvernment has set itself a mQderate target, and it knQws it-and the financial markets knQW it as well. ShQuld the gQvernment achieve its deficit reductiQn target it will be quick to. say that it said it CQuid do. it and it has delivered the gQods; it has brought hQme the bacQn, so. to. speak. But that is the way this gQvernment wQrks. It ruins things and then pats itself Qn the back when it gQes through an ill-cQnceived attempts to. fix them. Australia's dire IQng-term unemplQyment prQblem is a perfect example Qf this Labor gQvernment in actiQn. Having created the prQblem thrQugh its use Qf mQnetary PQlicy and having put Qne milliQn people Qn the dQle queues, this gQvernment has set abQut sQlving the problem and patting itself Qn the back fQr fund each failed attempt alQng the way. First, we had the One Nation statement Qf tIle Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-a gQQd Qld pump priming exercise that is nQW held up as a mQdel Qf ilI-cQnceived gQvernment PQlicy. It was never gQing to. wQrk and it never did, end Qf stQry. The Prime Minister's next attempt was the Investing in the NatiQn. statement. The title Qf that dQcument speaks fQr itself: Investing in the NatiQn failed to. lift investment Qne iQta. Of CQurse the mQst recent attempt, WQrking NatiQn, is nQt Qnly the mQst grandiQse but also. the mQst desperate and fQQlish attempt to. deal with the prQblem. The gQvernment's answer to. the. problem Qf massive, chronic, unemplQyment is training prQgrams and case management-no. jQbs, but case management. The Prime Minister WQuid have us believe that Working NatiQn is Labor to. its bQQtstraps. It is a statement to. that effect, but it will quickly fail the test Qf time and be revealed as nQthing mQre than $6.5 billiQn in i.1l-cQnceived gQvernment spending. The budget deficit this year is expected to. be $13.6 billiQn Qr 3.2 per cent Qf GDP. In his budget speech the Treasurer (Mr Willis) was Qnly tQQ pleased to. tell us that this is SQme $2.4 billiQn IQwer than the fQrecast in last year's budget. So. what dQes it mean? The budget deficit is $13.6 billiQn. It is quite simple: this year the gQvernment is spending $13.6 billion more than'it collected in taxes and other revenues. Total government spending is $114.5 billion, while total revenue is $100.9 billion. The difference between spending and revenue is the deficit; in other words, there is red ink all over the bottom line. But that was Mr Dawkins's effort. What has the new Treasurer proposed in his first budget? Do not let the dour delivery of the Treasurer fool you. There are some extraordinary forecasts in the budget. Let us start with the deficit. The Treasurer is pleased with his efforts here because he has the deficit down from $13.6 biIIion this year to $11.7 billion next year. This means that the budget deficit will fall from 3.2 per cent of GOP to 2.5 per cent. How has the Treasurer achieved this? How has he got the deficit down? We might expect the government to embark. on some fiscal restraint to bring the deficit down, but the Treasurer has delivered it another way. He has done it by increasing government spending by $6.1 billion next year and, while the revenue that the government collects will rise by almost $8 billion, the Treasurer's plan to get the deficit down is to spend more but collect even more than that in taxes. What a plan! The Treasurer has made a great deal of the fact that this first budget does not include any tax increases. He can only claim this because the tax increases that take effect in 1994-95 were announced in the previous budget. So, while there are no tax increases, the tax take for 1994-95 will rise from $94.2 biIIion to $103.3 billion. There are no new taxes, but we will all be paying an extra $9.2 billion in taxes next year. By 1996-97 the government will be spending $131.6 billion and collecting some $126.8 billion in taxes and other revenue. The resulting deficit of $4.8 billion will achieve the government's aim of bringing the deficit down to less than one per cent of GOP. This plan really is quite extraordinary. To bring the deficit down, the government will increase spending by 3.1 per cent this year and 3.2 per cent next year, while increasing the tax grab by 5.6, 5.5 and 4.3 per cent in real terms over the next three years. To achieve us not forget that the government has thrown out the second round of tax cuts which was promised before the last election. These were tax cuts that were enshrined in law, I-a-w, by the Prime Minister. But the book fiddling does not stop there. The government has-also had to embark on a new round of asset sales to fund its recurring expenditure. While many of these sales have been on the coalition's policy book for some time, the difference is that we would not use the proceeds of asset sales to fund ongoing expenses. We would ensure that the funds were used constructively to build a stronger economic structure. But this is another thing that the Labor government is not much interested in. While government spending is blowing out, none of it is going into productive investment in Australia's future. While the public sector investment in infrastructure accounted for 6.5 per cent of GOP in 1984-85, the government has run it down to 5.1 per cent in 1992-93. Our spending on public infrastructure is now at its lowest level for some 30 years. Delaying expenditure on public infrastructure only creates forward obligations for that expenditure. The Labor government will saddle us and the next generation with large levels of public debt as well as a range of expenditure commitments to boot. This is not responsible financial management. It is little wonder that the Institution of Engineers, Australia, came out after the budget was delivered with a damning attack on the government. Dr John Webster, Chief Executive, stated: Australia still does not have an efficient national freight system, let alone an integrated transport policy. We have serious congestion which affects all modes of transport in Sydney and Melbourne, and problems with waste disposal and water treatment and distribution in all our capital cities. We have yet to achieve a national electricity grid We will find ourselves, in a few years, like the owner of an old and quite unreliable car, which can no longer be persuaded to pass its annual roadworthiness inspection, who discovers that it has no trade-in value, and the cost of a new car is far this target, let beyond his means ... Our generation will be judged as the ""selfish generation"" if it spends its income on immediate needs, without providing for the future. The government can quite rightly be accused of ruining the economic future of this country. Not only has it put a million people out of work; it is running our public infrastructure into the ground with its grand plan to reduce the defic'it to one per cent of GDP by 199697. Unfortunately, at some point, all of this to be repaid. The current government is simply imposing spending commitments on future governments. It is ashame that the government has chosen not to examine its account with a little more care. We do not have to dig very deep at all to find grotesque examples of wasteful government spending and mismanagement. We have had the sports rorts; we have had the Conroy report revealing an inefficient Customs Service; and we have had the statements entitled One Nation, Investing in the Nation and Working Nation. The one that came to light last week, through the coalition's Waste Watch Committee, was that staff from Purchasing Australia at the Department of Administrative Services have spent almost $6,000 on golf balls in the last two years. An amount of $6,000 might not be considered a great deal in terms of the $100 billion-plus that the government spends each year. But, if we give $6,000 to a struggling unemployed person, it would make a huge difference to that person. I think I would prefer the $6,000 to be spent on the unemployed rather than on bureaucrats buying golf balls. Another example is the millions of dollars that are squandered each year by our bureaucrats in hospitality expenses. I have a file in my office that details the hospitality expenses for the Customs Service over the last two years. It makes extraordinary reading: a $2,500 lunch here, a $2,500 dinner there. It is not their money, so why should they care? They eat well-six bottles of Rosemount Chardonnay with lunch of lobsters, prawns, barramundi. Our bureaucrats like fish; they like eating well. But it does not make sound financial management for bureaucrats to be eating so well when it is such a struggle for so many families to put three meals a day on the table. Another example was raised by Helen Hughes last week concerning the export market development grants. Professor Hughes believes that the EMDG scheme does next to nothing to help Australian exporters, but the program is kept alive and is promoted heavily by a network of former bureaucrats who now act as consultants to companies trying to maintain the EMDG system. Under a coalition has government, the Minister for Finance would not be running election advertisements with a picture of himself in baseball gear with a caption that reads: ... over. 100 local sporting bodies have benefited from the support of Kim Beazley in gaining Federal grants for activities. Last year alone, more than $617,000 was provided for sporting groups in the seat of Swan. Waste and bad management-that is the hallmark of this Labor government. But let me return to my original discussion on debt. As we know, the government plans to reduce the budget deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. So what is it intending to do to make smaller losses rather than bigger ones in coming years? What does this do to the actual level of Commonwealth debt? Each year the government records a deficit, the level of Commonwealth debt rises. So in 1990, the level of the Commonwealth's own debt, after swap transactions, was around $30 billion, but by 1995 the level of debt will be in the vicinity of $95 billion. The total level of Australia's foreign debt fell in the March quarter to 38.6 per cent of GDP, coming off its peak of 41.6 per cent in the June and September quarters of 1993. Thiswas largely due to the rising value of our dollar and rising direct foreign investment. But, while the total level of our foreign debt is falling, the government is increasing its foreign debt. Commonwealth and Reserve Bank foreign borrowing in the March quarter of this year was 25.2 per cent higher than it was 12 months ago. This is the future that the Keating government is carving out for us. At a time when it should be consolidating our financial position, the government has chosen to blow it out a little more. The government does not set a good example. I could not let a discussion on the 1994-95 budget pass without making reference to the figure that has attracted the most attentionthe 14.5 per cent investment growth forecast. The government thinks it can sustain investment growth at 14.5 per cent in the coming years with plant and equipment investment increasing by 18.5 per cent. The Treasurer has had to do some creative accounting to ,achieve this deficit reduction target, which is nothing more fanciful than the investment forecast.' The government claims that such figures were recorded through the latter 1980s, so its forecasts are not without precedent. But the investment growth that took place in the 1980s came more from investment in buildings and structures than investment in plant and equipment and that is something the government has failed to acknowledge. The government's management of the recovery has been so poor that we now find ourselves in a situation where we are damned if the investment comes and we are damned if it does not. Terry MCCrann says: If investment does not pick up into the strengthening recovery, we will run into capacity crisis and rising inflationary pressures and a blowout in the current account deficit 1986 and 1989 style. If investment does pick up ... we will run into an interest rate crunch as the Government's need to borrow $23 billion clashes with business needs to fund $44 billion of investment. With the subsequent combination of a soaring dollar and rising interest rates a killer for the recovery. And underscored by the continued long-term trend in the household savings ratio. With business and government borrowing rising sharply, that can only be balanced by a huge rise in the current account deficit. So what on earth is the Reserve going to do-and when? Will it sit back and allow an unsustainable speculative boom to go roaring away? Or will it hike rates and send the dollar soaring anyway? Few commentators have taken any relief in the economic growth that we are now experiencing. We are poorly placed as we come out of this recession. The government has failed to lift business investment. If it comes in waves, we will now pay the price. If it, does not come, we will pay it anyway. This is the Labor government's style of economic management. It should realise that wild oscillations in economic policy will lead to wild oscillations in the economy. The Prime Minister introduced the worse recession since the Great Depression with his lack of understanding of monetary policy. We are now in the same position again where the government refuses to exercise fiscal restraint and interest rates can only go one way-clearing the way for our next downturn. As we have emerged from the recession, the government has demonstrated a distinct lack of commitment to responsible economic management. There are still 900,000 people on the dole queues and business investment is still to come through. The government has opted out on micro-economic reform. It is little wonder that offshore investment by Australian companies almost quadrupled last year while domestic investment waned. The government is not committed to reforming our economic landscape and it is not committed to sensible economic management. The government is already demonstrating that it cannot sensibly manage the recovery that is now occurring. The policies it is putting in place, or not putting in place as the case may be, are ensuring that we are locked into another downturn in another couple of years time. If business investment does not come through in the waves that the government predicts and if it cannot find jobs for the unemployed, instead of training programs, it will have only itself to blame. Boom-bust economies is what the Prime Minister will be remembered for and nothing more-just overstimulating the economy and then overreacting. It is not a surprise that the business magazine that voted him the world's best Treasurer went broke. Australian businesses and Australian people. are sick of Labor's style of economic management. A coalition government will deliver reform to the economy, will create the conditions for sustainable economic growth and will promote ,economic stability. In short, we, will be responsible financial managers of the Australian economy. I suspect that the deficit reduction target will be reached in 1996-97, but it will be a coalition government at the controls.",102
203,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"The budget this year was the first to be brought down in May and the first to be delivered by the now Treasurer (Mr Willis). It .has interesting, if not startling, consequences for our Commonwealth borrowing requirements and the Loan Bill. Apart from the just mentioned distinguishing aspects, the .budget was a continuation of Labor's fiscal incompetence. This budget was not particularly earth shattering and it did not, at first glance anyway, appear to be politically risky for the government. The budget provided the financial framework that detailed, in terms of Labor's rhetoric,howthe white paper on employment and growth is to be funded .. More importantly, the budget reflected a steady as she goes policy direction that built upon the tax increases of the 1993-94 budget and that predicted economic growth of 4.5 per cent over the next 12 months. All of this, I have already indicated,has implications the LoanBill and the borrowing requirements of the Commonwealth. At first glance, this debt,which will arise oilt of this year's that budget, is not as easy to criticise as last year's because the tax increases in the budget implemented by stealth rather than by openly upping the taxes. Bracket creep is an easy. way for governing ments to increase income and other taxes, especially when theyqo not have to raise taxes by legislative means. You will recall, Mr Deputy. Speaker, that Labor criticised previous coalition governments for the impact of bracket creep on the total tax But in its decade or more in power Labor has done absolutely nothing to reverse that pact, and neither will it. Though the budget Failure and the borrowing consequences of the budget appear to be politically sound, each will result in severe damage to our economy in the long run. There are several reasons why this budget will impact negatively on our national economic prospects and why the budget projectionsare unlikely to be 'met. Included in the reasons are the size of the budget deficit, the way the proceeds of privatising government assets are being .spent and the figures on which the budget is based. All of these have implications for the Loan Bill. The size of the budget deficit, which is projected to be.$11.7 billion in the coming year, is an example of first-rate economic vandalism .. That deficit needs to be' reined in. If it is not, there is a strong likelihood that interest rates will rise in the next 18 months as' the federal government's'call on national savings deprives the private sector of necessary investment funds. It is axiomatic that if the government raids the available but very limited savings-the historically low savings-in Australia to shore up its needs in deficit spending the private sector will be deprived of an equivalent amount of borrowings. So we see the dog chasing its tail, as it were. The end result of the government depriving the private sector of possible sources of capital, whether equity or borrowings, is a scarcity of funds which will as flow through and feed higher interest rates for over the coming months. In question time today the coalition mentioned a n.umber of sources which estimate interest rates will increase by up to three per cent within 18 months. If ever there were ate a risk that Labor could put our economic recovery in danger,it would be demonstrated by those misgivings and'those rather forebodestimates by a coalition-not this coalition-of very responsible bodies and entities the courage in the private sector. This. budget risks again locking Australia . into the boom-bust economic cycle. Don Mercer of the ANZ put this budget in context take. when he was reported in the Weekend Australianof 28-29 Mayas saying that Australia imis 'back on the path of boom and bust' and: to seize the opportunity of strong economic growth to cut the budget deficit more rapidly is going to leave Australia with higher domestic and external debt than is necessary or desirable. Put simply, most of the'gains from a stronger economic outlook-the so-called growth dividend-are not being used to wind back the deficit and increase saving but will be spent.' . The debt has to be financed whether by public or by private borrowings. We all know the dire state of savings in Australia so it is reasonable to assume there will be a mix of domestic and foreign borrowings; But however the money is raised the private sector will be tail end Charlie once again because it will have to take second place to the gilt edged security which the Commonwealth will offer, and no doubt the Comm?nwealth securities will in due course reflect Increases in interest rates to which, I have already aIluded. It should be made clear that no matter how desirable it is for governments to balance their budgets or to have a surplus there are times when economic fluctuations will force a government to run deficits. Th-S is defin.itely true during a recessionary perIOd. The Ideal scenario is for a government to run modest deficits in periods of recession and surpluses in periods of economic growth, with the longer term-say, 10 years-net being a nearbalanced budgetary position, preferably a surplus. I still maintain that the current budget deficit· projections for 1994-95, and for 199596, are too high-the projection for 1995-96 is a deficit of about $5.5 billion. Even by the government's own estimates in the 1992 One Nation economic statement, the projected deficit is too high. In One Nat-on Prime Minister Keating· gave an undertaking that the Commonwealth's budget deficit for 1994-95 would be less than $1 billion and that a surplus of $2biIIion would be achieved in 1995-96. It is something of an old chestnut, almost, to say that the government has failed to meet these targets, but it is also true that probably had no intention of meeting these targets, so how can we believe that this government will meet the revised estimates? Unfortunately for Australia. I doubt that it can. Labor's past inept management of . fiscal policy is a very good indication that it will not meet the deficit targets, and is especially the case with an election to be held within the next two years. For the government to meet the deficit of $11.7 billion the economy must achieve economic growth of 4.5 per cent this year, then average almost five per cen- for the rest of the decade, and have a sharp Increase in business investment of up to 14.5 per cent in this financial year, 1994-95, and an estimated 20.25 per cent in 1995-96. That is plainly ridiculous. The government also relies on assets sales, the transfer of state debt payments and Reserve Bank profits. Assets sales alone account for almost $3 billion of government revenue in 1994-95, which will mainly come from the sale of its 75 per cent stake in Qantas. Other assets to be sold include Aerospace Technologies of Australia and part of the shipping company ANL-and we know what a hurdle, politically speaking, the Labor Party has to get over with its members. Whilst Labor budgeted for it, it still does not have the agreement in policy terms of its own members. It is not certain that the government will be able to meet the timetable for asset sales, and there is no guarantee that the government will receive its asking price in each or any instance of its projected asset sales. Problems with a-set sales have the potential to blowout the deficit. It is as simple as that. If the econOlny fails to grow at 4.5 per cent, the result will be· a reduced level of tax receipts and also an increase in the deficit. Looking at the. record of Labor in government, I seriously doubt tha- the required as-et sales will be achieved in the coming financ::lal year. I hope in one way that they. are achieved. Without asset sales and dividends from government business enterprises the deficit is actually close to $18 billion. This poses a dilemma because the government cannot sell assets year in and year out. There is only a liinited quantity of assets that Labor it can sell off. Sometime in the near future a Commonwealt- government will have to tackle the underlying structural weaknesses of the federal fiscal position. We in the coalition believe thatthep-oceeds of all asset sales should go to the repayment of debt and should not fund recurrent expenditure, as is happening today- The situation we are in is akin to a personbofJ'owing $100,000 from a bank and spendi-g. it?? holidays and parties, and generally hVlng .It up. In those circumstances, the·· debt still exists but there is nothing to show for it. If the government is going to sell Australia's assets should we not see something for that? A red-ction in debt and a resuJtanfreduction in the cost of servicing our debt, woul- free up expenditure for import-nt n.ati?nal inves-­ ment in infrastructure, which; mCldentally, IS at an historical low, or perhaps·to reduce taxation: The training schemes as outlined by Labor will do nothing to relieve the plight of the long-term unemployed unless there are jobs available after completing training. If there are no jobs-I suspect there will not' beLabor is undertaking a dangerous, cynical exercise that will give false hope to many people and be analogous to pouring money down the drain. There will be nothing to show for this extra expenditure on training except for a' highly agitatedgroup of long term unemployed and, of course, the subsequent increased debt and borrowing. Besides, how many employers will take on trainees given the now-under-review unfair dismissal provisions in the Industrial Relations Act brought forward by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton)? To date, the government has shown lit.tle inclination to balance the books by reducing its own outlays. That is another point of criticism. Reducing the funding levels to the states has been the government's preferred and virtually only method 'of reducing its outlays. Since 1982-83, grants to the states have declined in real terms by 1.7 per cent while Commonwealth own-purpose outlays have increased by 35.5 per cent. There we have it: the golden rule once again. He who has the gold rules and the Commonwealth'has the gold. . The 1994-95 budget projects increased total grants of 8.4 per cent to the states from 199394 to 1997-98. That is, however, not a real increase. in funding, even if it comes about, because inflation will average greater than two per cent in each year. State funding compares. with the 34.4 per cent increase in revenue the Commonwealth will receive over an identical period. So much for the government's vaunted but spuriously claimed belt tightening. If the federal government wants the states to carry the cost of microeconomic reform, it will need to increase funding in real terms and the Commonwealth will also need to carry more of the burden of fiscal restraint. I am pleased to see the government adopting some elements of Fightbackin its recent white paper. The concept of a training wage isa necessary measure to give unemployed people the opportunity to gain skills and, hopefully, get a job. Labor continually fails to recognise that job growth will only occur if the macro-ec,onomic settings 'are correct and micro-economic reform is actually implemented. The gqvernment's budget strategy seems to merely throw money at the unemployment problem but fails to provide the incentive for the private sector to expand, increase investment and ultimately employ more Australians. After all, it is only in the private sector that real and sustainable employment can be generated. One wasteful aspect of public administration that the government fails to combat is the duplication' of regulation and service provision. Commonwealth-state duplication has been .an ongoing feature of public sector wastage; however, the problem has become worse in the last 25 years as the Whitlam and current Labor governments have sought to increase power at the centre. This is in direct conflict with the very purpose of a federation, where there is a proper division of powers to reflect the traditions and requirements of the modem state. To have two, and sometimes three in our case, levels of government providing the same or very similar services can only result in duplication, or obviously triplication by definition, and a resultant waste of our resources. Our aim in Australia should be to provide the public with quality government at the lowest possible cost. Our current level of duplication does not and will not allow that to' occur and, quite frankly, penalises the community.through higher taxes and unnecessary confusion. This confusion gets back to the lack of knowledge of which government is really responsible for the provision of particular services. We all, as individual representatives, encounter that confusion in state our electorate offices day by day. It is absolutely necessary for the federal government to voluntarily apply shackles to its own ever-expanding activities and set clear parameters within which it wi11legislate. This may involve leaving many functions in which the Commonwealth now dabbles to the states. It also more than suggests the need for the states to give the Commonwealth powers to legislate on some agreed national issues; If the Commonwealth is to seriously cut back on recurrent expenditure, it should seriously examine the issue ()f federal-state duplication. Too many public servants are employed by Commonwealth departments and agencies to develop policies and guidelines for the spending of grants by the states. more are employed to simply monitor how the states spend the money they get from the Commonwealth, by way of grants or otherwise. The states obviously have their own bureaucracies that develop policy to suit the needs of their own states and that is the way it should be, I think. Who can say that state governments do not know best what their populations want and what is in their best interests? The government which is, closest the people knows best what the people want.

SALES TAX (LOW-ALCOHOL WINE) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 10 May. Second Reading",106
204,Mr GEAR,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time, I propose to return the sales tax rate on alcohol wine, cider and similar beverages have an alcohol content of 1.15 per cent or le-s by volume from 12 per cent' to the concessional rate, which, is currently 11 per cent. This measure will place low alcohol wine, cider and similar beverages on the same footing as their main competitor; non-alcoholwe ic beverages consisting wholly of Australian fruit juice. Non-alcoholic grape and apple juice, either carbonated or non-carbonated, are examples of the beverages that are sold in competition with the low alcohol wines.' The cost to the revenue is estimated to be $0.4 million in 1994-95, rising to $0.6 million in 1996-97. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated to honourable mem';' Even bers. I commend the bill to the House.",110
205,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"The Sales Tax (Low-alcohol Wine) Amendment Bill 1994 will, as the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Ge-r), has just indicated, remove the current treatment of low alcohol wines-that is, wines not more than 1.15 per cent by volume of alcohol-and return them to the concessional rate currently set at 11 per cent. Obviously, the effect will be to reduce the present rate to from 12 per cent to 11 per cent. This bill amends three acts: the Sales Tax (Customs) (Wine-Deficit Reduction) Act - 1993, the Sales Tax (Excise) (Wine-Deficit Reduction) Act 1993 and the Sales Tax (General) (Wine-Deficit Reduction) Act 1993. Are the titles of those acts not a nonsense, since each has deficit reduction in its title but' each involves an 'increase or an imposition of a new tax? The language used by this government to obfuscate""confuse an<l conceal the real effect of its legislation is bordering on childish. We have examples of that arising out of last year's budget. These three acts, rather than one, were initially required because of the constitutional issiles raised at the time by the Senate involving a tax on wine. That tax was imposed for the first time in last year's budget and represented a betrayal of the electorate in the wake of the 1993 general election. The future increases that were then passed-I remind the House that they were in that legislation-as low, part of the 1993-94 budget measures for that commencement on 1 July 1995 and 'I July 1996 will also be removed. So there we have it-a Labor government apparently seeking partial absolution. ' We were opposed to the original' bills as passed by both houses last year. As a result, naturally do not oppose the measure before us, because it proposes an 'effective, reduction of an offensive and counterproductive tax. Reduced tax rates o.n IDW alcDhDI wine and similar prDducts shDuld be enCDuraged as a general rule, but so. shDuld lower tax levels Dverall.

In the event, bDth the Australian DemDcrats arid an unrepresentative few in the wine industry tDDk the easy way out and did the mDst curiDuS of deals.

The whDlesale sales tax(will increase by Dne per cent on and from 1 July 1995, and the rate on IDW alcDhDI wine, cider and similar beverages will also. increase by Dne percentage pDint to 12 per cent on and frDm 1 July 1995. So. it is Dnly a tempDrary respite. The financial impact of this bill will be a lDSS to. CDmmDnwealth revenue of an illgDtten $0.4 milliDn in 1994-95, $0.5 milliDn in 1995-96 and $0.6 milliDn in 1996-97 and the ensuing financial year. Overall, the amDunt of CDmmDnwealth revenue that is fDrgDne from this bill might be said to. be negligible. To. the extent that that is the case, it is a change fDr the better that the sales tax on IDW alcDhDI wine and similar products will be cut. The cDnsumptiDn of these IDW alcDhDI products and light beers shDuld be encDuraged ahead of full strength alcDhDlic drinks. I believe that mDst honourable members are aware Dr have SDme idea of the tDtal CDStS of beef excessive alcDhDI cDnsumptiDn. A study entitled 'Estimating the eCDnDmic CDSts of drug abuse in Australia' by David CDllins and Helen Lapsley was published in 1991. AmDngst Dther things, it said: Alcohol consumption represents estimated expenditure on alcohol by abusers, net of taxes and subsidies, estimated to be $1,651 million. This represents the resources which would have been released to the community in 1988 had there been no abuse of alcohol. The net health care CDstS - in 1988 tDtalled a claimed $581 milliDn, with the largest CDmpDnent being an extra Dperating CDst to' the hDspital system of $388 milliDn. With the spiralling CDStS of health care, I suppDse these alcDhDI related CDsts wDuld nDW be much higher-that is, if the escalated CDsts are to. be believed Dr are in any way near accurate. The CDstS may not Dnly translate into. increased budgetary Dutlays fDrthe hDspital system but also. impact on the number of peDple killed in car accidents, the increased level of risk in the wDrkplace and the catastrDphic level of family breakdDwns. . The CDst of road accidents in 1988 where alcDhDI was said to. be a majDr cause was a claimed $212.2 milliDn. I am sure it is a truism that tDD many of us still drink and drive having little regard to. the well-being of Dther rDad users and pedestrians. The human death tDll is the WDrst aspect of this irrespDnsible behaviDur, althDugh there is also. the CDSt to. the cDmmunity of the extr- hDspital beds needed and the clearing up of accident sites. Then there is the untDld damage dDne to. the relatives of victims-and no. price can be put on that. The value of IDSt prDductiDn due to. alcohol in 1988 was an estimated $801.2 million. The workplace is an area where occupational health and safety issues are made worse by . those who drink on the job or who come to work a little under the weather after a heavy night before. In many cases, such workers are a danger to themselves and others: Perhaps they should be sent home when they pose a danger to other workers. But we know that the industrial relations laws overseen by this government and some state govemments make that a practical impossibility on occasions. This is especially so in industries such as construction, where the workplace has obvious and, I can assure the House from personal experience, sometimes not so obvious dangers. As many honourable members well know, we all like an occasional drink. But there is a need for governments to try to reduce excessive alcohol abuse without resorting to the excesses pursued by the anti-tobacco zealots.",110
206,Mr GEAR,Unknown,Don't get on to tobacco.,112
207,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"George, are you telling me that you do not like to drink? Ms Crawford-No. If we finish now, we can have one.",112
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! This is no time for a conversation between members on both sides of the House. The speaker's addresses will be made through the chair.,112
209,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,Of course they will. I welcome the interest of the Assistant Treasurer. I am delighted that on this rare occasion he is in here to look at a measure for which he is responsible.,112
210,Mr GEAR,Unknown,I am usually too busy.,112
211,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"He interjects that he is usually too busy. I wonder what he is too busy doing. He is not too busy simplifying the tax laws, although that has been promised for three or four years. He is not too busy to delegate the responsibility for seeing the carriage of legislation subcontracted to parliamentary secretaries and others. He is not too busy to dodge the responsibility for which he is paid a handsome sum and has the right to certain amenities, such as a big white car. That aside, this measure is only one policy change that is unlikely, by itself, to have any noticeable impact on the volume of alcohol consumed. However, when combined with education campaigns and other measures, it could make some difference. We are already seeing a decline in alcohol consumption per capita. As I mentioned previously, the coalition is more than happy to see Labor reduce at least one tax, albeit minimally. However, Labor's tax record is not a good one. It is not one of which it can be very proud. Indeed, its record is one of deceit. Prior to the last election, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised the Australian people that there would be no tax increases if his government were re-elected. That is a matter of history. It is not disputed that the 1993-94 budget simply demonstrates the deceit to which I have referred. As you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, Labor used that budget as a means of increasing a whole raft of taxes and breaking promises too numerous to recall. The budget increased the price of petrol by 3c per litre on 18 August 1993, a further 2c per litre on leaded petrol from 1 January 1994 and a further 2c per litre on leaded petrol on 1 August 1994. All that has implications for the Loan Bill and Commonwealth borrowings. Obviously, tax increases have the effect of reducing it. They can be measured against the prospective and probably more desirable reductions in expenditure that would achieve the same end without further impositions on the Australian population. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that, in those days, the government used the imagery of small children to justify its tax grab through the petrol pump. One cannot sink much lower than that. It was not even used in an election context. By any standards, it was a pathetic ploy that only served to heighten to new extremes Labor's cynicism towards government, claimed on the part of the Australian people. . After all, Labor is always talking about social justice and looking after the poor. What was fair about hitting the poor at the petrol bowser while dishing out money to the ing wealthy? What was just or fair about slashing the value of older cars owned by low income earners while reducing the price of cars? We all know that Labor's support of social justice is a sham. Labor's social justice catch. calls would do Goebbels proud. Labor screws the less well off but convinces them that it is really looking after their best interment ests. That is like Goebbels if ever there were an example. Labor is only interested in vote catchers. The 1993-94 budget also introduced a on long service leave. This is an insidious that retrospectively impacts on all accumulatmay, ed long service leave. Sales tax on wine increased by 55 per cent, which is the reason for this bill now before us. The government, in its rush to gain extra revenue, never voted thought to limit the increase in sales tax low-alcohol wine, despite the enjoiners of honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andin rew) and others. Other tax rises include the tax imposed credit unions and the new tax on frequent flyer schemes. There is the famous government backdown on tax cuts that is up there with George Bush's 'read my lips, no new taxes' comment. The government reneged on its program of tax cuts that was supposed to be set in concrete. Remember those tax cuts that were I-a-w? If we believe this mob, they have now been deferred until 1988. But we will never see them. The No. 1 reason for that is that Labor government will not be in power and that other tax measures and expenditure . reduction measures will be in place by then. This year's budget increases the overall take. The tax increases in this budget are implemented by stealth rather than openly .upping tax rates. Bracket creep is an easy way for governments to increase income taxes, especially when they do not have the courage to raise taxes by legislative means. Labor criticised the previous Liberal government for the impact of bracket creep on the total tax take, but Labor, in its decade or· more in power, has done nothing to redress the situaones tion, and nor will it. Labor's record is a debacle. This is the case even before the complexity of the tax system, the high cost of compliance and the frequency of legislative change, all of which the Assistant luxury Treasurer can claim credit for. We do not oppose this bill because it confers a benefit. Of course we will not, given the rapacious approach of this governtowards taxation generally. I will dwell momentarily on this bill, which is under the guillotine until 10.30 p.m. It is a measure which we do not, and never did, oppose. If the government was of a mind to and foltax lowed its own rhetoric, it could have been tax referred to the Main Committee. Be that as it it was not a measure which was required was or deserved to be under the guillotine. We could have discussed this legislation and many of the departmental portfolios that were on earlier without this diabolical use of on the guillotine. So, once again, we have not the just arrogance towards the Australian people the area of taxation policy but arrogance towards the parliament through their elected on representatives in this place. The consequence of applying the guillotine may not be apparent to all, but once it is applied my colleagues and I decide that we are not even going to prepare. We do not even devote time to the legislation because we think we will not have an opportunity to air our views or to air views which represent those of our constituents. And so we have this nonsense of an unnecessary guillotine. Unless my friend the honourable member for Wakethe field takes up his full time, we will be through this debate before - the time allotted for it expires. I know he will try. Even if he does not take up the time, it is unnecessary to tax have the guillotine on this measure.",112
212,Mr GEAR,Unknown,Prove it.,113
213,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"The Assistant Treasurer knows very well that this is quite unnecessary. These bills-omitting the departmental stages of the appropriation bills,because that matter is the subject of another earlier debate and I would be out of order if r went into itdo not have to be under the guillotine. The the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has listed for subsequent sittings this week do examinnot have to be under the guillotine. I have said before that we do not even have to have a second chamber. It will make it easier, but we do not need it. All we have to do is sit in this place for a reasonable number of days. We have hundreds of billions of dollars invested in a parliament building to allow the House of Representatives, under this executive' government, to sit 60 days a year. This chamber is empty for 305 days a year306 in a leap year. We do not need the second chamber. All we have to do is sit in the parliament more. So we have this nonsense of a guillotine that we go through time and again. When the Leader of the House brought down the guillotine earlier this afternoon, I heard him rationalising, 'Well, we have three sittings now.' All that means is that we have fewer bills under the guillotine in each of three sittings-but they total the same number anyway. It does not indicate that we are going to get a government which is more committed to the parliament or more committed to the effective and efficient management of government business and government legislation. It is a nonsense that this particular bill should be under the guillotine, as I believe it is a nonsense that most of the legislation this week has been subjected to the guillotine. The coalition does not oppose the legislation. Under those. circumstances, I can riot understand why the government needs a guillotine.",113
214,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,"I appreciate the accommodation by you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) and by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in allowing me to participate brieny in this debate. I rise to speak on the Sales Tax (Low-alcohol Wine) Amendment Bill 1994 because the implication of the amendment bill affects my electorate more. directly than any other electorate represented in this chamber. The introduction of this bill by the government is applauded by the opposition because, as the honourable member for Curtin has said, the bill is all about tax equity. As to the downside to the bill, the point made by the honourable member for Curtin is absolutely right. We are here debating this bill because the government failed to do its homework in the preparation of the 1993 budget and failed to appreciate the unintended consequences of the 1993 budget. Consequently, the bill before the House is designed to address those unintended consequences. As the honourable member for Curtin has said, the proposal in the 1993 budget was avery simple one. It was devastating from the point of view of my electorate. The proposal was to take wine, which was then taxed' at 20 per cent, and lift its tax rate to 31 per cent. This proposal was opposed by the industry and by the opposition. It was a successful industry that had built up its overseas sales program dramatically. In export terms it had gone from an almost insignificant export base to an export base of 80 million litres each year. It had a target, the which it may very well realise, of producing in excess of $1 billion in export income by the year 2000. This was the industry, looking so successful, that attracted a new tax regime from this government. Frankly, what the wine industry has s-en while this government has been in power has been a dramatic change in its fortunes. It is not particularly to the government's credit, but I must recognise that while this government has been in office the wine industry has seen this dramatic change. When I first came into this parliament and the Hawke government then came into power, the wine industry was in all sorts of .trouble. It entertained and was involved in a vine pull scheme in the years 1984 and 1985. So desperate was the outlook for wine grape growing in Australia that the government saw the only way out for primary producers being the government's participation in some sort of vine pull scheme. The government, appropriately, intervened at that stage. It is incredible that in less than a decade we have seen this dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of the wine industry. It is fair to' say that the wine industry can now claim to be largely independent of government support. There is very little government involvement in the industry. There is some assistance with' research and development. There is no protection from imports. There are no tariff walls currently preventing the importation of wine products into Australia; This is an industry which is labour intensive. It dramatically value adds; It has become the benchmark for a number of other industries that the government is seeking to encourage. It is fair to say that while the ALP has been in power the wine industry in Australia has seen a. drarriatic recovery, although I would hasten to add that I do not think the government can solely claim the credit for that. My criticism was that in the last budget the industry, being seen to have taken the first tentative steps to a positive. recovery, then found itself saddled with a substantial tax. was saddled with a proposal to raise the base tax on wine from 20 per cent to 31 per centan effective hike of 55 per cent. For that reason, as everyone in this House is aware, the industry and the coalition joined forces and said that they would frustrate the government's·budget process because they felt that this sort of impost on the wine industry was unfair. Ultimately the industry capitulated. The government put to ita package that suggested that .the industry would progressivebecause ly be taxed at a tax rate that would increase from 21 per cent to 26 per cent.The government agreed to an inquiry into the industry in the interim. This bill is about the way in which· a fledgling industry associated with the wine industry was. caught up in that government proposal. While the honourable member for Curtin made .much of the increase in sales tax from 20 per cent to 31 per cent, even more dramatic was the.· proposal to rais- the tax low-alcohol wine from 10 per cent to 21 per cent, which effectively was over a 100 per cent tax slug on the low alcohol wine industry. There was good reason to be indignant about that. Here Was an industry offering an alternative to alcoholic beverages for those who for one reason or another find it difficult to responsibly use alcoholic beverages. This industry was saddled---'-it may have been unintended-with a tax hike of over 100 per cent. The industry caught in this was the industry producing alcoholic beverages with an alcoholic content of under 1.15 per cent. In my electorate, one of the largest producers of low alcohol wine is a winery known as Chateau Yaldara. The product it has specialised in is a de-alcoholised wine, the alcohol content of which is well below 1.15 per cent. In fact, the average alcohol content is probably 0.5 per cent. This de-alcoholised wine is produced by a vacuum process. With the use of a vacuum, the alcoholic spirit is taken off and the alcohol content of the wine is reducedtoO.5 per cent, as I have said. This is an alcohol level that is all but insignificant. But this produc:t was being treated by the government as if it It were an alcoholic beverage of closet to 1.15 per cent. Chateau Yaldara found that its dramatically low-alcohol product was disadvantaged'in shelf price terms compared with its competitors. Chateau Yaldara pointed out to me that it was seen as being competition for the wine industry but, in reality, its major competitors were non-alcoholic beverages, such as grape juice, which trade under brand names such as Grapella. Chateau Yaldarawas facing a real shelf price differential simply of this budget decision. As a result, its market share was lost because its product was seen as being priced out of the market relative to its major competitors, which were 10w-alcoh()1 or non-alcoholic drinks principally of pure fruit content. . All of this was done for what was effectively negligible budgetary impact. To be fair, I must acknowledge that, having approached the office of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on a number ofoccasi.ons and having earlier this on year put a question without notice on this issue to the then recently appointed Treasurer, the Treasurer did respond. I believe .that part of what we are currently dealing with tonight is a restIlt of the Treasurer's response to my question. I regret that the question was necessary and I regret the unintended consequences that occurred, but I acknowledge that the Treasurer was at least gracious enough to recognise the inconsistency .in what the government was proposing. In the interests of tax equity, the Assistant Treasurer has introduced this legislation which largely addresses that inequity. In that sense, I welcome it. While I have the opportunity to deal with this question of beverage inequity, I would also like to point out to the Assistant Treasurer, while he is here tonight, that one of the other areas of major tax inequity currently affecting horticultural and viticultural products has also been taken up by the government but has not been acted on legislatively. I refer to the inequity that currently occurs with respect to the way fruit juice is taxed in Australia. I trust that the Assistant Treasurer is aware of the proposal from one of his own colleagues, Senator Nick Sherry, who is chairman of the horticulture task force. He recommended that pure fruit juice in Austraiia. ought to. be treated as tax exempt. That was. meant to be a particular handout to the fruit industry: It was. J:ecogniti(;m of the fact that under GAIT the current arrangement which exists for the fruit juice industry, which allows those Australian . producers who produce a product containing at least 25 per cent Australian juice to have a tax reduced regime, will be lost because that proposal is seen as GATT unfriendly. . . . Senator Sherry has recommended that, in orderto compensate fonhat, the government ought to consider. making pure fruit juice products tax exempt.. I would like to commend that to the Assistant Treasurer. It does have areal sense of equity about it. Pure milk, which is a beverage that is unadulterated and that has no flavouring added, is tax exelIlpt. I fail to see why one who squeezes a pure food product out of fruit should be disadvantaged compared with someone who squeezes a pure food product out of an udder. It would seem to me that the two tasks are much the same. What is being produced is a pure food product. It would be appropriate for the government, in the interests of tax equity and in the interests of recognising the disadvantage that will be suffered under the GAIT negotiations,. to act on this in the same spirit as it has acted in the interests· of the lowalcohol wine industry. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third readmg to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Gear) read a third time. NA Motion (by Mr Gear) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Glengarry Primary School",114
215,Mr FILING,Unknown,"MY address this evening is about enVironmental education at Glengarry Primary SchooHn my electorate. Education about the environment, in the environment and for the environment is becoming important in our' community. Responsible management of our environment is also becoming increasingly important to the planning of industries and the work of governments. Recognising this,. the Glengarry Primary School community has encouraged the development of a comprehensive environmental education program at its school. Glengarry Primary School has received state and national recognition for the excellence of its environmental' education. program. The school has won several awards for its work, including the Education Department Innovations Award of $2,500;· the Energy Management Award of $5,000 from the government of Western Australia; the Earthworm Award; the John Tonkin Greening WA Award; the Grouping Greenies' Award from Family Circle; and the Uncle Toby's Landcare Award. The school was also a finalist in the Young Achievers Award. The school has also received other forms of recognition. Television reports and documen'taries, such as on the 7.30 Report, have focused on the exemplary nature of the school's environmental program. The' school was featured' at the national RecyCle 93 conference. It also attracted the attention of environmental educators and community groups from other states and overseas. Locally, the school has strong links to local government and assists a range of schools and organisations with their environmental programs. The Glengarry Primary School ,community now invites key industries, government agencies, community groups and other organisations to join with it: in widening the support for environmental education' across the school system and the community. I refer to the Glengarry Environment Centre. To support the progressive nature of the school's programs and to further encourage innovation, the school environment committee, the HOPE group, has decided to establish an environment· education centre on the Glengarry Primary School site. The goal or mission of the centre will be to develop Glengarry Primary School as a key centre for best practice in environmental education, responding to the needs of its students and community, while assisting other schools, other agencies, industry and community organisations with environmental education. To achieve this. goal, the Glengarry Environment Centre will develop more effective ways to educate young··people to work as responsible and informed citizens capable of developing and improving their environment. It will demonstrate environmental projects that other schools can use, as models for environmental education. It will demonstrate and apply environmentally friendly technologies. It will provide direct support to teachers in other schools in the development of environmentally based teaching programs, learning experiences based on special projects and·school environmental policy. It will assist other agencies and organisations in the development of relevant education materials; for example, those based on landcare, energy conservation, wetland rehabilitation, recycling, safe environmental practices and environmenta monitoring. The Glengarry Environment Centre will provide in-service courses for teachers, often in collaboration. with 9ther organisations. It will assist other agencies and organisations to provide special environmental education experiences for students; for example, those based on environmental camps, excursions and competitions. It will facilitate the distribuof tion of information about environmental projects and programs to schools and the community. It will support and lead networks of environmental educators. It will display evidence of student achievements and important environmental information. It will also encourage appropriate research by tertiary educators concerning environmental education. The centre will be staffed by a person experienced jn environmental education, and this position hopefully will be funded and sponsored by the education department of Western Australia. The centre will be constructed according to solar passive design prjnciples and will have multHunctional work, display and storage areas, The day-today operation of the centre will be managed by the education department, through the principal, with guidance from a management advisory group. The advisory group is likely to consist of representatives from the school community; the HOPE group; sponsors; teachers; and the education department. In conclusion, I would like to thank Mr Alan Lloyd, a very well-known local environmental. activist in my electorate, for providing me with this information .about the Glengarry Environment Centre. I am well aware of the tremendous input that Glengarry Primary School makes to student environment education'. I commend this project to the pariiament and my 'local community. i . Child Support Agency",116
216,Mr TAYLOR,Unknown,-:.J want very briefly to mention· three words that my constituent officer in my electorate dreads qIore. than anything else. Those three words are 'Child Support Agency'. Ms Crawford-Don't we all?,117
217,Mr TAYLOR,Unknown,"As the honourable member opposite said, 'Don't we all?' Over the last year or so we have heard a. lot about the Child Support Agency through the comprehensive first report of the inquiry into the operation of the Family Law Act conduc-ed by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues; through the honourable  that inquiry. into the Child Support Agency; the child support inquiry hotline; and, as has been said earlier, through the numerous complaints and inquiries that all of our electorate offices receive. Earlier today a very scathing report from the Australian National Audit Office was tabled in this place, and yet again it reported on the management and operations of the Child Support Agency. It found very serious deficiencies, unacceptable delays in dealing with client phone calls and letters, unsatisfactory management of debtors and ineffective tracing of the defaulting debtors and variations in branch procedures. The report made recommendations that undoubtedly will be looked at by members and committees of this House. It talked about the need to improve recording and reporting, corporate planning, performance monitoring andreporting, staff training, and the development of resource management. The report went on to say that the Child Support Agency has accepted the majority of the Australian National Audit Office recommendations and acknowledges the value of feedback on its performance. However, the Child Support Agency claims that the lack of staff resources is retarding the implementation of some of the recommendations of the Australian National Audit Office. There is a new initiative being started in Queensland which will get under way in the Toowoomba area next week. The Deputy Child Support Registrar . in Brisbane, Bill Mulherin, and his staff will be starting a help al!d awareness project. My understanding is that this is the first project of its type in Queensland and maybe the first of its type in this country. It will examine why the Child Support Agency and the individuals affected by that agency are having so many problems. I have been told by the Deputy Child Support Registrar that my electorate has the largest CSA case load in Queensland. I do not know whether or not that is true. As a result, starting on 14 June and running to 24 June there will be a series of help and awareness seminars involving individuals, schools and community organisations in the Toowoomba area. As of tomorrow, a hotline will be established to set up, the necessary appointments for that· help and awareness project. I hope that as a result of that project we find out a lot more about the Child Support Agency, and I hope that the project will be expanded into other states and other electorates. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 9.34 p.m. NA The followillg notices were given: MrFiling to move-' That this House: (1) deplores the practiCe of university-employed academiCs utilising uncosted university facilities to unfairly compete with the private sector for consulting work; and (2) cans on the Government to legislate to stop the practice. Mr Bilney to present a Bill for an Act to amend legislation relating to the environment, sport and Territories, and for related purposes. Mr Free to present a Bill for an Act to amend the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992, and for related purposes. NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 7 June 1994: Navigation Act-Order 1994 No.5. Veterans' Entitlements Act-Instrument 1994 No.3. The following answers to questions were circulated: Superannuation (Question No. 313) Mr Hawker asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 30 August 1993: (1) How many members of superannuation schemes who were part-time or .casual employees accrued less benefits in their funds during (a) 1990-91, (b) 1991-92 and (c) 1992-93 than was contributed by their employers. (2) Of the contributions referred to in part (1), what was the total loss in value in each year (a) net and (b) allowing for reasonable earnings. (3) Which five industry groups employed most members of superannuation schemes disadvantaged in the manner described in part (1). (4) How many employees in each industry group were disadvantaged. . (5) What proportion of the total number of employees in each industry group were disadvantaged.",117
218,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"The answer to .the honourable member's question is as follows: As regulator of the superannuation industry, the ISC is concerned with monitoring the prudential standards of 70 000 superannuation funds by requiring them to report annually to the ISC and subjecting them to a systematic audit regime. The ISC focuses upon monitoring the prudential standards of superannuation funds, as opposed to monitoring the membership within each fund, and currently does not collect detailed information about the individual characteristics of members of these funds. (It does collect basic aggregate information) The ISC together with the Australian Bureau of Statistics, is conducting a feasibility study gating the possibility of establishing regular surveys of superannuation funds. Should such a survey be established then general statistical questions, such as that asked by the Honourable Member for Wannon, could be more easily answered. NA Unanswered Question on Notice (Question No. 950)",119
219,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"the Ministers for Transport and Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 1 March 1994: When may I expect an answer to question No. 504 which first appeared on the Notice Paper on 20 October 1993.",119
220,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Minister for Communications and the Arts and I provided a joint answer to the honourable member's question. The answer to question No. 504 appeared in the Daily Hansard, on 30 May 1994 (page 983). Human Rights (Question No. 1018) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 23 March 1994: (I)What was the outcome of the items on human rights placed by the Commonwealth and others on the agenda of the meeting.of the - tanding Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) on 4 November 1993. . (2) What items on human rights were placed on the agenda of the meeting of SCAG on 18 February 1994. (3) By whom was each item ,referred to in part (2) placed and what was the outcome. (4) When and where will the next meeting be held.",119
221,Mr LAVARCH,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Part (I) The items relating to human rights on the agenda, and the outcome of those items, were as follows: Age Discrimination Ministers noted an officer's paper and agreed that investithe matter be removed from the agenda. The officer's paper recommended that age discrimination be removed from the agenda given that the Commonwealth/State working party on age discrimination had completed its work on age discrimination and superannuation and that further work was not to be undertaken by the working party at that time. Ministers agreed that the working party should be reconvened if there was a need and that the issue of age discrimination could be relisted on the SCAG agenda if that occurs. Paedophile Sex Tours Ministers noted that the Commonwealth would make its draft legislation available as· soon as possible and agreed to consider what complementary .legislation was necessary at that time. It was also noted by Ministers that the Commonwealth would include a provision in its legislation to make it clear that it was not the intention to cover the field. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Report on Racist Violence Ministers noted an officer's paper and agreed that the matter be removed from the agenda. The officer's paper detailed the major areas of concern in the Report to the States and Territories and that the States and Territories (other than Victoria) had reported on all relevant recommendations. Ministers also asked officers to restore the item to the agenda if progress of general interest to Ministers is made in the implementation of any of the relevant recommendations of the Commission's report. Human Rights Matters Ministers noted the Commonwealth paper on human rights matters and a report by the Commonwealth Attorney-General on the. arrangements in place for consultation between the Commonwealth and States in relation to the negotiation of treaties and their implementation. The Commonwealth paper on human rights matters contained a general report on current issues arising in the human rights area as relevant in the Australian context. Report of the Legal Working Party on the Inter Governmental Committee on AIDS Ministers noted that the Report on HIV/AIDS by the Inter Governmental Committee AIDS Working Party has made a number of recommendations for uniform legislation and agreed that the matter was suitable for consideration at their next meeting. Part (2) The items on human rights on the agenda of the SCAG meeting of 18 February 1994 were as follows: Report of the Legal Working Party. on the Inter Governmental Committee on AIDS Paedophile Sex Tours Human Rights Matters Part (3) The items mentioned under part (2) above were placed on the agenda by the Commonwealth except the paedophile sex tours item which was a Commonwealth/Western. Australia item. The outcome of each item was as follows: Report of the Legal Working Party on the Inter Governmental Committee on AIDS Ministers noted the officer's paper and requested officers to report further progress at· the next m-ting. The officer's paper included an attachment providing a progress report on implementation at the Commonwealth, State and Territory level of the recommendations of the Report of the Legal Working Party on the Inter Governmental Committee on AIDS. Paedophile Sex Tours Ministers· noted a Commonwealth Information Paper summarising measures contained in a draft Bill to be introduced in the (then) current session and action proposed on a number of related issues. The Commonwealth Minister for Justice indicated noted he would be happy for the Commonwealth Bill to be referred to the Parliamentary Counsel's Committee for it to be considered in connection with requests by other jurisdictions for complementary or supplementary legislation. (The Commonwealth BiII concerning this issue was introduced in the Parliament in the Autumn 1994 sittings and has now been referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs). Human Rights Matters Ministers noted the Commonwealth paper on human rights matters. The Commonwealth paper on human rights matters contained a general report on current issues arising in· the human rights area as relevant in the Australian context. Part (4) The next meeting of SCAG will be held in Brisbane on 21 july 1994. Hearing Aids for Part Pensioners (Question No; 1076) Mr Bradford asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: Are part pensioners to receive free hearing aids through the Australian Hearing Service; if so, (a) how many part pensioners have applied· for free hearing aids, (b) how does that number compare with the Government's original estimates, (c) what was the initial estimate of the cost of the provision of free hearing aids to part pensioners, (d) has the estimated cost been revised, (e) what has the provision of free hearing aids· to part pensioners cost arid (f) what is the current waiting time for service under the new arrangements;",119
222,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes: (a) The number is unknown. Applications to Australian Hearing Services (AHS) do not distinguish between full and part pensioners. (b) At the time Commonwealth fringe benefits were made available to part pensioners (I April 1993), the Government estimated that 38,000 part pensioners would apply to AHS for services over two years. (c) $3.5m in 1992-93; $8.2m in 1993-94. (d) A revised estimate of the cost of services provided to part pensioners is not available (see (a». However, the estimated cost of services to be provided by AHS contractors in 1993-94 has been revised to $31m. This is attributed to high levels of demand from pensioners, due in some measure to the attractiveness of programmable hearing aids provided by AHS, a greater take-up rate of concessions, and higher than anticipated contractor prices. (e) This cost cannot be established in the absence of numbers of part pensioners applying. (f) The average waiting time at AHS hearing centres in April was 6 weeks. Records of contractors' waiting times are not available to the Government, although AHS has not received any complaints from clients about lengthy times for services. Foreign Airline Pilots (Question No. 1106) Mr Thckey asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: (1) How many foreign airline pilots are licensed to operate commercially in Australia. (2) For which airlines do the pilots referred part (1) operate. (3) Will the pilots be required to return to their countries of residence when their Australian work or residency permits expire. (4) Is the Government encouraging foreign registered pilots to apply. for Australian work or residency permits.",121
223,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) & (2) The CAA has advised that to operate commercially in Australia, other than on a temporary basis, a foreign pilot must obtain an Australian Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) or Air Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). To achieve this, an applicant must pass the appropriate Air Law theory examination and flight test. Applicants for the ATPL are also required to hold an Australian command multi engine instrument rating which would involve an additional theory exam. Once the licence is issued and the CANs computer records are updated, there is no way of distinguishing those pilots who previously held overseas qualifications from those that were products of the Australian licensing system. In other words, once they are issued with the Australian licence, they are no longer considered 'foreign pilots' per se. The CAA is therefore unable to provide an accurate answer to the honourable member's questions. (3) This is a matter for the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. (4) I am not' aware of foreign registered pilots being encouraged to apply for Australian work or residency permits. 'Buy Australian' Program (Question No. 1126) Mr Moore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 4 May 1994: (I) Does the Minister's Department follow a 'Buy Australian' program; if so, (a) when was the program introduced and (b) what sum was spent advertising and promoting the program in (i) 198889, (ii) 1989-90, (iii) 1990-91, (iv) 1992-93 and (v) 1992-93. (2) What sum was spent within the Minister's Department on Australian made and overseas produced goods in (a) 1988-89, (b) 1989-90, (c) 1990-91, (d) 1991-92; and (e) 1992-93. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Scito in ence and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: . (l) The Department of Industry, Science and Technology does follow a 'Buy Australian' program in so far as its Secretary's Accounting Instructions provide: 'Wherever possible purchasing officers are to actively seek out potential Australian and New Zealand (ANZ) suppliers. This does not mean discriminating against foreign suppliers but giving ANZ suppliers full opportunity to compete'. (a) The above provision was inserted into the Secretary's Accounting Instructions in July 1991. (b) The Department did not spend any money externally advertising the program but awareness seminars and training of Departmental officers were held prior to the above inclusion in the Secretary's Accounting .Instructions. (2) The Department does not keep a record of what amounts are spent on Australian made and overseas goods. Child Care (Question No. 1146) Mr Slipper asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 10 May 1994: NA Electorate Bowman Brisbane Capricornia Dawson Dickson Fadden Fairfax Fisher Forde Griffith Groom Herbert Hinkler Kennedy Leichhardt Lilley MCPherson Maranoa Moncrief Moreton Oxley Petrie Rankin Ryan Wide Bay NA Department of Tourism: Cash Registers (Question No. 1202) Mr Downer asked the Minister for Tourism, upon notice, on 30 May 1994: (1) What is the total number of cash registers held by the Minister's Department. Which federal electoral divisions in Queensland have received places for Outside School Hours Care services under the 1992-96 National Child Care Strategy and how many places have been received in each case.",121
224,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,"The Minister for Family Services has provided the following answer to . the honourable member's question: CARE PLACES BY FEDERAL ELECTORATE, QUEENSLAND 23 MAY 1994 Approved Operational Not yet Operational 91 91 26 26 42 42 80 80 92 92 160 160 74 70 4 69 69 134 134 186 186 85 48 37 90 90 36 34 2 115 98 17 143 143 7 7 89 89 75 75 69 69 124 124 127 127 129 96 33 33 33 176 176 15 15 2267 2174 93 (2) What are the (a) brand names and (b) ages of the cash registers. . Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Nil. (2) N/A.",122
