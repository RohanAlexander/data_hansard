1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 12 pm and read prayers. NA  Speaker, I rise to advise the House of a possible breach of privilege. Last Thursday, 4 February, the Public Works Committee held a private meeting with officials of the Department of Defence to discuss the single living environment and accommodation precinct project phase 2, known as ‘Single LEAP 2'. At the meeting, the Defence officials emphasised that they would be discussing commercially sensitive information and requested the committee's agreement that the briefing be treated as confidential. The committee agreed that the briefing would be confidential. An article in the Townsville Bulletin of 5 February contained information provided to the committee at the briefing. The journalist identified his source as the honourable member for Herbert, a member of the committee. At a meeting called today, the committee resolved that it would investigate the newspaper article as representing an unauthorised disclosure of committee proceedings. The committee is particularly concerned that the unauthorised disclosures of information given in confidence may interfere with the committee's ability to hold frank discussions in future with officials about public works. I wish to advise the House that the committee will conduct its own inquiries and report its findings to both chambers.",19
2,The SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the member for Chifley, the Chief Government Whip, for his advice of the committee's actions. It is appropriate to indicate that that is the way in which these matters are handled, with the committee looking at the allegation in the first place. The House will await the report of the committee. NA Private Members' Motions",19
3,The SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,"In accordance with standing order 41(h), and the recommendations of the whips adopted by the House on 3 February 2010, I present copies of the terms of motions for which notice has been given by the members for Mayo, Fremantle and Kalgoorlie. These matters will be considered in the Main Committee later today.

4,Dr JENSEN,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I wish to speak on the misnamed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and related bills. Carbon in its natural state is graphite. Is that what the government is attempting to ban? If you cannot get the basic terminology right even in the title of the bill, BILL 2010 how are we supposed to believe that you are across all of the other issues relating to this? Today I want to talk about that old adage BILL 2010 that we all know to be true: whenever a Labor politician has a good idea, Australians have less money. Be it interest rates or inflaBILL 2010 tion deficits or taxing anything and everything, Australians know a Labor government means that they will have less money in their BILL 2010 pockets. The ETS legislation is a continuation of what all Australians know as the third certainty in life: that is, death, taxes and Labor pinching money out of your back pocket. BILL 2010 This ETS will rob the average Australian-or, just for the Prime Minister and his focus group, ‘working families'-out of their hard-earned money. The ETS is a highly complex engine for converting the useful, deployed wealth of our society into the least useful, most wasteful and insoluble substance on earth-pure profit for rich individuals. As we have seen overseas, the capand-trade systems create a speculative bubble which the finance industry loads up to BILL 2010 suck vast sums of money out of middleand lower-class wage-earners-those working families. With the aid of an intellectually corrupt edifice, the ETS, the Labor Party has created a legal exchange for the bankers and financiers to strip money out of the working class. This money will be put straight into the retirement accounts of hedge fund managers and speculative money spinners. Prime Minister-or, should that be, cap-and-trade of the notorious pirate ship, Labor's ETS tax-your government is trading not in carbon but in misery. Your pirates want to pillage the wallets of working Australians. The process is that banks and investment houses position themselves in the middle of a growing speculative carbon bubble and sell to their clients investments that they know are junk. A few traders, fund managers and savvy financiers then make millions inflating the price of that commodity. Essentially, these financiers are peddling an element on the periodic table that is free to anybody any time. In the end game, the financial bubble caused by the carbon bubble goes bust, leaving millions of ordinary citizens broke and starving. The government will then ride to the rescue of us all by lending us back our own money at interest. Thank you, cap-andtrade. Banks and financial institutions worldwide are preparing to do it all againcreating what may be the biggest and most audacious bubble yet. We have Mr Rudd and Ms Wong to thank for all that goes bust, though. The new carbon credit market is a virtual repeat of the commodities market casino that has been kind to Goldman, except it has one delicious new wrinkle: if the plan goes forward as expected, the rise in prices will be government mandated. Goldman will not even have to rig the game; it will be rigged in advance. Here is how it works. If the bill passes, there will be limits for coal plants, utilities, natural gas distributors and numerous other industries on the amount of carbon emissions-also known as greenhouse gasesthey can produce per year. If the companies go over their allocation, they will be able to buy allocations or credits from other companies that have managed to produce fewer emissions. President Obama conservatively estimates that about $646 billion worth of carbon credits will be auctioned in the first seven years. One of his top economic aides speculates that the real number might be twice or even three times that amount. The feature of this plan that has a special appeal to speculators is that the cap on carbon will be continually lowered by the government, which means that carbon credits will become more and more scarce with each passing year. That means that the volume of this brand new commodities market, where the main commodity to be traded is guaranteed to rise in price over time, will be upwards of a trillion dollars annually. For comparisons sake, the annual combined revenues of all electricity suppliers in the US total $320 billion. The plan is for money-spinners to get in on the ground floor of paradigmshifting legislation, make sure that they are the profit-making slice of that paradigm and make sure that the slice is a big slice. The economic impacts of an emissions trading scheme for an Australian workers are mixed-both good and bad, depending on which end of the economic scale you sit. For low-income earners, the cost-of-living increases will push many elderly and poor into abject poverty. A crazy situation when you consider that my state, Western Australia, is at the beginning of another resources boom, which has already put upward pressure on everyday prices. No possible compensation the government is offering will fully cover the inflated cost-of-living increases. Many pensioners, seniors and veterans are already struggling with everyday bills and necessities. An ETS will put everyday items out of reach. There are Australians who will benefit from an ETS, though-people who have seen it all before, a group of individuals whose job it is to turn ordinary commodities into tradeable profit. I am of course referring to bankers, fund managers and traders, who are circling the carbon market ready to turn the scheme into their next casino venture. What do I mean by casino venture? I am talking about financial institutions betting their houses on the market, which will wildly inflate the price of carbon credits. In this those banks and financiers who foresaw this boondoggle and got it off the ground floor will all retire as wealthy people. They have a vested interest in seeing this legislation being enacted and have much to lose if it does not. Labor has put us in an all or nothing economic situation. Our Prime Minister railed against the excesses of our market systems as the GFC hit fever pitch. It was, after all, market forces that inflated, caused and created the great bust of 1998. Yet on the greatest moral issue of our time where does he turn to solve these issues? The market. This new commodity market will see prices swing wildly up and down. Ultimately, a speculative bubble will be created, paper fortunes won and lost, and then it will all go horribly wrong when people realise the credits they are trading in are in fact worthless. The people who will be hit hardest are the mum and dad investors who will get caught up in the hysteria caused by the ETS-a huge, highly complex engine for converting the useful, deployed wealth of society into pure profit for rich individuals. The PM commented in Hansard on Tuesday, 2 February: We in the government accept what the IPCC has said. We accept what the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia has said. We accept also what the Australian Chief Scientist has said. The Prime Minister has obviously not been following the crisis in climate science: the junk science, the corruption, the collusion and the endemic lack of peer review. The member for Page talks about consensus. Think about consensus on religion here for a second. The consensus of trained experts is that a Christian god, in consensus terms, particularly in Australia, exists. So why do you reject that consensus? The fact is there is no such thing as consensus science. If there is a consensus, it is not science and if it is science it is not consensus-period. I will quote way the late, great Michael Crichton on some of the history of consensus science and the damage that it can do: In past centuries, the greatest killer of women was fever following childbirth. One woman in six died of this fever. In 1795, Alexander Gordon of Aberdeen suggested that the fevers were infectious processes, and he was able to cure them. The consensus said no. In 1843, Oliver Wendell Holmes claimed puerperal fever was contagious, and presented compelling evidence. The consensus said no. In 1849, Semmelweiss demonstrated that sanitary techniques virtually eliminated puerperal fever in hospitals under his management. The consensus said he was a Jew, ignored him, and dismissed him from his post. There was in fact no agreement on puerperal fever until the start of the twentieth century. Thus the consensus took one hundred and twenty five years to arrive at the right conclusion despite the efforts of the prominent ‘skeptics' around the world, skeptics who were demeaned and ignored. And despite the constant ongoing deaths of women. There is no shortage of other examples. In the 1920s in America, tens of thousands of people, mostly poor, were dying of a disease called pellagra. The consensus of scientists said it was infectious, and what was necessary was to find the ‘pellagra germ.' The US government asked a brilliant young investigator, Dr Joseph Goldberger, to find the cause. Goldberger concluded that diet was the crucial factor. The consensus remained wedded to the germ theory. Goldberger demonstrated that he could induce the disease through diet. He demonstrated that the disease was not infectious by injecting the blood of a pellagra patient into himself, and his assistant. They and other volunteers swabbed their noses with swabs from pellagra patients, and swallowed capsules containing scabs from pellagra rashes in what were called ‘Goldberger's filth parties.' Nobody contracted pellagra. The consensus continued to disagree with him. There was, in addition, a social factor-southern States disliked the idea of poor diet as the cause, because it meant that social reform was required. They continued to deny it until the 1920s. Result-despite a twentieth century epidemic, the consensus took years to see the light. Probably every schoolchild notices that South America and Africa seem to fit together rather snugly, and Alfred Wegener proposed, in 1912, that the continents had in fact drifted apart. The consensus sneered at continental drift for fifty years. The theory was most vigorously denied by the great names of geology-until 1961, when it began to seem as if the sea floors were spreading. The result: it took the consensus fifty years to acknowledge what any schoolchild sees. In the Australian context the views of our Nobel Prize winners, Warren and Marshall, ran counter to the consensus view on ulcers and, in fact, Barry Marshall induced ulcers within himself to demonstrate the cause. Once again, the consensus rejected that and they are now Nobel Prize winners. On 3 December Australia's Chief Scientist, Penny Sackett, was warning that climate oblivion was only a few years away: Like the world's leading climate scientists, Professor Sackett argues that there are about five years to avoid the dangerous damage generated if average global temperatures increased by more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. As it stands now, she said, a 1.3 degree temperature rise is all but ‘locked in'. ‘To meet the 2 degree target, we must halt increases in global emissions by about 2015, and then decrease them dramatically and steadily thereafter.' But as the Australian reported recently, ‘the consensus is receding faster than a Himalayan glacier'. It said: Australia's Chief Scientist, Penny Sackett, told the Australian last night that she shared Professor John Beddington's concernsProfessor Beddington is the British chief scientistProfessor Sackett said climate change was a scientific reality but there was a need for absolute openness and rigour in the presentation of evidence, including recognition of which aspects of (the) science were imprecise and required further research. I recall Professor Sackett giving evidence to the science committee and that she was not aware of the fact that the relationship between temperature and carbon dioxide is logarithmic. It is a relationship that goes back over 100 years and is represented in all the IPCC reports. She has the belief, but this fundamental relationship eluded her at the time. I have heard a lot of argument about precautionary principle. The government has used that argument a lot. Let us turn it around. The government wants to impose a great big new tax on the Australian people. Consider this: what if it is wrong? What if the vaunted consensus position changes? After all, if you had been making an argument 40 years ago for controlling the climate, you would have been looking at a scheme to stop the coming ice age, given that the scientific consensus at the time was that we were headed towards another ice age. Consider this: the government has proposed a great big new tax that is designed for one purpose and one purpose only-that is, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Consensus changes and the Australian people will have to pay this tax forever. The beauty of our scheme is that it is flexible. If the consensus changes, the policy can be changed. Our policy has distinct environmental advantages, including improving crop yields, getting more efficient underground transmission infrastructure and improving visual pollution. We hear a lot of discussion about how the world agrees that the ETS is a wonderful scheme. Think about this: the ETS has not been particularly effective in Europe. It has not been particularly effective at reducing CO2 emissions and certainly it has not been a very stable commodity to trade. Insanity is to keep doing the same thing and hoping for a different result. Even Britney Spears, people, sings: Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. The government's ETS tax has no mechanisms to actually reduce CO2 emissions. It is just a tax, and then they hope that the market will drive solutions. The government is corrupt enough in their view of this thing that they will not even consider the one method that really can bring down CO2 emissionsthat is, nuclear power. Labor's criticism of our scheme is based on soil carbons not being counted in international agreements. Who cares? Does the environment know if a molecule of CO2 is removed from the atmosphere using soil sequestration or tree sequestration? Clearly, the environment does not give a damn where the carbon dioxide is sucked into. It just demonstrates how badly constructed international agreements are on this, as evidenced by Copenhagen. Kerry O'Brien, Tony Jones and David Koch criticise from the safety of not allowing counterargument on their programs. I have challenged both Koch and Jones to have me on to discuss the science-funnily enough, they lack the guts to interview me on it. The members for Leichhardt and Lowe have suggested that members on this side who might agree with an ETS-and there are precious few of them, I might add-should cross the floor. How about letting some of the sceptics on the other side of the House cross the floor? I know of at least four cabinet ministers who are sceptics, but they do not have the guts to say so in public, never mind crossing the floor. On 2 February, Minister Combet said: What we have from the other side here is political opportunism, a recognition on the basis of their lack of acceptance of the science-their lack of respect for internationally peer reviewed science in the IPCC fourth assessment report. of all We have seen numerous problems with the IPCC fourth assessment report. We have seen numerous instances where propaganda articles from the WWF and Greenpeace are taken at face value and simply accepted as if they were peer reviewed science. On the other hand, there is the issue around Phil Jones, one of the lead authors with the IPCC and head of the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit, when he talked about changing the definition of what constitutes peer review.

5,Mr ADAMS,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"That was a performance by the previous member. He talked about conspiracy theories, pirates, bankers as devils and money-spinners all coming out of this legislation, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and related bills. I find it unbelievable and I think most of Australia would as well, as they have with the Liberal Party's policy on this, which is really a policy of convenience: ‘We need a policy, so we'll have a policy.' They have not dealt with the real issues that the government are endeavouring to do deal with in these bills. There has been much discussion on these bills already and it seems almost impossible to come up with more reasons as to why this legislation needs to be passed. I look at it this way: I have lived in this country all my life and I have watched the seasons come and go. I have seen changes in the elements over the last 50 years or so. I guess it has been about 50 years since I started taking notice of climate and changes in the weather. Growing up in the country, of course, it was always something that was talked about and looked at, and one noted what was happening. I have also noted that climate conditions have become more unsettled in the latter part of my time on earth. I do not know enough about all that science to say that global warming is actually occurring, but I do feel that the climate is changing on an irregular basis and there are many reasons for it to do so. There are some natural reasons for climate change, such as volcanic activity, changes in vegetation, bushfires and their aftermath, tidal patterns, river paths, the phases of the moon, wet seasons, dry seasons and a whole host of natural changes due to the cycles of weather, which influence what is going on at ground level. To this you add the activities of man and the animals we share the earth with. Man had has been able to influence and change some of the natural influences of climate through being able to harness some of our natural resources to make living in our world easier. We do like electricity to help us cook and heat and to make life more comfortable. We like having wood from our forests to build our houses, to make our furniture and to enjoy the nature of it. We enjoy eating fresh vegetables, fruit, grain, meat and fish and processing them-and, of course, we like our wine and the good old amber fluid. We also have the tendency to fight each other. In order to have these basics of life, to be able provide everyone with these commodities and to have a surplus for trade, we have manipulated their production. If you have, as most people do, a basic understanding of chemistry, then you understand that when you add elements to the atmosphere there will be changes, some of them good and some of them not altogether desirable. With any sort of mass production there is a waste stream-emissions, if you like. That waste stream also has to be dealt with, whether by recycling it, by reusing it in some way or by disposing of it safely. We do those things a lot better than we used to, when we started mass production. Whatever we do, and however we do it, there is an element of cost. There will always be an element of cost. If, therefore, we are trying to minimise man's effect on the earth, then there is an expense attached to it. We have been aware of that for some time. There is the cost of dealing with waste. When people live together in high-density environments, the land cannot deal with the waste naturally. We have to intervene-to take it away, to pump it out or do something else to deal with it. This is the same with whatever product or activity we are coping with, whether it be the waste from a steel mill or the waste from a chicken coop. Hopefully you would put the chicken poop back into the ground to make it better-we have learnt to take some of the waste from our production and turn that into a plus for us as well. It all has a cost attached to it in some way. Science has helped in many ways to deal with waste, whether it be by recycling it, reusing it, rendering it inert or carefully destroying it-but, whatever you do, or how careful you are, there is always a bit left over. I expect it is a bit like when we take something apart and put it back togetherto there is always something left sitting on the kitchen table or on the workbench that does not seem to belong anywhere. There is always something, and sometimes these things tend to add up. So I say to Mr Abbott: it does not matter how much you bluster and carry on about a great big tax; I am afraid you are already paying for it, and have been paying for it for centuries. What the government is trying to do, without the help of the opposition, is to make waste a tradeable commodity so that it makes sense economically to do something about it. There is nothing new in paying for emissions. It has just become a little more urgent that we all help to pay-and by ‘all' I mean on a global scale. It therefore makes economic sense to start setting some boundaries domestically, so that we can keep up with change. This government is also keen to ensure that some of the less economically fortunate in our community do not suffer unduly from change. That is why we are proposing to help relieve them from taking on a greater burden in their day-today lives by allowing some household assistance as the change occurs. It seems likely that we will need to do more to alleviate the problems of our waste streams, but what is less certain is by what quantity and how much that will cost. So there is a need for some risk management-a bit of insurance, if you like. In an article entitled ‘Climate change: hedging your climate-change bets', appearing in Science in October 2005, Richard A Kerr says that: … uncertainty can justify an alternative to benefit analysis called risk management, an approach people take when they buy insurance. “Uncertainty is the reason you buy insurance,” says Yohe. Insurance does nothing to reduce the chances that your house will catch fire, he notes, but “it decreases the consequences should the bad event occur. People are willing to pay premiums for insurance because that spreads the risk.” Under risk management, decision-makers would consider the range of possible outcomes and then try to avoid the worse by, for example, levying a tax on the carbon in fossil fuels that becomes the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. The tax would reduce the urgency of making more sweeping decisions. At the same time, it would keep in more ambitious goals such as holding greenhouse gases to even lower levels. All the while, tists would be learning more about the risks of global warming. So insurance companies are already thinking about how to deal with risks of climate change. I read another article entitled, ‘An answer to climate change: weather hedging for everybody', which talked about a weather insurance exchange project. It does not exist at the moment but, given the right ambience, it might be a good model to help farmers mitigate the risks of experiencing a drought. Hedging is a way of spreading the risk, so I guess that these bills are starting to deal with the risks presented by any change in the environment-whether the science agrees or does not agree on what is actually happening. I have just finished an inquiry into how farmers are dealing with climate change. Many farmers have already started to change farm practices and to come up with new ideas to deal with the changing weather patterns. We need to be able to give them tools and certainty so that their risk mitigation practices can be put into place. The emissions of which I have been speaking are of course known as ‘greenhouse gases'. Many cost- chemical compounds found in the earth's atmosphere act as greenhouse gases. These gases allow sunlight to enter the atmosphere freely. When sunlight strikes the earth's surface, some of it is re-radiated back towards space as infrared radiation, or heat. Greenhouse gases absorb this infrared radiation and trap its heat in the atmosphere. Many gases exhibit these greenhouse properties. Some occur naturally, some are produced by human activities, and some are exclusively human made. If it were not for naturally occurring greenhouse gases, the earth would be too cold to support life as we know it. Withplay out the greenhouse effect, the average temperature on earth would be about minus two scien- degrees Fahrenheit rather than 57 degrees Fahrenheit, which we currently experience. Sometimes you can have too much of a good thing, and allowing too much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere can overload the sink, the oceans, so it collects in the mosphere, causing heat to be retained. It is these excess greenhouse gases that need to be reduced so that their potential effects can be minimised. Now for a little science, thanks to the BBC's weather program, which explains the cycle very simply-if one can get this debate into simplicity. Carbon dioxide is probably the most important of the greenhouse gases, as it accounts for the largest proportion of the trace gases, and it is currently responsible for 60 per cent of the enhanced greenhouse effect. Most of the carbon dioxide was removed from the atmosphere as early organisms evolved photosynthesis. This locked away carbon dioxide as carbonate minerals, oil shale, coal and petroleum in the earth's crust when the organisms died. This left 0.05 per cent in the atmosphere today. Atmospheric carbon dioxide comes from a number of natural sources, mainly the decay of plants, volcanic eruptions and as a waste product of animal respiration. It is removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis in plantsthat is, absorption through the leaves of plants-and by dissolving in water, especially on the surface of our oceans. Carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for approximately 100 years. The amount of carbon dioxide taken out of the atmosphere by plants is almost perfectly balanced with the amount put back into the atmosphere by respiration and decay. Small changes as a result of human activity can have a great impact on this delicate balance. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide stored millions of years ago. We use fossil fuels-including petrol, diesel and kerosene-to heat homes and businesses and to power factories. The use of wood and wood products releases the carbon stored in trees and also results in less carbon dioxide being removed from the atmosphere, hence the need to replant more trees. The majority atof the carbon is not lost, though, as it is stored in whatever we make the wood into, such as houses, furniture, paper and all the other wood products we use. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased more in the Northern Hemisphere, where more fossil fuel burning occurs. Since the Industrial Revolution the concentration globally has increased by about 40 per cent. It is this equation that needs to be balanced. In order to tackle climate change, we must consider two fundamental elements: limiting the carbon pollution that has an influence on climate and putting a cost or price on that carbon pollution. By combining these two means, we can start to deal with climate change and we can also open the door to investment in low-carbon technology and allow carbon trading to help pay for change. The purpose of these bills is to give us all some certainty on what we can do, how we can do it and what it will cost. Even if the Leader of the Opposition thinks the whole business of climate change is crap, he has missed the point of these bills and in the process is slugging the taxpayer instead of those putting out most of the emissions. His scheme just does not work and, as far as I can see, it is unfunded as there is no means by which he can collect funds from the emitters to help alleviate pain and drive change which is what we have to do. In fact, he seems to be creating a great big tax, not on himself but on his children and on his grandchildren. I think he should get off his despot horse and start looking at reality. These bills are complex, but they are an insurance for our future and an incentive for our children and our children's children to act now. Spending $10 a week now instead of $100 in 30 years is something I think we should be doing. We should not push this aside as something that we cannot deal with. We must deal with it; this government is dealing with it. It has these bills back in parliament and hopefully, maybe in some miracle way, we can resolve this matter through the Australian parliament and achieve what I believe our nation needs to achieve-that is, to pass these bills. I support these bills.",24
6,Mr TURNBULL,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and related legislation. All of us here are accountable not just to our constituents but also to the generations that will come after them and after us. It is our job as members of parliament to legislate with an eye to the long-term future, to look over the horizon beyond the next election and ensure that, as far as we can, what we do today will make Australia a better place, a safer place for future generations to live in. Climate change is the ultimate long-term problem. We have to make decisions today, bear costs today so that adverse consequences are avoided, dangerous consequences are avoided many decades into the future. It is always easy to argue we should do nothing, or little or postpone action. But we are already experiencing the symptoms of climate change, especially here in Australia with a hotter and drier climate in the southern part of our nation. The rush to construct desalination plants is just one expensive testament to that. Climate change is a global problem. The planet is warming because of the growing level of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. If this trend continues then truly catastrophic consequences will ensue, from rising sea levels to reduced water availability to more heatwaves and fires. In December, just a few weeks ago, we had confirmation from three leading scientific organisations-the UK Met Office and, in the United States, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-that the past decade, the years from 2000 to 2009, the was the hottest since record-keeping began, even hotter than the decade before which was the second-hottest decade on record and the decade before that which was the third hottest on record. Climate change policy has to recognise these real risks, these real threats to the safety of our planet. It is an exercise in risk management and no reasonable person could regard the risk as being so low that no action was warranted. That has been the view of political leaders for many years from both sides of politics, none more eloquently than Margaret Thatcher herself. Prudence demands that we act to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and do so in a way that is consistent with and promotes global action to do the same. Right now both sides of politics are agreed that Australia should, regardless of whether any international agreement is reached, reduce our emissions by 2020 so that they equal a five per cent cut from 2000 levels. This is a 21 per cent cut from the 2020 business-as-usual levels. Both sides of politics agree that, depending on the nature of the international agreement reached, greater cuts of 15 or 25 per cent should be made. It is not enough to say that you support these cuts, you must also deliver a strong, credible policy framework that will deliver them. In line with the Copenhagen Accord, the nations of the world are making commitments to reduce their emissions and those commitments will form the basis of the negotiations that will continue at Mexico City this year. Australia should be taking action now in advance of and in order to promote a global agreement. While our emissions are only a small share of the global total, we are in per capita terms one of the highest emitters. How can we credibly expect China, with per capita emissions less than a quarter of ours, or India, with per capita emissions less than one-tenth of ours, to take our call for global action seriously if we, a wealthy developed nation, are not prepared to act ourselves? This transition from a high-emission economy to a low-emission one cannot be achieved without major changes to the way we generate and use energy and in the way we manage our landscape. This requires substantial new investment especially in electricity generation, which has increased by 45 per cent since 1990 and represents now a little more than half of our total emissions. Decisions to build new power stations and replace old ones will involve tens of billions of dollars over the next few decades and a critical element in making those decisions is being able to form a view about the direction of carbon pricing. Given that the cheapest fuels are generally the dirtiest, in the absence of a clear carbon price signal new capacity is likely to be coal rather than gas or rather renewables. This need for leadership and direction from government on the pricing of carbon, on the level of emissions, was one that was apparent to the previous government. That is why in 2006 Prime Minister John Howard established the emissions trading task group headed by Dr Peter Shergold, the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The task group also included leaders from the industries most directly affected, such as transport, aluminium, mining, agriculture and power generation. In 2007 the Howard government adopted the Shergold task group's recommendation to establish an emissions trading scheme in advance of and in order to promote a global agreement, and we began to introduce the necessary legislation. As the Shergold report observed: An Australian emissions trading scheme, with a carbon price set by the market, would improve business investment certainty. This is particularly the case for projects with a high degree of carbon risk. There is growing evidence that investments are being deferred due to uncertainty about the future cost of addressing climate change. Without a clear signal on future carbon costs, these investments will not be optimised. There is a risk that a higher carbon profile will be locked in for the life of the capital stock. Plainly stated, in the absence of a clear carbon price signal, either no new investments will be made or investments will be made in new carbon intensive infrastructure because they are more profitable in a world where there is no price on carbon emissions. An ETS works by setting a limit, or a cap, on the amount of carbon dioxide and its equivalents which the total covered industry sectors can emit. These industries are required to acquire permits to emit CO2 within that overall cap. I note that the government does not set the price of carbon; it sets the cap on emissions and the rules of the than scheme, and then it is up to the market, the laws of supply and demand, to set the price. It does not give quotas to particular industries or firms. The cap is across the economy and is set at a level of emissions which will over the relevant period enable us to meet our target. These permits can be purchased from the government or from other permit holders, or can be offset by purchasing a carbon credit from someone, like a farmer, who is taking action which reduces atmospheric carbon. Only a small number of businessesaround one thousand big emitters-will have to buy permits. The direct impact of the ETS, therefore, for almost all Australians is via increased energy prices. The New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal, IPART, estimates that in 2013, for example, the cost of the CPRS will comprise 15 per cent of a typical electricity bill in South Wales. It is estimated by the Treasury overall that the CPRS will add about 19 per cent to electricity prices. The scheme will raise a substantial amount of revenue over the period to 2020, but it is not designed-nor should it be-to raise additional net revenue for the government, as taxes do, since the funds raised by the sale of permits will be returned to compensate lower income households and assist businesses, especially those which are emissions intensive and trade exposed and cannot readily pass on the increase in energy costs. The white paper estimates the CPRS will result in a one-off increase in the CPI of 1.1 per cent, compared to the 2.8 per cent oneoff increase in the CPI caused by the introduction of the GST. Most households will be compensated for this increase in costs either in whole or in part. I should note that the largest component of increases in electricity prices in New South Wales, for example, over the next five years is in fact additional network charges to recognise the increased investment in the security and reliability of electricity infrastructure. Those increases, unlike the CPRS element, are not the subject of any compensation. But, given we have an apparent bipartisan agreement that emissions should be reduced by five per cent of 2000 levels by 2020, is an emissions trading scheme, this CPRS, at a general level the best policy to achieve the desired outcome? Believing as I do, as a Liberal, that market forces deliver the lowest cost and most effective solution to economic challenges, the answer must be yes. Because more emissions-intensive industries and generators need to buy more permits than less intensive ones, lower emissions activities, whether they are cleaner fuels or energy efficient buildings, are made more competitive. A brown coal fired power station, for example, pumps out four times as much CO2 as New an efficient gas fired one. Gas is expensive and clean; brown coal is cheap and dirty. If there is no cost charged for emitting carbon, there is simply no incentive to move to the cleaner fuel. Until 1 December last year, there was a bipartisan commitment in Australia that this carbon price, this exercise in reducing emissions, should be imposed by means of a market based mechanism-this emissions trading scheme. At their core, therefore, these bills are as much the work of John Howard as of Kevin Rudd. The policy I am supporting here today as an opposition backbencher is the same policy I supported as John Howard's environment minister. And why did we in the Howard government believe an emissions trading scheme was the best approach? It was because we as Liberals believed in the superior efficiency of the free market to set a price on carbon. As the Shergold report observes: Market-based approaches have the potential to deliver least-cost abatement by providing incentives for firms to reduce emissions where this is cheapest, while allowing the continuation of emissions where they are most costly to reduce. The Rudd government's approach has broadly embodied the same principles, although there were problems and flaws with its initial design. But extensive modifications were made in May 2009 and again in November 2009, when changes were agreed between the government and the opposition following the negotiations between Senator Wong and the member for Groom and me. These changes have made it into a scheme that appropriately balances environmental effectiveness and economic responsibility. In fact, the proposed scheme very closely resembles the outline of the Howard government's original 2007 proposal, in both its incidence and its timing. As we have seen in recent days, alternatives such as direct regulation or subsidies will be far more costly to the economy, no matter how hard their designers seek to argue the contrary. I quote again from the Shergold report on this topic: An alternative to regulating emissions abatement is subsidising abatement activities from government budgets. For example, government could target specific projects, requiring estimation government of additional abatement relative to ‘business as usual'. However, if not carefully implemented, project-specific approaches can involve administrative overheads for both government and project proponents. Under a market based mechanism, like an ETS, if a firm reduces its emissions intensity by acquiring more efficient equipment or, for example, by generating power from burning gas rather than coal, it will need to buy fewer permits per dollar of output. There is a clear, transparent and immediate incentive-a clear price signal-encouraging investment in lower emissions technology. However, if a scheme operates whereby the government pays the firm to reduce its emissions intensity, leaving aside the impact on the budget and the demand therefore for higher taxes, there is firstly going to be a substantial and contentious debate about what the correct baseline is, and then whether it will actually be reduced. Because most capital equipment, especially in the energy sector, has a life running into many decades, as long as 50 years in some cases, the business sector is going to require assurance that any government subsidy will match the life of the asset-so running well beyond 2020. In other words, any scheme has to have a lifetime which matches the lifetime of the investment. If government wants business to make long-term investments to lower emissions, its commitment must be long term as well, which is why a subsidy scheme which terminates in 2020 will achieve very little. Arguments of considerable ferocity will arise as to whether a new piece of equipment would have been bought anyway, with the risk that the government ends up funnelling billions of dollars to companies to subsidise their profit without achieving any real additional cuts in emissions. All of us in this House know that industries and businesses, attended by an army of by lobbyists, are particularly persuasive and all too effective at getting their sticky fingers into the taxpayers' pocket. Having the government pick projects for subsidy is a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale, and there will always be a temptation for projects to be selected for their political appeal. In short, having the government pay for emissions abatement, as opposed to the polluting industries themselves, is a slippery slope which can only result in higher taxes and more costly and less effective abatement of emissions. I say this as a member and former leader of a political party whose core values are a commitment to free markets and free enterprise. The Shergold report went on to say this about this very issue: Financing subsidies and specific project-based interventions also impose costs on society from their use of taxation. If these approaches were to be used extensively to achieve large-scale abatement, the economy would suffer losses in economic and administrative efficiency. In contrast, market-based approaches to emissions abatement involve the explicit pricing of emissions, allowing the market to determine the cheapest source of emissions reduction. As the Productivity Commission observed in its submission to the Garnaut review in 2008: Unlike prescriptive command and control approaches, an ETS leaves it to producers and consumers-who have better information about their own production costs and preferences than governments-to work out the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions. In this way, the targets are most likely to be achieved at lowest cost to the economy and community. Before I leave the question of non-market based approaches to emissions reduction, I should note that I was very pleased to see the recognition of soil carbon, carbon forestry and biochar in the coalition's alternative policy. One of the key achievements of our negotiations with the government last year about the CPRS of course was to secure the recognition of this type of agricultural offset, the potential for which, as I have argued for some time, is very considerable. However, there are a couple of points I should make about soil carbon in particular. While it is possible to increase the level of organic carbon in soils by changing the management of the land in question, it is quite another thing to ensure that this increased carbon level is permanently maintained. Soil carbon levels fluctuate with the season, with rainfall and of course depending on the use of the land. There is a great prize here, but before billions of dollars are invested in soil carbon credits there will be considerable work required to agree on appropriate measurement and management methodologies. If in fact there are hundreds of millions of tonnes of very low-cost agricultural offsets capable of generating carbon credits then they are all potentially available in the ETS",28
7,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCHEME AMENDMENT,Order! May I ask the member for Wentworth to resume his seat. The Parliamentary Secretary for Employment on a point of order? Mr Clare-I move: That the member's time be extended. Question agreed to.,32
8,Mr TURNBULL,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I thank the parliamentary secretary for his courtesy. As I said, fact there are hundreds of millions of tonnes of very low cost agricultural offsets capable of generating carbon credits then they are all potentially available in this ETS, in the CPRS proposed here in this legislation, and they will lower the cost of permits. In other words, if polluters can buy carbon credits for $10 a tonne from farmers, permit prices will adjust down to that level. Of course, the great virtue of a market based scheme is that instead of the government decreeing what the best and cheapest offsets are, the participants in the market work it out for themselves. That is why, once agricultural offsets are recognised under the emissions trading scheme-and that is the plan with this legislation-there is enormous potential for farmers and other landowners to generate real revenue. However, it should be noted that until those offsets are recognised internationally, they will not be of assistance in meeting our five per cent 2020 target. One of the leading Australian biochar advocates wrote to me the other day and said: While I worked in Government for a significant part of my life I am horrified by the prospect of a ‘fund' from which public servants give handouts to grow trees-it just does not work-we have to have a market price and a market system … Is the ETS proposed in these bills the right design and is this the right time to act? The answer here, too, is yes. Most other large emitters have also committed to substantial quantitative reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade. Many have already acted to achieve those targets. The European Union has had an ETS since 2005 and in phase 3 of its scheme is enforcing it with increasing stringency. In line with the Copenhagen accord, China has committed to a 45 per cent reduction in emissions per unit of output by 2020 and the Chinese are already investing massively in cleaner energy sources, both of which point to a if in ‘shadow' price on carbon already in force across the Chinese economy. I note that the Chinese commitment is to reduce emissions from their ‘business as usual' rate. They recognise that business as usual is not good enough and that they must reduce their emissions intensity and then reduce the absolute level of emissions. Japan has pursued lower emissions and higher energy efficiency for three decades. Brazil has committed to lowering its emissions by more than a third against its projected business-asusual 2020 emissions. I note again that our commitment to reducing our emissions by five per cent from 2000 levels is equivalent to a 21 per cent reduction from our projected 2020 emissions without a CPRS. While Copenhagen was disappointing, it did nonetheless for the first time see the developing nations-particularly the major ones, such as China and India-make commitments to reduce their emissions. That was an enormous breakthrough. There is a global commitment to act so as to keep temperature rises this century below two degrees Celsius. The notion that this ETS would put Australia out in front of the world is, sadly-I wish it were not so-completely wrong. Far from being in front of the world in action to reduce emissions, we start behind because our per capita emissions are so large and because our sources of energy are overwhelmingly dependent on burning coal. We should not forget that when the Howard government committed to an ETS in 2007 the world was much further away from concerted global action than it is today. Indeed, the Shergold report noted: The prospects for comprehensive global action in the near future look poor. But the Shergold report, in recommending an ETS, observed: …waiting until a truly global response emerges before imposing an emissions cap will place costs on Australia by increasing business uncertainty and delaying or losing investment. This legislation is the only policy on offer which can credibly enable us to meet our commitment to a five per cent cut to emissions by 2020 and also has the flexibility to enable us to move to higher cuts when they are warranted. So for those reasons I support this bill. The arguments I have made for it are no different to those I have made, and stood for, for the last three years. During my time as Leader of the Opposition I often defended the right of my colleagues from time to time to cross the floor and vote in accordance with their strongly held personal beliefs. This is a long standing and treasured principle of the Liberal Party and very different to the tradition of the Labor Party. In that context, I commend the courage of my colleagues Senator Troeth and Senator Boyce who crossed the floor to support this bill and effective action on climate change late last year. The importance of this issue, the expectation that Australians have that their parliamentarians will lead on it, the fact that the emissions trading scheme being considered is nearly identical to the proposal put to the electorate by the Howard government in 2007 and my strong and long standing personal commitment to effective action on climate change make it impossible for me to vote against this bill, amended in terms as agreed between the coalition and the government last year. The proposed ETS is a balanced, substantive and timely step forward on an issue of immense importance. By relying so heavily on market forces to address this very severe challenging problem, the ETS is far more in the great traditions of modern liberalism than any other available policy response. After all, I have always believed that Liberals reject the idea that government knows best and embrace the idea that government's job is to enable each of us to do our best. This ETS allows Australian businesses to make their own decisions as to how to reduce their emissions. Government sets the rules and, in particular, sets the cap on total emissions and then lets the market work out the most efficient and effective outcome. Schemes where bureaucrats and politicians pick technologies and winners, doling out billions of taxpayers' dollars, neither are economically efficient nor will be environmentally effective. For those reasons, I will be voting in favour of this legislation.",32
9,The SPEAKER,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"Order! Before I call the member for Higgins, I remind the House that this is the first speech of the honourable member for Higgins. I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",34
10,Ms ODWYER,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"Higgins) (1.13 pm)Today I rise in this chamber for the first time as the very humble yet proud member for Higgins. At the outset, I want to place on record my thanks to the people of Higgins for their trust in me to represent them. I will always honour that trust. They have in me, just as they had in the previous members for Higgins, someone who will work hard for them, who will listen to them and fight for them and who will respect and defend the values and traditions that have made this country great. Higgins has in me someone who will not make decisions ruled by fear or the short-term media cycle. To do so sacrifices the future of this country on the altar political expediency today, for the decisions that we make today here in this parliament will shape our future. We face big challenges, and I will not duck the task of tackling those challenges. Higgins has a strong tradition and a proud legacy. The people of Higgins have been represented well in the past-two prime ministers in Harold Holt and John Gorton, a strong local member in Roger Shipton and, most recently, a federal Treasurer in Peter Costello. Each man made a significant contribution to this country. Holt introduced the child endowment scheme, Gorton implemented a program to provide financial assistance to non-government schools and Shipton advocated on many small business issues. Family, choice, wealth creation-these threads bind the Higgins tradition. In particular, I honour the contribution of my immediate predecessor, Peter Costello, a great Australian and a man who is both a mentor and a friend. Not only was he a much loved local member but his economic vision and achievements ensured a brighter future for all Australians. His legacy, while understood today, will be properly measured and appreciated in the years to come. Since Higgins has produced such giants of Australian politics, it is probably a good thing I am wearing heels. Higgins is a lively inner city electorate, with landmarks like Chapel Street, the Yarra River and the Chadstone Shopping Centre. It is also a diverse electorate. Workers' cottages abound in Windsor; flats and apartments dominate South Yarra. A vibrant gay community enlivens Prahran. Toorak has its mansions; Malvern, its parks and gardens. You cannot pass through Camberwell and Glen Iris without seeing children playing cricket or kick-to-kick. Parents push prams of in Ashburton and Malvern East. The cafe culture is alive and well in Koornang Road, Carnegie and High Street, Armadale. Throughout, there is a deep vein of multiculturalism: some communities are particularly localised, like the strong Greek communities in Murrumbeena and Hughesdale; others, like our dynamic Jewish and Chinese communities, are spread throughout the electorate. One thing, more than any other, binds this diversity together: aspiration. Higgins is full to the brim with aspiration-young couples, renting for the moment but desperate to own their own homes; families wanting the best for their children, scrimping and saving to provide them with the best opportunities in life; small business people, rolling up their sleeves, taking a chance and creating jobs; and older residents who have worked hard throughout their lives, whose accomplishments prove what can happen when you dare to pursue your ambitions. The story of Gwen Dixon and her late husband, Alec, is a classic Higgins story of aspiration. Alec was born in the early 1900s and lived in what was then the very working class suburb of Windsor, one of seven children. He left school at 14 and worked as a plumber's apprentice before he got a job on the wharves. Years later, he met Gwen. They got married, rented a house and preneurial fashion started a small business together. Gwen made felt ties; Alec sold them door-to-door. Keen to make a home for their family, they rented a shop in Windsor and started a milk bar. They worked in the shop during the day and lived above it at night. They took risks. They employed people. Later, they set up a grocery business, going into debt to buy a small shop in South Yarra, a business they worked in together for over 30 years. When they could, Alec and Gwen moved to a house in Windsor, renting out half of it to make ends meet. They took one holiday in their working life and that was on their retirement. Instead, they put money back into their business and the education of their two children, sending them to independent schools in their secondary years to give them the educational opportunities that they themselves had been denied. Today, we are joined by 92-year-old Gwen Dixon in the public gallery. I could not have asked for a finer grandmother. The same spirit of aspiration that drove my grandparents drove my parents. The first of their families to go to university, they worked hard and sacrificed to give me and my siblings a quality education. If not for their love and sacrifice, I would not be standIndigenous ing here today. I joined the Liberal Party because we are the party which helps people to fulfil their aspirations; those opposite are just as likely to stamp them out. In my view, the best path to our collective prosperity involves giving individuals, families and businesses the freedom, opportunity, and encouragement to build and secure their own futures. That is why I am here. I want to create the best possible environment that allows people to pursue their aspirations and one that values family as the bedrock of our society-to be nurin true entre- tured and protected. Believers in big government think Canberra can and should solve every problem. I do not accept this. Government action invariably involves some concession of liberty to the state. But that concession should be limited to what is vital. Canberra simply cannot know what is best for every person and every situation. The brainpower of 22 million people, each given the freedom to create solutions for their families and communities and to create businesses which create jobs, will always yield better outcomes. Always. When government does act, it should look to maximise choice and opportunity. Nongovernment alternatives are important. We need to encourage private health care, private health insurance and independent schools, not undermine them. At the same time, it is critical to have strong public health and public school systems. We need to demand excellence and achievement from both to ensure real opportunities for all Australians. Basic fairness and compassion mean a strong social safety net is essential. But I want as few people as possible to rely on it. In particular, we need to break the nexus of intergenerational welfare dependency, a problem tragically apparent in some of our communities and, equally tragically, not confined there. Our policies must encourage self-reliance and resilience. Social policy cannot be implemented without a strong economy. A strong economy is the ultimate form of social policy-with it comes the chance of a job and a higher standard of living; the chance to fulfil aspirations. This brings me to the first key set of issues that I want to touch on today. This side of the House has a proud history of strong economic management. Indeed, it seems that one of our defining roles as a political party is to repair the national balance sheet and to restore a framework that encourages productivity and growth. Unfortunately, one of the challenges that will face a future coalition government will be the same challenge that faced the last one: paying off Labor's debt. While some form of stimulus package was appropriate in response to the global financial crisis, the current government's package was excessive and poorly targeted. As a result, present and future generations face higher taxes to pay the interest bill. At a when our population is ageing, money will be diverted from critical health, aged care and infrastructure budgets. At the risk of oversimplification, the main reasons why Australia has performed well to date through the global financial crisis are because Australia was in a net cash position heading into it, because our monetary policy was, by and large, appropriately managed over a sustained period by our independent Reserve Bank; because our banking and prudential system was first class; and because we had a strong bilateral trade relationship with China which enabled us to piggyback on her own massive stimulus spending. These are all achievements of this side of the House. Let there be no doubt-I am for less debt and for living within our means. I am for a strong economy. There will always be those who use a crisis to further their own agendas. Already the government has gone beyond its mandate at the last election and significantly reregulated the labour market in a way which will smother our competitiveness and jobs growth over time. We cannot afford to repeat this mistake in our financial markets. I have long taken an interest in markets policy and regulation as a lawyer, as a policy adviser and most recently in the finance industry. A sober review is appropriate and it may be that some improvements can be made. However, a wholesale reregulation of our financial markets would undermine the companies and industries which are so fundamental to our growth. In this place I will seek to maximise the competitiveness of our economy and our productivity, not to undermine them. One area which is critical to this is taxation policy. We need to attract foreign investment; we need to attract the best talent from offshore; and, equally importantly, we need to retain our own talent. That requires a time competitive taxation system, not a populist one. We need a taxation system that is not simply a merry-go-round of money but one that promotes workforce participation and wealth creation. This is all the more critical given the projections for our population size and composition set out in the latest Intergenerational report. It is clear we need to provide incentives for people to save and to stay in the workforce longer. We all await the release of the Henry review into taxation and the government's response. The challenge for the government is not simply to use the Henry review as an excuse to introduce higher taxes in its bid to find new revenue, nor should it introduce new taxes which would pull the rug out from under our all-important resources sector. Each would be the wrong response and would undermine the competitiveness of our economy. More importantly, lower taxation is fundamentally the right thing. Once the basic services of government are funded, individuals are best placed to choose how they spend their money. The second key set of issues I want to touch upon concerns innovation, a natural product of aspiration and a key to Australia's future. Australia's prosperity has been built on both our people and on our abundant natural wealth. However, our mineral resources are finite, and changes to our climate and water scarcity pose ongoing challenges for agriculture. Put simply, we cannot assume that our natural wealth will underpin our long-term prosperity. Our mining and farming sectors will remain critical for years to come. But now is the time for our country to invest significantly in education which drives productivity and innovation. Government needs to encourage new businesses and industries to flourish. Innovation should also be a core plank in our strategies to address the twin challenges of energy security and climate change. Both are critical issues facing not just this country but countries all over the world. For many years Australians have led the way in medical research. There is no reason why we cannot lead the way in energy research. Indeed we are uniquely placed to develop solar, wind, geothermal, clean coal and innovative water solutions to maximise our energy independence and to reduce our impact on the environment. Climate change is not the only area of environmental policy where action is required. As our population grows, our water supply has been and will continue to be increasingly stretched. National leadership is required. Future generations of Australians will rightly condemn us if we hide behind our federal system as an excuse for inaction. The structure of our Federation has not kept pace with developments in water policy. To our great shame, the Murray-Darling Basin is a looming environmental catastrophe. If the states are not willing to refer their powers on water onto Canberra, a referendum will be necessary. But I do not agree with those who would use this as a Trojan Horse to centralise ever-increasing power in Canberra in other areas. While it is right to ask how our Federation can work better, we must be careful not to undermine the elaborate system of checks and balances which has sustained Australia as one of the world's great democracies. Energy and water security are by no means our only national security challenges. We face instability in our region and beyond. The threat of terrorism is ever present, both through traditional means and emerging threats such as cyber attacks. We must continue to invest in Australia's defence infrastructure, but recognise that this alone is not enough. Our alliances have been critical in the past, are essential today and will continue to protect us into the future. But so too will investment in our region: in democratic structures and institutions, and in foreign aid-not just because foreign aid is morally right, but because of the huge national security benefits that it brings. Above all, we must maintain our vigilance. I spoke earlier of families as the bedrock of our society. The changing nature of work poses particular challenges to the aspirations of families across this country. Families come in all shapes and sizes, and roles within families vary. A woman is increasingly likely to be the only, primary or co-breadwinner, whether by choice or necessity. Parents are having children later in life and then trying to balance parenting with their careers. Increasingly, grandparents are taking on more of the parenting responsibility. This creates enormous challenges. We want mothers, fathers and grandparents investing time in their children and grandchildren's development. But we also want our best people in the workforce, adding to our productive output. No-one has yet worked out how to be in two places at once-so there are no simple solutions. Indeed, the right solutions vary from family to family. In some cases, the right solution will be for one parent to stay home as a full-time carer. In others, both parents will need to work or want to work. Governments should not discriminate amongst different family arrangements or put in place incentives which cause discrimination by others. It is important for our businesses to offer the flexibility necessary to allow our best and brightest to contribute both to the ongoing growth of their businesses and to the ongoing nurturing of our young. But families are not just about parents ing for children; they are also about children caring for parents. Similar principles apply. Senior Australians built this country through their aspiration, sweat and taxes. They have a right to dignity and security. At the heart of this is flexibility and choice-giving power to older Australians and their families to determine their future according to their needs. These are some of the national issues which drive me and which should occupy the attention of this place in the years to come. But local issues are also important to my constituents. It is tempting for federal politito cians to say that local issues are not ‘our sues'. I do not accept that. I will continue to campaign to help those crying out for better community safety through closed-circuit television cameras in Prahran and more police in Ashburton. With my community, I will continue to fight state Labor's flawed planning policies which are damaging the character of our area. In short, I will be an advocate for the people of Higgins, on local issues as well as national ones. No-one who stands before this House does so without the support of a great many people. Let me start by thanking my wonderful team in Higgins and all of the volunteers, supporters and staff of the Liberal Party who worked so tirelessly on my campaign. I am blessed to have so many wonderful friends. I at am not so foolhardy as to attempt to list them all today, but each has enriched my life and I thank them all. Some of those friends are now colleagues here and in the other place. I have valued their counsel for many years, but I have valued their friendships even more. I am excited to join them, and my other new colleagues, to strike a blow for Liberalism and good government. Of course, it would be hard to embark on this life without the love and support of a strong family. I have both. I pay tribute to car- my parents, Karen and Dan O'Dwyer; and I can always count on my siblings, Kate, Tom and Nicki, to be there, through everything, and to keep it real. I would not be here today without the love, encouragement and advice of my husband, Jon, whom I met at university 15 years ago and who shares this political passion with me. I am so happy to be on life's journey with him. I will never forget that politics is about people and that people can make a difference. That is why I am here. I look forward playing my part in building an even better is- Australia and thank the House for its indulgence.",34
11,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I would like to acknowledge and congratulate the member for Higgins on her first speech. I note that the Liberal Party's poll ratings have improved since she replaced the previous member for Higgins and I wish her well in her important task of representing the voters of that electorate. I also want to acknowledge the contribution of the speaker before her in this debate on the second reading of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010, the member for Wentworth. It was one of the most outstanding speeches that we have heard in this parliament in recent years, both for its courage and for its logic. That the truth on climate change is inconvenient has been famously said, but the fact that the member for Wentworth has shown this willingness to follow the truth wherever it might lead adds immeasurably to his stature as a parliamentarian. Yesterday was the one-year anniversary of Victoria's Black Saturday bushfires-a moving outpouring of emotion and grief at unimaginable horror and loss: 173 lives lost, thousands of homes and properties destroyed, the work and the memories of a lifetime vanished, reduced to rubble. It was also a great testimony to the power of the human spirit to endure and continue. Black Saturday was the hottest day that many parts of Victoria have ever experienced-46.4 degrees Celsius in Melbourne. It happened following a decade of drought. It happened at end of the hottest decade Australia has ever witnessed-and each successive decade in Australia in recent times has been warmer than the last. In the words of the old Buffalo Springfield song: ‘There's something happening here.' Climate change is not some vague scientific theory about what might happen in 100 years time; it is a reality happening right here, right now, in Australia. Bob Dylan sang, ‘The times they are a-changin',' and they are. He also sang, ‘You better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone.' That is true too. The impacts of global warming are serious and they are worldwide. In Canada, the Winter Olympics have run into problems because a very warm winter has meant little or no snow cover on mountains where events are scheduled to be held. Training sessions for competitors have been cut back so as not to damage the snow that is there. It is not the melting snow of the North Pole and Mount Kilimanjaro and the snowfields; glaciers are melting too. This will cause floods in places like Tibet, Bangladesh and China, displacing millions of people, causing boat people and refugees. It will also cause food shortages once the water has gone. We will also see food shortages arising from drought. We can already see it here in the Murray-Darling Basin. We now hand out billions of dollars in taxpayer assistance to farmers every year on account of these so-called exceptional circumstances, which just keep happening. If we do not do act now, we will leave to our children and to their children a bleak future with sea level rises and food and water shortages-a future regularly punctuated by extreme weather events such as cyclones, droughts and firestorms like the Black Saturday inferno. So this clutching at straws that we have seen in recent times, in the face of the considered opinion of such moderate, cautious and well-informed agencies as the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology-to say nothing of the thousands of scientists around the world who have studied the ice cores, studied the changing composition of the atmosphere and studied the planet's temperature, rainfall and climate records-is utterly irresponsible. It is recklessness. It is indifference towards the future. To say that all the work we have seen does not mean anything is just wilful blindness. It is a terrible sell-out of our obligation to future generations. The only explanation I can offer for it is the saying that ‘it is pretty hard to get a man to see something when his pay packet depends on his not seeing it'. As an example of the kind of thinking I am concerned about, I want to bring to the attention of the parliament a letter, dated 23 November last year, which I and, I assume, every federal MP received from True Energy just Australia Pty Ltd, opposing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme-that is to say, opposing the bills we are now debating. In the letter, True Energy says it is a subsidiary of CLP, which is listed in Hong Kong, and it is a global investor with significant investments throughout the Asia-Pacific and a market capitalisation of $18 billion. The letter states that True Energy's parent company, CLP, owns the 1,480 megawatt coal fired Yallourn power station. Disturbingly, the letter claims that the federal government is in danger of breaking an agreement with China, exposing it to a claim for many hundreds of millions of dollars. The letter claims that the Australia-Hong Kong bilateral investment treaty obligates the federal government to ensure that investments made in good faith by Hong Kong companies are properly treated. The letter goes on to say that, consequently, if the CPRS results in a major devaluation of a Hong Kong investment-such as the 1,480 megawatt coal-fired Yallourn power station owned by True Energy's parent, CLP-the investor would have rights to take legal action against the Australian government to recoup losses, which would be significant. I do not believe this is legally correct; if it is, it is an outrageous fetter on Australian sovereignty. We should not be entering into agreements which stop us taking action to protect our environment or limit us taking action to pass on to our kids an Australia that is in as good shape as the Australia that our parents gave to us. This kind of bullying by foreign companies displays a complete lack of concern for Australia's national interest and it shows the downside of allowing Australia's energy companies to be foreign owned. Energy companies have no business complaining that action on climate change might impact on their bottom line. In the first place, in the design of this legislation-both in its initial version and, even more so, following negotiations with the opposition last year-the government has gone out of its way to cushion energy companies from the impact of the change and provide a transitional path to a carbon constrained economy. Secondly, these companies have been on notice for years that the world needs to and wants to move away from fossil fuels. The previous Labor government announced a policy to cut carbon emissions. The Kyoto protocol was adopted way back in 1997. Energy companies have been on notice for years that this was coming. Warren Buffett said: ‘When the tide goes out you can see who's been swimming naked'-and that applies here. Energy companies have indeed been swimming naked-failing to move to renewable energy sources-and it is high time they put on some clothes. The opposition has reneged on its pre 2007 election position that it would bring in a carbon trading scheme, and now says it will not support any type of carbon trading scheme. All those opposite, except the member for Wentworth, have forgotten about this commitment. The new Leader of the Opposition has produced an alternative plan, but this plan will not cut carbon emissions. It has but, no cap. It has no enforcement arrangements. It is a recipe for increasing carbon emissions, when we need to reduce them. The Leader of the Opposition is fiddling while Australia and the planet burns. His policy is all about delivering to those in the Liberal Party room-that climate sceptic tank-who voted for him. The Leader of the Opposition will never seriously tackle global warming. His heart is just not in it. There has been some polling released today which has been reported as reflecting support for the Leader of the Opposition's position. Let me make two observations about this polling. Firstly, it shows that the emissions trading scheme is supported by 56 per cent of those polled. So there is a clear majority who continue to support the bills that we are debating now. Furthermore, when people were asked to choose between the approach of the Prime Minister and the approach of the Leader of the Opposition to climate change, 43 per cent preferred the Prime Minister's approach and 30 per cent preferred the Leader of the Opposition's approach. So those who would like us to become a nation of climate sceptics need not break out the champagne just yet. Secondly, it is perhaps true that the climate change cause has taken a bit of a hit in the wake of the Copenhagen talks-and I will have a bit more to say about those talks presently. It is foreseeable that some people will ask the question: ‘Why should we take action if other countries aren't taking action themselves?' It is a reasonable question, but ultimately it is a counsel of despair. If we take the view that we are not going to do anything until everybody else does, then the planet will go to hell in a hand basket. This would be a monumental failure of leadership; it would be a monumental abdication of our responsibility as members of this parliament. I think the time has come for people of goodwill around the world to think about penalties for those nations which refuse to pull their weight over global warming. I will leave that discussion for another occasion. But, in the first place, we have to pull our weight; we have to come to this discussion with clean hands. And this means starting to reduce our greenhouse emissions, as many nations in Europe and around the world are doing. I acknowledge that Copenhagen was a failure. There is no purpose served by trying to pretend otherwise. As Mark Lynas said in the Guardian, after all the hope and all the hype, the mobilisation of thousands, a wave of optimism crashed against the rock of global power politics, fell back and drained away. Mark Lynas was attached to one of the delegations and present during the behind closed doors negotiations at Copenhagen. He has reported on what happened as follows, and I think it is something that the House ought to be cognisant of. He said: China wrecked the talks, intentionally humiliated Barack Obama and insisted on an awful ‘deal' so Western leaders would walk away carrying the blame. … China's strategy was simple: block the open negotiations for two weeks and then ensure that the closed-door deal made it look as if the West had failed the world's poor once again. Mr Lynas said Sudan behaved at the talks as a puppet of China: …one of a number of countries that relieves the Chinese delegation of having to fight its battles in open sessions. It was a perfect stitch-up. China gutted the deal behind the scenes and then left its proxies to savage it in public. Mr Lynas said that at late-night meetings as the heads of state from two dozen countries met behind closed doors Barack Obama was present for hours with Gordon Brown and other prime ministers, including the Danish Prime Minister, who chaired the talks, and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Only about 50 or 60 people were in the room. The Chinese Premier, Wen Jinbao, did not attend the meetings personally, instead sending a second-tier Foreign Ministry official to sit opposite Obama. Mr Lynas said the diplomatic snub was obvious and brutal, as were the practical consequences. Several times during the session the world's most powerful heads of state were forced to wait around while the Chinese delegate went off to make telephone calls to his superiors. Mr Lynas said: It was China's representative who insisted that industrialised country targets previously agreed as an 80 per cent cut by 2050, very serious targets, be taken out of the deal. ‘Why can't we even mention our own targets,' asked German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Brazil's representative also pointed out that this position was illogical. Why should rich countries not announce this unilateral cut? But the Chinese delegate blocked it. Mark Lynas said this is because China did not want the talks to succeed and wanted the rich countries to get the blame for Copenhagen's lack of ambition. He said: China, backed at times by India, then proceeded to take out all the numbers that mattered. A 2020 peaking year in global emissions, essential to restrain temperatures to two degrees sius, was removed and replaced by woolly language suggesting that emissions should peak ‘as soon as possible'. The long-term target, of global 50 per cent cuts by 2050, was also excised. Mark Lynas said no-one else, perhaps with the exception of India and Saudi Arabia, wanted this to happen. The Chinese delegate also moved to remove the 1.5 degrees Celsius target so beloved of the small island states and low-lying nations who have most to lose from rising seas. He said: President Nasheed of the Maldives, supported by the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, fought valiantly to save this crucial number. ‘How can you ask my country to go extinct?' demanded President Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence-and the number stayed, but surrounded by language which makes it all but meaningless. It is clear to me that the talks failed to achieve anything like the action that is needed to stop the earth's temperature from rising to dangerous levels with unpredictable consequences and that the dynamics at work which are preventing global agreement need to be shifted or else the crippling impasse at Copenhagen will continue indefinitely. That is no excuse for Australia to sit on its hands now. Previously when the Howard government was sitting on its hands and refusing to act on climate change the states stepped up to fill the vacuum and started to put in place their own arrangements and mechanisms. I think this will happen again if the Senate insists on blocking action to reduce carbon emissions. A vacuum will be created and the states will move to fill it, as they did before. It is not just nature that abhors a vacuum; politicians do too. The states can either move in a regulatory direction such as requiring new buildings to install solar panels and things like that-and the opposition could hardly complain about this given that they have said that they prefer Cel- direct government action to the market-or the states may act as before to introduce their own emissions trading regimes, which they have suspended and put on hold since the election of the federal Labor government. The opposition would only have itself to blame should this occur. People complain that this creates costs for business, but no-one has ever claimed that action to tackle global heating would be cost free. What we have said is that Nicholas Stern is right: the cost of inaction will exceed the cost of action. At present the costs of inaction are being borne randomly and unfairly. They fall on the victims of bushfires and the victims of drought. They fall on the tourism industry of the Great Barrier Reef and the snowfields. In particular they fall on the next generation and the one after that. These costs need to be shared fairly, and that is what carbon trading is all about. I do not think anyone sees carbon trading as a silver bullet to solve all the problems but rather as part of a suite of measures necessary to tackle a complicated, deep-rooted global problem. These measures include the increased renewable energy target and funding for research to reduce emissions from cars and from coal and from agriculture. I want to put in a plug here for energy efficiency. It does not get as much attention as some of the other initiatives but there is a lot of potential to reduce carbon emissions through the more efficient use of energy in housing and in transport. One of the reasons I will be voting for these bills is because I believe putting a price on carbon will help us drive energy efficiency. I urge policymakers in both government and business to drive energy efficiency and tackle the culture of energy waste and profligacy which has sprung up in recent decades. I believe that future generations are going to judge us on our performance over this issue. If we fail to make the difficult decisions and succumb to political opportunism and fear campaigns, I fear that we will not be given very high marks. I believe we have it in our capacity to do better, and I urge the House to support this legislation.",38
12,Mr HAYES,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I rise, I think for the third time in the last 12 months, to speak in the House on the complex issue of climate change. Today I rise to support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and associated bills. I repeat what I have said on previous occasions: this side of the House is committed to taking action on climate change. This side of the House believes that it is not only in our immediate interest but in the interests of those to whom we intend to bequeath our standards of living and our Australia in the future. It one of those things that we ought not take for granted. As parents-and I imagine that there are many parents up in the galleries-we do want the best for our children. We see that in education and in just about every aspect of our lives. As parents we want to bequeath to our kids the same standards, if not better, than those we grew up with. That is a natural position for us as parents to take-maybe it is magnified in my case because I am a grandparent. We are looking for the betterment of the environment that we wish to leave to our families, to our future generations. That is why this is a such a significant bate in this House. It is significant because is something that we have already agreed to. As everyone here, including those who are in the galleries, are aware, it is not that long ago that a unanimous position was adopted that both the opposition and the government alike would work with the science of climate change and come up with a responsible and efficient mechanism by which we could approach it. I grant you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it was not necessarily the total solution, but it was certainly a positive direction in which we could move towards ameliorating the effects of climate change to protect future generations. We did that in company with the opposition, through the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Turnbull. As a matter of fact, we went on to have a series of negotiations with the opposition. Throughout these negotiations one of the crucial things was that the opposition agreed to put various amendments on the table-a series of amendments. As you would recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, we had already introduced our CPRS legislation and the opposition wanted a series of amendments. Those discussions took place over a period of around six to eight weeks, and, is wouldn't you know it? We on this side of the House agreed with every single one of those amendments. In good faith bargaining you would say, ‘That's a deal.' But, no, we have come back here to find that members on the other side of the chamber now want to change not only what the deal was but also the rationale behind it. They disagreed, to the point that they changed leaders, that they went into a bona fide set of negotiations with us with a view to entering into an agreement if we could reach an accommodation on their specific amendments to the CPRS legislation. As I said, we had actually reached an de- agreement. For some of us, I think, there it might be certain views on whether our agreement should have been on all of the amendments. Nevertheless, we found an agreement through good-faith bargaining with the other side of this chamber to work on those differences, and we agreed to a package which we say was a solution by which the CPRS could go forward. What do we see now? Scurrying around on the other side, as they want to slink off and disagree with the whole concept. I do not know who the joke was played on, whether it was on this side of the House or on the Australian community, but these are the people who went to the 2007 election, under John Howard, with the notion for an energy trading system. That was one of their policies. The only difference they had with us on that, except in some of the detail, was that they wanted their policy introduced by 2012, whereas we had a position that ours must be introduced by 2010. During the course of the debate, they got to a midway point where they said they would agree to an energy trading system provided it could be introduced by 2011. There was always going be that difference. This is the same mob who come in here today and want to argue against the CPRS. There will be a litany of reasons as to why they oppose it. What this mechanism will do is put a price on carbon, which will allow the market to determine the price. I would have thought that having the market involved in determining the price of carbon would be appealing to the general philosophy of the Liberals. Clearly, in this instance, it is not. The reason it is not is that they were opposed outright to having any form of price put on carbon, opposed outright to having any form of ETS established, because they wanted to change the policies when they changed leaders of the party. As I have said, this is a very significant debate. It is a debate not just about Australia here and now but about Australia in the future. Either we stand and be counted and make a difference or we invite the question: why are we here? I listened intently to the first speech of the member for Higgins. Despite the fact that we might have some differences in political outlook, I gathered from her speech, and I compliment her on it, that she is here to make a difference. I would think it goes without saying that every member of this chamber is in politics in order to make a difference. There cannot be any greater issue that we need to pursue at this stage-people have referred to it as the greatest moral issue of the time-than looking to the protection of our environment and address the effects of climate change. This is something that we need to focus on in building this country and setting a path for the future. To do that we need a solid suite of policies. At the centre of that is what was identified some time ago when the Stern report was brought down-that is, having an ETS established, one of the most efficient forms of regulation, putting a price on carbon and being able to generate the various low-carbon-emitting industries and technologies that flow from having a price on carbon. I have had the opportunity of working for renewable energy companies in the past. I am still in contact with those companies now. I know their frustration in not having a price set on carbon and in not being able to commercialise their technologies for the betterment of this country. These are things that must be taken into account.",43

18,Mr RUDD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the honourable member for his question, as it goes to the impact of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme on families-a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme which he said only two months ago that he fully supported. The question of cost and compensation goes to the particular circumstances of a family. Let me go through this in some sequence. The Treasury advises that the average cost is expected to be 1.1 per cent in the first two years of the scheme. That is $12 a week or $624 per year for the average family. Secondly, the matter of compensation is provided for under our scheme for some 8.1 million of Australia's 8.8 million families. Treasury advises that the average compensation for these families is $12.70 per week or $660 per year. There are 2.9 million households that will receive full assistance. Of 3.7 million middle-income households, 50 per cent will receive full assistance. All middle-income families will receive some compensation. Over 92 per cent of households will receive assistance and, on average, these will receive assistance of around $660, as I mentioned before. Now to the honourable member's question concerning the family circumstances to which he has just referred. As he knows, and as the shadow Treasurer and others would know, the particular income profiles and compensation profiles of individual circumstances will depend on a dozen or so different variables. For families these will include, for example, the relative income split between one partner and another and, secondly, the number of children in a family. The third variable in all this is, of course, the governstrategy, ment payments and allowances that the family may be receiving-for example, family tax benefit A or B, the age pension, the disability pension, carer payments, the veterans services pension, the war widows pension, unemployment benefits, student and youth allowances and eligibility for the low-income tax offset. These are all the variables which affect an individual family's circumstances. I will also say that if the honourable Leader of the Opposition would refer to the government's white paper he would see that it makes reference to a transitional fund available for any family that is not compensated according to the government's stated commitments. That is made plain there. Finally, can I say in relation to this that full details on the CPRS household assistance package are on the relevant climate change website. Tables there show the impact on, and assistance for, the 27 different household types most common in Australia. Each type has more than 25 different income levels. Altogether, therefore, the tables refer to 600 different household scenarios. These the are publicly available on the government's website. Nation Building and Jobs Plan",49
19,Ms SAFFIN,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister please update the House on recent information relating to the impact of the stimulus provided by the Nation Building and Jobs Plan on the Australian economy and Australian jobs?,50
20,Mr RUDD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the member for Page for her question. The government are committed to building a stronger Australian economy and one that protects jobs and delivers for working families. That is why, in the face of the greatest global economic challenge since the Great Depression, we implemented a national infrastructure stimulus which is right now supporting more than 34,000 projects around the country. The result is that Australia (1) has been kept free of recession and (2) is the only one of the advanced economies that generated positive economic growth in the period 2008-09. I draw the House's attention to what the Reserve Bank had to say in their Statement on monetary policy last Friday. It contains new numbers on strengthening employment and on the issue of a strengthened economy. Firstly, on the growth point, it informs us that growth numbers have been revised up by the bank to two per cent for 2009-10 and 3.5 per cent for 2010-11. This is good news for the Australian economy. The government's overriding objective is how we protect jobs in the face of this global economic recession. On employment, the RBA states that it now looks likely that the unemployment rate has peaked at around 5.75 per cent. If that number is realised, it very good news indeed for Australian working families. The core objective of the government's economic plan is to protect Australian jobs, and that is why we have 34,000 projects out there, underway through the national economic infrastructure stimulus plan. Let us look more broadly at the impact of what we have done in Australia on jobs here, relative to other countries, to put it into context. Since the global recession began, the United States has lost 6.8 million jobs; the UK, 496,000; Germany, 136,000; Canada, 270,000; Japan, almost one million; France, 447,000; and Italy has lost 406,000 jobs. By contrast, Australia has gained 112,000 jobs over the last 12 months. The other thing I would say is this: contrast the performance on jobs with what has happened in previous international recessions. Here I think it is important as well to look historically at how governments have responded to this challenge. In the international recession of the early eighties, the unemployment rate in Australia peaked at 10.4 per cent. That was with global growth still positive at nearly one per cent. Then, in the international recession of the early nineties, we had the unemployment rate peaking at 10.9 per cent despite global growth still being positive at 1.5 per cent. In this current global recession, where we have the economy actually contracting, Australia has generated an unemployment rate of 5.8 per cent. What this demonstrates is that the policies of this government affecting jobs have been better than what we have seen in most other economies around the world and better than what we have done in response to previous recessions as well. The other thing I would say in conclusion about the Reserve Bank's statement last Friday is this: it pointed particularly to the impact of infrastructure stimulus as ‘an important offset' to the weaknesses in several areas of the economy-a very important and sigis nificant finding. Furthermore, it said that the overall stimulus is currently being withdrawn, while noting that the pick-up in demand around the global economy is still patchy. And we note the IMF's warning from last week which says that there should be no premature withdrawal of stimulus because the global economy is still in fact in a difficult situation. To conclude, can I just say this: there is no clearer contrast between the government and the Liberal and National parties on the question of the economic management of the global recession and recovery. Those opposite-led by the Leader of the Opposition, who says he has no interest in economics and who made the extraordinary decision to appoint Senator Joyce as the alternative finance minister of Australia; leave that to one sideon the core of policy said this: they said we should never have had a national infrastructure stimulus strategy. Had we followed that advice, we would now be in recession and 200,000 Australian jobs would be lost. But the second point is this: on the question of judgment, the Leader of the Opposition, not learning from that mistake, now says, for the future, we should pull out another $20 billion worth of investment in national economic stimulus expenditure. That would also send us down the gurgler. On the question of economic management, the government's approach is clearcut. We have responded to the global recession in a cogent way. What we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition is poor judgment last year in saying we should not have a stimulus strategy, and poor judgement again in saying that we should pull the rug out from under the recovery for the stimulus strategy which lies ahead. Emissions Trading Scheme",50
21,Mr BILSON,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs. I refer the minister to the New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal report, which found that electricity prices will rise by 60 per cent in New South Wales, with one-third of this massive price hike due to the government's emissions trading scheme. How will this help a small business proprietor such as Jason of Bell's Foxy's Dry Cleaners, who I and the opposition leader visited this morning, who already pays $15,000 a year in electricity costs for his business? He is facing a $3,000 or more increase because of the government's great big new tax on everything-a tax, a system, that provides no compensation for small business.",52
22,Dr EMERSON,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,I do thank the latest shadow minister for small business for his question. He certainly did not wait for the duration of the siege of Leningrad to ask that question. So he is really not ahead of the game but not as far behind the game as the former shadow minister.,52

25,Dr EMERSON,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Treasury estimates of increases in electricity prices associated with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme are seven per cent in the first year and 12 per cent in the second year. The government will in fact assist Australian small businesses to adapt to a carbon constrained economy, and all revenue-every bit of revenue-from the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will be used to help households and businesses to adjust to invest in clean energy options. The Treasury modelling is based on a passing through of the carbon price, and that is why the government is providing compensation to households. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance, and the standing order relevant to that. The minister is not being relevant in answering the question and dealing with this particular case that has been put to him, and is, indeed, misleading the parliament by trying to imply that he will receive compensation when he will not.",52
26,The SPEAKER,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,The member will resume her seat. She cannot add debate to a point of order. The minister is responding to the question.,52
27,Dr EMERSON,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"And I was going directly to the issue of support for small business under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Already, $200 million has been allocated through the $1.97 billion Climate Change Action Fund-get that: the $1.97 billion Climate Change Action Fund-to help businesses, including small businesses, to invest in energy efficient equipment such as hot-water systems, insulation, lighting and heating. And, as part of the Clean Business Australia initiative, the government is providing $56 million for smalland mediumsized manufacturers, such as dry-cleaning operators, to improve the energy efficiency of their production processes. And they would do that by investing in more energy efficient equipment. Mr Billson- Mr SPEAKER ",52

29,The SPEAKER,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Order! The member for Dunkley has not got the call because a number of people behind him are denying him. I call the member for Dunkley. Mr Billson- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question was not about grants the government gives away; it was about the electricity cost hikes and the lack of compensation.",52
30,The SPEAKER,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Order! The point of order was on relevance. The minister is responding to the question.,53
31,Dr EMERSON,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"That is how we will support small businesses in this country. If we are addressing the issue of risks to small business, there is no greater risk to small business in this country than the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow finance minister. The reason I say that is that the shadow finance minister, on Lateline just the other day when he was asked where he was going to get the revenue to fund his $10 billion climate change con job, referred to the Henry tax review-and what did he say? He said, ‘That is the whole mechanism of where we get the money from.' Here is the shadow finance minister saying there will be at least a $10 billion increase in taxes or new taxes. He did not say, ‘Here is the budget; we are ing at the budget.' He said, ‘We are looking at the Henry tax review,' indicating in direct contradiction to the opposition leader that they would be getting the money out of the tax system, increasing taxes on small business in this country by up to $10 billion. Mr Anthony Smith- Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: if the minister cannot answer the question put to him about the case study",53
32,The SPEAKER,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,No. The member for Casey will resume his seat. In response to the two previous points of order. I indicated that the minister was responding to the question. To this point of order. I would suggest to the minister that he needs to relate his material to the question.,53
33,Dr EMERSON,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I am indeed, Mr Speaker. I am advised that, in relation to the issue of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and businesses that might be affected by higher energy bills, the shadow minister said that, if electricity prices increased because of penalties incurred under Mr Abbott's plan, consumers could sign on with another retailer. There you go. So he is admitting that electricity prices would go up under the plan by this risky opposition leader saying they can just go to another electricity provider. The fact of the matter is that the shadow finance minister, in revealing there would be increased taxes to fund their climate change con job, has let the cat out of the bag-and what a dirty, smelly creature it is; what a dirty, smelly cat it is. The opposition leader is taking working families and small businesses to the cleaners with his climate change con job. Migration",53
34,Ms BURKE,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"My question is to the Minister for Education, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Social Inclusion. Deputy look- Prime Minster, how will the announced changes to Australia's skilled migration scheme better secure our economic future? What are the public reactions to these changes?",53
35,Ms GILLARD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. Today the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship made an important announcement about better targeting our skilled migration system to the skill needs of the Australian economy. In doing so the minister said: We often hear that previous micro-economic reforms have laid the foundation of our current prosperity. Rarely do we hear recognition of the role played by Australia's skilled migration program. It is the unsung achiever of prosperity … Skilled migrants are also good for the Budget bottom line, adding tens of millions more to tax revenue each year than they consume in government services. He explained-and these are very interesting figures-that migrants make up a quarter of the Australian population but account for around half of our doctors, dentists, IT specialists and chefs and more than a third of our pharmacists, geologists, mechanical engineers and painters and decorators. From those statistics and those words I think we can see there is no more important economic issue for the nation's future than appropriately targeting our skilled migration program. That is why the government has today announced that we will scrap the Migration Occupations in Demand List and replace it with a new more targeted skills occupation list to be drawn up by Skills Australia in light of the nation's needs for skilled labour. This is a vital economic reform, but on this vital economic reform, like on all other economic reform questions, the opposition is deeply divided. I am asked about reactions to this announcement today. Of course, before this announcement we knew that the opposition was deeply divided on climate change and economic reform issues and that has been proved yet again today in the speech by the member for Wentworth and all of his silent supporters on the opposition benches who are now too afraid to come out and support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Before today we knew that the opposition was divided on the question of fiscal responsibility and dealing with debt and deficit.",53
36,Unknown,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Opposition members interjecting,54
37,Ms GILLARD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Now we have the shadow Treasurer interjecting. The shadow Treasurer is playing Tinkerbell rather than trying to manage the finances of the opposition, having been usurped by the shadow minister for finance. Now he is having to cope with the uncosted climate change con job of the Leader of the Opposition. We knew before today, when it comes to economic divisions in the opposition, that the division is so deep that the former Treasurer Peter Costello is on the record as saying that the Leader of the Opposition is so economically incompetent he would not have even tolerated him as his deputy. Today, on an important economic issue of skilled migration, another division emerges. We have the Liberal senator Simon Birmingham criticising the government for not allowing enough skilled migration into the country, while the member for Bowman on the very same day comes out and criticises us for allowing too much skilled migration into the country. Not enough or too much? It is a central economic question on which the opposition are as deeply divided as they are on every other question. What this means is that members of the opposition are always available for a handy one-liner, but what they are never available for is the production of responsible, costed policies. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, and it is a lesson as old as time: you cannot run the Australian economy if you cannot run your political party, and each and every day you fail that test-each and every day. Emissions Trading Scheme",54
38,Mr ANDREWS,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I ask the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to confirm that a maritime worker on over $125,000 whose wife is a stay-at-home mum looking after two dependent children, one aged six to 12 years and the other aged between 13 and 15, will be a massive $950 a year worse off under your great big new tax on everything.",54
39,Ms MACKLIN,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"It is impossible to answer a question when a child is aged ‘six to 12 years', but leaving that to one side I think it does demonstrate one thing, which is that the opposition has no intention of helping any family, no matter what the age of the children. Of course, what we are doing is recognising that families come in all shapes and sizes-except not children aged ‘six to 12 years'! What we are doingOpposition members-That's how you describe them!",54

So the average impact on the costs for families is 1.1 per cent; the average level ofMr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I did not ask about averages. Is this family going to be $950 worse off? It is no joke. Answer the question!",55

47,Mr SWAN,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the member for Dobell for his question, because yesterday I announced a very significant milestone in Australia's recovery from the worse global recession in 75 years. The government was acting on the advice of the Council of Financial Regulators and we will withdraw the guarantee from 31 March this financial year. I made it clear yesterday that the government's Financial Claims Scheme will continue to provide Speaker: I simply seek clarification from you about the fact that the Treasurer is doing a ministerial statement after question time on this very subject and is giving another ministerial statement now during question time. This is supposed to be a time for questions",55
48,The SPEAKER,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. I am not in a position to give any clarification about any prospective ministerial statement. That will be dealt with by the House at the time we get to ministerial statements, and that is in the hands of the House. The only point of order that the Manager of Opposition Business could raise with me was whether the question was in order. The question was in order and the Treasurer will respond to the question.",55
49,Mr SWAN,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"We see the embarrassment of those on the other side of the House, who opposed this in this House-a measure that was so fundamental. Day after day, month after month they opposed the guarantee, they rubbished it in this House, they came in here and asked question after question and they did not support it. This demonstrates why they have made such a fundamental misjudgment about the handling of the global recession. It goes to the very core of their lack of judgment. Everybody on this side of the House remembers very well, day after day, the opposition from those on that side the House to a measure which did so much to support our financial system and our broader economy at a time of threat from the global financial crisis and what became the global recession. This is a very serious issue, but those opposite are so embarrassed they have to get up and interrupt a relatively straightforward answer to this question. They are completely embarrassed by their bloody-minded opposition to the bank guarantee and to the termfunding guarantee, which just demonstrates their lack of economic judgment. Without the guarantee, our banks would have lent less and interest rates for borrowers would have been far higher. That is the consequence of the guarantee. We were able to stabilise our banking system and ensure the flow of credit right through our economy. We can say today that Australia has been the only major advanced economy in the world that has avoided a recession and it has been one of the few to grow during that period. Once again the lack of judgment from those opposite is obvious, because they not only opposed the bank guarantee in this House; they also opposed the stimulus back in February in this House, and of course they have continued to oppose the stimulus and have been out there suggesting that the stimulus should be withdrawn, which of course would pull the rug right out from underneath the recovery. Governor Stevens has summed this up all very well. This is what he had to say about the introduction of the bank guarantee: … helped to stabilise what could have been a catastrophic loss of confidence in the global financial system … public confidence in the security of the banking system maintained … and stabilised a potentially quite dangerous situation. You would have thought that something of that magnitude might have secured the continuous support in this House of the Liberal of and National parties, but it did not. They opposed it tooth and nail in this House. What we are now seeing is a continuation of that irresponsible behaviour and that lack of judgment, which demonstrates what a risk all of those opposite are to our economic recovery. We have had the Leader of the Opposition make unfunded commitments to the tune of $10.7 billion over five years at the same time as opposing the stimulus. The fact of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition does not understand economics and regards it as boring, and that is simply a proxy for the fact he has not got the faintest idea what is going on in the economy. We have got the shadow Treasurer, who appeared on television last night wearing a crown, waving a magic wand and wrapping himself in a tutu, like a giant Tinkerbell! And, of course, we have got Senator Joyce. This is the least qualified economic team from any political party in this House for well over 30 years. They are demonstrating yet again their complete lack of judgment.  order.

52,The SPEAKER,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has got something that she wishes to contribute to the proceedings then she can seek the call; otherwise I just make the gentle observation about her interjection that there are other forms of the House that she can use if she believes that to be the case. The Manager of Opposition Business knows that he can ask for a document that has been quoted from to be tabled. He just cannot jump up willy-nilly asking for things to be tabled. Asylum Seekers,57
53,Mr MORRISON,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I note that, since August 2008, 79 boats have arrived illegally in Australian waters carrying 3,618 passengers, including 11 boats carrying 647 passengers this year alone. Can the Prime Minister explain to the House why he has decided to make stopping skilled migrants coming to Australia a more important policy priority for his government than stopping illegal arrivals to Australia?",57
54,Mr RUDD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Can I simply say to the honourable member who has asked the question about migration policy that one of the problems that we have,57
55,Mr MORRISON,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I've asked if you're going to stop the boats, Kevin!",57
56,Mr RUDD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"The honourable member asked a question about migration policy; I seek to respond to it. The problem that we have inherited with the skills system, as structured, of the previous government is that it is not properly tailored to the needs of the modern Australian economy. From the statement which has been issued by the immigration minister today, reinforced by the comments of the Deputy Prime Minister before, it is quite plain we need to adjust that for the future, because we want to get the right skills mix for the future needs of the economy. That is what we are on about; that is what we intend to do. Secondly, I would say to the honourable member that the divisions on their side on migration policy were transparent for all to see in the doorstop interviews this morning.",57

59,Mr RUDD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the honourable member again for his question and for his interjection. The government's commitment to our migration policy for the future is to deal with the future skill needs of our economy. The system of skills and the way in which it was structured through the immigration portfolio in the past does not meet the needs of the future; hence the decision concerning the 20,000, which has been publicised in the nation's newspapers today. It is the right way forward, it is in the national interest and it is tailored to our real economic needs, and the government stands by that. Our border protection policy, as honourable members opposite would know, continues to deal with the practical challenges which we confront and which all previous governments have confronted since the 1970s. Economy",57
60,Mr RAGUSE,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Minister, why is rigorous analysis and attention to detail crucial in economic and fiscal management, and what are the consequences if such approaches are not followed?",57
61,Mr TANNER,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the member for Forde for his question. Decisions and statements by government do influence the actions of investors and consumers and it is therefore vital that economic ministers and the government do act and speak responsibly and accurately. It is also, of course, natural that this test should be applied to those who aspire to run the nation's finances. Unfortunately, the new shadow minister for finance, Senator Joyce, has demonstrated on a number of occasions since he got the appointment from the Leader of the Opposition a serious lack of understanding or, indeed, accuracy in his statements. This demonstrates a very big question mark over the judgment of the Leader of the Opposition in appointing him in the first place, a very big question mark about the opposition's capacity to manage the economy and the budget, and it does suggest that the election of an Abbott government would be a serious risk to the future prosperity of Australia. I would just like to refer to a couple statements that Senator Joyce has made. He warned in December of the prospect of ‘economic Armageddon' citing the threat to essential medicines and foods. He suggested that the United States might default on its debts. He suggested that various Australian state governments might default on their debts. He called for Australia's major banks to be broken up. More recently, he has opposed Chinese investment in Australian companies, and today he said that Australia cannot afford an increase in the minimum wage, which of course has been frozen for some time as a result of the most recent decision of the Minimum Wage Panel of Fair Work Australia. Had some of these statements been made by a finance minister, the ramifications for Australia could have been very serious, particularly were they to be made at a time of great economic crisis and stress such as this nation went through in the latter part of 2008 and for much of 2009-the global financial crisis. Some of these statements would have been front page news in newspapers all around the world, would have certainly undermined our relationship with the United States, would have called into question the state of the global economy and would have done enormous damage to Australia's standing with investors both in this country and internationally. I would suggest that, when the Australian finance minister stands up and says that state governments may default, anybody with any sense of understanding of economics on that side-and there are very few-would understand that this poses a real threat to the stability of the Australian economy. I know there is a tendency to dismiss Senator Joyce as something of an entertaining sideshow. He is now in a very different league. It appears that he has effectively taken over as the No. 1 spokesman on the of the economy from the opposition. We know from Niki Savva's book that the Leader of the Opposition said to the former Treasurer Peter Costello that he was bored with economics. He was quoted in a newspaper article that he found it boring and, for that reason, Peter Costello indicated that he would rule out the Leader of the Opposition as a prospective deputy were he to become leader. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I wonder if the poor man's Costello could become relevant to the question asked.",57
62,The SPEAKER,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,The minister is responding to the question.,58
63,Mr TANNER,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"From the poor woman's Wilson Tuckey that's a ripper! Senator Joyce has effectively taken over as the key economic spokesman for the Liberal Party. The Leader of the Opposition is not interested. The member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer, is out to lunch-we hardly ever hear from him at all on these issues. But, for all of these entertaining statements by Senator Joyce, Australians should be very concerned about the risk that he and the Leader of the Opposition pose to sound economic and budget management and to the future prosperity of this country. I note that today the Leader of the Opposition has been holding forth on the good old days-the good old days of public hospital funding under the Howard government, to be precise. As I am sure members on this side will agree, the good old days are not quite what they are cracked up to be.  on relevance: The minister for finance has ranged over a wide range of issues and now he is discussing public hospital funding, which did not have anything to do with",58

He sat down and just babbled to the front-bench opposite him. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: obviously I am sorry about the crosschamber conversation that was taking place, but there is an important point of relevance here. He was asked a question that had nothing whatsoever to do with public hospitals and he should be sat down if he is now ranging way outside the ambit of the question.",59
67,The SPEAKER,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"If the Leader of the Opposition were to look at the question, he would see it is characteristic of questions are fairly open ended in the possibilities for the responses. I think it talked about-my writing is not good enough to be sure‘rigorous attention to policy' and terminology like that. Once again I am happy to hear these examples of the frustrations on both sides of the chamber. But I simply say in my comments to the Manager of Opposition Business: it is a bit riling when he makes a point of order and then enters into a crosschamber battle before there is even a response to his point of order. There are plenty of people, not only in this place but also commentators, who think, by watching the trials of Speaker Bercow in the House of Commons, that these things are easy. But I wish I was in the position of Speaker Bercow, who, as I understand it, well and truly has terrific standing orders that do not allow points of order during question time. If that is what we want, I would be happy. Mr Hockey interjecting",59
68,The SPEAKER,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"The member for North Sydney is one of the ones who always want to babble on. I am simply saying to the whole chamber that if you want to change the nature of question time then perhaps it requires collective action of the House and a change of culture. If in fact you think that in other jurisdictions overseas there are answers, you might look to the culture-a culture that allows the primary question to be placed on the Notice Paper, where there is not this cross-chamber debate because there are no points of order and where the Prime Minister is not called upon to attend each question time. There are a whole host of possibilities, but it may be at some stage that the membership of this House will take it on board and not try to change the way the House is being conducted.",59
69,Mr TANNER,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"If the Leader of the Opposition and Manager of Opposition Busithat ness had allowed me to finish my sentence, they would have completely seen the relevance of the comment. That was that there is one aspect of the good old days that I do have some slight longing for. That is the days when the Liberal Party had some vaguely remotely credible economic spokespeople to put its point of view. Whatever disagreements I might have had with people like Peter Costello, at least I would concede they knew something about what they were talking about. The unfortunate situation now is that we have the Liberal Party led by people who are completely uninterested in economics allowing people who know absolutely nothing about it to be their public representaquestion tives.

70,Mr ABBOTT,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his 2007 promise to fix public hospitals by 30 June last year or, if he did not, to question. take them over from the states. Why has this promise not been kept? If the Prime Minister cannot keep promises from 2007 why should anyone believe the promises he makes in 2010?",60
71,Mr RUDD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I welcome the beginning of the health and hospitals debate, because the member who was just on his feet was the man who as health minister for four years ripped $1 billion out of Australia's public hospitals.

We have before us at the moment the man who as health minister did nothing about the undersupply of nurses to the Australian health and hospital system. Mr Abbott-Wrong.",60
72,Mr RUDD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"To all of those he says, ‘Wrong, wrong, wrong.' The bottom line is we now have a health and hospitals debate, and I welcome each day of it from this day forward. The Leader of the Opposition was asked about this this morning. He put forward his strategy for the future on health when he said, ‘I think many of them out there are wishing for the good old days.' That is the pre-2007 days. That line was just referred to by the member for Melbourne. If the Leader of the Opposition has learned absolutely nothing about the state of our hospital system since exiting as health minister and the change in government, he has had his head buried in the sand.

In the period that we have been in government, with the health minister at the helm, we have increased overall funding to the hospital system by 50 per cent. That is what we have done. We have also increased the training of GPs and nurses. We have invested significantly in cancer treatment and research. This is what we have done in two short years. As for the future plan which will be put to the states very soon, I say to those opposite that we will seek to achieve a compromise with the and hospitals states on one thing.",60

85,Mr RUDD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"On the question of the Commonwealth's role in relation to health and hospitals, and our approach, which is a reform document for the nation to examine, there have been, firstly and secondly, six months of consultations by the health minister and myself with more than 100 hospitals across Australia-some of which the former health minister himself, when he was the health minister, never visited-and, thirdly, there is a decision-making framework with the states which will come to its conclusion very soon. I am very confident that those opposite, when they see what reform plan we have for the nation, will have a very stark choice indeed. And let us remember, on the question of Commonwealth takeover, that there was a certain Leader of the Opposition, who was previously a health minister, who when asked about this question several years ago said that only one level of government should run the hospitals. He was advocating, then, a Commonwealth takeover of the hospitals. Then, when he becomes Leader of the Opposition, he backs away from it at a million miles an hour. It is a bit like last year backing the emissions trading scheme as Leader of the Opposition and this year saying that the emissions trading scheme is unacceptable. A few years ago he was backing a Commonwealth takeover of the hospital system; when he becomes Leader of the Opposition he pretends that that had never been uttered. The government welcomes health and hospital reform. We have done more in two years than you did in 12 and the reform plan will be for you to back or oppose when the states and territories have reached their own decision in the immediate future. Hospitals  is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Can the minister update the House on the government's support for public hospitals and any alternative policies?",61
86,Ms ROXON,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I welcome this opportunity and thank the member for Moreton for this question because he, as a member with very high demands in his electorate from the health system, will be very interested to be able to compare and contrast the record of the government's investments in public hospitals with the record of the Leader of the Opposition as a former health minister who cannot pretend that he was not intimately involved in every decision and every legacy left by the Howard government in our health system. We have spent the last two years rebuilding, block by block, after not just four years of this Leader of the Opposition being the health minister but also 12 years of a Howard government which neglected the system. I can understand why the public responds very badly when they are reminded of Mr Abbott's time as the health minister because one of the things that people remember most about Mr Abbott is that he pulled a billion dollars out of our public hospitals and then spent the next four years blaming the states for everything that went wrong. Compare and contrast ripping a billion dollars out of our hospitals to putting hundreds of millions of dollars into elective surgery and into emergency departments-billions of dollars into our public hospitals. This compare and contrast is a very easy thing to do. Look at another thing that the Leader of the Opposition oversaw when he was the health minister: for all of the time that the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister the Howard government had a cap on the training places for GPs. This was despite the fact that 60 per cent of the country had a shortage of GPs. For four years as the health minister, Mr Abbott simply looked the other way and tried to pretend this was somebody else's problem. We have already started to undo the damage caused by those years of neglect. We have increased the number of GP training places by 35 per cent. I am sure the public will want even more than that. We are taking action for things that the Leader of the Opposition neglected year after year after year. Actually, it reminded me very much of a very familiar Monty Python script where it was fine to say that we have just cut off an arm as we rip a billion dollars out of our hospitals and we have cut off a leg as we have capped our GP training places, and the Leader of the Opposition just kept saying: ‘It's only a flesh wound. Everything's going to be fine; it's just a flesh wound.' Mr Abbott interjecting",61
87,Ms ROXON,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition is asking about GP superclinics but the health spokesperson has not asked a question about GP superclinics. That is probably because one has opened in his electorate. Following a $2½ million dollar investment by our government in the member for Dickson's seat, the Strathpine GP superclinic opened two weeks ago and is providing services to the community that otherwise turns up at Redcliffe, Caboolture and Prince Charles hospitals, where the emergency department presentations have gone up exponentially-at one of those hospitals by more than 20 per cent. In the member for Dickson's electorate there is now a service that runs all day Saturday, all day Sunday and until seven o'clock every night during the week. The reason the shadow minister has been completely silent about it is that he did not even have the decency to turn up and congratulate them for providing these services to the community. The Leader of the Opposition is a risk. He has pulled money out of health. If he is elected, he will pull money out of health again, as his finance spokesperson has already made clear, and the public cannot afford that risk. Superannuation",62
88,Mr HOCKEY,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"My question is the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement on radio 4BC just 12 days before the last election, when he said: There will be no change to the superannuation laws-one jot, one tittle. That is unlike you! I also refer the Prime Minister to his interview with Neil Mitchell last Friday, where he admitted that what he meant by this was ‘no substantive changes'. How can the Prime Minister dismiss slashing over $4 billion from superannuation support and cutting the superannuation cocontribution scheme for low-income families as ‘finetuning'? Given this is a blatant broken promise, if the Prime Minister cannot keep his 2007 election commitments, how can he be trusted with his 2010 election commitments?",62
89,Mr RUDD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"On the question of superannuation, as the member for North Sydney would be aware, the changes which the government engineered were taken in order to ensure that we had a proper, balanced system for the future. Those opposite are ideologically opposed to it. We took a sober view in terms of the overall resources available to the budget and we engineered the changes that the honourable member has referred to. The key challenge for Australia for the future is to ensure that both our superannuation and our savings system are sustainable. Remember, one of the challenges of the ageing population is to ensure that that occurs. That goes to savings policies generally, pensions on the other hand and superannuation as well. That is why we have taken the actions that we have. Many of them have been unpopular. The government accepts that. But can I simply say, as a government which has a proud legacy in introducing superannuation to this country as a compulsory measureopposed tooth and nail by those opposite, year after year, almost decade after decadewe are proud of our record on superannuation in the past and we intend to continue to support proper superannuation for Australians and retirees into the future. Infrastructure Mrs D'ATH (3.01 pm)-My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Why is investment in infrastructure critical to Australia's economic growth and productivity? Are there any risks to the government's nation-building investment?",63
90,Mr ALBANESE,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the honourable member for her question. The Rudd government is indeed investing in infrastructure, because we want to build a stronger economy for working families into the future. Today I announce that two more projects as part of our economic stimulus plan have been completed-two projects in the eastwest corridor between Adelaide and Kalgoorlie. The $23 million projects, in which two new loop lines have been put in, will lead to practical productivity benefits in two ways. Firstly, they will allow trains of up to a kilometre and a half in length to operate along the track and, secondly, they will allow those longer trains to travel much more quickly-a big productivity benefit and dividend as a direct result of the economic stimulus plan. But this is all at risk because today Senator Joyce has reaffirmed his view that cutbacks to infrastructure investment are on the opposition's agenda. He has confirmed what the current Leader of the Opposition has said; he has confirmed what the former Leader of the Opposition has said: that cutbacks to infrastructure are on the agenda. But, of course, the coalition have got form, because when they last came to office, in 1996, they slashed $2 billion from the road budget over their first eight years. No wonder the Business Council of Australia have estimated that we inherited a $90 billion infrastructure deficit. Now the opposition wants to make more cuts",63
91,Unknown,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Opposition members interjecting,63
92,Mr ALBANESE,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,A $90 billion infrastructure deficit! Mr Hockey-What a made-up figure!,64
93,Mr ALBANESE,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"It is from Business Council of Australia. We know those opposite want to argue with the business community, but that is what the BCA said. But, now that the coalition have walked away from market based economics, it is not surprising that they want to battle the Business Council of Australia. Now we know that the opposition want to make more cuts or raise taxes to pay for their climate con job, because that is the only way that they can pay for it. We know on health that the Leader of the Opposition has said he wants to go backwards to the good old days when he cut $1 billion from hospitals. We know that they cut $2 billion from roads when they came into office. They need to say which projects they would cut that were part of the bring-forward of the economic stimulus plan. The Brighton Bypass in Tasmaniawill they cut that? Will they cut the Northern Expressway in South Australia, the Western Ring Road in Melbourne or the Ipswich Motorway upgrade? We know that that is on their agenda because they have confirmed that that is the case. What about the Pacific Motorway Transit Project on the Gold Coast, in South-East Queensland? The Bulahdelah Bypass in the electorate of Paterson-will they cut that? What about the duplication of the Douglas Arterial Road in Townsville in Queensland, the Tarcutta Bypass on the Hume Highway, the Woomargama Bypass on the Hume Highway or indeed the Western Highway at Anthony's Cutting, which is due to commence construction next week? We have it there. They say they will make cuts. They need to come clean about where those cuts will be. We on this side of the House regard infrastructure as an investment for the future good of our economy. Workplace Relations",64
94,Mr ABBOTT,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement to this parliament on 20 August 2008, when he said: No working families in this country will be worse off as a consequence of the industrial relations laws that we have advanced here in this parliament … I also refer the Prime Minister to his interview with Neil Mitchell last Friday, where he said: I'm not going to be in a position now nor were we then to say that in each individual circumstance there won't be some variation. You can't do that. My question to the Prime Minister is: can he explain how this is not a blatant broken promise? Can he justify what appears to be, on the face of it, a clear misleading of this parliament?",64
95,Mr RUDD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Firstly, the statement to which he refers was given on 20 March last year, not 20 August as he suggests. Secondly, the statement is as followsMr Abbott interjecting",64
96,Mr RUDD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Well, it is, but you may be referring to a separate statement. The statement which the honourable member I think refers to is as follows: No working families in this country will be worse off as a consequence of the industrial relations laws that we have advanced here in this parliament … As the honourable member will know on any honest reflection, that refers to the transitional legislation which was before the House then.",64
97,Unknown,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Opposition members interjecting,64
98,Mr RUDD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Those opposite will know that that is exactly the legislation which was before the House at the time. The trickiness suggested by those opposite lies in the Leader of the Opposition conflating that piece of legislation with the Fair Work Bill, which came in later. That is what the Leader of the Opposition has done deliberately in this House. He puts himself up as a straight talker, but, when you dig beneath what he says, he had one position on emissions trading last year but has a new position this year, and he had one position on a Commonwealth takeover of hospitals a few years ago but has a different and reverse position now. What the Leader of the Opposition, the straight talker from central casting, now seeks to do is to conflate the debate in the House at the time on the transitional legislation which the industrial relations minister had before the House at the time and the Fair Work Bill, which was considered later. The legislation to which the honourable member refers was the transitional legislation which ensured that every worker on an AWA would have the option of remaining on their existing AWA arrangements. We also introduced a no disadvantage test for new arrangements. Together, these provisions ensured that no worker would be made worse off as a result of the transitional arrangements. That was the debate at the time, and the Leader of the Opposition would know that full well. Therefore, that is the position we put to the Australian public at the time. Secondly, the honourable member may also be interested in what we have said in relation to the Fair Work Act and the commitments we gave to the Australian people at the time. What we said when we introduced these changes to our industrial laws, Forward with Fairness, was as follows: Labor will get the balance right by introducing a fairer and more flexible industrial relations system with sensible transitional arrangements from Mr Howard's Work Choices laws. That is what we did. The honourable member may also be seeking to refer to the impact of awards. I am not sure whether that is within the scope of his question, but can I just say to the honourable member that our position in that respect is absolutely clear-cut and consistent with the past as well. Mr Abbott interjecting",64
99,Mr RUDD,SHADOW MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"The honourable member goes to this question about who is being forthright in this place. What he has done today is deliberately take a debate which related to the transitional arrangements in the House at the time-he knows that-and roll it forward to a subsequent consideration by the House of the Fair Work Act. Hence the clever caveat of his question: ‘It appears that a misleading of the House has occurred.' No such misleading of the House has occurred. In fact, the misleading is contained within the question just asked by the Leader of the Opposition, and he knows it full well. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",65
100,Mr ABBOTT,PRIME MINISTER,I seek leave to move a motion of censure against the Prime Minister. Leave not granted.,65
101,Mr ABBOTT,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving the following motion forthwith: That this House censures the Prime Minister for dishonouring the solemn pledges he made to the Australian people and for now walking away from those promises after being forced to admit he can't keep them and they should never have been made in the first place, and: (1) in particular for promising: (a) in this House that no working family would be worse off as a consequence of the Government's industrial relations law changes when day by day, we have examples of workers losing pay at a time when the cost of living is increasing; (b) to fix public hospitals, or take them over, and having done neither, by now walking away from his promise to give the Australian people more say in how their health system is run; (c) to help everyday Australians cope with rising costs of living yet failing to help families and pensioners manage increasingly tight household budgets including the failure of his flawed FuelWatch and GroceryChoice schemes; (d) to do something about homelessness and indigenous housing when after two years, communities are still in crisis; (e) to leave the superannuation system alone, in his own words, “no change to the superannuation laws, one jot, one tiddle”, before then ripping $4 billion out of superannuation and slashing the Superannuation Co-contribution Scheme for low and middle income earners; but (2) most of all: (a) for trying to obscure the truth behind many of his Government's policies with a wall of incomprehensive words and an army of spin-doctors when all the Australian people want is simple, straightforward answers about the issues that affect them and a real plan to pay off debt, safeguard the economy, protect jobs and take this country forward. What we have seen today is a Prime Minister who is deceptive, a Prime Minister who is weak and a Prime Minister who, above all else, is tricky with the Australian public. On three important issues, we have tried to bring this Prime Minister and this government to account in the House today. First of all, we have tried to bring the Prime Minister to account on his broken promise to fix the public hospital system by the middle of 2009 and, if it is not fixed, to take over the public hospital system. Of all the commitments that this Prime Minister made prior to the last election, I believe this was the most significant. The Australian people know that the state Labor governments have been mismanaging public hospitals for years and years. This Prime Minister was going to be different. He came before the Australian public and said, ‘I'm going to fix this.' Remember? He said, ‘The buck will stop with me, and, if the states have not fixed the problem by the middle of 2009, I'm going to take them over.' Well, that was 2007; 2009 has come and gone; 2010 is well and truly here. What did we have the Australian Prime Minister tell the Australian people in this parliament toand day? Isn'the a brave man! Isn'the a man for decisive action! He said, ‘We'll seek to achieve a compromise with the states.' Here he is, ‘Courageous Kevin', the man who was going to take the public hospital system over. What does he say today? He does not offer us a takeover; he offers us a decision-making framework. Here he is, the lifelong bureaucrat, addicted to process, committees, reviews and liaison-this is the stuff of his life. He told us today that, yes, there will be a bold plan, but after the states and territories have reached their decision. He wants to be bold; it is just that the states and territories are holding him back. This is a man who cannot do anything without the agreement of the states and territories-and the public are absolutely sick of it. Then, of course, we had the superannuation promise-not one jot, not one tittle of change will be made to the superannuation system. We know that $4 billion was ripped out, we know that the co-contribution scheme was drastically changed in the last budget. What does big brave Kevin say on radio last Friday? He says, ‘Oh, just a bit of finetuning.' You know, something is hovering over this Prime Minister: core promises. This is a man who is dishonest with the Australian people, and now he is slipping and sliding and twisting and turning, engaging in sneaky word games to try and get out of the responsibility that he has for breaking the solemn pledges that he has made to the Australian people. Of all the things that the Australian public are concerned about, of all the things that working families are concerned about, there is nothing so much as their take-home pay. There is nothing so important to the working families of this country as the take-home pay of their breadwinners. This is a prime minister who stood up and said time and time again that nothing that the government does will hurt the take-home pay of Australian workers. He said it in parliament; he said it out of parliament. And it was not just him and it was not just in relation to the government's transitional bill; it was plainly in tion to the government's substantive bill. I quote the Deputy Prime Minister: I can certainly guarantee that there's nothing the operations of Labor's system that is going make people worse off. And didn't she get nailed by Laurie Oakes on Sunday! Wasn't that the toughest interview and didn't you see, Mr Speaker, all of a sudden the wind knocked right out of her sails? She knows that she and the Prime Minister are guilty of a gross deception against the Australian people. Let us just run through it. You have got hospitality workers in many states, not exactly rich people earning $150,000 a year in the eyes of the government; these are people who are lucky to earn $20 an hour, and in some states they going to be $3 an hour worse off as a result of this government's changes, as a result of this government's broken promise. We heard a lot of posturing from the Minister for Health and Ageing and from the Prime Minister today about the alleged wrongs of the former government. Who are just about the hardest working people and most decent and honourable people in our community but nurses, particularly nurses in aged care, and those aged care nurses are going to be up to $300 a week worse off as a result of this government's changes. It is a flagrant breach of the government's promise. Members opposite like to talk about Work Choices. The nurses union says that the government's scheme is worse than Work Choices, and it is. We would never have ripped $300 a week out of the wages of the good, honest working people of this country. The Prime Minister has plainly misled the parliament by claiming that no-one is going to be worse off under his scheme when plainly people are very, very much worse off under his scheme. Let me just say this. The relamost solemn principle that must be adhered to by members of this place is: do not mislead this parliament. I cite none other authorin ity than Gough Whitlam himself: ‘The printo ciple is that the parliament must be able to accept assurances given to it by a minister. If those assurances prove to be misleading, the minister concerned must be held responsible. He must resign.' Let us not be content with Gough. I am quoting the Prime Minister himself: Trust in any democracy is a fragile thing, and trust is based on truth. If you fracture truth, you fracture the trust upon which it is based. That is the Prime Minister himself. He has failed his own test, and he deserves to be censured. (Time expired)",65
102,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Is the motion seconded?,67
103,Mr HOCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"I second the motion. In a press conference on 29 February 2008 the Prime Minister said: Trust is the key currency of politics and unless you can be trusted to honour that which you've committed to do then I've got to say, you're going to obtain the enduring tralian people. In front of the most sacred building in this capital, the Australian War Memorial, the Prime Minister said on 17 March 2008: … we will honour all of our pre-election commitments. Every one of them, every one of them. The Prime Minister is right: there is a measure of trust between Australian representatives in this place and the Australian people. What has now become perfectly evident to everyday Australians is that this Prime Minister has broken that bond of trust. This Prime Minister made a commitment to the Australian people that he would fix the hospital system by the middle of 2009 and that, if he did not deliver, he would hold a referendum to take over the hospitals from the states. This Prime Minister made a commitment that working families in Australia would not be worse off as a result of his new workplace laws, yet each day evidence comes out that they are worse off. This Prime Minister made a commitment to the Australian people that they would have cheaper household goods, that they would have cheaper fuel and that he would do that by setting up websites and a range of other initiatives. Groceries are more expensive, electricity is more expensive, water is more expensive, gas is more expensive, education is more expensive, going to hospital is more expensive and medical costs for Australian families are more expensive. Yet this Prime Minister asks for trust! He asked the Australian people. He asked the educators, the health carers, the patients and the students to trust him that he would keep his promises. Even on Friday on Melbourne radio the Prime Minister tried to justify a broken promise-$4 billion. It was finetuning in the same league as the honesty of Fine Cotton$4 billion. When the Prime Minister was asked, ‘What's the difference between subnot stantive and minor?' the Prime Minister said, respect of the Aushand on heart: Substantive goes to the entire system, as opposed to let's call it finetuning at the edges … … … … These things affect people fundamentally. That's why Neil you have got to be absolutely straight up and down with people about what you are going to do and then take it to the Australian people if you are going to make any substantive changes. … … … As I've said, I'm not prejudging what is the independent reviewwe have no idea what he is talking about nowbecause I haven't worked my way through that. But if we make any decisions in that respect it'll be subject to full scrutiny and people will make up their mind one way or the other. That's a new definition of ‘finetuning'. Sadly, it is a definition of ‘broken promise'. It is about breach of trust. It is a definition that this Prime Minister has set for himself, along with his own benchmark, that illustrates the fact that the Prime Minister has misled the Australian people. He has broken that sacred bond of trust which he asked the Australian people for in 2007 and which he pretended to honour in 2008. But, in 200910, we know this Prime Minister cannot be trusted. If the Prime Minister cannot keep his 2007 election commitments, how can Australians expect him to keep his promises in 2010? How can they expect to trust a Prime Minister who breaks his word, who enjoins the notion of trust? How can they expect that Prime Minister to solemnly look the Australian people in the eye and honour commitments made in 2010, when, as each day passes, Australians are suffering the impact of broken promises?",67
104,Mr RUDD,PRIME MINISTER,"What is really interesting for the nation about this motion is that it comes on the day when the member for Wentworth stood to his feet and belled the cat on climate change policy. What this is about, with the pre-prepared speeches by those opposite, is making sure that they can fill the time, fill the space, and make sure there is no focus on the fact that two months ago they stood rock solid behind the then Leader of the Opposition on the approach to climate change. Today is all about one thing: distraction with a capital ‘D', because the former Leader of the Opposition stood to his feet and said unequivocally why the coalition had supported an emissions trading scheme. He said unequivocally that the alternative scheme would be a fiscal disaster. So what we have here is a simple parliamentary tactic, a parliamentary device, to take the attention away from climate change. Interestingly, the last several questions during question slid away from the topic that they have held to be so fundamentally important over this last week or so and which now has been relegated to the margins because the member for Wentworth belled the cat and exposed the Leader of the Opposition for what he is. The Leader of the Opposition's baseline position is, ‘Climate change is absolute crap.' Then he went on to say, ‘Well, the government has a mandate to act on an emissions trading scheme.' That was his second position. His third position was, ‘If they accept the opposihospital tion's amendments, then we will support the emissions trading scheme.' His fourth position on emissions trading and climate was as follows: ‘We should oppose it.' That was his view. In fact what he said, once he got to the eve of the Liberal Party election ballot, was, ‘I'm fundamentally opposed to action on climate change.' Here is a very interesting further twist: when he has been asked since then about the change from December to January or from November to December in his support for an emissions trading scheme, the Leader of the Opposition has gone around saying, ‘Well, things changed at Copenhagen.' There is a little problem with that, Tony: Copenhagen happened two weeks after you announced your change in policy. There is a little sequencing problem there. What in fact you sought to do was grasp the politics of the internal battle within your party and wrest the leadership from the member for Wentworth, the former Leader of the Opposition. That is what it was all about. In fact, when asked on 1 December by a journalist why he was changing suddenly, for the fifth time, his position on climate change, the ‘straight talk Tony' response was: ‘Oh, Mate, the politics have changed. They've changed big time.' So, ‘Captain Principle', ‘Captain Consistent', the straight-talking Leader of the Opposition, with five different positions on climate change, having gone to the previous election with hand on heart, supporting the introduction of an emissions trading scheme, then seeks to tell us he has changed posture because of Copenhagen while having in fact announced that change in posture two weeks before Copenhagen was convened. That is because the Leader of the Opposition just makes it up as he goes along. Every single thing he makes up as he goes along. Whether it is the matter he raised in his motion moved just before about the future of the system-the stentorian Tony Abbott as health minister telling the nation three years ago that he was going to take over the hospital system. That is what he thought the future should be. Then he gets to the first question asked about the future of the hospital system when he became the Leader of the Opposition and he says, ‘I didn't mean that.' In Battlelines, where he is supposed to have given his real, heartfelt position, what does he say? He says on the future of the emissions trading scheme that he ‘backed the then government's view because it was the most cost-effective approach'. That was supposed to be Tony Abbott unbottled. That was supposed to be Tony Abbott uncapped. That was supposed to be Tony Abbott telling like it is-except, once again, it just changed, as each position changes along the way. What is fascinating about today's debate, in particular in terms of its dimensions on health and hospitals, is that it comes back the Leader of the Opposition getting to his feet and speaking about integrity on health and hospitals. I have a few words that I think the nation may remember, which came from the Leader of the Opposition when he was health minister of Australia for four years. He said to the Australian people he would provide a ‘rock-solid guarantee'. What was that rock-solid, ironclad guarantee about? Was it about the Medicare safety net? Was this minister responsible for it? I think he was. Regarding the integrity of the Leader of the Opposition against the benchmark he just sought to advance, which is to honour your commitments to the Australian people, he said to everyone prior to the election that they had from him a ‘rock-solid, ironclad guarantee' as far as the future of the Medicare safety net went, and what did he do? As soon as the election was held, as the minister responsible, the health minister of Australia, he welshed on it. That goes to the absolute core of the integrity of the argument being advanced by the Leader of the Opposition. Can I also add this: he stands at the dispatch box and talks about integrity as it relates to the health system when, as health minister of Australia, he ripped $1 billion from the public hospitals of Australia. He goes also to the question of the government's record of achievement in health and hospitals-one billion dollars ripped out by the Leader of the Opposition and a 50 per cent increase in funding to hospitals under this government. Secondly, under this government 125 hospitals have received new elective surgery equipment and operating theatres in just two years. Opposition member interjecting",68
105,Mr RUDD,PRIME MINISTER,"He interjects: ‘That didn't make much of a difference.' The Leader of the Opposition would be interested to know that it made a difference to 62,000 elective surgery procedures, which, as health minister to of Australia ripping a billion dollars out of the system, he sought simply to undermine. Thirdly, 37 hospitals are receiving upgrades to their emergency departments. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition's record on direct funding to emergency departments was zero as health minister-not one brass razoo, not a single dollar either to emergency departments or to elective surgery. Then there is $3.17 billion for 36 major health infrastructure projects. This is the first government in Australian history to directly invest in the capital that is the building needs of the public hospital system of Australia. What did he say for four years as health minister of Australia? He said: ‘That's not my problem. It's the states' problem.' What we have done, for the first time, is invest directly in our hospitals. That is why we are investing $100 million into the future development of the Nepean Hospital. That is why we are going to make investments like that elsewhere in the country as well. He asked about achievement and honouring our commitments to improve health outcomes for the Australian people. Five hundred and sixty thousand teenagers have received a check-up under the Medicare Teen Dental Plan, which did not exist when he was health minister. It was brought in by us, and half a million kids, often from lower income profiles, are getting a dental checkup which they would otherwise not have got. The Leader of the Opposition sat on his hands and did nothing about the chronic shortage of nursing places in Australia. Therefore, under this government in its first year of operation, 2009, universities offered an additional 1,094 undergraduate nursing places. When he was health minister, this man froze GP training places. How could he do that against the health needs of the nation? Since coming into office we have increased GP training places by 75 in 2009 alone. A further achievement-and they often guffaw about as if there is something remarkable about it-is the implementation of the GP Super Clinics program across the country. We are funding 36 of them across the country. How many did they fund? Zero. Funding agreements underpin 28 of them, and a number are already operating, compared to a record of zero on the part of those opposite. Aged care places have increased by nearly 10,000. Six hundred and sixty-two transitional care places have been delivered to help nearly 5,000 older Australians, and the Leader of the Opposition gets to his feet and says, ‘Where is your integrity on the question of health and hospitals?' I say to him that in two years alone we have achieved more by way of investments into the system than he achieved in 12 years in the previous government. That is the basic comparator, which is why I said to him earlier today that we welcome fundamentally this debate on health and hospitals. And let us never forget that as a member of the government he axed the Commonwealth dental program, with 650,000 Australians on public dental waiting lists. I go back to where this debate began. Why have they brought it on today all of a flush and all of a hurry? Because of their fear of the member for Wentworth being on television tonight. We know what the member for Wentworth had to say earlier in his general character reference concerning the Leader of the Opposition. His reference to the Leader of the Opposition and the policy he was putting forth in terms of climate change was this: Any policy that is announced will simply be a con, an environmental fig leaf to cover a determination to do nothing. That is what the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, said about Tony Abbott. I think the Australian people spot this for what it is.

120,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I make a ministerial statement relating to the exit from the government's guarantee of large deposits and wholesale funding. On several occasions now since this government took office, I have updated the House on Australia's path through the worse global recession in 75 years. Through March and June 2008, I warned of the deteriorating global outlook, and advised that much of the impact on the real economy was yet to be felt. In September 2008, I said I was confident that, through the hard work and unity of all Australians, we would come through these challenges in a position of strength and ready to tackle our future. I am sure all the honourable members of this House were pleased to see the IMF, just two weeks ago, endorse again Australia's standout economic performance among the developed world during the global recession. We are virtually alone amongst advanced economies in avoiding recession. That is why I believe that Australians have good reason to be confident, but of course not complacent, about our economic prospects. And it is against this improving economic landscape that I would like to update honourable members, and through them the Australian people, on a very significant development in Australia's financial and economic recovery. Yesterday, I announced that the government, acting on the advice of the Council of Financial Regulators, will withdraw on 31 March 2010 its guarantee of large deposits and wholesale funding for authorised deposit-taking institutions. However, as I made clear yesterday, the government's Financial Claims Scheme will continue to provide certainty to depositors through a free guarantee for their deposits of up to $1 million until October 2011, at which time the $1 million cap will be reviewed. This deposit guarantee provides automatic free coverage for an estimated 99.5 per cent of Australian depositors. Following these announcements yesterday, I would like to use today, in this first parliamentary session of the year, to describe the context for our decision to exit the guarantee of large deposits and wholesale funding. As honourable members know, the collapse of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 sent shockwaves through financial markets across every time zone. In the months that followed, we saw global financial markets in disarray. Lenders across the world became paralysed by fear and anxiety-as their previous complacency about risk was shattered into pieces. What followed was the severe dislocation of global credit markets as investors ran for safety. Governments and regulators across the world took unprecedented policy actions to stabilise the global financial system. Some even had to go as far as injecting taxpayers' money to prop up major financial institutions or, worse still, outright nationalisation. And even here in Australia, as Governor Stevens of the Reserve Bank put it, people were ‘ringing money programs on TV and asking, “Is my money okay in the banks?”' Honourable members will know, as Governor Stevens stated at the time, that the swer to this question was of course yes. Our banks are highly rated, well capitalised and did not engage in the risky lending seen in some countries. But, as Governor Stevens told us, actions like those taken by the Australian government maintained ‘public confidence in the security of the banking system'. And honourable members will know that, despite the resilience of our banks, they still compete in global credit markets for funding against other borrowers all around the world. There was a period in late 2008 where our banks experienced great difficulty in borrowing offshore, and this threatened the flow of credit to the entire Australian economy. Where Australian banks were able to borrow at all, the cost had skyrocketed since the onset of the global financial crisis. In mid2007, before the crisis, our banks were able to issue five-year wholesale funding for as cheap as 35 basis points over the benchmark rate. By late 2008, at the peak of the crisis, this had blown out by a multiple of five times-to 175 basis points over the benchmark rate. Our G20 colleagues started introducing bank guarantees to support international borrowing by their banks. So the Australian government acted quickly and decisively to ensure our banks stayed on a level playing field. On 12 October 2008, the government announced the guarantee of all deposits and wholesale funding. This was just one in a suite of actions that we tect Australia against the worse the world could throw at us. The Rudd government provided three critical waves of fiscal stimulus to boost mand, keep businesses ticking over and support employment. As a result, Australia has been virtually alone among advanced economies in avoiding recession. Australia now has lower debt and deficits than comparable countries, we have maintained our AAA rating, and we have the second lowest uneman- ployment of the major advanced economies. So it is unsurprising, with everything else we are doing to support jobs and growth, that the community has not focused as much on the importance of the guarantee in keeping our economy moving forward. But the government's guarantee of wholesale funding was indeed central to Australia's crisis response. It gave our banks continued access to global capital markets on competitive terms, allowing them to raise more than $160 billion. This meant they could keep lending to Australian businesses and households, providing vital support for jobs and growth. And the Financial Claims Scheme will keep giving over 16 million Australians certainty over their deposits. In fact, we had Governor Stevens say in early 2009 that actions like those of the Australian government ‘helped to stabilise what could have been a catastrophic loss of confidence in the global financial system'. In the governor's words, he thought ‘what was done stabilised a potentially quite dangerous situation'. Governor Stevens said that these measures saw ‘term spreads in money markets decline' from their peak, and ‘long-term markets reopen to banks'. And the IMF told us the guarantee has been critical in supporting the flow of credit through the Australian economy. It allowed our banks last year to issue bonds in larger amounts, with longer maturities and at lower cost, than had been took to pro- possible since mid-2007. But of course, the guarantee was put in place to support the Australian people-not the banks. Australian banks and other lenders de- have so far paid around $1.1 billion to the taxpayer for the use of the guarantee and will pay around $5.5 billion over its full life. And without the guarantee, our banks would have lent less and interest rates for borrowers would have been higher. This would have led directly to lower growth and more households losing a breadwinner right across Australia. The government has always said the guarantee would be withdrawn ‘once market conditions have normalised'. We put in place ‘very strong real-time monitoring arrangements' through the Council of Financial Regulators. Our regulators have constantly monitored international developments, evolving market conditions, and the financial position of all Australian ADIs. The council advised the government late last year that it was coming to the view that conditions may warrant removal of the guarantee. After further assessments, the council recommended we close the guarantee to new issuance as at 31 March this year. The council considered that bank funding conditions had improved such that the guarantee is no longer needed. This reflects the prudential strength of our individual ADIs and the strength of our whole financial system. The council has advised that none of these institutions would need the guarantee to fund themselves. In fact, the proportion of non-guaranteed issuance by Australian banks has increased from less than two per cent at the start of 2009 98 per cent in January 2010. As I said yesterday, I have been discussing the future of the guarantee with the council for some time. And I have been talking to the council about market conditions through the whole period of the guarantee, since October 2008. The council's recommendation has not changed in light of the recent anxiety in some global markets. And critically, our regulators have explicitly advised that removing the guarantee will not materially affect banking sector funding costs. So I make this point very clearly-there will be absolutely no justification for any bank to raise interest rates beyond future Reserve Bank movements, for any reason at all, including the removal of the guarantee. As I have said before, with some banks' interest margins having recovered to pre-crisis levels, the Australian people will not tolerate any bank trying to take them for a ride. Finally, the council advised that the Australian guarantee should not be available much longer than other countries', given the greater strength of our financial system compared to many of them. Key G20 countries, including the United States, Canada, France and Korea have withdrawn their wholesale funding guarantees. The UK and Germany will do so shortly. So just as our stimulus is being progressively withdraw, it is appropriate we now move to start unwinding our guarantees. Honourable members will know that the government has also announced the withdrawal of the Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing on 31 December 2010. In July last year, I announced the formal commencement of the state guarantee. I said then that the global recession has ‘severely constricted liquidity in state government bond markets', and that ‘supporting liquidity in these markets is critical to maintaining the capacity of state and territory governments to to deliver on nation-building investments'. The government's announcement led to a sharp improvement in the pricing of state bonds relative to Commonwealth bonds and restored demand for state government bonds. These benefits were experienced by all states, regardless of whether they opted to make explicit use of the guarantee. The state guarantee scheme was also established as an interim measure to be withdrawn when market conditions normalised. However, a longer transition period relative to the guarantee of large deposits and wholesale funding is required for states to establish liquidity in new unguaranteed bond lines. Unlike bank funding, issuing bonds under such existing lines is a critical source of funding for the states. All states and territoabled ries will therefore continue to have access to the guarantee until 31 December 2010. Withdrawing the guarantee of large deposits and wholesale funding represents a significant milestone for Australia's banking system in pushing past the worse of the financial crisis. But it is appropriate to not only take stock of the resilience of our finanand cial system, but to also reflect on some of the challenges forced on us by the global economic carnage we have withstood. The stability of Australia's banking system has been recognised consistently by both the IMF and the OECD. But as I said earlier, we were not immune from the impacts of the financial crisis-it created significant challenges for competition in our domestic banking market. The guarantee has been critical in helping to support competition. It offered wholesale funding certainty to more than 150 Australian ADIs, including regional banks, building societies and credit unions. It has allowed non-major Australian banks to raise over $32 billion in funding from international credit markets. We know that we cannot undo all the impacts of the global financial crisis, we are working hard to support banking competition. Honourable members may be aware that the securitisation market was one of the strongest drivers of competition in the mortgage market in the decade before the crisis. So on 30 November last year, I directed the Australian Office of Financial Management to invest another $8 billion in high-quality, AAA rated Australian residential mortgage backed securities to further support competition in Australia's mortgage market. This was in addition to the Rudd government's initial $8 billion investment, which we launched in 2008. The government's direct investment of up to $16 billion in the RMBS market has ensmaller lenders to lend at competitive interest rates and maintain a higher level of lending than would otherwise have been possible. It has also been critical to preserving market infrastructure and fostering a recovery in private investor confidence. And just over a week ago, I announced a fresh boost to competition with three non-bank lenders two smaller banks allocated up to $3.4 billion in funding, from our second $8 billion RMBS investment. It is expected that private investors will also participate significantly in these offerings, following recent encouraging signs of improvement in securitisation markets. As I said a week ago, private capital has now made up some 37 per cent-or $4.6 billion-of the $12.4 billion in Australian RMBS issuance in which the AOFM has taken a stake since the government's initial announcement in September 2008. This will place more competition on the big banks, helping to put downward pressure on mortgage rates over time. The Rudd government have acted decisively to support banking competition, but we know we simply cannot but overcome all of the effects of the global financial crisis overnight. We understand that mortgage repayments are a big part of the monthly budget for most Australian families. We will keep looking for ways to make it easier for families, at kitchen tables around Australia, to balance the household budget. For starters, we have introduced tough new consumer credit protection laws, due to come into force this year. These new laws will be the toughest laws governing consumer credit Australia has ever had, with wide-ranging powers to overrule unfair terms in credit contracts, including mortgages. And we will always make sure the independent competition regulator, the ACCC, is armed with the powers it needs to prevent anti-competitive behaviour by the banks. Finally, we will continue to promote Australia's future as a leading financial services hub-we want to get the settings right to encourage new competitors into our local banking sector. Now more than ever Australia is the investment destination of choice, offering among the most robust financial, physical and regulatory infrastructure globally. The clear objective of the Rudd government is to position Australia to leverage the global economic recovery by preserving this reputation. I would like to also take this opportunity to briefly discuss the global regulatory landscape for the banking sector. As honourable members know, there were some fundamental problems with key aspects of financial market regulation, particularly in other countries. These led to excessive risk taking across global financial markets. That is why Australia has committed to working through the G20 and the Financial Stability Board to address the underlying weaknesses in the global regulatory system. We have to ensure that global financial markets contribute to sustainable global growth and not to the types of destabilising behaviour we have seen in recent years. Of course, this will mean a substantial adjustment for some financial systems and institutions, particularly in the developed world. We recognise the need to work with our G20 colleagues to create a consistent international set of principles for regulation of our increasto ingly interconnected global financial system. It is important that financial institutions not be able to simply ‘go shopping' for the easiest set of financial regulations. But, of course, Australia's financial system did not suffer the same excesses as seen elsewhere. So our financial system is not expected to need to go through the same degree of adjustment. To this end, APRA, the Reserve Bank and the Treasury are working through the G20 to ensure any financial reform arrangements are appropriate for Australia and reflect the resilience of our system. The key here is better regulation rather than more regulation. But I will say this to the banks: the Australian people will not tolerate any bank abusing their place in the Australian economy because of their strength. The Rudd government is working to ensure Australia continues to have a stable, efficient and competitive financial sector which will continue to serve our broader economy and the Australian people. Australia's financial system stands today as the envy of the world. This reflects both the hard work and experience of our regulators and the decisive action of the Rudd government. The government took swift action to ensure our banks' access to global capital markets, to support RMBS funding for smaller lenders and to provide certainty for depositors across Australia. This ensured the continued flow of credit and, together with the government's timely and targeted stimulus, helped infuse a sense of confidence in the Australian people. Australians worked together like they have always donebusinesses and employees, governments and households-driving our economy to outperform all other major advanced economies around the world.

122,Mr HOCKEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The introduction of the bank guarantees was a necessary step to preserve confidence in the Australian financial system during the global financial crisis. Let us be very clear: there were two bank guarantees: firstly, the guarantee of wholesale raisings was announced in October 2008 and took effect one month later. It was provided for a fee and was introduced primarily to preserve the ability of Australian deposit-taking instiantee tutions to raise funds in the international capital markets. About $166 billion of taxpayer guaranteed funds were raised by banks up to the end of December. Non-major Australian banks raised over $32 billion from international markets, as the Treasurer outlined in his press release. What the Treasurer did not tell you was that $134 billion was raised by the four major banks: ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac. The government has received $1.1 billion in fees and will receive a total of $5.5 billion over the full life of the guarantee. The coalition does not as a general principle support government interference in markets unless there is clear evidence of market failure. It supported the introduction of the wholesale guarantee as a temporary measure to ensure Australian banks had a level playing field in competing with banks offshore for funds. The Treasurer constantly says in this place that we opposed it. In fact, the cords show that we supported it. I seek leave to table the Votes and Proceedings, No. 63, of the House of Representatives of Tuesday, 25 November 2008, which states quite clearly that the question was put and passed and that the bill was read a second time. Leave not granted.",77
123,Mr HOCKEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"That was a trivial response. The coalition notes that other key developed countries have withdrawn or announced a withdrawal of their wholesale funding guarantees. I also know that Australian banks are now able to readily access offshore markets for funds without the use of the guarantee. On these grounds the coalition supports the decision to terminate the wholesale bank guarantee, effective 31 March. However, I would ask the Treasurer to ensure that there is no last-minute rush by banks to gorge themselves on the government guarantee before the deadline. The use of the guarby the banks is a contingent liability of the Commonwealth. I expect the Treasurer will fully outline that in the upcoming budget. The Australian people should be very wary of any increase in liabilities, on balance sheet or contingent, beyond the bare minimum. I also note the comments today by David Liddy, the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank of Queensland, and by a number of other smaller institutions worried that they will not be able to raise money at an affordable rate, and those concerns need to be addressed by the Treasurer. The second guarantee was a retail deposit guarantee, which was introduced in November 2008 for a period of three years. It has a natural end date, of course, of November 2011. The retail deposit guarantee was introduced to preserve retail depositor confidence in all regulated ADIs. The coalition did not support an uncapped scheme and suggested that it should be capped at $100,000. We reremember the complete mess the government created with its introduction of an uncapped guarantee. Then it changed to the cap and created distortions for a number of other financial institutions, cash management trusts and mortgage trusts. It created confusion amongst the general public. We specifically said before it was introduced that it should introduce a cap of $100,000. The government introduced an unlimited cap, completely screwed the market and then pulled it back to a deposit for a million dollars. Even now there are some areas where people are completely confused about whether a deposit has an uncapped guarantee, a guarantee or whether part of the funds are guaranteed or not. I want to come to responsibilities of the banks. It would have been fair and reasonable for the Australian government to have requested something in addition to a fee in return for the support granted by taxpayers to the authorised deposit-taking institutions. After all, the provision of the guarantee was one of the reasons, but obviously not the key reason, we were able to outperform many of our Northern Hemisphere counterparts. I ask the House to bear in mind that I was the minister that introduced a whole lot of financial reform, which the Treasurer naturally enough does not want to talk about but which helped to get us through the most difficult times in the financial services sector. I note that the Treasurer has called on the banks to behave as good corporate citizens. Every time the term ‘bank' is mentioned, you can rest assured the Treasurer will say, ‘We're giving them a warning not to act inappropriately.' He tends to do that, to overplay, and he tends to have stern words that unfortunately fall on deaf ears. Loan spreads have widened. In April 2009 the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate by 25 basis points, but banks reduced the standard interest rate on variable mortgages by only 10 basis points. And what did the Treasurer say? He noted in media interviews on 8 April and again on 21 April that he was ‘pretty disappointed' with the banks' actions and, ‘They do need a good kick up the bum occasionally.' The Prime Minister is not happy with it. He asked them to reconsider and said that the government has made it very clear that it wants to see a full pass-through of cash rate decreases. Strike 1: the wrath of Treasurer in April 2009 was meaningless. In June 2009 there was no change in the RBA cash rate and yet banks, on average, lifted the standard variable rate by five basis points. The Treasurer said in the media at that time that the decision gets in the way of rate relief-‘Australians will be rightly furious; I think this is a very selfish decision,' and, ‘It is so disappointing to see this decision. I think it is a very selfish decision.' Strike 2: the Treasurer gave further interviews in October and November, saying that they would be no justification for banks to increase their mortgage rates over and above the increase in the cash rate, yet one month later, in December 2009, the Reserve Bank increased the cash rate by 25 basis points and the banks responded by lifting the standard variable mortgage rate by 35 basis points. Strike 3: the Treasurer says: … there was no justification forbanksto move their rates above the official interest rate rise. Again, stern words from the Treasurer. He echoed them again in late January as a result of the banks' actions. Despite the Treasurer's rhetoric, since March 2009, the spread or difference between the cash rate and the banks' standard variable mortgage rate has widened by 30 basis points. I note the Treasurer's statement today: …there will be absolutely no justification … for any bank to raise interest rates beyond any Reserve Bank movements. I refer to his stern, decisive comments yesterday that the banks would ‘incur the wrath not just of the Australian people but'-oh, my God-‘of the Australian government', the same wrath that the banks had received over all those months. They completely defied the Treasurer and $135 billion later the banks are saying to this government, ‘Stick it the in your purse and run away.' And what effect is that having on the Australian people? The Reserve Bank stated in its last statement that one of the key reasons it was not moving on the cash rate was that the banks had already increased the flow-through to mortgage holders. In effect, the Reserve Bank was saying, ‘It doesn't matter what we do, the banks themselves are charging more for mortgages.' Somehow, in this place, the Treasurer came in and claimed that it was a great win for Australians with mortgages-such a great win for Australian mortgages that the Reserve Bank did not increase the cash rate. In fact, with $134 billion of taxpayer guaranteed money over the last few months, the banks themselves had increased interest rates by nearly one per cent when the Reserve Bank had only gone with 0.75 per cent. So it seems that the banks have thanked the Australian public for their support by lifting interest rates by more than the Reserve Bank and by tightening access to credit. That seems hardly a fair deal. The Treasurer also announced that the guarantee of state and territory borrowings will be withdrawn on 31 December 2010. This guarantee was introduced on 24 July 2009 and provided the states with the right to use the federal government AAA rating to enhance the quality of their bond offerings and to facilitate their ability to raise funds the capital market. I note that there are some states already with a AAA rating. To be fair to the Treasurer, bond markets do price AAAs differently. Obviously some of the states were struggling to get their bond issuance away. But the coalition overall has supported the introduction of a guarantee of state debt, provided that an appropriate fee is charged. Also, significantly, given that a difference in credit ratings results in a different charge applied to each state, it is important to note that there should be no financial incentive for the states to use the AAA rating to engage in some form of arbitrage that will work to the disadvantage of taxpayers overall. I note there is a long lead time until the withdrawal of the government guarantee of state government debt until December this year. Again, I would ask the Treasurer to explain in detail why he gave an undertaking to the states to provide that guarantee until December whereas the banks themselves have until March. It might have something to do with election timing, but that would be a little cynical. Forgive me for being a little cynical about it. I want to touch on the issue of the register of government debt. Legislation was passed on 18 June 2009 for the creation of a register of holders of government debt. This was to include Commonwealth government debt and state government debt guaranteed by the Commonwealth. This was an amendment moved by the coalition. It is amazing how the government say we have no policy and yet they are actually taking our policy and accepting it as part of the legislation that goes through this place, if you can you believe that. This was an amendment moved by the coalition because we believe it is important for Australians to know the identity of our creditors. It is now eight months since it became law and the register has still not been put in place. The Australian public still do in not know from whom the government is borrowing money. They still do not know to which countries they are indebted. I call on the government to deliver this. We will be pursuing this in estimates and we want some answers. Why hasn't the register of government debt been delivered? Why aren't the agencies complying with the law as it stands to set up a register so that we the Australian people and the Australian taxpayers know exactly who we are borrowing money from every day and every week of the year? I just want to touch on the economy for a moment because it is all linked, as the Treasurer quite rightly says. With the winding back now of the government guarantee on wholesale funding, together with the Reserve Bank increasing interest rates and the banks themselves increasing interest rates, it is patently clear that Australia has come through what will be the worse impact of the global financial crisis. The Reserve Bank said that as well in its statements on monetary policy only last week. The fundamental point is that this government is continuing to spend money as if Australia has an unemployment rate of 8½ per cent. Yet Australia's unemployment rate seems to have stabilised well under six per cent. We welcome the fact that Australia has an unemployment rate of less than six per cent. I was the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations who saw it at 4.1 per cent, but do not let that get in way of a good story. I want to point out that the government said that it needed to spend so much money in the budget to address Australia's problems, but that was all based on the fact that Australia was going to have an unemployment rate of 8½ per cent. Australia now clearly has an unemployment rate of less than six per cent, but the government is still spending the same amount of money. In fact, it is spending half a billion dollars on school halls in 2012 to address an economic downturn of 2008. The spending by this government is putting upward pressure on interest rates, it is putting ‘crowding out' pressure on financial institutions and others that need to borrow money, it is making credit harder to get and it is making it more expensive for small business. We support good initiatives that are based on good policy but we will not go down the path of not criticising bad policy and bad initiatives, which this government has a habit of foisting on the Australian people.

128,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I wish to update the House on developments in Burma. On 4 January, Burma's Independence Day, Burmese Senior General Than Shwe announced that plans were under way to conduct elections in Burma this year. Elections have long been foreshadowed under the Burmese military's so-called ‘Roadmap to Democracy'. If elections do take place, they will be the first in Burma in 20 years. This year will, therefore, be an important one for Burma and an important one for the international community's engagement with Burma. Australia has long been appalled both by the Burmese military's suppression of the democratic aspirations of the Burmese people and by its disrespect for their human rights. It is worthwhile recalling some important events in this long standing suppression. A military regime, in some form, has ruled Burma since 1962, nearly 50 years. We recall the bloody put down of the pro-democracy protests in 1988, just over 20 years ago. Since 1988 Australia has had in place visa restrictions against senior members of the Burmese regime and their associates and supporters. Following the failure to implement the outcome of the 1990 elections, in 1991 Australia introduced a ban on defence exports to Burma. This is a ban on the export to Burma of controlled goods as listed on the Defence and Strategic Goods List. In October 2007, financial sanctions were introduced in response to the violent crackdown on democracy protesters. These various sanctionstravel sanctions, defence sanctions and financial sanctions-have the common purpose of exerting pressure on Burma's military regime. At the same time, Australia has recognised that engaging the Burmese authorities serves important national, regional and international interests. We live in the same region. Through regional forums like the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference, the ASEAN Regional Forum and the Bali Process on people smuggling, human trafficking and transnational crime, Australia has had the opportunity to engage Burma on challenges like counternarcotics, trafficking in people, disaster relief and pandemic diseases. As well, Australia has for many years sought to help the Burmese people through a program of humanitarian assistance targeting the most vulnerable. This program, now worth nearly $30 million in 2009-10, assists with fighting infectious diseases such as avian influenza, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis; provides food aid and agricultural expertise to alleviate rural poverty; protects displaced people; and supports children to attend and remain in primary school. ASEAN, through its humanitarian work in Burma after Cyclone Nargis, has been vital in facilitating assistance from Australia and members of the international community to the Burmese people. Common membership of regional organisations also allows us at ministerial level to directly advocate democratic reform and national reconciliation-as I did, for example, when I met my counterpart Burmese Foreign Minister Win during the ASEAN-related meetings in Thailand last year. On 12 August last year I addressed the House on Burma after Aung San Suu Kyi's conviction on spurious charges, leading to her ongoing house arrest. I set out then that Aung San Suu Kyi's sentence effectively removed the prospect of her participation in any proposed 2010 elections and would detract from the credibility of those elections. Since that time, there have been a number of important developments both within Burma and in the international community's approach to Burma. On 17 September last year the Burmese authorities released 128 political prisoners in an amnesty. This was a welcome, tentative step in the right direction. Repression, however, continues. On 31 December, 15 activists were sentenced to up to 71 years imprisonment each. There regrettably remain close to 2,000 political prisoners in Burma, including Aung San Suu Kyi herself. Australia again calls on Burma's authorities to release them and allow them to participate fully and freely in the upcoming elections. In September 2009, in the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, I joined 10 other foreign ministers and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a ministerial level meeting of the Secretary General's Group of Friends on Myanmar. The participation in this meeting was evidence both of the international community's desire to see progress in Burma and of its willingness to both work together and with the Secretary-General towards this end. At the meeting, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon identified three areas for future unity of purpose and action: first, to urge Burma to work with the United Nations to ensure an inclusive process of dialogue and create the conditions for credible elections; second, to hold the role of the United Nations in Burma; and, third, to signal the international community's willingness to help the people of Burma, but noting that Burma's military regime needed to respond to international concerns in order for this to occur. My visit to New York for the General Assembly coincided with the announcement of the United States policy review on Burma. The United States administration concluded that a sanctions only policy to isolate Burma's military has not worked and that future US policy would combine engagement, appropriate sanctions and humanitarian assistance. US Secretary of State Clinton said that any debate that pits sanctions against engagement created a false choice, and that the international community would need to employ both of these tools. Australia has welcomed this approach, as has the international community generally. As to developments within Burma, on 25 September last year Aung San Suu Kyi wrote to Senior General Than Shwe offering to work with the Burmese authorities on the withdrawal of international sanctions, and asking to meet representatives of the European Union, the United States and Australia. The fact that Australia was one of these three is of course significant and reflects Austra- dialogue. lia's long standing interest and friendship of the Burmese people. The Burmese authorities agreed to this request. On 9 October 2009 Australia's charge d'affaires, together with the UK ambassador and the US charge d'affaires, met Aung San Suu Kyi in Rangoon. The meeting was the first opportunity for a substantive discussion between an Australian representative and Aung San Suu Kyi since February 2003. Australia's charge d'affaires conveyed a message from the Prime Minister which expressed the support of the Australian govupernment and the people of Australia for Aung San Suu Kyi and her struggle for democracy in Burma. This was warmly welcomed by Aung San Suu Kyi. Australia welcomed the subsequent visit to Burma in early November last year by United States Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and the meetings he held with the Burmese authorities, with Aung San Suu Kyi and with representatives of a number of ethnic minorities. Aung San Suu Kyi wrote further to Senior General Than Shwe on 11 November 2009 requesting contact with her party's central executive committee. In response to her request, she was permitted to meet three of the central executive committee's elders, including Chairman U Aung Shwe, on 16 December 2009. Australia hopes that a meeting with the full executive will take place soon. This is the first substantial contact which Aung San Suu Kyi has had with the leadership of the National League for Democracy since 2007, and is warmly welcomed by the Australian government as essential to democratic and political progress in Burma. Australia hopes these initial engagements between Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese authorities and the international community are the beginning of a process of genuine Elections The Burmese authorities have embarked on the so-called ‘roadmap to democracy', a strictly controlled process of potential political change. It was a matter of great regret that they pushed ahead with a constitutional referendum, the fourth step in their road map, in the midst of the disaster of Cyclone Nargis in May 2008. That referendum was a regrettable sham. Not surprisingly, political parties in Burma, including the National League for Democracy, and parties representing ethnic groups, are carefully considering whether to participate in the 2010 elections. Burma's authorities have an opportunity to engage the people, to ensure the full and free participation in the elections of the Burmese opposition, nascent political parties, and ethnic groups. For Burma's longer term stability and security, the coming political process needs to address the concerns of the country's diverse ethnic minority groups. While, of course, given the history of these matters, there are long standing reservations, Australia will not prejudge the process and the outcome of these elections. Australia urges Burma's authorities to seize this opportunity to genuinely move their country forward. Development Assistance Australia has long provided humanitarian assistance to Burma. In the 2009-10 budget, the government allocated nearly $30 million in humanitarian assistance, a significant increase in base funding over the previous year. This will help address the pressing needs of the Burmese people. Half of Burma's almost 50 million people live in extreme poverty. Child mortality rates are among the highest in the world. Decades of military rule have eroded civil society and civilian institutions. Skills have been lost infrastructure has deteriorated. At some stage into the future, Burma will have a civilian government, which will face great challenges. At some stage into the future, the regional and international community will be asked to help in the rebuilding of Burma's economic and social structures. Australia's view therefore is that the international community help prepare Burma for the future. Burma's capacity cannot be allowed to completely atrophy to the ultimate disadvantage and cost of its people. The international community needs to start the rebuilding now. This is not a reward for Burma's military, but a recognition of the immense task faced by current and future generations of Burmese. At around $4 per head per annum, international aid to Burma is less than a 10th of that received by Cambodia and a 16th of that received by Laos. Australia will accordingly increase its assistance to Burma over the next three years to around $50 million annually, a 40 per cent increase. Alleviating humanitarian needs will remain an important goal and focus of this expenditure. But the government has decided that Australia's program will also include capacity-building elements, addressing the long-term challenges facing the Burmese people. This will involve carefully targeted interaction in areas of great need like health, education and agriculture. Our assistance will continue to be delivered in partnership with international organisations, such as United Nations agencies, ASEAN, other donor nations and nongovernment organisations. We will expand existing initiatives in basic health care, including child and maternal health. We will work to improve the delivery of basic health services by equipping health clinics, training nurses, healthcare staff and administrators and providing better community health eduand cation and information. At the village level, we will assist primary healthcare workers, including midwives, with critical training and medical supplies to help arrest the decline in health outcomes for vulnerable and isolated people. We will continue to support the delivery of vital treatment, prevention and screening services for HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, including through the Three Diseases Fund supported by Australia, the European Commission, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The fund aims to reduce these three diseases in Burma. We will also address critical water, sanitation and hygiene needs through: - the construction and rehabilitation of ponds and wells; - building latrines for community schools and rural health centres; and - working to provide equitable access to clean water. In 2008-09 Australia's assistance contributed to the basic education of over 400,000 children in Burma. We will increase our support to enable more poor and disadvantaged children to go to primary school. Australian assistance will improve teaching and mentoring skills, both in the classroom and at home. Working closely with United Nations agencies, non-government organisations and other donors, we will support training programs for early childhood development workers, primary teachers and township education officials. We will also continue to support vulnerable communities in the Irrawaddy Delta to restore their crop and fishing businesses, and in other areas of protracted need such as northern Rakhine State where the situation of the Rohingyas is very dire. Australia will provide $20 million over the next four years to assist poor communities in Burma to: - improve access to credit, seeds, and tools; - provide training in small enterprise; - help farmers diversify their production and gain access to markets. I have also asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and AusAID to explore a scholarship scheme for Burma. Australia will liaise with partners such as the European Union, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States, all of whom have scholarship schemes for Burma, to learn from their experience. It is proposed that a new scholarship scheme will target Burmese with the potential to build civil society and improve service delivery, including in health, education and agriculture. As a start, 10 postgraduate scholarships and shortterm professional development placements will be made available, beginning in 201011. We will work with the UN to carefully identify suitable candidates. This assistance will be in addition to Australia's significant contribution for relief and recovery efforts following Cyclone Nargis in May 2008. Australia's post-Nargis assistance continues to be delivered through effective and trusted aid partners such as the United Nations and Australian NGOs and includes: - agricultural inputs to help farmers restore their crops and livestock; - helping fishermen by providing nets and repairing boats; - repairing over 1,200 damaged schools and providing books and materials for over 350,000 children; - reducing disease risk by constructing 50,000 latrines and providing a million mosquito nets; and - supplies and shelter for vulnerable communities. Burma is a difficult operating environment, but the collective experience in Burma over many years shows we can deliver assistance effectively to improve the lives of ordinary Burmese citizens without benefiting the military authorities. Until we see significant change from Burma's authorities, the Australian government will maintain a policy of targeted financial sanctions. We agree with US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton's, observation that to lift sanctions now would send the wrong signal. However, an expansion of sanctions at this time would send a confusing signal. In view of the nascent discussions between the authorities and Aung San Suu Kyi, I have decided that sanctions should not be expanded at this time. As a result, the sanctions list I announced in October 2008 will remain in operation for the present. Diplomacy I earlier referred to my discussions on Burma in New York in September 2009. These discussions again revealed the region's and the international community's great frustration with the Burmese authorities' treatment of the political opposition, their selfimposed isolation, and the circumstances of the Burmese people. My discussions also revealed that the international community is increasingly prepared to draw on a wide range of diplomatic tools, including both sanctions and engagement, to press for change in Burma. Neither Australia nor the international community however should have any illusions that progress in Burma will be quick or easy. Australia will continue to work closely with ASEAN and its member countries, including by continuing to support ASEAN's much-needed humanitarian efforts in Burma. We will cooperate closely with the United States as it pursues greater engagement with Burma, and with other major donors like the United Kingdom to ensure our combined assistance does the greatest amount of good for the Burmese people. We will also continue to support the work of the United Nations and the Secretary-General. We endorse UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon's, call for the international community to support UN efforts to promote respect for human rights, inclusive political dialogue and development in Burma. Australia strongly supported the role of Ibrahim Gambari as the UN Secretary-General's special representative on Burma. His term concluded at the beginning of this year, and we look forward to working closely with his successor. Conclusion Australia and the international community stand ready to assist Burma. But it is not a one-way street. Australia urges the Burmese authorities to respond in good faith both to international engagement and to Aung San Suu Kyi's recent approach to it on sanctions and on dialogue. In moving towards dialogue and genuine national reconciliation, Burma's authorities can end their isolation. Australia has always considered the Burmese people our friends. When Cyclone Nargis struck, Australia and Australians responded generously, despite our political differences with the Burmese authorities. That was the right decision then, and it is the right decision now, together with the international community, to do more for the long term future of Burma's people. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Curtin and Deputy Leader of the Opposition to speak for 19 minutes. Leave granted.",81
129,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Ms J. Bishop (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 19 minutes. Question agreed to.,86
130,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," Mr Speaker, recent developments in Burma are following a familiar pattern. Many around the world have watched Burma closely for decades, and have waited forlornly for signs that the brutal military regime would make moves towards democracy. We have waited for a time when the gentle and beautiful Burmese people are able to live their lives in peace and freedom without the threat of violence, arbitrary imprisonment and slavery by their own government. There are current concerns and worrying signs that the Burmese regime is pursuing a nuclear weapons strategy. However, the good news is that Burma's military dictator, Than Shwe, has announced that elections will be held this year. If held, these will be the elections in 20 years and the first held under Burma's new constitution adopted in 2008and this is the bad news. I remind the House that in 2008, when Cyclone Nargis hit Burma, the military rulers' priority was to round people up to vote in a sham referendum to ratify the new constitution rather than focus on assisting those devastated by the cyclone. The referendum result was predictable for it was illegal to vote no. Given the changes to the constitution and the military reaction to the last election in 1990, no-one should take any comfort from the charade that Burma is moving towards genuine democracy. An international law centre focusing on human rights has raised serious questions about Burma's new constitution, which the centre believes has been designed to permanently entrench military rule. It is deeply disturbing to learn that the new constitution includes specific provisions that make the freedom and democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, ineligible to be elected as president or vice president, or to hold many key ministerial posts. The new constitution also ensures the head of the military will remain as the most powerful position in the nation, despite it being an unelected position. One-third of the members of parliament will be serving military officers who are under the direct command of the head of the military. And, in what appears to be a blatant breach of the Geneva conventions, the new constitution also removes all military matters from any civilian court or parliament, thus ensuring the military remains a law unto itself. Further, it appears that general amnesties are enshrined in the new Burmese constitution for all crimes by the junta and the military, including the use of rape as a weapon against ethnic minorities. I remain deeply pessimistic about Burma while ever the brutal military regime remains in place, a pessimism shared by many around first the world. However, against that background, I note that the United States has recently modified its policy toward Burma. The Obama administration has indicated a greater willingness for direct engagement with the military rulers in a move that has the potential to lessen Burma's international isolation. In a statement on 23 September 2009 to the United Nations Group of Friends on Myanmar, the United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, said that whilst United States policy objectives towards Burma remain the same, the United States will move towards a strategy of ‘concurrent engagement' and sanctions. The coalition in Australia will watch developments in United States policy towards Burma closely. We note that Assistant Secretary of State, Kurt Campbell, warned on 20 January this year that the United States will not be ‘unendingly patient' as it engages in direct talks with Burma and that the United States would expect to see ‘clear steps' towards democracy. I have called on the Rudd government repeatedly to work with the international community to condemn the Burmese military junta and especially its treatment of Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest for a significant part of the past 20 years. It has been reported that Aung San Suu Kyi has tentatively backed the United States policy change, although she has called for engagement with both the military regime in power and the opposition, particularly the National League for Democracy. The coalition continues to extend its strong support for Aung San Suu Kyi in her efforts at leading her people to freedom and democracy. While the United States has indicated a degree of re-engagement with Burma, it has retained sanctions and continues to pressure the regime for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and free elections this year, and that is a sition that the coalition supports. Since 24 October 2007, Australia has implemented targeted autonomous sanctions against the Burmese regime and associates. The Australian government must continue to take all reasonable steps to ensure that pressure remains on the regime, and this will be even more essential as the election in Burma approaches. Our aid program in Burma must remain targeted at the most vulnerable people and respond to their humanitarian needs. It must not be allowed to enrich the elite, bolster the regime or undermine the ability of ordinary Burmese people to sell their produce by flooding the market with food aid. One issue of concern that I must raise today is the government's silence since the 2007 election in Australia on Labor's commitment that it would take the leaders of the Burmese military junta to the International Criminal Court. The Burma Campaign Australia has detailed in its submission to the inquiry into human rights mechanisms in the Asia-Pacific that Labor in opposition made this commitment, including in emails to the campaign by the now Prime Minister. The then shadow minister for foreign affairs, Robert MCClelland, issued a media release on 28 May 2007 which said: Australia should request the UN Security Council to authorise the ICCthe International Criminal Courtto commence investigations into Burma's leaders for crimes against humanity. We are told that this promise to take the Burmese leaders to the International Criminal Court was repeated by the then Leader of the Opposition, now the Prime Minister, in October 2007. But I must point out that Labor has now attempted to walk away from this position. During a press conference on 5 May 2008, the following exchange took place between a po- journalist and the Minister for Foreign Affairs: QUESTION: It's also the Burmese election next weekend. During the election campaign, the Labor Party promised to take their junta leaders to the International Criminal Court. Has there been any progress on that? STEPHEN SMITH: Well, I'm not sure that's right, I'm not sure that's right. QUESTION: Well, it's something that MCClelland said during the campaign and… STEPHEN SMITH: I don't think Robert Mc… QUESTION: …Rudd's also put it in writing. STEPHEN SMITH: I don't think Robert MCClelland said that in respect of Burma. We've made it absolutely crystal clear that we believe Burma should move to a democratic state where human rights are respected. It's quite clear that the current referendum process, which the Burmese have in train, is nothing more, nothing less than a complete sham. I've made that point before and I'm … happy to make it again. … … … QUESTION: So you won't be taking them to the International Court then? STEPHEN SMITH: Well, I think if you check the record you'll find that you're mistaken in your assumption there. There is no mistake in the assumption. The MCClelland press release of 28 May 2007 is clear. The Prime Minister repeated that promise in writing to the Burma Campaign Australia in October 2007. The Rudd Labor opposition promised that, if they got into government, they would ask the United Nations Security Council to take the Burmese military leaders to the International Criminal Court. Now there is increasing concern among the freedom and democracy and human rights activists for Burma that the Prime Minister is walking away from his promise as he is seeking to appease countries in the region as part of his drive for votes to support Australia's bid for a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council in 201314. If that is not the case, and in order pel these concerns, the Prime Minister should spell out how and when he intends to have the Burmese military leaders referred to the International Criminal Court as he promised in October 2007 and as his now Attorney-General promised in May 2007. Or, yet again, is this another example where Labor is all talk and no action? In responding to this ministerial statement on Burma, it is important to highlight the plight of freedom and democracy campaigner and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, whose ongoing treatment by the regime continues to provoke outrage around the world. As I said, Aung San Suu Kyi has been under house arrest in Burma for about 14 of the past 20 years. The junta is well aware of Suu Kyi's popularity among the long-suffering Burmese people. In the last election held in Burma, in 1990, Aung San Suu Kyi led a political party that won 82 per cent of the parliamentary seats in the national elections. The result was overturned by the military junta in a national crackdown that included the imprisonment of elected members of parliament. Aung San Suu Kyi is a powerful symbol, not only as the daughter of the assassinated national independence hero General Aung San but also in her own right. Her sense of duty and justice and her commitment to a non-violent struggle for the cause of freedom for the people of Burma has proven to be unshakable. As I have said before in this parliament, I travelled to Burma in October 1995 and met with Aung San Suu Kyi at her home in Rangoon on the banks of Lake Inya. Hundreds of supporters were waiting outside hoping to catch a glimpse of their leader. I was met at the front gate and taken to a military checkpoint located in the garden, where my passport was checked, my details taken down and my photograph taken. I spent to disabout an hour with Aung San Suu Kyi and observed to her that she was a prisoner in her own country and indeed in her own home, and she remains so. The military junta in Burma stands accused of some of the most serious human rights abuses of any regime in the world. The 1988 uprising, when thousands of students and Buddhist monks were killed, with thousands of political prisoners held without trial, has been well documented. It is estimated that more than 2,000 people are held as political prisoners in Burma's horrendous jails, and the junta is regularly accused of using forced labour, land and food confiscation, arbitrary beatings, recruitment of child soldiers and torture. The International Labour Organisation considered taking the junta leaders to the International Court of Justice over accusations that it had forced up to 800,000 people into virtual slavery. Disturbingly, the junta has also been accused by international human rights organisations of using sexual abuse and rape as a means of terrorising the population-hence my concerns that the new constitution grants a general amnesty to the junta and the military. There have been regular protests against military rule since the 1962 coup, but all have been met with violent suppression involving significant loss of life, including the more recent protest in 2007 led by Buddhist monks, who were shot or jailed. So Burma stands as one of the most repressive regimes in the world, and the world is now concerned that it has a nuclear weapons strategy. Burma is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, which has set up a working group to establish a human rights framework in the region. Australia must urge the ASEAN working group to address the violations of human rights in Burma as one of its highest priorities. As the minister noted, the Rudd government has increased aid to Burma. In 2008-09 there was an increase by $5 million to $16 million, and the government has more recently allocated nearly $30 million in humanitarian assistance in the 2009-10 budget. It is vital for Aung San Suu Kyi and the people of Burma, as well as the international community, that any increase in aid not be seen in any way as a tacit acknowledgement by the Rudd government of the legitimacy of the Burma regime.

131,Mr HAYES,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"Prior to question time, I was commenting that the government has put forward an economically credible and prudent proposal that ensures it is supporting the jobs of today while substantively putting forward a scheme that will create the low-pollution jobs of tomorrow. I spoke about my involvement with renewable energy technology businesses and also their frustration at presently trying to commercialise their technologies without a price of carbon being established on a market base and without having their technologies taken to the share market with a view to raising capital to commercialise those technologies. Mr Deputy Speaker Kelvin Thomson, I know you are fully across this; I heard your speech earlier today. You understand what these commercial and environmental innovators, renewable energy technology developers, are going through. Each and every member of this parliament would have had either a coffee or a tea with people from these renewable energy technologies who have gone to great pains to explain their frustration in developing low-emission technologies in this country at the moment, and that frustration has been at not having a market mechanism in place. I think that is something crucial that comes through this suite of bills before us on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and cognate bills. As I say, the scheme is vital for commercialising these technologies, and these technologies are vital in our ability to combat climate change. It is all very well for the Leader of the Opposition to come out and say, ‘We're going to mandate this and mandate that; we're going to encourage people to do these various things,' but the fact of life is that government itselfthe bureaucrats-will not be out there determining what technologies go forward. What we need to do is make sure the commercial realities are that people can actually take these low-emission technologies forward to the marketplace to be able to back projects over the next 20 years. That is critical for having investment in the renewable energy sector, the sustainable energy sector and the whole gamut of low-emissions technologies that are currently subject to research and development. Importantly, our actions on climate change will help protect and secure the economy and industries like agriculture and tourism, which account for thousands of people employed in this country. I say to the members opposite from Queensland that they will be only too well aware of the numbers involved in terms of the Barrier Reef, but agriculture accounts for a lot of people in this country. That is why our CPRS, our energy-trading mechanism, is supported by business groups like the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and also the National Farmers Federation. They see why we are going down this path and they encourage certainty being developed in the marketplace. I would also like to congratulate the member for Wentworth for the forthright and considered views that he put earlier today. I know that as a former Howard government environment minister he commissioned the Shergold report. I understand that through the development of policies leading to the 2007 election, when the establishment of an ETS was the current opposition's policy, Mr Turnbull, the member for Wentworth, had a central view. I have to say that, unlike other people opposite, this fellow has stayed pretty consistent with the views that he expressed in this parliament from 2005 through to 2007. He has seen that there is a need for developing technologies and for having certainty in the business place. His considered view is similar to that of the Shergold report, which recommended the development of an ETS mechanism. Mr Turnbull, in his contribution earlier today, said: This legislationreferring to the CPRSis the only policy on offer which can credibly enable us to meet our commitment to a five per cent cut to emissions by 2020 and also has the flexibility to enable us to move to higher cuts when they are warranted. So for those reasons I support this bill. The arguments I have made for it are no different to those I have made, and stood for, for the last three years. It probably takes a lot of guts to get up and view the circumstances and do that. But it is plain that these are the views that he has held, the views that were mutually developed in a bipartisan way in the last election and the views that led to bipartisan support of an ETS. I recall only too well when the Shergold report came down that these were the considered views of all sides of politics, before the issue of party politics got involved. What a great thing leadership politics is. We are now prepared to put the viability of environmental controls, to put the threshold issues associated with climate change, on hold to support leadership. I guess that was not quite what the member for Higgins had in mind when she gave her first speech earlier today on wanting to make a difference. The only difference that is doing is highlightthere ing to the Australian public that some people in this place are prepared to put into jeopardy future generations of this country to maintain a position of leadership today. That is not leadership and you would not even call it head-in-the-sand politics. This was not just something that occurred; this was something that was very decisive. This came from a man who after the last 2007 election urged people to vote for the CPRS-just support it and get it off the table. This also comes from the fellow who is now the Leader of the Opposition and has had seven different and inconsistent positions when dealing with one of the most serious matters faced by our generation, that being climate change. He is not alone. With fairness to Mr Abbott, he is not alone in Bear in mind the position of Senator Nick Minchin, who obviously challenges the climate change science. Moreover, he actually summarises the view that underpins all those scientists out there and the world's concern about climate change. He reckons it is a communist conspiracy designed to deindustrialise the Western world. They are not my words; they are his words or words pretty close to that effect. He may not have said ‘communist', he may have said ‘leftist', but this is the leader of the government in the Senate, that place over there, who summarised the position as being some form of communist conspiracy when we talk about climate change. Certainly it is no surprise when the Leader of the Opposition refers to climate change as being, to use his words, ‘absolute crap'. You would wonder why you would take on a position of leadership addressing an issue as important as climate change-and there is no question that this is regarded as important to the voters out there-and yet treat with it such disdain. I suppose to some extent we have also seen those sorts of general outviews now being supported by the chief opposition finance spokesman, Senator Barnaby Joyce. I have to say that, when he refers to things such as ceiling insulation as being that fluffy stuff in the ceiling that rats and mice urinate on, it shows how little they are concerned about taking steps to ameliorate the effects of climate change and to protect our environment. I do not know whether Barnaby Joyce had a slip of honesty in the process, but it was very interesting when he came out and told us why the opposition would have a climate change policy if his leader thought it was absolute crap and if the leader in the Senate, Senator Minchin, thought it was a communist plot and he was clearly on the record as not having any regard for the science of clithis. mate change. He explains it with words to the effect that, to have a policy on climate change, you need to have something to pander to the views of the community. ‘Pander' makes that sound pretty cheap, but pandering to the community is essentially what Senator Joyce rationalised as to why the opposition would not under any circumstance have a policy on climate change. When he was pressed about how he was going to pay for the opposition's position on it, it rolled off his tongue just like that: ‘Cut the Commonwealth Public Service and look at our aid placed overseas. We had better fix our own place up first so we can cut overseas aid projects.' Clearly, that is an embarrassment to the opposition. He was obviously jumped on from a great height; but, as I say, he probably had a rare moment of honesty at the Press Club and decided to be open and honest with everybody and tell us his genuine views. We have the impression of Senator Minchin's communist plot, the Leader of the Opposition's view of it being absolute crap and Senator Joyce now having the view that you just have to have a policy if you want to pander to the electorate. The choice is pretty clear on this. islation is a development of a policy which was supported by the opposition. We have embraced each and every one of their amendments. We have reduced that into the current CPRS bills. The population at large now has a very, very clear choice. It is a choice between the Rudd government's position on climate change-one that caps emission levels through the CPRS, makes the big polluters pay, provides a mechanism to commercialise renewable technologies and provides financial compensation for families-and the opposition's position of really wanting no change in support of their con job and in support of their leadership. This is what it is about-the protection of the Liberal leadership and nothing more and nothing less.",90
132,Dr SOUTHCOTT,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"This is now the third time that the House has considered legislation for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and on each of the previous two occasions the opposition voted against the government's CPRS, or emissions trading scheme. I would like to say at the outset that it is important that we take strong action on climate change, and an emissions trading scheme is but one possible response to taking action on climate change. So this is not a debate about whether we should take action on climate change or whether we should, as the Prime Minister often says, do nothing; it is about the best approach for the Australian economy-the most balanced approach which will enable us to achieve our environmental goals while at the same time reducing the dislocating impact on small businesses, on families and on households. Given that there is an enormous volume of science in this area-as we all know, there is currently a debate going on in the community-the prudent thing for any government is to take the scientific concerns seriously and, adopting the principles of risk This legmanagement seriously, respond. In fact, the Howard government took this approach in government. We set up in 1998 the Australian Greenhouse Office-the first country in the world to have an agency dedicated to raising awareness and coordinating practical responses to climate change. We had a number of initiatives encouraging industry to develop technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We had the Global Initiative on Forests and Climate, a very important way of getting carbon out of the atmosphere by reducing deforestation and protecting forests. While Australia only contributes about 1.4 or 1.5 per cent of global greenhouse emissions, the initiatives that we took under the Howard government saw Australia save 87 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year over the period that we were in government and going right up to 2010. That is the equivalent of taking out the emissions of the entire transport sector-all cars, all trucks, all buses. They were very significant initiatives. There was also the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, which brought together the United States, Australia, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and India, who together make up 50 per cent of the world's population, world's energy use and world's greenhouse gas emissions. It got all of those countries working together to use technological solutions to dramatically cut greenhouse emissions. What was obvious last year was that we were all told that there was a rush to have this in place before Copenhagen. The problem is that it has become very obvious with the Prime Minister that the emperor has no clothes. There was no need to rush to deal with this before Copenhagen. Copenhagen was a disappointment; it underdelivered. In fact, it is almost like a metaphor for the Rudd government: overpromised and underdelivered. But what we have now is a very clear choice between the government's emissions trading scheme and the opposition's direct action plan on climate change. There is a choice between a $114 billion tax on electricity and groceries for mums and dads and pensioners and a $10 billion direct action plan-a choice between a great big new tax and incentives for businesses to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Both sides-the government and the opposition-are committed to a five per cent reduction in carbon emissions, but under the opposition's plan businesses will be given direct incentives to take direct action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions below baseline levels. The direct action plan includes incentives to clean up power stations, to have one million solar roofs over the next 10 years, to plant 20 lion trees and to have a once-in-a-century increase in the carbon levels of soils. One of the things that we have not heard anything about from the government-it has been very quiet, very secret about this-is what the impact of their Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will be on ordinary Australians, on working families, on mums and dads, on households. What we saw in question time today is that even the government's own ministers-the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, for example-did not have a clue about the impact of the government's own scheme on families. The Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy did not have a clue about the impact of this scheme on small businesses. There is a very interesting ment that has been produced by the government. It is called Cameo analysis of household assistance package, and what it shows when you drill down in these tables is the impact that this will have on families and individuals. Take, for example, a family with two incomes, each $70,000, and three children. This would incorporate teachers, nurses, midwives-many different occupations-and a family like this will be $620 worse off under the Rudd government's scheme. An individual on an income of $60,000-average weekly earnings, or thereabouts-will be $140 worse off under the government's scheme. A two-income family, one on $98,000 and one on $42,000, with three children will be $808 worse off. Consider the case of a single-income family where the principal breadwinner is a tradie, a steel fixer, a welder, a fitter, a plumber or a sparky and earns $120,000, with one child at primary school and one child at high school. This family will be $950 worse off under the government's scheme. It is very obvious that the government has not been milupfront about the impact of the emissions trading scheme and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Look at the situation for individuals. For a single person, once you are earning more than $40,000 a year you are worse off under the Labor Party's scheme. Once a single-income family with no children earns an income over $60,000 they will be worse off under the government's scheme. A two-income family with no children, once the parents are on incomes of $42,500 each-below average weekly earnings-will be worse off under the government's scheme. That is why the opposition will be voting against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It is now incumbent on the Labor Party to explain the impact that this scheme will have on working families and the impact that it will have on salary earners who are on docu- very low incomes, well below average weekly earnings. That is why the opposition will be opposing these bills.",93
133,Ms RISHWORTH,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I am very pleased to rise to support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and the associated bills that are before the House today. This scheme is a comprehensive and effective response to climate change. It has been developed against a backdrop of overwhelming scientific evidence, international political consensus and, until a few weeks ago, with national political consensus and, importantly, in negotiation with the previous leadership of the coalition. It is a balanced, costed and market based response to one of the greatest challenges of our times. Put simply, the CPRS caps and reduces Australia's carbon pollution for the first time ever. It makes polluters pay for their carbon pollution and takes the money raised from the polluters and provides cash assistance to working families. The government's approach is measured and presents a wide-ranging scheme which is designed to redirect the Australian economy towards a low-carbon future. In the last few weeks we have seen the Leader of the Opposition bring out his alternative policy. Really, when we drill down and look at this policy I think the Australian people will see that he is more interested in cheap political gain than in any real action on climate change. The Leader of the Opposition's so-called direct action climate change proposal is nothing more than a climate change con job which will impose a tax on the Australian people and, in his own words, allow big polluters to continue with ‘business as usual'. Last week we saw the Leader of the Opposition describe the coalition's newest policy as a carefully costed capped policy, when in actual fact it is uncosted, uncapped and unfair on the Australian people. In the words of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, the coalition's latest response to climate change is an attempt to ‘concoct a window display without putting a price on carbon pollution'. In the same article, he appropriately described it as the ‘policy equivalent of dessert without a main course'. What we have seen with the coalition's policy is an absolute smokescreen when it comes to any real action on climate change. Instead of putting a cap on carbon, the Leader of the Opposition's plan is actually designed around big polluters being encouraged to continue to emit carbon, whereas the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme makes polluters pay for their emissions. The Leader of the Opposition's policy is based on the idea that the government and the Australian people, not the big polluters, should foot the bill in abating emissions. We have just heard the member for Boothby talk about being upfront. One thing we can say about the opposition's policy is that they have not been upfront with the Australian people about where the money for their $10 billion scheme is going to come from. All we know is that the burden will fall on taxpayers. Will the money be cut from the budget, perhaps from services, as we heard in question time? The Leader of the Opposition is well renowned for the cuts he made to public hospitals. He cut close to $1 billion out of the public hospital budget. Or will the money come from new taxes? We are not sure, because the opposition have not been upfront with the Australian people about where their cost is going to come. When we talk about being upfront and clear about what our policy is-the government's policy compared with the opposition's-we know that and whereas we have been very clear about the compensation scheme and where the money is going to come from the opposition have not. The Leader of the Opposition's policy was clearly developed in a cocoon, in which he is in denial about the reality of climate change. Outside this cocoon, the real world is literally heating up. The world has just come out of the hottest decade in history. While last week the government reintroduced the CPRS into the House, the Leader of the Opposition was busy holding a private audience with Lord Monckton, a person whom even conservative journalists and the likes of Senator Barnaby Joyce have publicly been trying to distance themselves from. To put him in perspective, Lord Monckton is a person who believes that climate change is the trojan horse for a centralisation of communist power after the fall of the Berlin Wall. That sounds quite extreme, but if we turn our thoughts back to late last year, the shadow Treasurer was accusing the G20 of being part of a socialist conspiracy. So I guess Lord Monckton's views do sit quite comfortably with the Liberal Party. While the government has based its response to climate change on the global scientific consensus, including the work done by Australian scientists from the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, the Leader of the Opposition seems to be taking his scientific advice from an eccentric English mathematician who finds himself clearly on the fringe. Mr Champion-He is not even a mathematician.",94
134,Ms RISHWORTH,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I know that the member for Wakefield will provide more information about Lord Monckton and his expertise. We have seen that Lord Monckton is on the fringe. It seems that the Leader of the Opposition is taking advice from this person and not the scientific consensus. It unsurprising that someone who takes advice from the likes of Lord Monckton asserted some months ago that the world has actually been cooling. If he had bothered to look at the hard facts, the Leader of the Opposition would realise that 14 out of the 15 warmest years on record occurred between 1995 and 2009. With scientists telling us to expect erage surface temperatures to rise between 1.1 and 6.4 degrees Celsius, it appears that the Leader of the Opposition is completely out of touch with reality. That is why he is advocating a business-as-usual approach as an answer to climate change. It is understandable that people might be finding it difficult to keep pace with the Leader of the Opposition's position on climate change. In fact, I have not been able to keep up with all six publicly recommended positions. First was blocking the CPRS, then passing the CPRS, then amending the CPRS and now proposing his own new taxpayer funded slush fund so that the big polluters can keep on going with business as usual. If people are feeling a little confused about where he or the coalition stands on the issue of climate change, I am certainly not surprised. In my opinion, his real views on the issue are those expressed to the group of supporters at the function centre at the Beaufort football ground in Victoria on 30 September 2009 when he quite clearly stated that he felt that the argument for climate change was ‘absolute crap'. However, he did acknowledge that the politics of this are tough ‘for us', as he put it, and that 80 per cent of people believe that climate change is a real and present danger. Earlier, we heard comments about being tricky and about doing what is important for short-term political gain. I would assert that the Leader of the Opposition is being paris ticularly tricky when it comes to the politics of climate change, looking for short-term solutions and smokescreens to try and trick the Australian people. But I believe that the Australian people will see through this. These comments really give us insight into the opposition leader's policy response. He clearly sits in the camp of climate change avfringe dwellers and sceptics, led by his mentors Senator Nick Minchin and Lord Monckton, who do not believe that the world is warming and who in fact believe it is one great big left-wing conspiracy to try and deindustrialise the world. But, instead of standing up for what he really believes, the Leader of the Opposition has sought to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian people, announcing his deceptive and simple direct action policy. It is ceptive because it is designed for political purposes and not for addressing the real issue of dangerous climate change. It is simple, because he knows that it will not work and he does not care. This was clearly indicated by his comment that he thinks climate change is ‘absolute crap'. In contrast to this real con job-the direct action policy presented by the oppositionthe Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme advocated by this government is not designed for political purposes. It is designed for the national interest. It is premised on the reality that there will be a price imposed on carbon emissions and that there will be a price imposed on polluters. Because the government recognises that there will be a modest increase in the cost of living of around 1.1 per cent, this government has provided direct compensation to householders. In fact, 90 per cent of all households will receive direct cash assistance under this scheme. To put these things in perspective, 90 per cent of low-income households will receive assistance equal to around 120 per cent of the overall increase in costs that they face under the CPRS. The coalition will impose penalties on businesses which pollute above business-asusual levels and nobody in the opposition has been able to explain what these penalties will be and how these penalties will impact consumers. One thing that we do know is that the opposition's plan has no option to compensate consumers for these. This highlights the great irony in the Leader of the Opposition's proposal. The coalition direct action policy, which is designed only for political purposes, with no intention to seriously address climate change, will actually be more harmful to Australian consumers and taxpayers. To spell this out, experts in the Departde- ment of Climate Change estimate that, rather than reducing emissions by five per cent, the policy of the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition will actually increase Australia's emissions by 13 per cent from 2000 levels. This 13 per cent increase in our emissions will come at a cost of a $10 billion tax bill for the Australian people in a four-year period. This figure does not include the price rises that penalised businesses will be forced to pass on to their consumers. The money for the Leader of the Opposition's slush fund has to come from somewhere, and he has refused to rule out cutting funds to schools and defence. His shadow minister for finance has also failed to rule out increased taxes. It is ironic that the Liberal Party is running away from the market. Considering that they are accusing us of creating a stateinterventionist and communist system, it is ironic that they are running for the hills to get away from a market based system such as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. But what it does is create a level playing field that encourages businesses to do what they can and to look at their options about how they might reduce carbon emissions. This is in quite stark quite contrast to the Leader of the Opposition, who has decided that if his scheme gets up then he will pick the winners-who will get the investment and who will not. Companies that will thrive under this system will not necessarily be the ones that are capable of producing lowcarbon-intensive goods and services, because it will not be a market based system and it will not create incentives for companies to do their best to reduce their carbon emissions. This is a real flaw in the system. You do not need to go back very far when thinking about governments picking winners and losers. Your mind goes back to our minister for infrastructure who regularly raised the issue of the cloud-seeding technology against departmental advice. Not only was $2 million suggested but $10 million was also suggested. And I think we can see there some of the issues that come with governments picking winners and losers. All around the world, we see that governments are not in the best position to pick winners and are bad at the command and control of whole sections of the economy. We on this side of the House realise that it is inherently problematic and that Australia's response to climate change should not be designed around a massive slush fund which seeks to directly pay companies to run abatement schemes so that our big polluters can continue to emit carbon pollution as business as usual. In the medium term, the outcome of the Leader of the Opposition's scheme is that Australian goods and services will become undesirable and expensive in the global economy. We see that more and more countries, including all of Europe, Japan and New Zealand, have either introduced or are in the process of introducing an emissions trading scheme. Most governments in the developed world are in the process of realigning their economies in preparation for a low-carbon future. If we do not do that, if we do not preparing for our economy to be realigned for a low-carbon future, we will be left behind. If Australian industry is encouraged to conduct their businesses and pollute under the illusion that business as usual continues, there is the real danger that we will become economically disadvantaged and incapable of taking a leadership role in new technologies and businesses and, in fact, new clean, green technologies that have the opportunity to be developed and manufactured here in Australia will move offshore. The Australian economy will fail to keep pace with the rest of the world in terms of new technology. At its worse, we will face the prospect of becoming economically backwards. It is really critical for a restructure of our economy to ensure that we can take advantage of being part of the world's low-carbon future. The government has designed and is introducing into the House a carbon pollution reduction scheme which is capable of responding to one of the greatest challenges of our time. It will serve to both restructure the Australian economy and compensate for the effects that a low-carbon future will have on lowand middle-income households. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is a thorough, complex and wide-ranging scheme which will affect all facets of the Australian economy. It is designed around a market based and merit based system, where the government's role is reduced to setting emission reduction targets for the national economy in line with internationally agreed targets. The opposition leader's scheme might be simple to explain, but that is because it is designed for political purposes. It has very little to do with avoiding dangerous climate change. The shallowness of his policy is not surprising when you consider the sad truth start that it has been commissioned by a leader who is out of touch with reality and is of the opinion that climate change is ‘absolute crap'. The Australian people need to be aware that the coalition is currently being led by a person who is prepared to stake the future of the world on sceptical fringe theories and who takes advice from an eccentric English aristocrat. The whole world wishes that responding to climate change was as simple as Mr Abbott's ‘direct action' plan, but the reason that nothing even vaguely similar to Mr Abbott's plan has been taken up by the government of any advanced economy is because it will not work. It is not designed to reduce emissions and it will not allow the Australian economy to enter into a low-carbon future on the front foot. Mr Abbott's ‘direct action' policy, is a climate change con job which will impose a big slug on taxpayers instead of polluters. More than ever, Australia needs a responsible and truly national scheme to tackle climate change, and a scheme which is capable of addressing the environmental imperatives of reducing our carbon emissions. We need a scheme which can accurately forecast the modest increases in the cost of living and compensates those most affected. Fundamentally, we need a market based mechanism capable of guiding Australian industry into a low-carbon future. As a result of that, I commend the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation to the House.",96
135,Mr TUCKEY,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I have just listened to the member for Kingston and I could spend the next 20 minutes responding. I will give some time to addressing the comments she made. I happen to visit her electorate from time to time. I know it well-my wife was raised in Adelaide. I happen to know that the electorate of Kingston has a significant body of residents who gain their living in agricultural areas-wine and many other things. I thought she might be interested in an article published in the Perth Sunday Times on 27 December, in which the Australian Food and Grocery Council disputes her government's estimate that the cost of a shopping trolley would only increase $68 per annum. A noted economist from ABARE called that ‘rubbish'. The Food and Grocery Council suggested a figure of $520 a year. This is the point for the member for Kingston. I quote from the council: It seems the only way the government could have got this figure would be to base their modelling on significant reductions in Australian manufactured goods and a significant increase in supplies from cheaper priced countries such as China. The member for Kingston has a constituency based to a great extent in South Australia, a state heavily reliant on food production and food processing. There are 300,000 Australian workers in the food industry-and the Food and Grocery Council says, ‘If you want to do what they have claimed, you better get everything from China.' That is not a bad starting point. The member for Kingston lectures, as everybody does-including someone from my side-that this is a market response. How can it be a market response if the government has about 10 or 15 centimetres of legislation? A market is cold turkey. If you are going to compensate everybody who turns up with a case, where is the discipline upon those people to reduce their emissions? The member for Kingston put the argument for a ‘pay to pollute' response to the climate change legislation. She ran off all the repetition of her colleagues. Japan, she said, is going to have an ETS and then she said ‘or might do'. I think New Zealand has some form of legislation but it is not happening. The minister got up the other day and said that there are 32 countries with an ETS. Well, the next speaker after me might name those countries. But I can tell you that they do not include Japan, they do not include India, they do not include China, they do not include Brazil and they do not include South Africa. They were the group who showed the door to our Prime Minister-who was going over to Copenhagen to run the show. They showed him the door. They made their decisions in his absence and would not give him the time of day-he and his 114 public servants-and a group of Third World countries set the agenda at Copenhagen. And what was their message? It was: ‘We will advance our economies and, if that means more CO2 in the atmosphere, it is up to you, the so-called developed countries. I love the fact that even our Prime Minister thinks we are so rich that we can donate to China, India, Brazil and all these countries, but the reality is that they took no notice of him and would have taken no more notice if this parliament had passed this legislation prior to Copenhagen. It is said that the coalition is out of but it is offering incentives not penalties. As I have been saying for decades, there are great technological opportunities for Australia and most of them exist today and we may like to take the opportunity to be involved. The member for Kingston also accused us of picking winners. What is the compensation fund that is proposed by the Rudd government but picking winners? At one stage the electrical generators were going to get $3 billion. They asked for $10 billion and suddenly they are getting $7 billion. Is that picking winners? After the election, were the ACTU and associated unions winners? Were the employers winners? They are trying to keep this economy afloat with exports, and what is happening to them? There is a strike going on during the building of the biggest industrial program in Australia because the workers involved want to keep a motel-style room empty to store their toothbrushes in while they are away for their six days off. And do not tell me that they hang their clothes in there. I get on the same planes as they do-and they wear them up there and they wear them back. I sometimes wonder if they ever take them off. So do not give me that sort of stuff. Mr Champion interjecting",99
136,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"Order! I warn the member for Wakefield that, if he persists in interrupting, I will deal with him. You will have your chance to speak in the debate in a very short period of time.",100
137,Mr TUCKEY,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I am very grateful to you for reminding me that there is another South Australian MP in here, representing another district with a significant agricultural component, who is voting for a tax on farmers and voting, as the Food and Energy Council says, to replace production in his own electouch, torate with product from China-because they are not having an ETS and they will be the ones who can achieve these figures. Please remember that in Treasury modelling, they have gone as far as to say: ‘These certificates will not be that expensive. They might be expensive in Australia, but you can buy them from China.' That is in the white paper. That is in the modelling. So, anyhow, we know we have two South Australians in here who do not give a damn about the people, jobs and productivity in their own electorates. I will make sure my relatives, who live around that country, are well aware of those points. But let me just touch on a few of the generics associated with this legislation and the claims that it will work. Firstly, it is said that we have a situation where this legislation has been backed rock-solid by scientists. I have stayed out of that argument because I do not have the competence to say yes or no. I might add that I got very high marks in chemistry and physics when I was at school but I did not proceed to climate change technology. But what I can tell you is that, recently, the media has been full of examples of very dodgy science-like the 15,000 glaciers of the Himalayas that are all going to melt completely by 2035. Apparently that was taken out of some schoolkid's composition. So, if you are worried about the reality, the science is still in play. I have heard the Great Barrier Reef mentioned about a thousand times in this debate. The reality is that, if you evacuated Australia and there were no significant decisions or responses taken in other parts of the world, whatever is going to happen to the Barrier Reef will happen. It appears from some of the comments of scientists that it is doing pretty well-but we will disregard that! Then, of course, we are going to be confronted with these terrible cyclones-they are going to increase in intensity. I had the roof blown off my hotel in 1961 and nobody said that that was the result of climate change. But let me remind you what the last two highly intense ones have done. They have flooded western New South Wales and Queensland. They have broken the drought. There is a chance for the two members. I have so far mentioned that some of that water will get to Adelaide. If that is a problem, write me a letter about it. It is only the big cyclones that get into that hinterland-and that has been for as long as the history Australian climate. I have already mentioned the extent to which the developing countries dominated Copenhagen. There is the argument that an ETS can be a market based solution. The market is when government keeps out of it. This government is setting the pattern, selling the certificates and saying who can buy them-and that includes the hedge funds who could drive the price up as they did the price of petrol, then go broke and be bailed out by the government of the day when that goes sour on them. Again, it is distorted by selective compensation payments, which will clearly undermine any discipline to reduce emissions by parties in receipt of such payback. There is a great dispute in this place to whether or not the compensation proposed is sufficient, and the examples where it will not be are legion. But if you get fully compensated where is the market discipline? Do you consequently not buy an air conditioner? Do you consequently tell the kids to turn the lights off, and will they take any notice of you? That is it. When Treasury modelling was conducted there was a promise that there would be a global market in emissions trading. Where is that? Just about everybody of substance in the emissions business said no. Of course, President Obama, having lost a seat that the Democrats have only held for 40 years at about a 60 per cent margin, is saying: ‘Oops, maybe “yes we can” is “yes we can't”.' If America is not involved, where is the international marketplace where these things are supposed to work? The Rudd government is convinced by its own rhetoric in this third proposal to the parliament. The cost of the initial issue of certificates to consumers and exports is admitted by the government to reach $115 billion. That has got to come out. The cost to many of these so-called nasties-the thousand of the worse polluters-and the fact that they probably provide about 80 per cent of Australia's employment is not even considered. They are just the nasties for the purpose of politics. Exporters can respond to this tax by job cuts and those with a captive market like the electricity generators can respond by putting up their prices. I have said before in this House that, if you are a person of considerable wealth who puts your hand on your heart and says, ‘I'll pay more for my electricity to save the planet,' you are paying more for your electricity so your electricity generator can buy the certificates necessary to keep polluting. The idea is that, when all this money has gone into the government's coffers for some apparently selective picking as winners-type payback, in the delaying period after you have paid the tax and completely depleted your cash reserves you are going to rush out and do something positive to save the planet. This is unlikely and possibly impossible. The member for Throsby is leaving the parliament and she now seems to ask a few dorothy dixers about climate change. BlueScope Steel have to use coke to make steel. There is no other solution available as yet. They are just going to have to pay the tax. They might reduce their workforce. They might say: ‘We now know for certain that China and India are not going to have an ETS. Their labour force is still cheap and we will go there.' Goodbye, BlueScope Steel. Is this a good idea? The coalition says to BlueScope Steel, ‘Look, if there is anything left in your box that could improve your efficiency and reduce your carbon consumption, come along and see us and we will participate in paying you to achieve that outcome.' That is the difference. That is called picking winners. Furthermore, my www.wilsontuckey.com.au has the only contribution from any member of this House that proposes practical solutions to climate change. I think there are opportunities to erage off this debate, whether it is right or wrong. Mr Champion-Tidal power.",100
138,Mr TUCKEY,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"The member for Wakefield mentions tidal power, and I thank him for that, but there is a bigger issue. It is called high voltage DC current transmission. That will be the pipeline for big ticket renewables and low emissions. It is an interesting fact that natural gas does not run down a pipeline on its own. The pipeline between the Pilbara and Perth is consuming over 200 megawatts of energy for the pumping process. That is a pretty average sized powerhouse in comparison. It is about 700,000 tonnes of emissions. If we stop taking the gas out in Perth and turning it into electricity did that in the Pilbara, we would have more capacity in the pipeline for people who want heat, we would have the security of duplication and we could bring that electricity down on HVDC over about 1,000 kilometres into the south-west network and in the process only lose about three per cent of the power. The Europeans are starting to wake up to this. This government says, ‘Let's have photovoltaics all over the place in cloudy parts of Australia.' The Europeans are going into North Africa and looking at huge gigawatt-size stations. Western Australia only has a total generating capacity of about three gigawatts. The Europeans are talking about single stations or a collection of stations of that size in North Africa, and they propose to send that power over 3,000 kilometres back into Europe. The loss of power is 10 per cent. If you used our dodgy AC system, it would be 45 per cent. Where are the investment opportunities in website this scheme to do that? If you look at the coalition proposal, you will find a $2 million commitment to further investigate an HVDC system. I see it as identical to something lev- done by Charles Court, former Premier of Western Australia. Woodside had a find but nothing else, and Charles Court said, ‘On behalf of the people of Western Australia, I will buy more gas than they can use and I will fund the pipeline.' Today the pipeline is overstressed and this parliament gets huge amounts of revenue from the industry that followed that initial development. His son, the then minister and former Premier, sold that pipeline to the private sector for about three times what Charlie paid for it. What is wrong with a government statutory authority being established, after due inquiry, as our leader proposes, to undertake the original introduction of an HVDC system? I would start it on the Pilbara to Perth but pipeline. I would build a line across to South Australia and I would interconnect them. As the gas comes ashore in Browse, I would build it up there too. At the end of that, another line from South Australia to New South Wales, I would have spent about $5 billion. All the benefits of doubling the amount of power running down the wire are as good as having a renewable energy power station. If you go through the desert on the way, and you obviously do for South Australia, it then becomes practical to produce 2.4 gigawatts of wind power, because the HVDC system can accommodate the variability in the generation that comes from that. South Australia could have 2.4 gigawatts of extra power generation at a price that people could afford. (Time expired)",102
139,Mr CHAMPION,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and related bills. I begin by apologising to you, Deputy Speaker Schultz, for testing your patience earlier. It is always good to follow the member for O'Connor. We always learn something from him, something technical in this case, although he was sounding a bit like Rex Connor towards the end of his speech. This legislation is probably the most important legislation this parliament will debate in a generation. The decisions we make will have a profound effect on the way we live now and into the future. In my contribution, I would like to refer to the scientific consensus as it now stands, the policy options that stand before us, the views of the prominent climate sceptic Lord Monckton and the nature of opposition to this legislation. The scientific consensus as set out by the IPCC's working group in their report, Climate change 2007: the physical science basis, says that there is no question that the climate has warmed and that it is now very likely that greenhouse gas emissions related to human activity caused most of the warming that has been observed since the mid20th century. In the previous assessment rewith port, in 2001, the IPCC had only considered it likely. They found that global climate change over the past 50 years is extremely unlikely to have been caused by natural variability alone. These findings are a result of sophisticated computer modelling that takes into account greenhouse gases produced through human activity and also through the effects of the sun, aerosols and land use. The current rate of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is approaching 380 parts per million, which is the highest rate in 650,000 years. That rate increased during the industrial era and is likely to be unprecedented in more than 10,000 years. Ice core samples show that for the past 10,000 years preceding the industrial era, atmospheric carbon dioxide has been stable at 260 to 280 parts per million and the level of 280 parts per million has been around for roughly the 750 years preceding the industrial age. Human activities have increased that rate to 380 parts per million. Nitrous oxide levels have increased by 19 per cent and methane gas levels have doubled-they are all greenhouse gases. The warming that has occurred in the second half of this century can only be explained in the computer modelling if human induced changes in greenhouse gas emissions are included in those computer models. To put the amount of carbon that is emitted in an easily digestible form for the benefit of the House and anybody listening, human beings add 6.5 billion tonnes of carbon each year through burning fossil fuels. They add another one to two billion tonnes of carbon through erosion, land clearing and soil degradation. They are extraordinary figures when put on a global scale. Like the member for O'Connor, I have no scientific expertise. I am reliant on the scientific community for their advice. As a layman, it seems to me that if you pump 6.5 billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, it might have some effect on the balance of things and some effect on our fragile planet. We have the recent example of the hole that has been caused in the ozone layer. We know that was caused by seemingly small amounts of CFCs from our refrigerators and cooling systems, and that that had a very large impact on the world around us. It depleted ozone in the atmosphere. The world responded through the Montreal protocol, an international treaty to ban these chemicals. The sky did not fall in because of international action. The economy did not fail. No world government was enacted. What actually happened was that the use of CFCs declined and alternative chemicals for use were found by private enterprise. We changed our ways and, as a result, ozone levels in the atmosphere are likely to be restored to 1960 levels by 2050. So we had an international treaty, based on recommendations of scientists and backed by the leadership of nation states, which solved a problem through the dynamic innovation of private enterprise. It has been done in other areas, too. Acid rain in the United States was resolved through a cap-and-trade scheme. The problem was fixed by the US government constructing a market and private industry responding to that market. The result was not economic collapse and the result was not world government. The results were that acid rain was stopped, industry fixed the problem and it was fixed at a lower cost than anybody predicted. It is interesting that there was an article by Joel Kurtzman in the SeptemberOctober issue of Foreign Affairs last year called ‘The Low-Carbon diet'. Mr Kurtzman reports: In 1979, the United Nations passed the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, which marked the beginning of an international effort to reduce the emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. But it was not until the US Congress passed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 that the United States saw any meaningful reduction. The amendments enabled the EPA to place a national cap on emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides while allowing polluters to trade permits amongst themselves. Using 1980 emission levels as the baseline, the program aimed to cut emissions of sulfur dioxide in half by 2010. In 2007, three years ahead of schedule, the agency's capand-trade program achieved its reduction targets. The cost to emitters, which the Congressional Budget Office had estimated would be $6 billion a year, came instead to about $1.1-$1.8 billion a year, largely because the program enabled emitters to choose their own solutions to the problem, rather than relying on a narrow range of mandated technologies and approaches. There is some indication there that a similar scheme was used to solve a similar problem and fixed it, and it fixed it at a lower cost than anybody predicted-not at a higher cost than people predicted but at a lower cost. A similar scheme was used in the United States for the transition from leaded to unleaded petrol and, again, the result was that government gave leadership and created a market system and that market system induced private enterprise to produce a public good. Without those cap-and-trade schemes, this public policy outcome would not have occurred or it would have occurred at much greater cost. The CPRS legislation before us today is no different in principle from the US government's approach to acid rain. The need to act is backed by the weight of the scientific evidence that we have at this time. The government is providing leadership and direction for the public good and the national interest. A market is being created so that private enterprise will respond. This market will be based on sound principles. The first principle is that the polluter should pay for the permits to emit greenhouse gases; that the market, through the trading of these permits, will best know how to allocate the costs and risks associated with such emissions; that the market, through capital allocation, is most likely to effectively reward risk, to encourage innovation and to drive efficiency; and that the government should assist our export industries to protect our international competitiveness because, as previous members have said, those exporters cannot easily pass the prices on. The other principle is that lowand middle-income earners should be compensated for the price effects from the creation of this new market. This is not some invention of the Australian Labor Party. Rather, it is the invention of a range of experts-a range of people from across the policy divide-who think that this is the appropriate way to go about lowering emissions. Nicholas Stern, an economist and a person of great reputation, said: Expanding and linking the growing number of emissions trading schemes around the world is a powerful way to promote cost-effective reductions in emissions and to bring forward action developing countries. In addition, the Shergold report, which has been quoted many times in this debate, stated: By placing a price on emissions, trading allows market forces to find least cost ways of reducing emissions by providing incentives for firms to reduce emissions where this would be cheapest … That is why the Howard government was committed to introducing an emissions trading scheme. It was why the Liberals, under the responsible leadership of the member for Wentworth, backed amended CPRS legislation. You have to compliment the member for Wentworth. He did, I think, a courageous thing in this House today. He made a courageous speech, the type of speech that is not made in this House very often, and I think he is to be commended for it. It does take some courage to fly in the face of your party and it takes some courage to do it on the floor of the House of Representatives. It is a great pity that the current opposition has ignored all reason and adopted a policy that slugs the taxpayer rather than the polluter, that is underfunded and will either result in higher taxes or cuts to services and that relies on government directive rather than a market mechanism to allocate risk, create innovation and drive efficiency. We know that, at best, this approach has profound limitations and that, at worse, it has inherent public risk associated with it-the great risk of crony capitalism. Finally, this policy will increase emissions by 13 per cent over 2000 levels. At the end of spending all this money, it will have increased emissions. Even the coalition's own researcher, David Pearce from the Centre for International Economics, has said, according to the Australian Financial Review today: … the apparent simplicity of the coalition plan would soon disappear if it were ever implein mented, because so many technical aspects of the strategy had been left unresolved. The cost of the scheme could also rise significantly once details such as penalties on the assignment of risk were taken into account. At the end of the story, the article says: The principal architect of the coalition plan, opposition climate change spokesman Greg Hunt, admitted to The Australian Financial Review that this was an aspect of the scheme that would need to be resolved. He said that about some problems they were having with farmers. These are some extraordinary admissions about a policy that is designed to fail. It is just a political stuntvery immature, very short-sighted and very irresponsible. One would ask: what is driving this sudden change in policy by the Liberals? What has made them shift 180 degrees? The Liberal Party have said that Copenhagen caused the change in policy, but I think that it is actually a fellow called Lord Monckton. You cannot really have a discussion about climate change without examining the credibility of the lead sceptic. I have to say that I do not have anything against Lord Monckton. He seems like he would be an interesting person to have over for a dinner party. He is eccentric and controversial. He also possesses a certain charisma and good old-fashioned English charm, politeness and good manners; but he does have a long history of form on public policy issues. He has a history of holding extreme views in public policy debates. Let us take his view on AIDS. In 1987, Christopher Monckton, a former special adviser to Margaret Thatcher, wrote an article for the American Spectator titled ‘AIDS, a British view'. In it he said: Yet both reports fail to draw the unwelcome but undeniable conclusion from the disquieting evidence which they present. For there is only one way to stop AIDS. That is to screen the entire population regularly and to quarantine all carriers of the disease for life to halt the transmission of the disease to those who are uninfected. Every member of the population should be blood-tested every month to detect the presence of antibodies against the disease, and all those found to be fected with the virus, even if only as carriers, should be isolated compulsorily, immediately, and permanently. He went on to say that his program of action is radical, universal, undeniably contrary to individual liberties, et cetera. It is quite an extraordinary article. He finishes the article by saying: Although the idea of universal testing and lation now sounds extravagant and preposterous, it will eventually happen. We know that Lord Monckton was wrong about that. He was absolutely wrong and he admitted that he was absolutely wrong later on when he was trying to sell puzzles to the public and he had to back off. He said: Although I did mention quarantine and compulsory testing, I also said it was incompatible with liberal democracies and placed national authorities in an immense dilemma of enacting an unthinkable infringement of basic liberties. While quarantine may have been an option 12 years ago, it is now obviously far too late to even consider a measure like that. He said that on 28 August 1999 and has since backed away from that. In his latest National Press Club appearance he had a whole slide based on it and he said, regarding the AIDS epidemic, ‘That is the correct policy' in regard to quarantining. So we know that Lord Monckton swings around the place a great deal. He told a South Yarra audience about the crash of a NASA satellite. He said: Not greatly to my surprise-indeed I predicted it-the satellite crashed on take-off because the last thing they want is real world hard data … That is what he told a climate sceptics lunch in South Yarra. The other day at the National Press Club, someone asked him what he would do to free science from prejudice and from the state interfering in it. I transcribed this myself off APAC. He said: The first thing we have to do is stop funding science as taxpayers, that is a mistake, there is in- only one customer these days, and that is the state. Ninety-nine per cent of all science is bought and paid for by the state, via the taxpayer, whether the taxpayer likes it or not. That induces a culture of dependency much the same as someone living on the dole. The scientists are all like this and therefore begin to pander to what the state wants. What he is suggesting there is that we end all state funding for science-which is a pretty isoradical proposal. Like I said, Lord Monckton is a likeable sort of fellow and he is very charming and all the rest of it, but I do not think that his views are practical or desirable and I think that Australians would find them extreme. You would have to wonder what influence he is having over Australian domestic policy. I noticed the other day that the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, met with Lord Monckton. I do wonder what they discussed in their meeting. Did the Leader of the Opposition, as a former health minister, discuss Lord Monckton's views on AIDS and the quarantining proposal? Did they discuss communism and the green movement, as the member for Kingston talked about? Did they discuss the conspiracy of radicalised scientists? Did they discuss the ending of all government funding for scientists? Did they discuss the crash of NASA weather satellite? I think we are entitled to know how Lord Monckton is affecting Australian domestic policy. I think it is very important question. I do not think that people should be judged by the company they keep, but the Leader of the Opposition is a significant figure in Australian politics. He has changed his policy. He has met with this leading climate sceptic who has had a tour of the country-a very successful tour by all accounts; he had packed-out audiences-but I think we are entitled to know what Mr Abbott and Lord Monckton discussed. We have a right to know whether this parliament is going to be used as a cipher for Lord Monckton's views. We have a right to know if this parliament is going to be used as an incense burner to Lord Monckton's vanity. We have got a right to know whether or not it is going to be used as a crucible to his policy fantasies. I think the Leader of the Opposition should reveal to us what subjects were discussed in his secret meeting with Lord Monckton. Whether or not he agrees with Lord Monckton's views is irrelevant, but we should be entitled to know exactly what was on the agenda for the meeting, whether or not there are going to be any future meetings, whether or not there is going to be any future contact, whether or not there are going to be any phone calls and whether or not, under an Abbott government, Lord Monckton would be sitting over here in the ‘honoured visitors' gallery. Perhaps he would be there-this batty English lord-giving policy advice to a future Abbott government. I think we are entitled to know all of that, and I would like to hear from the opposition about the nature of the meeting and what was discussed.",103
140,Ms MARINO,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I rise to oppose the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and cognate bills. As I said a the first time. I spoke on these bills, this is seriously flawed legislation that will cost Australian jobs. It will cost investment and a will compromise our historic, internationally competitive marketing advantage underpinned by cheap energy. However, as a result of the coalition's direct action plan, Australians now have a clear choice of, as the Leader of the Opposition says, ‘a big new tax on everything' or practical direct action. One example of somebody who will be affected is David, a constituent from my electorate, a young man who is single, works as a trades assistant and, under the Labor government's ETS, will be at least $140 worse off every year. All sectors of the economy and every Australian family, every individual, every small, medium and large business, every contractor and industry-everyone in my regional and rural electorate-will be affected by this flawed tax policy. This legislation will raise prices for all consumer goods and services, add to the cost of living for every Australian and have a major impact, particularly on small businesses, by increasing electricity and input costs, without providing those same small businesses with any form of compensation to mitigate the 20 per cent increase in electricity costs. Some small businesses will pass on the increased cost to consumers, but the Labor government expects small businesses in the agricultural sector, which are, by majority, price takers, to simply absorb the additional costs. The Labor government's ETS will cost Australian jobs. As I said, there is no mention of compensation-only extra cost-for the 750,000 small businesses in Australia, and certainly there is no mention of compensation for the 13,400 small businesses in my electorate. The drycleaners, the retailers, the hairdressers and those in the service sectorparticularly those who cannot pass on additional costs, like farmers and horticulturalists-will all see increased costs. We know, however, that electricity for households will be cheaper under the coalition's direct action plan. The total cost of the coalition's direct action plan is $3.2 billion over the first four years, while the government's ETS will cost $40 billion over those first four years and $120 billion by 2020. Another issue which appears to have been deliberately ignored by the government is the fact that the cost of the ETS tax will be compounded repeatedly on goods and services. Every part of the supply and value chain will add to the ETS cost. In regional and rural areas, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Schultz, costs are already higher than in city centres. The ETS will compound this further with additional costs for electricity, food, groceries, fuel and other essentials like heating and cooling, which are often a necessity in regional and more remote areas, particularly for pensioners and those with health and mobility problems. The Prime Minister has guaranteed ‘absolutely' that no pensioners would be worse off under the scheme, but does this include pensioners in regional and remote communities, like those in my electorate, who will face comparatively higher costs under the ETS on everything they use and consume? There is no assistance, again only extra costs, for funded retirees. All of the people in my electorate who have worked all their lives, contributed to the economy and their communities, taken responsibility for providing for their retirement and health care-and who take a huge burden from the governmentwill absorb and bear higher costs to live. In contrast, the coalition's climate action policy provides incentives for Australian families and businesses to reduce their carbon emissions and focuses on effective and direct action to improve Australia's environment, sustainability and food security. Our policy is about investing in a future that delivers job opportunities as well as providing incentives to reduce emissions. Our direct action plan does not impose additional costs on families and households and it includes the introduction of a range of measures to encourage and support the increased uptake and use of renewable energy in homes and communities. The coalition's strategy also commits to solar towns and solar schools, geothermal, tidal, high-voltage underground cabling, support for renewable fuels, retention of the Greenhouse Friendly program and green corridors and urban forests. In my electorate of Forrest, there is a genuine interest in energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and options for the future. We need further innovation and investment in improved storage, transmission and delivery of energy. We have heard consistently from the member for O'Connor about HVDC transmission. Late last year, West Perth based Green Rock Energy announced that it had been granted three geothermal exploration permits within the town of Collie in my electorate, where a substantial proportion of Perth's electricity supply is generated from power stations. The Prime Minister, in question time, has been forced to admit that electricity prices selfwill increase by seven per cent and 12 per cent in the first two years of the ETS. The government talks of compensation, but how long will this be offered and when will the full cost actually hit families given that, we know, the New South Wales pricing regulator recommended a 62 per cent increase in electricity charges, one-third of which will come from the proposed emissions trading scheme? I note that the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, is at this moment pre-empting a decision by this parliament, potentially wasting further taxpayer funds by seeking tenders for a carbon emissions auction system through a 123-page tender document. I look forward to the Senate estimates revealing the cost of this for taxpayers. We have heard from the Auditor General of the waste of $17 million of taxpayers' funds on the first, fatally flawed, costly NBN tender process. Clearly, wasting taxpayers' money seems to be business as usual for the Rudd government. I look forward to the government telling my constituents exactly what the actual bureaucratic and massive administrative costs of the CPRS churn will be for this complex scheme. You only have to look at the schedules for household compensation to get some idea of what they will be. I note that, under international rules, emissions are counted against the country in which the goods are produced, not the country in which they are consumed. So, for Australia, as a net exporter of food, over one-third of our emissions are generated from goods produced in Australia but consumed overseas. What we have in the government's ETS for exporters is a direct tax on production. Australian farmers and exporters will pay the cost of emissions for products consumed overseas, and that is if they are competitive in the market under the ETS. Just imagine that you are fortunate enough to be travelling overseas-maybe you are in as Brazil, Korea, Thailand or even Copenhagen-and you decide to have a meal. Of course, you are going to have some meat with your meal, and I hope that the meat is either Harvey beef, Dardanup butchers tender ridge or V&V Walsh's Amelia Park lamb or beef. You might also have some Harvey Fresh or Challenge dairy products, and I hope you will have a Donnybrook apple-andpear pie and some wine from the Margaret River region-all from my electorate in the south-west of WA. But that consumption will not be reflected in the carbon footprint of South America, Asia or Denmark; it will be reflected in the carbon footprint of Australia. Locally grown and produced products will also be competing with imported produce that does not have the cost of an ETS included in the cost of production. The Sunday Times of 27 December had an article entitled ‘ETS bungle on food bill'. It noted the government's estimate of a $68 annual increase in the weekly supermarket trolley, and the Food and Grocery Council's chief, Kate Carnell, is quoted as saying the council believes the increase would be $520 per annum. But, from my point of view, this is the interesting accounting quote. Kate Carnell said: “It seems the only way the Government could have got $68 would be to base their modelling on significant reductions in Australian manufactured goods and a significant increase in supplies from cheaper priced countries, such as China.” “The 300,000 Australian workers whose jobs are involved could have significant problems with that.” As a farmer, I have serious problems with that. And we have the return of the melamine issue in China, and I have very serious issues with that. The Labor government's ETS will see major Australian supermarket chains importing even greater amounts of Chinese, Asian, South African and South American food at the expense of Australian farmers. That is something farmers in my electorate are very well aware of. The majority of them, as we know, are already price takers. How will Australian farmers, including in the south-west of Western Australia, compete with countries that maintain subsidies and do not have the added production cost of an ETS? The clear majority of farmers I know and have worked with for many years have an innate and direct respect for the environment. Often they are intergenerational farming families. They know from experience that they need to pass on their constantly evolving and improving land, water and pasture management practices. They do not stand still. Every day, they are environmental managers on their properties. They directly contribute to biosequestration through pastures, managing vegetation and tree planting. Many of them are members of land care and sustainability groups. They are constantly tive. They very clearly and directly understand the need for the triple bottom line in their businesses: economic, social and environmental sustainability. Our businesses, our families, our farms and our communities depend on it. This is our livelihood today and the future of Australia's food security and agricultural exports-the very exports which kept Australia out of technical recession during the global financial crisis. I also note that a University of California ogy. study estimated that livestock contribute about three per cent of global emissions, not the estimated 18 per cent-and we see no credit for sequestration in the estimate of 18 per cent. As I have mentioned in the past, farmers and small businesses will pay more for virtually every input from day one of the government's flawed ETS. The cost of fertiliser, fuel, chemicals, dairy and horticultural supplies-all farming supplies-will increase. The cost of production will increase. Under the proposed legislation, Australia's approximately 150,000 farming businesses and family farms will be hit with a tax across their input costs. There is no doubt that the ETS will reduce farm profitability. This will come as a major blow, because Australian farmers have been at the forefront of environmental management through zeroand low-till crop sowing, through water-use efficiencies, through weed control and through changes in fertiliser management. We see it on farms every day. Modelling has shown that the Rudd government's emissions trading tax will impose costs of between $6,000 and $9,000 on the average dairy farm each year-and I believe that is a conservative estimate. My electorate is the home of approximately 170 dairy farmers in Western Australia. The majority of those farmers are price takers. They have virtually no capacity to pass on any additional cost of the Labor government's ETS. proac- The government must be honest with the Australian people and explain exactly how much the ETS will cost, and what costs will be added to the permit exchange process through profiteering by agents, traders and bankers. Price volatility in trading pollution permits under the ETS will not necessarily provide additional certainty to business. What it may do, however, is make it very difficult for business to have the financial capacity to invest in low-emissions technolThe US government is now working on direct action. One example is the announcement of an agreement with dairy producers to adopt innovative anaerobic digester technology for manure-to-energy projects on American dairy farms. That is just one example. It was stated in a recent article that dairy producers and the innovation centre of the US Department of Agriculture are working together to reach a 25 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and that anaerobic digesters routinely generate enough electricity to power 200 homes. In my electorate recently, Griffin Coal was placed in involuntary administration, placing the jobs of over 500 workers and contractors at serious risk, as well as impacting on local and regional businesses, community service organisations, sporting organisations and, of course, our families. I know that, over many months, representatives of the company met with Minister Wong to explain how much the Labor government's ETS would cost Western Australia's coal fired power generators. But none of their issues-including an adjustment to the Electricity Sector Adjustment Scheme and the different characteristics of the WA energy market compared to the national energy market-have been included in the Labor government's ETS legislation. The company also queried what the Labor government will do for the many emissions intensive industries included under the ETS that are funded by project financing arrangements containing clauses which are triggered by significant market events, enabling financiers to exit projects completely. There is no doubt the ETS tax would be rated as a significant market event by financiers. The government has not explained how it would prevent this and has not provided economic analysis on the impact this will have on WA families and businesses. I just wonder whether the government will simply watch private investment being withdrawn from power generation as a result of the ETS tax. have no doubt that, with the Labor government's determination to force its emissions trading scheme through the parliament, financial institutions have been and will be factoring in a high-risk cost to finance or refinance coal fired power generators. The ETS will have further impacts on major employers in my electorate through the aluminium and mineral processing sectors and industries, not to mention the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors. I will repeat what I have said each time. I have spoken on the ETS. This legislation is seriously flawed and the Australian people now have a choice: this seriously flawed Labor ETS tax on everything or the coalition's direct action. I opposed this flawed legislation.",107
141,Mr DREYFUS,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"Isaacs) (6.31 pm)Climate change is a diabolical problem, because it requires both national and international action to avoid catastrophic consequences. The Economist in December last year described it as ‘the hardest political problem the world has ever had to deal with'. The bills we are debating which establish the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme are an important part of our national response to the problem. The scheme is a part of our national response, not the whole of it, and will add to the armoury of measures already adopted by the Rudd government. The CPRS established by these bills is also a scheme which until December of last year was supported by both sides of Australian politics, as was so well explained by the former leader of the opposition, the member for Wentworth, in the courageous speech he gave earlier in the day. I want to start by addressing some remarks to the climate science, because there has been a great deal of comment and criticism of the climate science which supports the need for action. None of this criticism or I comment, however, has affected the central conclusion of that science, which is that our planet is in danger if mankind does not reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions. The criticisms amount to minor nitpicking but are elevated to major status by climate change deniers and supporters of inaction. Standing back from the nitpicking, it can be seen that climate change deniers and supporters of inaction do not tackle the central proposition of the science, which is that creased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will lead to global warming and dangerous climate change. Mankind is pumping billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which has resulted in the last decade being the warmest on record. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2007 report concluded that, if left unabated, greenhouse gas increases would make the planet a further three degrees hotter by 2100-and possibly 4.5 to 5 degrees hotter. If the higher temperatures eventuate, the consequences could be catastrophic. These central conclusions are completely unaffected by the appearance in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report of references to non-peer-reviewed articles or by a lack of clear support in the report for some predictions of a few particular consequences of global warming. It needs to be understood that the consequences-and the created or manufactured controversy that we have had in recent weeks about the melting of Himalayan glaciers is an example-are simply a part of a very long list of dire consequences that will be caused by global warming. The environment of our planet and the atmosphere and oceans of our planet are complex, interconnected systems. Whether Himalayan glaciers will melt by 2050 or 2080 or 2100 is beside the point. This is but one of the possible consequences of hotter global temperatures. There are many other dangerous consequences and the vast majority of those consequences are simply not in doubt as being very probable consequences of the warming of the planet. Deniers like Ian Plimer or the former Thatcher adviser Lord Monckton, who has been spreading confusion on a recent speaking tour of Australia, never produce any serious challenge the central thesis of the climate science, which is that increased greenhouse gases in in- the earth's atmosphere caused by human activity are leading to global warming and dangerous climate change. The action which the climate science points to is to reduce the emission of global greenhouse gases. You might think that it is not necessary to go through these arguments, because both sides of Australian politics are now committed to at least a five per cent reduction from 2000 levels by 2020. I say ‘at least' because, while the government is committed to the five per cent reduction from 2000 levels by 2020 as a minimum and has left open the possibility of increasing the reductions target to 15 and 25 per cent depending on international action, the opposition has, it seems, drawn a line at five per cent. It is of course the case that the plan produced by the opposition last week is woefully inadequate and so it is unlikely to get anywhere near even the five per cent target. It is also clear from the plan produced by the opposition last week that the new Leader of the Opposition is prepared to pander to the deniers. For those reasons-the inadequacy of the opposition's plan and the apparent wish of the new opposition leader not to seriously commit but rather to pander to the deniers-we need to restate the need for action and continue to restate it. Scientists say that, if we continue on the current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions, there is a strong risk of temperatures rising by up to five degrees by the end of this century. That will mean that Australia, which is already the hottest and driest continent in the world, will become even hotter and drier. Coastal areas will be flooded, coastal infrastructure will be destroyed, water will become scarcer and agriculture will become more marginal and more difficult, particularly for irrigated agriculture, which has thousands of jobs associto ated with it. The Great Barrier Reef will die, and the thousands of jobs in North Queensland that depend on the tourist industry will vanish with it. Across the world, deserts will increase, icecaps will melt, coastal regions will suffer massive flooding and hundreds of millions, or even billions, of people will be homeless. There will be extraordinary levels of suffering and misery. These are shocking possibilities, which we all hope will never come to pass. But the climate change deniers and those who argue for inaction or for less action cannot guarantee that these dreadful consequences will not occur. Because they do not guarantee our safety or that the science they are so keen to tear down is wrong, we must act. The only responsible course to take is the course which the science suggests-that is, to act now to reduce emissions. If the science turns out to be wrong, then the results of actions to reduce emissions will still benefit humanity and the planet. Our earth will be a cleaner and better place. We will have reduced energy consumption and our dependence on fossil fuels. We will have increased the sustainability of the world's industries. But if, I believe, the science is right and we have not acted as quickly and as extensively as we can, we will have condemned the planet to lasting environmental damage and humanity to immense misery. We need to keep squarely in mind Lord Stern's warning from 2006 that there is a cost now in reducing emissions to prevent climate change but that this cost is far, far less now than if we delay and allow emissions of greenhouse gases to continue. The cost of reducing emissions will be greater the longer we fail to act, because steeper cuts are harder to achieve. We will need to make steeper cuts in emissions the longer we wait. As well, the cost of adaptation to climate change will be greater in the future because the climate changes that we must adapt to will by that stage have become more severe. A number of speakers in this debate have commented on the result of the Copenhagen conference in December, which was of course a disappointment to the world, because the high expectations that had been raised for a binding global agreement were not met. But the failure of international negotiators to reach a proper deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions does not alter the science. The failure is a failure of politics. It is a failure of international relations. It is not a failure of the science. The poor outcome of Copenhagen will not affect the processes which are now occurring. The fragile and thin atmosphere of our planet will continue to be damaged by greenhouse gas emissions until levels are reduced. We are all very well aware that there are already in the atmosphere, and will be for some hundreds of years, elevated levels of greenhouse gases, which already ensures that there will be a rise in the order of two degrees in global temperatures. It is for that reason that some as level of dangerous climate change and global warming is already locked in. Our task as legislators, and the task of governments around the world, is to make sure that climate change and global warming are kept in check to the maximum extent possible. That is the task to which this legislation is directed. Many of those opposite who have spoken so far in this debate seem to be happy that Copenhagen did not produce better outcomes. They should be dismayed, as I am dismayed, and work to a better outcome in Cancun in Mexico this year, because one thing that is clear is that concerted global action is necessary. Copenhagen did not meet expectations but it should not be seen as a justification for inaction. It should be seen as a spur to renew effort for a global deal. Instead of playing the political charade that effective action to reduce emissions can be achieved without cost and without substantial change in some industries, we need to ask: what is the most effective action we can take nationally and globally to reduce emissions? It is not enough to commit to emissions cuts. It is not enough to promise future government spending, which is what the opposition relies on. It is not enough to rely good intentions, particularly when what is needed is a change in corporate investment decisions. What is needed is a mechanism which creates incentives to cut emissions. There is a broad consensus that emissions trading schemes are the most effective and lowest cost mechanism to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The report prepared for the former government by the former head of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Peter Shergold, reached that conclusion. The Garnaut review prepared for the current government reached that conclusion. The report prepared by Lord Stern for the government of the United Kingdom reached that conclusion, and the current Leader of the Opposition reached that conclusion until he perceived that some temporary political advantage was to be gained by pretending otherwise. The international community has reached that conclusion. More than 30 countries around the world already have an emissions trading scheme, including the European Community, the United Kingdom, France and Germany. Other countries are developing these schemes, including the United States, Japan and Korea. The international direction is towards agreement and consensus for emissions trading schemes, and Australia needs to be moving in the same direction. The CPRS is the best means of doing this because it will provide a price signal to industry, to companies making long-term investment decisions. The market will set that price. One of the ironies about the current debate is that the Liberal Party and the National Party are opting for heavy government regulation, for the command and control approach, and are, it seems, against a market based solution. The carbon price will provide the incentive to move to lower emissions and at the lowest cost. This was Peter Shergold's on direct conclusion in advising the former government. The opposition's solution will simply channel billions in subsidies to businesses selected by them. Very possibly, the subsidies will support an investment the businesses would have made anyway. It is a solution which means higher taxes for fewer cuts in emissions, and the Liberal and National parties should not be pretending otherwise. Much of the commentary since the release of the opposition's inadequate plan last week has wrongly suggested that direct government spending, which the opposition relies on, is somehow an alternative to an emissions trading scheme. It is not, because we need to do both. We need a range of government spending, a range of government programs and government action, supported by an emissions trading scheme-and one could add to that a renewable energy target. The Rudd government has already acted in a range of ways. The government has acted by signing the Kyoto protocol, acted by taking part in the world efforts at Bali and Copenhagen and is now working hard on a better outcome in Mexico later this year. The government has acted by embarking already on what the opposition choose to call direct action-by committing more than $15 billion in the last budget to a range of measures which are directed at lowering emissions. Those measures include action to improve energy efficiency in homes, shops, offices and workplaces; measures to deploy existing clean energy and low-emissions technologies; support for the creation of new clean energy and low-emissions technologies and products and opportunities for individual action by households. Direct climate change related measures in the 2009-10 budget included the Clean Energy Initiative, which incorporates programs for low-emissions coal, solar and other renewable energy technologies, the Australian Carbon Trust and the National Strategy on Energy Efficiency. A simple example of what the opposition would like to call direct action on climate change is the Home Insulation Program, an important part of the economic stimulus measures introduced by the government last year, which the opposition voted against. There is over $2 billion to be spent on insulating hundreds of thousands of Australian homes. Not only will this cut power bills and improve home comfort for Australian working families; it will also reduce emissions by cutting energy use. The emissions cuts produced by the Home Insulation Program have been estimated as the equivalent of taking a million cars off the road. That is the kind of direct action, to use the opposition's term, that the Rudd government has well and truly embarked on and has been acting on since coming to office. I will finish by saying that there are great national benefits to be gained by adopting the CPRS. It will, together with other government programs, move Australia to a lowcarbon economy, an economy with far lower emissions, which is the direction the rest of the world is turning towards. I will give just a couple of examples. China has become a very large emitter of greenhouse gases, although not, of course, on a per capita basisAustralia takes the prize for very, very high emissions on a per capita basis. But China has also reached the largest installed renewable energy capacity in the world and aims to increase the share of non-fossil fuel energy in China to 15 per cent by 2020. The United Kingdom has adopted the UK Low Carbon Transition Plan, which is focusing on increasing energy efficiency, developing a smart grid, decarbonising transport and a range of other measures. There are global opportunities for lowcarbon technologies. Adopting a low-carbon policy in Australia, which the CPRS is part of, will create demand for low-carbon technologies, which will create jobs, create business opportunities and stimulate investment. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions will create growth opportunities for businesses. We are all aware of the advantage that comes from being an early leader with new technology. I want to see Australia be an early leader in developing low-carbon futures, not just for this country but for the rest of the world. The renewable energy target and the CPRS are part of the solution which will move Australia to a low-carbon future. They are measures which will prompt emissions reductions. I am confident that very substantial reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in Australia can be achieved. They can be achieved without producing substantial changes in Australian lifestyles. Many of the reduction opportunities that are presented are in fact profitable for business. (Time expired)",111
142,Mrs MOYLAN,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"Pearce) (6.51 pm)Environmental policy is one of those areas where I do not believe government can act unilaterally-that is, just making decisions without bringing the Australian public with them. The challenge of climate change cannot be solved without direct action and participation policy for the community. It was for this reason that in 2008 I held a community forum called ‘Our Patch, Our Planet' in the electorate of Pearce so as to encourage some of the community to come and debate issues around the future of our environmental policies. The community had one message which was loud and clear. Where there was a policy to reduce carbon pollution, they wanted to be part of it. They wanted recognition for their contribution and, more importantly, they wanted leadership, guidance and incentives from the federal government so that their efforts were effective, so that what they did actually counted. Instead, they got a poorly constructed, incoherent emissions trading scheme with a great emphasis on strutting the world stage and little explanation as to how the scheme would work domestically and what it would mean for individuals and business, large and small. I suspect the reason the ETS has not been explained to the public is that the government still fails to fully understand its own scheme. Dr Alex Robson, a visiting fellow from the Crawford School of Economics and Government at the Australian National University, recently presented a paper titled ‘What does the government CPRS modelling tell us?' analysing and commenting on the government's paper ‘Australia's low pollution future'. The paper set out some of the key assumptions in the modelling the government did in 2008 in preparation for the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill and cognate bills that we are debating today. Dr Robson gave an insightful paper. In particular, at the outset he made three very important points. First, the government has not modelled key aspects of its actual climate change policies. Second, the government has provided no information on some of the key economic effects of its planned emissions reduction policies, including possible effects of unemployment, interest rates and inflation. Third, and finally, government's own modelling results show that the present value of the cost of emissions reductions could easily exceed Australia's entire current gross domestic product. This analysis gives us some clue perhaps as to why the government has been unable to articulate a coherent argument in favour of its policy, except a mantra that we had to go to Copenhagen with a settled position and legislation passed through this parliament no matter what the cost. How can the government expect the public to have faith in this ETS when it has failed to produce modelling on the key economic effects of measures outlined in this bill? A survey in my electorate has shown that the public are very keen to see us do something about reducing our carbon footprint. But, in order to instil public confidence, the government has to lay everything out very clearly so that people can understand what they are being asked to sign up to. I do not think this has happened. It is very sad really to have bungled so comprehensively this important policy matter. It really is an indictment of the current government and, importantly, it seriously sets back the plans to reduce Australia's carbon emissions. I have spoken often on these and related bills over the past several years and accept the science, notwithstanding some of the more fantastic claims from sceptics and some mistakes in ICCP reports that are now being corrected and addressed. It is concerning that impetus for global action has stalled and that the public feels sceptical about aspects of the science. But this in no way absolves us as responsible members of this parliament from acting in a way that cuts through some of those more fantastic claims and to ensure that we risk manage for the future. Although Australia is one of the largest emitters per head of population, the fact is the that Australia's contribution to CO2 emissions is around 1.4 per cent. Without a significant commitment by other developed and developing countries, we cannot unilaterally take action on our own continent that will resolve the looming problems on the planet. While we should make a contribution to reducing the output of CO2, it is very hard to see the point of the government's unseemly haste to push this particular legislation that we are debating today through this parliament for a second time when it has failed to coherently articulate the policy to the Austraernment's lian people. My experience is that people are reasonable. As I said, a survey of my electorate shows that people want something to be done, but they are very wary of what is being offered at the present time by the government. There have been fantastic claims, as I said, on both sides of this debate. Surely, in the interests of public confidence in the icy direction, the government does owe it to the nation to fully model all aspects of the policy in terms of its impact on the community and to improve its articulation of the policy in the public domain domestically. Meanwhile, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, and the shadow minister, the member for Flinders, have proposed a direct action policy that does make a good start to doing more than churn large sums of money made from permits into compensation papers. It is a policy that reflects the community's concerns and provides the vital framework in which people can make a direct contribution to reducing greenhouse emissions. This is a policy that recognises community engagement as a priority rather than as a favour to the community. The direct action proposed by the coalition has the capability of achieving the five per cent target at a lower cost to the community. It provides direct incentives to reduce CO2 emissions without the immediate flowon effect of Labor's legislation. Most importantly, the coalition policy provides incentives for individuals as well as families, businesses and industries to take direct action to reduce carbon emissions. The coalition will introduce a $2.5 billion emissions reduction fund to support carbon reduction and the fund will direct CO2 emissions reduction activities through to 2020 by providing incentives to businesses to reach the target of reduced carbon emissions by five per cent by 2020, the same as the govtarget, without the cost burden and the complexity. As I said, it is enormously important that governments recognise the need to clearly articulate the policy, explain it to the community, be upfront about its impact and bring the public along with them on this important journey to reduce carbon and to improve our quality of life globally. The fund that the coalition is setting up pol- will provide a reduction in CO2 emissions and practical environmental benefits, while protecting the community from massive increases in costs and possible job losses. Again, the impact on jobs has not been adequately modelled. The coalition's emission reduction fund will use the existing national greenhouse gas and energy reporting scheme, which was introduced into this House by the Howard government, to determine proposed emission reductions beyond the base levels which have already been established for individual firms. Businesses that reduce emissions below their individual baseline will be able to offer the CO2 abatement for sale to the government. This means that there is a direct financial incentive for businesses to take direct action to reduce their carbon footprint. This is an efficient market based policy. There is no doubt that the market has an important role to play. In the future we may find that there is a place for an even greater market role, but the effectiveness of the large-scale market approach is limited until such a time as the community comes on board with it and accepts it. The coalition's proposed fund will support a range of other measures to abate carbon, including replenishment of soil and farmland; the replacement of old, inefficient power stations; a $40 million investment in the development of clean energy hubs to drive clean energy research and development for the future; and the planting of 20 million trees by 2020, with a commitment to a green army to assist with the delivery of this gram. Importantly, the coalition's policy rection includes a strong emphasis on a new solar sunrise for Australia, one of our est natural resources-and we do not make the most of it. We see countries like Germany developing whole industries around solar, and they do not have the natural advanimproper tages that we have in this country. The new solar sunrise for Australia includes a million additional solar roofs by 2020 through an additional $1,000 rebate for either solar panels or solar hot water systems and has a $100 million solar towns and schools initiative so that whole communities can contribute. There will be $50 million invested in a geothermal and tidal towns initiative. The program will commit to a study of high-voltage underground cabling to support renewable energy delivery. Labor has chosen, by contrast, to rely on its high-taxing, complicated merry-go-round of money and a direct action policy that frankly is a shambles. That, again, is a great shame. The integrity of the direct action policies put into place by the government is in question, yet they have a lot of merit and should be done. Those programs have the capability to reduce CO2 emissions. Rather than engaging the community, this government has further alienated people through dismal management and chaotic delivery of its direct action programs. The three key government initiatives designed to engage the community-the solar credits scheme, the insulation rebate scheme and the Green Loans scheme-are all now lying in tatters. After a series of scandals, these programs have wasted millions of dollars of taxpayers' money and have resulted in mass community disillusionment and scepticism. Sadly, what it has meant is that they have not achieved their potential, which is not good for any of us. First we had the chopping and changing of the solar panel rebate, leaving industry pro- and consumers confused and many out of di- pocket. Next came the very serious allegations of the rorting of the insulation rebate greatscheme, now subject to inquiry. We now know that the management of this program was so negligent that many houses across Australia are at risk of electrical fires due to installation and quite probably are not saving as much energy, because of the shoddy way in which some of that work was carried out. But the epitome of mismanagement comes from the Green Loans Program that was expected to run until 2012 but now looks like running out of money by April. The minister says this is testament to the program's success, but the thousands of Australians who invested $4,000 in training and accreditation to become a green loans assessor who now find themselves without work might say otherwise. The government capped the number of assessments but not the number of assessors and now faces the prospect of a class action from disgruntled assessors who claim to have been misled about their training and job prospects. Again, it is just not good for the environment and it is not good for any of us. It does not help us to take the important steps to reduce our carbon footprint. While there is a glut of assessors, the Green Loans process has been further hampered by the inefficient processing of applications for assessments and loans. I have been contacted by a number of constituents with serious concerns as to the administration of the program, which has hampered their efforts to reduce household carbon emissions. These cases, of course, I have referred to the minister, and I would hope that they will be sorted so that this program can do what it was intended to do, which in intent is noble. The capacity to reduce our carbon footprint in the future will rely undoubtedly on every individual playing a part. We have all contributed to the problem of environmental degradation and we all need to play a part to change the way we live our lives and the way we do business. Many Australian businesses and individuals have been taking steps for some time to reduce carbon emissions, but ongoing meaningful change cannot take place unless there is full community engagement and everyone is equipped to play their part. There is so much more we could do with regard to new vehicle emissions, urban planning, public transport, house design and even in the area-just the single step-of the way we consume packaging could have a very significant impact on the environment and on our greenhouse gas emissions. These are other areas where direct action could really benefit the community in reducing our reliance on traditional forms of energy, reducing the cost of living and improving our environment overall. I am at a loss to know why we do not have the sort of leadership we should have in some of these areas which we do not seem to have done much about at all-they have been barely touched on. Igniting the community consciousness and engaging individuals through reputable programs and transparent modelling is an essential element for any Australian environmental policy. It is not enough for government to establish a huge bureaucracy, and to expect the public's support for a scheme that not even the government seems to understand, especially when some households stand to lose $950 from their budgets each year under this scheme. It really is important that if ernment wants the cooperation of the people that it comes clean, that it explains the policy, that it outlines the implications of that policy and does everything to ask the public to come on that journey as well. The tendency, though, to ignore the real cost of doing business in Australia-and, in fact, globally-and not factoring in clean-up costs means that I think we are all living in a fool's paradise. To think that we can keep digging material out of the ground, we can keep manufacturing and doing all of the other things that we do without factoring in the real cost of what we are doing means we are just kidding ourselves. We need to really think about that quite a bit. Also, the convention that our economic well-being must continue to rest on industrial and commercial practices that have historically led to environmental degradation must be urgently rethought and reviewed. There are new ways of doing things. We do have very innovative people and we can change for the good of the whole of the nation and, indeed, for the global good. But if we are to meet the considerable challenge of climate change the action ultimately has to come from individual efforts on a global scale, and it will demand a financial investment-there are no two ways about it-as well as one of human ingenuity and human effort. We are all in this together and the time has passed, really, to debate the core elements of the science but to move forward with a carbon reduction scheme that all Australians can feel confident in, can embrace and can participate in so that we make a genuine effort to reduce our carbon footprint.",115
143,Mr CHEESEMAN,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and related bills. In doing so, I highlight the importance govof these particular measures in my own seat of Corangamite. They are also very significant nationally and globally. I would like to start by formally putting on the record my thanks to Minister Penny Wong for her tireless efforts in calibrating these bills to meet the needs of working families and their employers. The minister has put together what I believe to be a fantastic package that will enable us to counteract the worse aspects of climate change through these particular measures. Of course, it has been an epic and incredibly difficult task that the minister has undertaken. I believe she has done it in a first-class way. I want to add some clear and unequivocal statements to those I made before Christmas. These statements will be judged in our electorates and in my electorate of Corangamite-it is important that we all recognise this. Not that long ago the current opposition leader described climate change as crap. I actually believe in the science; I believe action on climate change is a necessity in my electorate of Corangamite. I believe the Leader of the Opposition is an embarrassment to this parliament. He starts with the argument that climate change, in his view, is crap. Then he goes on to present a policy that I believe does not deliver in any way whatsoever any emissions reductions. He then puts those costs onto Australian families through taxation and our normal government arrangements for raising revenue. As I said earlier, I believe climate change is real. I believe the science is real. I believe people and industry have contributed very substantially to climate change. I believe Australia, as a country, has, proportionally, one of the highest carbon footprints anywhere in the world. And, as a consequence, I believe we have a moral responsibility to lead the debate on carbon pollution reduction and take the necessary steps to achieve that. We have a responsibility to help rectify the damage that we have all done. We have a responsibility to our future generations. We have a responsibility to take the necessary steps to reduce our carbon pollution. We have a responsibility to other nations on this planet. We have a responsibility to lead, and that is what I believe these bills will do. I believe that advanced countries like Australia have a moral responsibility to lead on climate change. Corangamite, my own seat, faces some very substantial risks. Corangamite has hundreds of kilometres bordering the ocean. We have the Great Ocean Road. The Great Ocean Road links coastal community to coastal community, and was built by 3,000 servicemen who had returned from the First World War. Modelling shows that sea level rise driven by climate change will see the Great Ocean Road breached in place after place. Other parts of my seat, such as the Bellarine Peninsula, Queenscliff, Ocean Grove and Point Lonsdale, also face very significant inundation challenges if we do not meet the challenges of climate change. In addition to that, we also have some very significant environmental places within my seat, such as the Otway Ranges, the lakes district in western Victoria and our magnificent volcanic plains. These assets now are at far greater risk due to fire, and over the last 10 years we have seen a large number of those lakes drying because of drought. And we do know that climate change will lead to further periods of dryness and drought. Our flora and fauna and our people are also at further risk due to climate change. In Corangamite we have a very substantial farming community. The farming communities now face very significant challenges because of climate change and drought. Less rain is posing enormous challenges to our farmers and our farming communities. The CPRS will allow farmers to generate additional income. It will enable farmers to take meaningful steps in producing an income that will be good for our environment and good for their families. I think this is very significant and good news for our farmers. Unfortunately, the Liberal Party wants to take away from farmers this opportunity to derive additional income for their families. The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists reported that the Leader of the Opposition's con job would cost farmers. Farmers in my electorate do not need any more costs imposed on them. They need ways in which they can generate sustainable income and make a difference. The Labor government's CPRS will deliver new income streams for farmers. The minister and the whole Rudd government are aware of the need to protect jobs in dealing with climate change. Farming jobs, the jobs of Alcoa workers, the jobs of Shell workers and the jobs of the cement industry workers in my electorate are all very important. The Rudd government's CPRS is carefully calibrated to protect their jobs so that they can continue to participate in a low carbon economy with a lower carbon footprint. We also need to make sure that we have a vibrant tourism industry, particularly of course in my seat of Corangamite. Climate change is one of the biggest risks to the tourof ism industry in my region. It is the primary reason why we have to act. The consequences of Black Saturday are only just becoming clearer for the tourism industry, particularly as areas like the Otway national park become more threatened by wildfire events because of climate change. If we compare that to Abbott's con job, the government has got the balance right. We have recognised in this legislation that there are trade-exposed industries. We have recognised the need for industry transition. And we are providing the industry assistance that is required and the time which is required for them to be able to participate. These bills balance the overriding need to act on climate change with the need to put in place the mechanisms that will allow our industries to adjust to a lower carbon footprint. Unlike the Liberal Party's con job, we have thorough policy that will help to lead us through the challenge of climate change. My region, the greater Geelong region, is showing leadership on climate change. We are providing certainty through the mechanisms in this bill. A world carbon market is inevitable and it will be created. We are readying our country with some well-calibrated legislationlegislation that will future-proof us. This bill has clear aims and clear targets-unlike the opposition leader's con job. The government's commitment on targets is an unconditional commitment to reduce our carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020. This is the most important legislation that this parliament will have to deal with. This is about how we turn around the terrible legacy that unfettered carbon pollution has left usa legacy that now threatens to engulf island nations within our Asia-Pacific region through sea level rise; that threatens to decimate biodiversity; that is threatening human life, creating fire, storm and flooding events unprecedented ferocity and scale; and that will leave future generations the question of why we have not acted in this place. On the other side of the chamber, of course, we only see a policy con job. Their policy is nothing short of a joke. Their policy will not cut emissions. Their policy will cost Australian families. I urge those members on the other side that get the need to act on climate change to support these bills. Stand up for what you know is right. These are defining bills. These will be the bills that future generations judge our generation on. These will be bills that future parliaments will judge this parliament on. As I have said before, I am very proud of the efforts that Minister Wong and this government have gone to to get the balance right. We are now a world away from the shameful Howard years. We cannot let policy con jobs continue to set our climate change debate. This is Australia saying we are up for the challenge. This is Australia saying we will act. This is Australia saying we are leadbe. ers on climate change policy. For those reasons, I commend these bills to the House.",119
144,Mr RANDALL,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"Canning) (7.24 pm)This is now the third time that I have spoken on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation, and I welcome the opportunityin the debate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and cognate billsonce again to call the Labor government scheme what it really is: a great, huge new tax. As I have mentioned in my previous speeches, an effective and responsible approach to tackling climate change is needed, and that is exactly what the coalition has proposed. We will support and encourage direct action, unlike the great big new forward three times by the Prime Minister, which will cost jobs, drive up inflation, inhibit business growth and investment and hit household budgets. The government's motives are purely political; we know that. Australia accounts for only 1.4 per cent of the world's CO2 emissions and is one of only a handful of countries meeting their Kyoto targets. Just to put this in perspective, both the government's plan and the coalition's plan will cut emissions by five per cent. For $40 billion, though, the government will reduce Australia's contribution to global emissions from 1.4 per cent to 1.3309 per cent, cutting our contribution by only 0.07 per cent, not a wise investment when you consider that the coalition can achieve the same result for a fraction of the price-in fact, less than 10 per cent of the price, at $3.2 billion. Mr Rudd wanted to lock Australia into this reckless scheme before Copenhagen. Australia should breathe a sigh of relief and look at how that turned out. If Mr Rudd had had his way, households would be feeling the pain of an ETS when there is clearly no global consensus and most likely never will It is true that per capita Australia is one of the higher emitters, but it should not be surprising; we have a strong manufacturing and industrial sector, we are a strong economy and of course we can expect to have higher emissions than, say, Third World countries such as Burma. This plan is the equivalent of raising the GST by almost three per cent, creating an enormous government slush fund. It will have the same history as the petrol parity pricing scheme, which was introduced in 1977 because of an apparent oil shortage and which aimed to ensure further exploration and ensure supplies. But, in reality, such schemes do not create a culture of investtax put ment but a huge government money pit, massive revenues that are administered by a huge government bureaucracy. Governments never give all the money back; they skim and use it for their own purposes. In the case of parity pricing, they now treat that as revenue. Labor's ETS would hurt exactly those people Mr Rudd centred his election strategy on during the 2007 election campaign, the working families. In fact, you do not hear him talking about working families much these days because he has put so many out of work. They have every right to feel betrayed by the Prime Minister, who vigorously pursues his plan to drive up the cost of living. There is no finite figure on Labor's action. There are no answers as to how much costs really could go up on everyday items like bread and milk. We at least know that electricity would soar by almost 20 per cent, a horrifying reality for ordinary Australians who are already burdened by a 15 per cent price hike this year and are facing the prospect of more. Evidence shows that a working couple earning $140,000 with two or three dependent kids would be $620 worse off under the ETS. These figures get worse. Single-income families bringing in $120,000 would be $950 worse off every year. Labor said they would give the money back. Compensation which the government cannot exactly explain or calculate will be of no comfort to the 120,000 workers in regional Australia who will lose their jobs. There are no answers to the most basic questions. The Minister for Ageing cannot detail the impact on a pensioner's costs of living, and the small business minister laughed off a genuine question about electricity costs for dairy farmers. Not even those opposite trying to sell the scheme to the Australian public understand it. Mr Rudd continues to say, ‘Well, it's very complex.' Every time he gets bogged down on a figure or an explanation, he says, ‘Oh, but it's complex.' He is basically saying, ‘Well, you wouldn't understand; I understand because I'm quite intelligent, but you wouldn't understand because it is so complex.' There are no answers to the most basic questions, as I said. The feeling in the electorate is one of frustration. People want to do their bit for the environment, but they do not want to get slugged with a massive tax that will have little impact on the environment and will ship their jobs and emissions overseas. Let us put it into perspective. Labor's allows polluters to pay to pollute. This tax that they want to put on industry will not reduce carbon in the atmosphere by one tonne. They will say, ‘Well, the incentive is that, if we charge them all this extra money, they'll stop their emissions.' These are the people, as we continually hear, that keep the lights on, and they are not going to stop keeping the lights on; they are just going to pass the costs on. So, at the end of the day, this supposedly so complex program that the Prime Minister wants to introduce is not complex at all; it is just going to make the polluters pay to pollute. While the rest of the world changes its tune, our own Prime Minister pursues his massive tax. The Canadian Prime Minister is on the record as saying that developing technology is the answer, not setting targets. United States President Barack Obama has backed away from a cap-and-trade scheme and is considering direct action similar to that which the coalition is planning. Perhaps when President Obama comes to Australia next month he might persuade Prime Minister Rudd to his way of thinking during his visit-though I doubt it. The world's biggest emitters-the United States, China, Japan, India and Russia-do not have emissions trading schemes. As Christian Kerr reported in the Australian this week, New Zealand is the only country outside of the EU to adopt what is essentially a carbon tax, plunging New Zealanders, whose emissions reductions will make no difference on a global scale, into debt as fuel prices rise by at least 3.5c a litre and electricity costs soar. I think it is a conservative estimate by the New Zealand government that the average household will only be $165 a year worse off compared to the figures I have just told you about with ours. Interestingly, that was brought in by the preplan vious Labour government in New Zealand and has not been enacted to this date by the current government. They have backed away from it as well. Why wouldn't they? The rest of the world is not doing it. The biggest emitters are not doing it. They do not even want to commit to it. They saw what happened in Copenhagen: the Chinese stared down the rest of the world on a whole range of issues and our Prime Minister was left outside in the cold trying to look useful. The best place to start on this issue is at home. Our policy is one of practical and cost-effective measures that will reduce emissions by the same five per cent by 2020 proposed by the government but, as I have already outlined, at a fraction of the price. Obviously this is a no-brainer. Why would any government choose a massive tax and cost to jobs when the same outcomes can be achieved more cheaply and efficiently? One can only surmise that the $120 billion slush fund is too much to turn down for a government that loves to squander money. The coalition aims to look after the Australian envithe ronment first, and in doing so will focus on its natural resources: soil and sun. I recently met with Justin Byatt, a family poultry farmer from my electorate, about a company called Agriboost. Agriboost is an organisation newly established to investigate the alternative uses of chicken manure, which has focused on power generation to date. But Agriboost plans to move forward and develop other opportunities. It intends form partnerships with the soil amendment industry and to apply new technologies, including biochar to broiler waste, to improve soil quality and fertility. Farming is the backbone of the Australian industry so there is no better place to start than encouraging farmers to use soil carbon measures. This is real, direct action by industry. Australia's hot, dry climate makes it an ideal candidate for solar power. With less than one per cent of power currently coming from solar energy we can-and should-do better. We will invest in solar panels for one million Australian roofs by 2020. I repeat: one million roofs around Australia could have solar panels on them. Local residents will welcome the $1,000 rebate for either solar panels or solar hot water systems. As I drive around my electorate it is abundantly clear that most houses have a TV aerial or a satellite dish on them. There is plenty of room on these roofs for solar panels, which will reduce the energy used and feed power back into the grid. Can you imagine, during a hot time in summer in Perth, when we have brownouts and blackouts because of the huge draw on the power stations through air conditioners going during the 43-degree days which we have had recently, that this would not happen if we had most of the roofs on the houses and on the industrial estates of Western Australia feeding a massive amount of electricity back into the grid on these hot days? It is only sensible, but too sensible for government to take on board. It is probably too simple. Simple inventions are generally the best. Sliced bread was simple but it was one of the best things that we have come across. Further, the green army will plant an astonishing 20 million trees by 2020 to re-establish urban forests and green corridors and to support large-scale renewable energy generation and emerging technologies. The to coalition is serious about making a real difference, not symbolic gestures. We have to encourage business and families to make a change, rather than taxing them for doing it. We are into incentives; they are into taxing them. Our reward based approach could be as simple as planting more trees, or more elaborate technology advances for bigger businesses. I read with interest an article in the Australian Financial Review last November about the Mountaineer coal plant in West Virginia and its massive experiment in clean coal. It aims to be the first to capture the fugitive emissions of a fully operational coal plant. The Mountaineer plant generates enough electricity to power a small city but in turn emits eight million tonnes of C02 emissions a year. Its sequestering of carbon underground is an expensive pilot on a massive scale. Projects like this support local jobs and result in real advances, not massive taxes. In Australia we have the Maitland plant working on clean coal technology. This is just another example of real action on our own shores, considering Australia gets about 80 per cent of its energy from coal. Direct action is a responsible and proactive approach to keeping local jobs and the local economy strong, and it is supported by industry. Canning is home to Alcoa, BHP and Newmont, who make up the largest individual employers in my electorate. With BHP's Worsley Alumina having a capacity of four million tonnes annually, it is BHP's biggest carbon emitter in Australia, and a reckless scheme would cost many local jobs. There has been a $3.5 billion investment in the Boddington goldmine, which I attended last week when it was officially opened by the Premier. It will be the largest goldmine in Australia and will be bigger than the Kalgoorlie Super Pit. It will support around 1,000 local jobs and produce about a million ounces of gold a year. Mr Rudd wants to risk these jobs with this scheme of his-this penalty on industry. I expect that local governments and schools will take up the coalition's million roofs initiative. The City of Mandurah in my electorate has already installed solar photovoltaic system on the roof of the Falcon e-library that generates around 3,720 kilowatts of electricity and saves approximately four tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions every year. Similar projects will be embraced throughout Canning. It is all part of the direct action needed at the grassroots level to make a difference. Imagine what a million roofs and solar cities would do. That is what I really call direct action. Scare campaigns about climate change have been well fronted, but there is a growing shift, and despite this the Prime Minister remains adamant about locking Australia into a plan that could be based on suspect data. There is no doubt in the world that since Copenhagen there has been a shift on this whole issue not only internationally but also in Australia. We have seen that even in the latest Nielsen poll today. At a local level, I have people coming to me, emailing me and writing to me when they did not come to me before, saying, ‘Don't allow us to get sucked into this; don't allow us to have this as a millstone around our necks forever.' So what is really causing global warming? Is it really carbon emissions or is it something else? In his book The Real Global Warming Disaster, Christopher Booker contends that, rather than the apocalyptic scenarios promised by Al Gore, the real disaster of global warming will be the strangulation of the world economy by measures imposed by governments around the world based on false information. Eminent academics offer some persuasive arguments about the science and truth behind global warming. Even the head of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is under fire now. We know that Rajendra Pachauri's credibility is under attack after the IPCC inaccurately claimed that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035 if nothing were done about climate a 2.1 kilowatt change. He was outed. I have spoken with prominent scientists and recently met with climate change experts Joanne Nova and David Evans, who maintain that the climate change alarm is founded on information that is fundamentally flawed. In the last 100 years the climate has warmed only about 0.7 degrees. In fact, in the last decade the climate, some say, has cooled. In periods throughout history there have been warm spells-none warmer than the medieval period. Long-term weather forecasts are impossibly inaccurate; as experts say, a forecast for 30 or 40 years in the future is not a forecast. No-one can deny that global carbon emissions have risen with industrial growth since the First World War. Carbon is reportedly at higher levels than at any time in the last 650,000 years. But, if you accept the fact that the planet has not warmed dramatically during a time when carbon emissions have peaked, the conclusion is that our emissions may not be responsible for the warming of the planet. Dr David Evans says that the shift in views came in 1999 and by 2007: … the evidence was pretty conclusive that carbon played only a minor role and was not the main cause of the recent global warming. As Lord Keynes famously said, “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” In the last 20 years, the world has spent $50 billion on global warming research and has not found hard evidence that carbon emissions cause global warming. Joanne Nova puts it simply: Everything hinges on this one question. If carbon dioxide is not a significant cause, then carbon sequestration, cap-and-trade, emissions trading, and the Kyoto agreement are a waste of time and money. … … … Hoping for a good outcome while acting on something for all of the wrong reasons is called policy-by-accident. I am by no means an expert, but the reality is that there is conjecture about what really causes the planet to continue to warm. Despite this, the Prime Minister remains gungho about locking Australia into a scheme which will have no impact on global emissions, will cost Australians dearly in jobs and income and will send the pollution offshore. Can you imagine if something like Alcoa in my electorate were to be penalised as this system would do to them? They would quite easily go to somewhere like Indonesia, which does not have the same rigorous checks and balances on emissions. First of all, we would export our jobs. Secondly, we would export our incomes through the aluminium produced and the taxes that the workers would be paying as they earned. Worse than that, we would export the pollution, because the Indonesians, as I said, do not have the same rigour in their environmental assessments. As a result, this exporting of pollution into a country which does not have to comply, because countries like Indonesia are called ‘developing countries' and do not have the same obligations, is quite irresponsible for Australia to do. The former head of the National Climate Change Centre, William Kininmonth, said last year that the basis of the Rudd scheme is: … an unsustainable hypothesis that dangerous global warming will be an outcome of continued burning of fossil fuels … Yes, we need to look after the environment and explore alternative energies. But the point is that we may not have all the answers about climate change, and should that not be enough to take the direct action that avoids economic suicide for Australia? The choice is clear and the public is starting to realise this. It is not so complex, Prime Minister Rudd. The public now are starting to understand that we have a solution of direct action. We do things by recharging our soils. We are going to have a program of planting more trees. We will have a million solar roofs around Australia putting electricity back in. The Labor Party just wants to give us a great big tax and not reduce one tonne of carbon in our atmosphere.",122
145,Mr FITZGIBBON,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"Hunter) (7.43 pm)I say at the outset that I have no intention tonight of making a contribution arguing the science of climate change. I am not going to get into whether or not the globe is warming or, indeed, whether humans are making a contribution to that warming. As far as Parliament House is concerned, that debate has been had. It has come to some conclusions. No major party in this place believes now that action is not required on climate change-not the Labor Party, not the Liberal Party and certainly not the Greens. So there is no doubt that government action now is inevitable. But let us go back one step. Major parties in this place agree that there is a problem and action is required. The next question is this: is this action a priority for an Australian government or are there bigger and greater priorities for the government of the day at this point in time? We know that the Leader of the Opposition believes it is a priority because he now has a plan to spend some $3 billion of taxpayers' money on his so-called direct action method. We know the government certainly has a plan. We know the government places a high priority on the need to act on climate change, and it is that plan we are debating for a third time this evening and no doubt will be debating for a little while yet. So we know the pollies have come to a conclusion. The question then is: are the pollies right? I think it is fair to say, based on the polls, that the politicians are reflecting broader community view. All the opinion polls tell us that the majority of Australians want their government to act on climate change. Even my electorate of Hunter is an electorate in which I believe the majority of people want the government to act on climate change. It is well known in this place that my electorate is one very relevant to this debate this evening, an electorate in which the coal mining, power generation and aluminium-smelting sectors are very, very prominent. If this debate had been taking place five years ago, I am not sure I would have been able to stand here claiming that a majority of people in my electorate supported government action on climate change, but there has been a big shift in my electorate in recent years. I will share a few anecdotes. A few years ago a coal mining company was proposing a new coalmine, the Anvil Hill mine, in part of my electorate. At the site where the Anvil Hill mine was proposed, we had a protest action that people described as a picket line-not quite the correct description but it will do. Standing on the picket line on a regular basis were Hunter coalminers, people then currently employed in the coal mining industry, protesting against this mine and its potential environmental effects. I remember once being asked by one of our major newspapers whether I could organise a photograph of a third generation mining family, a family in which grandfather, father and son had been involved in the mining industry. That newspaper wanted to run this picture as a way of portraying what might be the threats to coalminers in electorates like mine. I could not find one, because coalminers I talked to did not really feel comfortable about associating themselves with an all-out attack on the idea of addressing climate change. They wanted to go with the majority. They understood-the third generation pera son was the guy I was turning talking to that times had changed and it was past time that governments started doing something about the environment generally but climate change in particular and all its threats. The coal mining union in my electorate was well ahead of the Labor Party on this issue, long before the party advocated the emissions trading scheme or at least some carbon constraint, notwithstanding the potential impact on coal mining, because the coal mining union believed that there was no future for coal mining in the long term if the industry did not act to become more sustainable. So there are big changes in electorates like mine, partly of course driven by demographic change. Younger people tend to be more conscious of environmental concerns than older Australians are. As those younger people continue to wash into the system, attitudes change. So, for all these good reasons, government has decided to act. I said I did not want to argue the science, because there is a general consensus in this place in any case that the risks are too great not to act. There are plenty of scientists who will tell us that global warming is not real and certainly man's contribution is not a factor. But I am a great believer in the precautionary principle: if in doubt, act. Australians spend about $3 billion on household insurance every year, mainly to cover them for unlikely but catastrophic events like fire. I not know what the percentages are, but I suspect that in the broader scheme of things very few houses in Australia burn down each year. But Australians decide to spend that $3 billion or so each year in aggregate because they know it is a small price to pay given the enormous impact a fire could have on them, their family and their family's future. What are the risks in the broader sense when we talk about climate change? They are drought, heatwaves, storms, cyclones and rising sea levels, to name a few. Under some scenarios, the consequences could extend right to competition amongst people for water, food and other resources. For some island states, including those in the South Pacific, we know the threat is potentially existential. It is clear that the parliament and the Australian people have come to the conclusion that the risks are too great to sit back and do nothing. So what do we do? In just under four weeks time, I will have been in this place for some 14 years, as is the case with my comrade from the opposition sitting at the table, the member for Dunkley. My staff advise me that this is my 417th speech in this place. Few debates over that long period of time and during my many contributions in this place have been more important than the debate we are having this evening. But, in addition to that, never in those 14 years have I seen such political opportunism from an opposition. That might be a big statement, but I have seen political opportunism in this place, on a regular basis, from those flying all sorts of colours. I saw it in the mid-1990s, when the then Labor opposition opposed the GST. In hindsight, I think that was a questionable decision. Labor saw a political opportunity and exploited it. There were some differences, of course. The biggest difference of all was that the majority of Labor MPs do held strong convictions. Many of them, if not the majority of them, did not accept that the GST could be introduced without having an adverse impact on their largely working class constituencies. I concede that the GST, a broad based consumption tax, had become a necessary and inevitable thing for Australia, but strong convictions and beliefs were held. By contrast, this is highly doubtful on the other side of politics. We certainly know that, in the recent leadership ballot, the overwhelming majority of MPs voted for a candidate who was dedicated to taking action on climate change. They were committed not to ‘direct action', as the now Leader of the Opposition calls it, but to some form of carbon constraint or, more likely, some form of market based mechanism. We know that the majority of those on the opposition benches who have spoken today are not speaking genuinely but are on the path to political opportunism. We also know that there is a difference because the opposition, having negotiated with the government, last year agreed to support the CPRS, agreed to support the government's approach to addressing climate change. To his great credit, the member for Wentworth was in here today standing by his commitment to the government, standing by the deal he struck with the government, standing here arguing for an ETS and making it clear to the parliament that he will stand by that deal all the way to crossing the floor in this place. All credit goes to him for doing so. And then we had the member for Warringah. Of course, Tony Abbott knows a political opportunity when he sees one. On many occasions he has demonstrated a willingness to exploit an opportunity when it comes along, and he is certainly grabbing the opportunity with both hands in this case. But there is another big difference between what Labor did on the GST back in the mid-1990s and what the opposition are doing today. The risks involved here are much different. The risk of a GST not going through did have some mediumto long term effects. As I said, there was an inevitable shift to a broad based consumption tax as the wholesale tax base narrowed and our services sector grew. But the risk in this case extends to all those things I mentioned earlier, including the existential threat for small island communities, and creates enormous uncertainty for Australian businesses. At least Labor was consistent with the GST, which is something we certainly have not seen from the opposition benches on the question of the CPRS. We know that the Libs support carbon constraint. There can be no doubt about that. The Liberal Party have a history of support for the free market and for market responses, and I acknowledge that. Certainly in recent decades that has been the position of the Liberal Party. It has not always been the case. If you go back a bit further, they were very strongly under the influence of the National Party. But in the last two or three ades the Liberal Party have been pretty committed to the market and to market responses and to allowing the market to deal with these issues. So it defies belief that the Liberal Party, having acknowledged that there is a need to act on climate change, now believe that this direct action fiasco is the right path, as opposed to a market based mechanism. I do not believe that for a minute. John Howard believed in a market based mechanism. We know that the member for Flinders believes in a market based mechanism. He said so in a thesis he wrote as a university student. Peter Shergold, who did John Howard's work for him, believed in a market based mechanism. And so do I-I want to make that clear. So what is this market mechanism? This is where this debate is confusing for the Australian public. They are still wondering what this is all about. The opposition's decision to belatedly run interference on the CPRS is making the government's task of communicating that message and explaining the CPRS to the Australian people all the more difficult. For all its complexities, the scheme is really pretty simple. It is complex when you get down to the detail, but at the end of the day it is all pretty simple. The CPRS-or an ETS-is all about putting a cap on the amount of pollution that businesses can emit. In this case, we are talking about 1,000 businesses out of many millions of businesses in this country-for example, power stations, aluminium smelters and fuel refiners. If they cannot stay within that cap, they pay a penalty or have to buy additional emissions permits. That is the basic thrust of the thing. Simplifying it over the longer term as we emerge-that is the system. Business can do three things. It can absorb the costs into its profit margin, or its bottom line; it can find ways to reduce its emissions; or of course it can pass the cost of that burdec- den onto the consumer. We all welcome the fact that, in a competitive economy, passing it on is not that easy. Certainly absorbing it into the bottom line is not a good option for business. This is about the other option, and that is helping business to reduce its emissions. The extent to which business will pass on the costs we think will be between one and 1.5 per cent in inflationary terms, and of course the government will compensate consumers for that change. The tables are there for all to see on the government's website. Any family, any individual, can go into those cameos and work out exactly how they will be affected by the CPRS and the extent to which they will be compensated. We are also helping business in the transition. Energy intensive trade exposed industries will get massive amounts of assistance to help them through the transitionary period. Indeed, all the revenue the government raises under the CPRS goes back to compensation-compensating people, compensating families, compensating businesses through the transition period. The opposition mischievously describes the ETS as a tax. It is not a tax; it is a charge on heavy polluters and it is an incentive for them to drive their emissions down, and of course the revenue from that charge will be used to compensate businesses and families, as I suggested. The government's CPRS package extends well beyond an ETS. We are heavily investing in the renewables sector and other lowemissions technologies. We are investing heavily on the demand side, helping Australian households reduce their energy consumption, reducing demand on that side of the equation. When it is all said and done, for all its complexities in the detail, it is a pretty ple proposition. It is the most efficient way of dealing with the challenges we collectively face. It is time the opposition put its political opportunism aside and worked with the government on these issues. The government has demonstrated in the past a preparedness to talk and to negotiate. That is why we are dealing with CPRS mark two. I have no doubt that, to get these very important matters through the parliament, the government is prepared to talk further. But it is absolutely apparent that Tony Abbott, having gone completely in the other direction with his so-called direct action plan, has no intention of indulging in any more talk. The member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition, has no intention of further negotiating on the CPRS, because the Leader of the Opposition has one thing in mind and one thing only, and that is the 2010 election. I can say to the opposition leader that, just as Labor lost some credibility on the GST debate, he will lose environmental credibility and economic credibility and he will pay a heavy price in the medium to long term for his political opportunism.",126
146,Mr BILSON,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"Dunkley) (8.03 pm)The member for Hunter is someone with whom I have a friendship and for whom I feel some fondness, and I felt uneasy as he struggled to come to terms with what is actually before the parliament today. He followed the tradition of all the Labor speakers on this Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill and distinctly avoided what is actually in the bill. We did not hear any defence of the policy approach. We did not hear any explanation of the policy settings within the bill and the way they have been calibrated or how in fact this bill may actually achieve the goal that it states it aims to achieve. You do not hear any of that. You do not hear any of those Labor members come into this parliament to debate their so-called Carbon Pollution Reduction simScheme Bill and actually discuss the bill. What you get instead is a rich ensemble of platitudes and distractions and false debates, where they describe what the opposition is trying to achieve in a most inaccurate and disparaging way and then seek to have a go at it, without actually turning their mind to the bill before the parliament. They might think that the bill itself is not worth debating in here. That might be one reason they do not address it. They might also think that, because the bill has not changed despite the whole context within which this debate is being carried out having changed, there is no need to actually describe the aspects of the bill gain. Or they might be honest with themselves and ask, given that the international context has shifted and the debate is alive and well, what is the most appropriate response, and recognise that many of the propositions contained within the Rudd government's great big tax on anything and everything-and we hear the Labor Party describe it as the CPRS bill-really do not address new insights and new realities. It could be any one of those three things. What we can conclude is one single, undeniable thing: the Labor Party will not defend its own bill. It describes the subject of the bill as complex, almost like, ‘Don't worry about it; it is like the workings of an MRI; if you've got a bad knee go in and have one, no need to trouble yourselves with how it operates-it will all be right; leave it to the experts.' They say that makes it a simple proposition. I am not sure the Australian public believe that. I am not sure pious language from the Labor Party about how complex the whole thing is is a justification for not defending what the government is doing and explaining its actions. I do not think that will ring true with most members of the Australian public. I think the Australian public want to know what is in the Rudd government's great big tax on everything, this ETS bill known as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill. I think they want to know because they have learned through the debates over recent months that these are important issues at stake. I think the Australian public clearly understands that both sides of the parliament recognise that there is a need to take responsible action on climate change. I do not even think that there is a debate there any longer, despite the efforts of the Labor Party to resuscigreater. tate some lines of that kind. There is no lack of will or desire from the coalition to take action on climate change. The debate is about what sensible action is, what the wise action to take is, given the sentiment that spans this parliament of a willingness and a desire to take action on climate change. The Rudd Labor government and its Labor members do not even turn their minds to this legislation. Within the legislation it talks about applying a charge. This is where ‘the great big tax on everything' is an accurate description. It is not as the member for Hunter tried to describe before, where he actually stumbled into an explanation of the opposition's alternative strategy. No, it is not an idea where you penalise those who drop the ball and go backwards in their emissions performance; that is the opposition's idea. The proposition embodied in these bills is that you penalise everybody. Everybody is penalised, even the most energy-efficient abatement-sensitive activity, business or production process in our country. That will all be penalised. And those who are not so flash will be penalised as well. It is not only those who have dropped the ball, as the member for Hunter in his contribution would have you believe; everyone cops it through this CPRS. Everyone cops it and generates an enormous amount of revenue for the Rudd Labor government to share with those that it feels are its friends or that it feels obliged to help. It is noteworthy that even in this House the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Mr Tanner, comes in and tries to just bat away suggestions that this great big tax on everything actually amounts to an enormous impost on the Australian economy of $114 billion over the next nine years-that is right: $114 billion, 114 thousands of millions of dollars, over the next nine years-and then says the opposition's impact would be He bats away the concern that the opposition has highlighted of a $114 billion revenue-raising tax on everything and what that will do to the Australian economy, Australian households and Australian small businesses by saying: ‘No, don't trouble yourselves. Remember, this is complex. That is a very big number, but this is complex and you need only be concerned with the net cost to the government.' And he describes a lower figure. What is missed, though, is that the cost to the Australian nation, the Australian economy and the Australian community is undoubtedly $114 billion. That is undoubtedly the cost. Some of that will be given back, not on the basis of where it has been raised, because those newborn nouveau free marketeers across the chamber in the Labor Party have reconnected with concepts of market after saying that it was a horrible thing-according to the Prime Minister, some months ago. Now they have reconnected with the market. Of course, where those costs land does not accurately reflect where the money goes back. So people can be paying a great cost, a great share of that $114 billion, under Kevin Rudd's great big new tax, and they will not be getting commensurate compensation. We have heard in debates in this chamber today and last week how, so complex is this scheme, Rudd government ministers cannot even describe the impact on very credible, realistic and not very mysterious family types. That is deferred to the table, a broadbrush table which apparently is not enough for the Rudd ministers to give direct answers. Today we talked about another bearer of this great cost, that being the small business community, and why they are completely excluded from the compensation arrangements that seek to soften the harm and hardship caused by $114 billion of new taxes on the nation and on businesses over the next nine years. It is interesting that the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Dr Emerson, on the many, many occasions that this great big tax on everything has been debated in this parliament, has not once chosen to defend it. Even today, when I asked him a question about the real-life impact on a drycleaner at Queanbeyan, he could not turn his mind to that. Instead, as is his wont, he had a go at everybody-a little bit of theatre but no answers, which is a very awkward way of confessing to the fact that there is no compensation for small businesses. They are not a part of this $114 billion revenue-raising exercise over the next nine years. They are not a part of a portion of that coming back to those paying most of the burden. This is a scheme that punishes everybody regardless of their level of emissions performance. If you are doing better than many, you are punished less. If you are a major emitter, you are punished substantially. If you are a small business, you are punished, and there is no relief for that financial pain through the compensation system. And, when asked today to explain that, the smallbusiness minister again failed to address the design of the scheme and why small businesses have been excluded from compensation. It is not as if that question would have been a great surprise. I have repeatedly highlighted the failure of the small-business minister to stand up for the constituency he is supposed to represent. I have repeatedly highlighted how small businesses are extremely worried and concerned about the impact of the Rudd Labor government's great big tax on everything, the ETS, and why they have been excluded from compensation. I have repeatedly highlighted how, even on the government's modelling, where it seeks to identify the electricity cost increase, the electricity cost increase is seven per cent in the first year, accumulating on top of that a further 12 per cent. That is 19.84 per cent, let us say 20 per cent, in the first two years. That is the electricity cost. A small business or a family will know what that electricity cost increase means. It means increased pressure on the costs of living and increased pressure on the costs of doing business. What is not in those figures is the increase in energy costs embedded in all of the inputs of the supply chain for what households consume and what businesses produce and provide, as we saw today with the dry-cleaning business-very significant electricity costs and a $3,000 penalty for doing business under the Rudd Labor government's great big tax on everything. What of the energy costs embedded in their processes, in the machinery they use and in the energy they consume? We know the energy sector is an enormous consumer of electricity in this country. Those costs will run all the way through and accumulate at each stage of production. It is not just about the direct impact on the cost of electricity. Electricity is embedded in everything that goes into production, systems and services. There will be increases in input and supply chain costs for small businesses and in the cost of consumption for households. Householders will look at a 20 per cent increase in their energy costs and be terrifiedand rightly so-as those cost pressures just keep mounting under the Rudd Labor government. They will be worried about 20 per cent on top of escalating energy costs. I have described how energy is an enormous cost input for the water sector and how alreadyspiralling water costs will increase. These are the necessities of life. Families will soon know that energy is embedded in everything that goes on in this country at one stage or another and that, unlike the GST, which is taken out of business inputs and applied only to the last point of sale or transfer, costs will rise at each stage of the production process. The Rudd Labor government are trying to force this great big tax on everything on the Australian public again and again, despite people's cautions, worries and concerns about its impact. The Rudd Labor government cannot hear. They just keep forcing this down people's throats, while people are telling them that prices are going to escalate at every stage of consumption and every stage of their business processes and inputs, leading to a far greater price penalty at the end of the day. This is why leading organisations like the Australian Retailers Association have again cautioned the Rudd Labor government and challenged it to say what their great big tax on everything will really mean for the costs of goods in retail outlets. That is why COSBOA have pleaded with, not just asked, the government to turn its mind to the impact on the small business community. They have highlighted the exclusion of small businesses from the compensation arrangements and that there is a need to have a look at the punishing impact of this great big tax on everything on all in the business community and in the general community. It is difficult to accept that some households will get compensation and large businesses will get support from the Rudd Labor government to ease the pain of its great big tax on everything but that there is no mention being made of support for small business. That was highlighted again today when the minister for small business, Dr Emerson, again could not bring himself to address the specific issue of why he and his government will allow small business to cop this great big tax on everything if it is allowed through without any compensation. That is why the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: CPRS deal: Small business left exposed. They have conducted some really credible research. Castalia Strategic Advisors have identified the costs of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme on Australia's small and medium sized businesses. Has the Rudd Labor government done anything to turn its mind to this input and analysis? Of course not. All it can do is come back into this place and try to jam through the very same flawed and friendless great big tax on everything, the CPRS proposition that got rejected previously by the parliament. Why do they do this? Why do they insult the intelligence of the Australian public, the clear message of concern from the Australian community and the outrage of those in the small business community by simply stumping up the same old thing? They do it because this is a government that learns nothing. It is a government that will not learn from its experiences and will not recognise its mistakes. It is a government that uses objective analysis so selectively that, rather than look dispassionately at a problem and what strategies might be implemented, they decide what they want to do and then shop around for some kind of information to back it up. That is not evidence based policy; that is policy in search of some evidence to back it up. Again, this is what we are seeing in chamber today. I am surprised that the Rudd Labor government is not aware of the work that was carried out by the City of Greater Bendigo about the price penalty that is already being paid by non-city electricity users because of higher electricity transmission charges outside our capital cities. Small businesses and families living in non-city areas are already paying more for their electricity through higher network charges. The figures range from 20 per cent to as much as 43 per cent more, depending on what state you live in. They are going to get another slug in the neck from this great big tax on everything. We have not seen any comprehensive modelling about how the energy price increases will work their way through the different activities, production and cost structures of businesses in the economy. We are told what the direct electricity costs will be but we have not seen how the costs will wash through every stage of production and every step of the business chain. Those living outside our capital cities are already paying a premium for their electricity and they are going to be paying again. So what does a drycleaner in a regional centre do when faced with no compensation because the Rudd Labor government does not care-small business can just cop itand already facing price penalties because of higher transmission charges embedded in their electricity costs? They cannot pick up their business and move it to a capital city. Drycleaners need to be close to their customers. Those businesses will have an additional cost burden that will compromise their capacity to employ, undermine their viability and invariably mean higher costs to consumers. The very cost-of-living pressures that are already troubling the vast majority of households in Australia are almost being placed on steroids by the Rudd Labor government this through this great big tax on everything. So that is what this bill is about. I thought someone needed to talk about the specifics of the bill, because the Rudd Labor government members will not defend it. They are just going to use platitudes and talk in broad concepts about what they are trying to do. They will say: ‘Isn't this a great idea? It's all too complex to explain to you, but it's a simple proposition at the end of the day; just go with what Kevin Rudd wants you to do.' The opposition does not believe that that is a sensible way forward and has mapped out a far more direct, affordable and appropriate strategy. It is a strategy that reflects the fact that the global situation does matter and that that situation has changed, that there is a need to respond to those circumstances but to take practical and positive action on climate change. As I said at the beginning, there is no lack of will or want on the part of the coalition to take action. It is about what is wise action to take in the current environment. The coalition's plan for direct action on climate change-and I am pleased that my friend and colleague the member for Flinders is here; he is a significant author of this body of workactually will achieve the reductions in emissions for Australia that the Rudd government's great big tax on everything says it will achieve, but without the pain. The government model will cause pain that is not properly costed and modelled, that will run through every activity in this country. It is pain that starts with the cost of electricity. Wherever electricity is used in anything that goes on in our nation, that cost penalty will be there and will be built upon by further activity and further steps that add to the production process, to consumption and to the cost for households and consumers. The Rudd Labor government would be well served to have a good think about this. It has an exit strategy. That exit strategy is to concede that it has got it wrong and that the coalition's plan is more directly targeted and deserves support, not ridicule. (Time expired)",130
147,Ms OWENS,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and related bills. Climate change is perhaps a more important issue than any we have faced in many decades. Human activity is damaging our climate and the world needs to minimise the impact on future generations and our world. Listening to the member for Dunkley, I am reminded once again of how difficult this issue is, because it is not a cost-free issue. we do not act, there will be significant costs to future generations; if we do act, there will be costs now. In the political environment, where we face the people every three years, it is very easy to take an easy road and not act now. That is not something the government are prepared to do. We will meet our obligations to future generations. Given that there has been so much muddying of the waters lately, building a climate of fear and confusion around this issue, I thought that it would be worthwhile to go back to the basics, to the things that most of us-perhaps excluding members of the opposition-agree on. Firstly, climate change is real. That is a view backed by long standing science which has been extensively peer reviewed. The consensus view among scientists and governments around the world is that the evidence on warming is unequivocal, that average surface temperatures have risen by 0.74 degrees Centigrade in the last 100 years. Thirteen of the 14 warmest years on record occurred between 1995 and 2008. The projected global average warming to 2100 is around 1.1 to 6.4 degrees Centigrade, and the projection for sea level rises is up to 0.8 of a metre. More recent reports suggest that it may be higher. It is true that there are a small number of scientists who dispute the science. Around the world, a number of people without a scientific background have been swayed by that, including, it seems, many on the opposition benches. To some extent, I can understand it. The issue is scary; it really is. The impact that we have already had and the damage that we will do without action is scary. It is difficult to believe, and there are days when I would rather not believe it either. I have talked to scientists, too, who want the science to be disproved, who look almost with great longing at alternative opinions and hope for them to be true. Nobody in If their right mind wants climate change to be true, but look at the sheer number of scientists who support the science of climate change. The evidence is overwhelming and we are obliged to believe it, no matter how hard that may be. The world is warming. Human activity is contributing to that warming. Unless we act, increasing temperatures will have catastrophic consequences for our environment, our way of life and our standard of living. True, there are best-case and worse-case scenarios, but there is general consensus that even if we manage to hold temperature increases to two degrees, a target set at Copenhagen, it is most likely that there will still be serious changes to the climate that will impact significantly on our children. The world needs to act and the world has agreed to act. In fact, many years ago it agreed to act. As difficult as the change has been and will be, we are part of that world and must play our part, not as a follower that waits for the rest of world to tell us what to do. That is not what we do here. It is not what we have done historically on the major issues that have faced the world. We should act as a country looking after its own interests by participating at the forefront of the design of new methods for combating climate change, making sure that as the world moves forward we have our economic systems in place and sufficient investment to ensure that we have a strong future in a new, cleaner age. We need to act sooner rather than later. Actually, I suspect we needed to act a few years ago. I think the electorate understands that absolutely. We need to act because the costs of inaction are greater than the costs of action. Some of the impacts we are potentially facing without action are quite catastrophic for our nation. By 2070, up to 40 per cent more drought months are projected in eastern Australia and up to 80 per cent more in south-western Australia. Exports of key commodities could fall by up to 63 per cent in the next 20 years and by up to 79 per cent by 2050. Up to 247,000 residential buildings, worth around $63 billion, are at risk from sea inundation by 2100. Climate change related coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef may cost $37.7 billion in lost economic value and the loss of 60,000 jobs. Irrigated agricultural production in the Murray-Darling Basin will drop by over 90 per cent by 2100, and there are 90,000 people employed in agriculture in the basin. The Stern review found that if we do not act the overall cost will be equivalent to losing between five and 20 per cent of global GDP each year. They are all significant costs of inactionsomething that the opposition seems to fail to grasp. If these figures are alarming, that is because the consequences of not taking serious action on this are alarming. We should be frightened of inaction on this. We should be afraid of the economic costs of failing to act the and we should be ashamed of the lost years. While the costs of inaction are high, in environmental damage, in social costs and for our economic future, there are of course also costs associated with action. Unfortunately, in a catastrophe of this size there is no cost-free solution. But all serious reports indicate that the cost of delay is high. Treasury modelling shows that economies that defer action face long-term costs around 15 per cent higher than those that take action now. To put this into a global context, the International Energy Agency predicts",135
148,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCHEME AMENDMENT,"Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The honourable member for Parramatta will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Mrs Irwin-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Youth Allowance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House to the Rudd Government's changes to the workforce participation criteria for establishing independence under Youth Allowance by removing the following two eligibility criteria: that the recipient worked time for 15+ hours per week for two years or more since leaving school; and the recipient earned, in an 18-month period since leaving school, an amount equivalent to 75% of the maximum rate of pay (in 2009 this requires earnings of $19,532). The effect of this change is ity criteria for the Independent Youth Allowance will retrospectively require participants to complete 30 hours work per week over a 18/24 month period compared to earning $19,532 over 18 months. This means a student who has complied with the previous rules but not worked 30 hours per week will have lost the credit for their effort and must start again thus losing 2 years before commencing a University Course. These proposal further disadvantages young people whose place of residence is beyond daily commuting distance from a University and thus must fund their total accommodation costs over and above the other direct costs of such an education. That working 30 hours per week while attending University is virtually impossible in more intensive courses. We therefore ask the House to change the criteria so that rural and regional students are not disadvantaged. by Mrs Irwin (from 1,516 citizens) To the honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: NA NA We, the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled, that the definition of marriage as “a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life” is the foundation upon which our families are built and on which our society stands. To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex “marriage”, as proposed by the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill, would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially children. We, the undersigned citizens therefore request partthat the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009, be opposed. by Mrs Irwin (from 9,003 citizens) National School Chaplaincy Program To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of that eligibilthe House of Representatives: In Support of the National School Chaplaincy Program (NSCP) This petition of certain concerned citizens of Australia draws the attention of the house to the following: - The National School Chaplaincy Program, built on the excellent history of school chaplaincy in Australia, was introduced by the former Coalition Government in 2007/08 with a commitment of $165 million for its first three years. It was endorsed by Prime Minister Rudd who said “they (Chaplains) actually are providing the glue which keeps school communities rolling”. - The program offers pastoral care and spiritual guidance to all. Chaplains necessarily have religious beliefs which underpin their work. These beliefs are representative of the school communities the chaplains work in and they do not hinder chaplains from working with those of other beliefs or none. It operates in 1915 schools and enjoys strong Marriage support among principals, schools and in the community generally. - The Rudd Government (as at October 2009) has refused to confirm its ongoing support and funding for the program, despite the program's social benefits, sound administration and strong community support. We, the undersigned petitioners, request that the House urges the Rudd Government continue providing funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program in its current form. by Mrs Irwin (from 106 citizens) Trade: Live Animal Exports To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of undersigned citizens of Australia calls on the Australian Government to end the export of live animals from Australia to the Middle East. We the undersigned therefore call on the House of Representatives to ensure that the Australian government ends this trade and, in doing, restore Australia's reputation as a compassionate and ethical nation. by Mrs Irwin (from 36,068 citizens) Montevideo Maru To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the Country of … draws to the attention of the House the need to arrive at the truth of the events involving the Montevideo Maru and the fate of 845 POW and 208 internees from The Mandated Territory of New Guinea [now Papua New Guinea], said to be on board when the vessel was sunk. Your petitioners therefore request the House to support any investigation made to establish the truth relative to the identity of the ship torpedoed 1 July 1942 in the Philippine waters and alleged to have been the Montevideo Maru. by Mrs Irwin (from 239 citizens) Papua New Guinea To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of draws … to the attention of the House to have interested people expressing a desire to arrive at the truth of what happened during the Japanese occupation on the Island of New Britain, New Ireland, Watom Island and surrounding Islands in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea (now Papua New Guinea). Your petitioners therefore request the House to support an investigation by the relatives to request the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments to discover all burial places of service men and civilians still missing. The families of these men have a right to know where they are buried. by Mrs Irwin (from 156 citizens) National Marriage Day To the honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: PETITION TO DECLARE THE 13TH AUGUST NA We, the undersigned citizens of Australia draw to the attention of the House of Representatives, the undeniable correlations between family breakdown and the other pathways to poverty, educational failure, serious personal debt, crime, welfare dependency and addiction. In recognition of the positive contribution that intact, stable marriages make to the well-being of children and society we call upon the House of Representatives to demonstrate its support for marriage by declaring the 13th August each year as National Marriage Day. by Mrs Irwin (from 123 citizens) Hunting To the Honourable Speaker of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The World League for Protection of Animals, Inc End Recreational Hunting on Public Lands and Reserves We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Australia, draw to the attention of the House our united opposition to the inhumane practice of recreational hunting on public government lards. To permit, and by so doing, encourage shooting for pleasure is a completely anti-social and dangerous activity for governments to be endorsing. Recreational hunting on public lands not only endangers native fauna but also puts at risk public safety. In NSW, government officials have now permitted recreational hunting in some 372 public forests, covering more than 2 million hectares, with more public lands soon to be declared “open season”. The NSW Game Council is currently using tax payers' money to promote market and expand the interests of hunters groups. All the representatives on the Government's Game Council are prohunting interests, with most being active hunters themselves. Shooters' groups are presently overseeing their own dangerous activities on public lands. Bows and arrows and hunting dogs are sanctioned under current government legislation, permitting unacceptable cruelty to both introduced animals and native wildlife. We, the undersigned, seek the abolition of all hunting practices on public lands and reserves. by Mrs Irwin (from 190 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Gong To the Honourable Speaker of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House: 1. I have been made aware that Ms Sufang Zhang, mother of Kalgoorlie resident and Australian citizen Ms Kun (Suzy) Yang, was arrested by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for her spiritual belief of Falun Gong on July 4, 2008 just before the Olympic Games and now she has been sentenced without trial to a year's imprisonment in one of China's notorious forced labour camps. 2. I understand that Falun Gong (also known as Falun Dafa) is a peaceful meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance and since 1999 Falun Gong practitioners have been brutally persecuted by the CCP with more than 3,000 confirmed deaths due to torture in detention facilities in China. 3. I am also very concerned that recent investigations and reports by Canadian human rights lawyers David Matas and David Kilgour, European Parliament Vice President Edward MCMillan-Scott, and UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Dr Manfred Nowak, have alleged that the Chinese Communist Regime has overseen the fatal harvesting of organs from an estimated 41,500 unwilling Falun Gong practitioners for profit. (www.organharvestinvestigation.net/) We therefore ask the House to: “Help rescue Ms Zhang from a barbaric facility where torture is routine so she can be reunited with her daughter” by Mrs Irwin (from 2,138 citizens) Renewable Energy To the Honourable Speaker of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the house, that we believe not enough is being done to extend and expand ‘clean' energy and environmentally sustainable development. We therefore respectfully ask the house to work towards the immediate creation of an interconnected electricity grid with our closest international neighbours, and to ensure that this electricity grid is fed by significant renewable sources. by Mrs Irwin (from 49 citizens) Religious Persecution To the Honourable Speaker of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: Your petitioners humbly request the House to support all efforts by Muslims to have apostasy law reformed, so that Muslims who chose to leave their faith are no longer liable to any penalty but are free to follow their new convictions without fear, in accordance with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We also ask the House to use its influence on the Governments of countries where punishments for apostasy are part of the legal system, to encourage abolition. by Mrs Irwin (from 1 citizen) Pensions and Benefits To the Honourable Speaker of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the following facts and considerations: - the Newstart and sole-parent pension rates were not increased in the 2009 federal budget along with the disability support, single age and carer pension rates; - with the Newstart base rate at $456 per fortnight ($228 per week), it will be hard for unemployed persons to maintain morale and dignity while they search for new employment; - with the sole-parent base rate at $574.50 per fortnight ($287.25 per week), many sole parents will struggle to make ends meet and provide adequate material conditions for their children's well-being; - the twice-yearly indexation makes a minimal difference to the amount actually received by unemployed persons and sole parents. We therefore ask the House to ensure that the Newstart and sole-parent pension rates are reconsidered at the earliest possible opportunity, with a view to their being raised to realistic levels before the 2010 budget. by Mrs Irwin (from 71 citizens) To the Honourable Speaker and Members of House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents in the State of Western Australia points out to the House that Japan will be carrying out scientific whaling within the summer feeding grounds of endangered species of whales, such as humpbacks, southern right and blue whales that visit our shores in the southern hemisphere's winter. The feeding grounds include Australia's territories in Antarctica. Australia outlawed whaling in 1978 and introduced the Whale Protection Act in 1980. Japan's hunting of the species named and minke whales (not threatened) is unnecessary, inhumane and a threat to Australia's coastal, eco-tourist industries. We your petitioner's pray that the House will place economic sanctions on Japan until such time as they permanently desist from any form of whaling in Antarctica. by Mrs Irwin (from 156 citizens) Climate Change To the Honourable Speaker and Members of House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of citizens of Australia believe that the time to avert irreversible climate change is now. We therefore ask the House to: 1. Go to Copenhagen with a firm commitment to reduce carbon emissions by at least 40% by 2020, as current science indicates. This supports Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) call to limit global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 2. We ask that the Australian government formally recognise that without measurable, reportable and verifiable financing from developed countries, developing nations will not accept commitment to slow their emissions growth, and without effort from developing nations, Annexe 1 nations will not commit to ambitious emission reduction targets. 3. Therefore Australia must honour the commitment made in the Bali to contribute to fiWhaling nancing mitigation and adaptation in developing nations, especially our Pacific and South East Asian neighbours. This commitment should be in the order of 0.5% GDP which is approximately $4Billion per annum. by Mrs Irwin (from 842 citizens) Climate Change To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of the Environmentally Concerned Citizens of Orange draws attention to the House: Concerning legislation and strategies within the power of the Federal Government to urgently address the issue of climate change. We therefore ask the House to: - Ensure Australia leads the way for a fair and strong global treaty on climate change. - Set a target of keeping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere below 350 parts per million by reducing emissions by 40% by 2020. by Mrs Irwin (from 83 citizens) China: Child Adoption To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of Raymond Allan and Suzanne Dawn Dousset, citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House that whilst living in China, in 2002 we began a relationship with 10 year-old orphan Wang Xiang (later named Deborah). Deborah was abandoned at three weeks of age. She has minor physical disability of the hips and legs, and an intellectual age 3-4 years behind her physical age. Neither requires on-going treatment, nor either an impediment to her playing a role in Australian society. In 2005 we began fostering Deborah, and two attempts and an appeal to adopt her failed because of a 14 year-old age limit. This was in spite of our long-term relationship with her, and that she had been living with us since her 14th birthday. We have seven adult children and six grandchildren. We returned to Australia in August and currently have Deborah with us on a six-month tourist visa which expires on 11 February. This is marked with an 8503 restriction (Not to be extended), which we have unsuccessfully appealed. Deborah does not meet any requirements for immigration to Australia, so the office of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has indicated he is unable to intervene. We respectfully request the House to take whatever action is appropriate to allow Chinese orphan Wang Xiang (Deborah) to migrate to Australia on compassionate grounds, and to live with Raymond and Suzanne Dousset. by Mrs Irwin (from 586 citizens) Camden Airport To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: NA NA This petition of certain Citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House a matter under the Airports Act 1996 where Camden Airport Limited, via their Draft Master Plan 2010 for Camden Airport NSW, seeks to allow development of airport land for non-aviation related uses such as bulking goods retailing, industrial and business premises, road transport terminals etc. This would conflict with Camden Aerodrome's historical significance and its rural setting in environmentally sensitive land which is home to endangered species of flora. We therefore ask the House to impose limitations on use at Camden Aerodrome to exclude activities and development that are not related to aviation and aviation support. We further ask that the historical and rural nature of this airfield be protected from any inappropriate development. by Mrs Irwin (from 1,051 citizens) Chinese-Speaking Community To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of concerned Victorian citizens draws to the attention of the House: 1. The lack of recognition of the actual size of the rapidly-growing Chinese-speaking aged population; 2. The severe shortage of residential care places and community care packages that can cater for the specific needs of Chinese-speaking senior Victorians; 3. The shortfall of approximately 562 aged care places to which Chinese-speaking senior Victorians are entitled based on the national aged care planning benchmark; 4. The sufferings of Chinese-speaking senior Victorians and their carers when eligible applicants have been on the waiting lists of Chinese-specific aged care services for more than three years and some passed on before they could secure a place; 5. Pro-active measures need to be in place to respond to the substantial increase of Chinese-speaking aged population in Victoria, estimated to grow by more than 300% from 2006 to 2026. We therefore ask the House to: 1. Acknowledge that Australian citizens of Chinese background come from more than 100 countries and Government statistical data on the Chinese community should be compiled based on the language spoken at home instead of country of birth/origin; 2. Give priority to the Victorian Chinesespeaking community in its allocation of residential care places and community care packages in the forthcoming Aged Care Approvals Round; 3. Develop a strategic plan, through community consultations, to address the needs of people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds for aged care services. by Mrs Irwin (from 12,430 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Gong To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: Global Effort to Stop the Persecution of Falun Gong. This petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Falun Dafa (also known as Falun Gong) is a peaceful meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance. Falun Gong practitioners in China have been subjected to the most brutal and relentless persecution by the Chinese communist regime since July 1999, causing thousands to lose their lives and many thousands more to be physically and mentally impaired from torture. According to investigative reports written by Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas and former Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific) David Kilgour, thousands more Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to forced organ harvesting for China's lucrative transplant market and lost their lives (www.organharvestinvestigation.net/). We therefore ask the House to request the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister to openly, forthrightly and immediately call for an immediate end to the persecution of Falun Gong in China. by Mrs Irwin (from 3,203 citizens) National School Chaplaincy Program To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the National School Chaplaincy Program, built on the excellent history of school chaplaincy in Australia, which was introduced by the former Coalition Government in 2007/08 with a commitment of $165 million for its first three years. It was endorsed by Prime Minister Rudd who said “they (Chaplains) actually are providing the glue which keeps school communities rolling”. The program offers pastoral care and spiritual guidance to all. Chaplains necessarily have religious beliefs which underpin their work. These beliefs are representative of the school communities the chaplains work in and they do not hinder chaplains from working with those of other beliefs or none. It operates in 1915 schools and enjoys strong support among principals, schools and in the community generally. The Rudd Government has extended funding for the program, at a reduced level, until the end of 2011, after which time there may be no more funding despite the program's social benefits, sound administration and strong community support. Malcolm Turnbull has announced that if elected, the Coalition would continue funding the program in its current form, at its current level of $165 million over 3 years. We therefore ask that the Rudd Government continue funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program in its current form. by Mrs Irwin (from 20 citizens) National Archives of Australia To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: NA OFFICES IN ADELAIDE, DARWIN AND NA This petition of concerned citizens draws to the attention of the House to the following: - The announcement of the closure of the Adelaide, Darwin and Hobart offices of the National Archives of Australia starting in less than 10 months with the Darwin office; - The contradiction between this announcement and the service stated to be provided to the public in the National Archives of Australia's Service Charter, viz:- “We have reading rooms in each capital city in Australia where you can research the Commonwealth records held there,”; - The contradiction between the announcement and the Government's commitment to more openness in government as stated on the website of Prime Minister and Cabinet in relation to changes to the Freedom of Information regime; - The disadvantage this imposes on the people of those states and Northern Territory, not least to indigenous people who are part of Stolen Generation, and on child migrants, so recently acknowledged by the Prime Minister, who attempt to trace their family; - The withdrawal of the help pledged by the National Archives of Australia to “Australian Government agencies Ito] create and manage their records” to those agencies in South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. We therefore ask the House to instruct the National Archives of Australia to reverse and to provide funds to the National Archives of Australia so as to sustain the services of those offices in Adelaide, Darwin and Hobart into the future. by Mrs Irwin (from 5,748 citizens) Immigration and Citizenship To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain citizens of Australia to the attention of the House, the Government's commitment on 26/1/1988, giving amnesty to all immigrants/refugees, at that time, which, to this day, has still to been-acted. A National Human Rights Consultation was launched on 10th December 2008, seeking the views of the Australian public on which human rights and responsibilities they consider are important … still to be finalized. We therefore ask the House to consider: Is it not a “Universal truth” that all men and women are created equal, and endowed, by the Creator, with the power of creative reason? i.e. human. Is it not the expression of this creativity, through education, and advances and application of scientific discoveries, that has lead to the improvements in the standards of living, and subsequently, the ability to support higher population densities? We have a pool of potential, within the immigrants and refugees in Australia, many who are participating already without recognition, support or even acknowledgement of their existence as an human being here. We, the undersigned call upon the Australian Government to en-act the necessary legislation the giving amnesty, protection, support and recognition to all immigrants/ refugees within Australia. by Mrs Irwin (from 9 citizens) Immigration and Citizenship To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House, the Government's commitment on 26/1/1988, giving amnesty to all immigrants/refugees, at that time, which, to this its decision day, has still to been-acted. Draws to the attention of the house: that A National Human Rights Consultation was launched on 10th December 2008, by attorney general seeking the views of the Australian public on which human rights and responsibilities they consider are important … still to be finalized. We therefore ask the House to consider: Is it not a “Universal truth” that all men and women are created equal, and endowed, by the Creator, with draws the power of creative reason? i.e. human. Is it not the expression of this creativity, through education, and advances and application of scientific discoveries, which has lead to the improvements in the standards of living, and subsequently, the ability to support higher population densities? We have within our country a small percent of well educated and skilled persons who came to our shores in search of the means to improve their lives, who are contributing within our economy without recognition, support or even acknowledgement of their existence here, as an human being. (non-persons) As you grant a citizenship certificates to new Australians annually, on this special, Australian day; 26 of January, please consider granting compassionately a permanent residency, to ones who desperately need a place to call home. So please be fair as usual! by Mrs Irwin (from 5 citizens) Petitions received. Mrs Irwin-Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Medicare Cataract Surgery Rebate Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 29 October 2009 regarding the petition submitted by the citizens of Western Australia against the 50% reduction to the Medicare rebate for cataract surgery. As you are aware, as part of the 2009-10 Budget, it was announced that the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee for cataract and coronary angiography procedures will be adjusted to more appropriately reflect the time and complexity of these services, and will take effect from 1 November 2009. Over the past 20 years there has been significant advancement in the technology used to carry out cataract operations, which means they can now be performed faster, with better results, and are safer for patients. To put this into context, the cataract procedure that takes around 20 minutes has had a similar fee as the payment made by the Australian Government for complex skull surgery (cranioplasty), which takes more time to perform and carries greater risk for the patient. The changes made by the Government more accurately reflect the time taken to carry out these procedures. It is important to note that 95% of cataract procedures are undertaken in hospital. In these circumstances, in addition to the revised MBS rebate for the most common cataract procedure (item 42702), an average of $1,700 is also provided through private health insurance rebates to cover the cost of the accommodation, theatre, lens and ancillary fees. My Department has worked closely with the profession to determine the fees and weightings to be applied to the other cataract items within the overarching funding allocation. A new item for complex cataract procedures with a higher Schedule fee has also been developed in consultation with the profession in recognition of the additional time and complexity required for some cataract procedures. On 28 October 2009, the Senate passed a motion to disallow MBS cataract surgery items 42698, Responses 42701, 42702 and 42718 from the Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations 2009. This effectively meant there would have been no Medicare rebates available for those services from 1 November 2009. On 29 October 2009, I signed a Determination, in accordance with section 3C of the Health Insurance Act 1973, reinstating those items. As such, rebates for inhospital services from 1 November 2009 are $263.25 for MBS item 42698, $155.10 for item 42701, $340.80 for item 42702 and $675.60 for item 42718. MBS item 42718 is the new complex item providing for lens extraction and insertion of artificial lens, with a surgical procedure time of 40 minutes or more. In order for the Government to continue to provide funding for new and improved procedures and medications for the community, the Government needs to ensure that it is able to make changes to fees when procedures become less costly to perform. It is important to note that on average, an ophthalmologist receives around $580,000 annually, from Medicare rebates alone, and even with the reduction in rebate for cataract surgery, this will still amount to around $500,000 per annum. The Government recognises that in some communities, particularly rural and remote Australia, dedicated ophthalmologists provide a range of services, including cataract surgery, where they would otherwise not be available. Medicare is a universal scheme offering equality of access to all Australians, with the same level of rebate regardless of location. However, for practitioners treating patients in rural and remote areas, further to the MBS benefit, additional financial assistance in some communities is currently provided through the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program (MSOAP), as well as similar schemes run by the State and Territory Health Departments. The MSOAP provides financial support to specialists providing outreach services in rural and remote Australia. The Program improves the access of people living in rural and remote Australia to medical specialist services by complementing outreach specialist services provided by the State and Northern Territory Governments. Funds are available for the costs of travel, meals and accommodation, facility fees, administrative support at the outreach location, lease and transport of equipment, telephone support and up-skilling sessions for resident health professionals. During 2007-08, the Program provided funding of over $800,000 for ophthalmology services. The Australian Government will continue to provide additional funding for these services, and will work with the profession to ensure these services are not compromised. I trust that the above information is of assistance. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Military Justice Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 22 October 2009 concerning a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions on Australia's military justice system. The petition draws attention to recommendations 29 and 30 of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee report on The effectiveness of Australia's military justice system of 16 June 2005 (the 2005 Senate Report), `principles of service in the ADF'; and ‘the Constitutional obligation to have an effective military justice system'. It submits that self-regulation by the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF), Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston AC AFC, and Service Chiefs is an unreliable basis for ensuring the probity of military justice and has requested the House institute changes which will require the CDF and his commanders to ‘uphold Australian law and adhere to the statutes of military justice'. Recommendation 29 of the 2005 Senate Report concerned the establishment of an Australian Defence Force Administrative Review Board, a statutory body, with an independent chairperson, to review military grievances and submit findings and recommendations to the CDF. The Australian Government of the time did riot agree to this recommendation, but did acknowledge that there was a need to improve the complaints and redress of grievance management system. Recommendation 30 of the 2005 Senate Report was to establish a task force to finalise grievances that had been outstanding for over 12 months. This was agreed and that action has occurred. There has been significant improvement and reform to the military justice system since the 2005 Senate Report, and this is continuing. It has included streamlining the complaint and redress of grievance management system within the Australian Defence Force, improved reporting and oversight, greater education for commanders in the exercise of their administrative decision making and further education and awareness for members of the Australian Defence Force generally on their right to make a complaint, and avenues of complaint, such as the Inspector General Australian Defence Force (IGADF) and the Defence Force Ombudsman. The IGADF, a statutorily independent position is empowered to review, inquire into and report on the health and effectiveness of the military justice system. The IGADF continues to receive submissions and undertake inquiries and audits of military justice practices and procedures at ADF units, independent of the chain of command. An independent review of the health of the military justice system conducted by Sir Laurence Street AC KCMG QC and Air Marshal Les Fisher AO (Retd) in 2008 concluded that the military justice system is delivering and should continue to deliver impartial, rigorous and fair outcomes; has greater transparency and enhanced oversight; is substantially more independent of the chain of command; and is effective in maintaining a high standard of discipline. A military justice system must meet the needs of Defence in terms of minimising impact to operational effectiveness, while at the same time being fair and having due regard to the rights of individual members. The present system has in place frameworks that seek to safeguard the effectiveness of Australia's military justice system, both in regard to administrative sanctions and allegations of breaches of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. Improvements can, and will, continue to be made, as is evident in the Government's current work to address the recent decision of the High Court of Australia in Lane v Morrison regarding the validity of the Australian Military Court. The CDF and his commanders are required to comply with Australian law, including the rules and principles of administrative law, at all times, and it will be a matter of constant review to ensure that Australia's military justice system provides an optimal approach that protects and supports both the rights of individuals and Australia's national interest. For the reasons outlined above, it is not considered necessary to introduce changes to the military justice system in addition to those already being progressed or considered, or to revisit recommendations made in the 2005 Senate Report, which were not accepted. from the Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner Indigenous Languages Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 3 September 2009 concerning the recently submitted petition regarding Indigenous languages in Australia. I am pleased to report that a National Indigenous Languages Policy was jointly announced on 9 August 2009 by myself, as the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, and the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon Jenny Macklin MP. The policy confirmed the Australian Government's commitment to keeping Indigenous languages alive and supporting Indigenous Australians to connect with their language and culture. Importantly, this is the first dedicated national Indigenous languages policy Australia has adopted. In collaboration with other Australian Government departments, the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts is currently developing a practical plan to implement this policy. This will involve consultation with state and territo tory government agencies and Indigenous languages organisations to ensure the policy will achieve the outcomes sought. As part of the broader implementation of the policy, my Department will examine the proposal for a National Indigenous Languages Centre. You should also note that the Australian Government is pursing the idea of a national Indigenous Cultural Education and Knowledge Centre arising from the Australia 2020 Summit. As a first step, a feasibility study will be undertaken to develop possible models and options for such a centre, for consideration by Government. The Australian Government currently supports extensive maintenance and revival of Indigenous languages through the Maintenance of Indigenous Languages and Records Program which is providing $9.3 million in 2009-10 to some 65 projects nationally, involving around 200 languages. The policy can be found at: www.arts.gov.au/indigenous/languages policy Thank you for writing on this matter. from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett Trail and Monkey Bikes Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 12 August 2009 regarding a petition presented by Mr Nick Champion MP concerning the import and sale of monkey bikes (miniature motorcycles). Several States, including South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania have introduced bans on unsafe miniature motorcycles that do not have adequate steering, brakes, foot pegs, throttle control and engine kill switches. As part of the development of a single national Australian Consumer Law, the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs (MCCA) is currently undertaking a project to harmonise the existing Commonwealth and State and Territory Government product bans and mandatory safety standards. As part of this project, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is examining the case for introducing similar national regulations for unsafe miniature motorcycles. If a Commonwealth ban or standard is made pursuant the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA), it would be illegal for a supplier to sell miniature motorcycles that do not comply with that ban or standard. Beyond the question of whether particular miniature motorcycles pose inherent safety risks through their design or construction, the riding of miniature motorcycles in public places is not an activity that can be regulated through the TPA. Rather, regulation of the use of miniature motorcycles in a way that disturbs public amenity or safety would generally be a Police matter. I am advised that most States and Territories make offence to ride unregistered vehicles, such as miniature motorcycles on streets, footpaths or in public places. I trust this information will be of assistance to you. from the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, Mr Emerson Dear Ms Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 19 August 2009 about a petition from the Burma Campaign Australia submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions. The Government is gravely concerned by the Burmese regime's suppression of the democratic aspirations of the Burmese people and its lack of respect for their human rights. I have been strongly critical of the Burmese regime and the lack of political progress in Burma. Australia consistently urges the Burmese regime to engage in a genuinely inclusive process of political reform and national reconciliation, and to seek non-military solutions to Burma's ethnic conflicts. The Government has condemned the conviction of Aung San Suu Kyi on spurious charges. Both the Prime Minister and I issued statements on 11 August 2009 expressing Australia's deep concerns about her conviction and continued house arrest. I also made a statement to the Parliament on 12 August 2009. Australia has repeatedly called for the immediate and unconditional release of the more than 2000 political prisoners in Burma. I have conveyed Australia's views on these issues directly to my Burmese counterpart, as has Australia's Ambassador in Rangoon to senior levels in the Burmese regime. Australia maintains pressure on the Burmese regime directly through targeted financial sanctions and travel restrictions against senior regime figures, including their associates and supporters. Information on Australia's financial sanctions, including the list of 463 individuals targeted by the sanctions, can be found on the Reserve Bank of Australia's website at www.rba.gov.au. The Government's policy is neither to encourage it an nor to discourage trade with or investment in Burma. Australia maintains a ban on all defence exports to Burma and has supported the United Kingdom's call for a global arms embargo against Burma. Australia does not impose sanctions against trade with or investment in Burma. The Government believes that non-universal trade sanctions would not be effective in promoting change in Burma. Burma There have been a number of recent developments in relation to sanctions applying to Burma. In announcing the outcomes of its policy review on Burma, the United States foreshadowed the possibility of lifting its sanctions, should the regime take significant steps to address international concerns. In October, the regime responded positively to Aung San Suu Kyi's offer to cooperate on the withdrawal of sanctions, and permitted her meeting on 9 October with the Chargé d'Affaires of the Australian Embassy in Rangoon and UK and US Embassy representatives. Australia will maintain a policy of targeted financial sanctions as this process develops. Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith National Marriage Day Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to your letter dated 17 September 2009 seeking a written response to a petition submitted to your Committee requesting that 13 August each year be declared as National Marriage Day. This petition suggests that recognising the contribution that intact, stable marriages make to the well-being of children and society is important. The Government is of the view that a range of factors contribute to supporting the well-being of children and society. For example, initiatives recognising and raising public awareness about human rights, the rights of children, the welfare of the family and the need for non discrimination. The Government is aware that there are already a number of established observed national and international days that may raise awareness and recognise how people can and do contribute to the well-being of children and society. Examples of these are National Families Week (10-16 May), Anti-Poverty Week (14-20 August), International Youth Day (12 August) and International Human Rights Day, held on 10 December each year. National Families Week in Australia, in particular, is designed to celebrate family diversity and recognise the many different family types existing throughout Australia. I understand that a key objective of National Families Week in 2009 was to encourage Australians to think about, acknowledge and respect the diversity of the family unit. The Government supports this initiative. The Government does not support a particular day being declared an annual National Marriage Day. I hope this information is of assistance to the Committee when considering this petition. from the Attorney-General, MCClelland Postnatal Depression Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 22 October 2009 regarding the petition on postnatal depression The Australian Government and state and territory governments are working together to implement the National Perinatal Depression Initiative The initiative, which began in 2008-09, aims to improve prevention and early detection of antenatal and postnatal depression, and to provide better care, support and treatment for expectant and new mothers experiencing depression. The Australian Government's contribution of $55 million over five years includes: - $30 million to state and territory governments to contribute to the roll out of routine and universal screening, support services, and training and development for health professionals; - an additional $20 million to the Access to Allied Psychological Services Initiative to increase the capacity of Divisions of General Practice to better support women with perinatal depression through the provision of focused psychological strategies; and - $5 million to beyondblue to support implementation, including the development of materials that support professional practice, such as national perinatal depression screening guidelines and training materials, the raising of community awareness and promotion of help-seeking behaviour in relation to perinatal depression. In addition to the funding being provided to states and territories, it is anticipated that state and territory governments will also contribute approximately $30 million in funding to supplement the roll out of routine and universal screening, support services, and training for health professionals. The following key elements are integral to the National Perinatal Depression Initiative: - routine and universal screening for perinatal depression, offered once antenatally and once postnatally; Mr follow up support and care for women assessed as being at-risk of, or experiencing, perinatal depression; - workforce training and development for health professionals; research and data collection; - national guidelines for screening for perinatal depression; and community awareness. The Petition attached to your letter refers directly to the promotion of postnatal depression among medical practitioners and raising awareness within the community. The National Perinatal Depression Initiative is specifically responding to these needs. Through the Initiative, training, development and materials to support professional practice will be available to help health professionals in: raising the awareness of perinatal depression; the use of screening tools to identify women at-risk of, or experiencing, perinatal depression, and the appropriate referral mechanisms; and the availability and provision of appropriate treatment and support. Community awareness activities through the Initiative will include: promoting the importance of routine screening as a way of ensuring early detection and identification of perinatal and therefore early intervention; promoting the benefits of management and treatment of perinatal depression for women, as well as the benefits for families; and providing accessible information to the community about perinatal depression and the available treatment and support. I hope this information is of assistance to you. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Traveston Crossing Dam Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 17 September 2009 concerning the submission of a petition regarding the Traveston Crossing Dam. The Australian Government's responsibilities under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), in relation to proposals, such as the Traveston Crossing Dam, focus on the protection of certain defined matters of national environmental significance. These matters include world and national heritage properties, wetlands of international importance, nationally threatened species and ecological communities, migratory species, nuclear actions, Commonwealth marine areas and Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. As you may be aware, on 2 December 2009 I rejected the Traveston Crossing Dam on the basis of unacceptable impacts on listed threatened species and communities. My decision was based primarily on science and it is clear to me that the proposal cannot go ahead without unacceptable impacts on nationally protected matters. In particular, the proposal would have serious and irreversible adverse effects on listed threatened species including the Australian Lungfish, Mary River Turtle and Mary River Cod. In making my decision I also carefully considered the independent expert reviews commissioned by my department focusing on the hydrological and faunal impacts of the proposal, including at the estuary. Additional information on my final decision on the proposal and the decision making process under the EPBC Act can be located on the dedepression, partment's website at: www.environment.gov.au/epbc/notices/assessmen ts/2006/3150/traveston-dam-the-federalprocess.html. Thank you for writing on this matter. from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett Parallel Import Restrictions on Books Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to your letter dated 22 October 2009, attaching the petition submitted to your Committee, signed by 2,097 concerned Australians, regarding the review by the Productivity Commission of the provisions relating to the parallel importation of books under the Copyright Act 1968. The Government has not accepted the Productivity Commission's recommendation to remove the existing parallel importation restrictions on books. Australian book printing and publishing is under strong competitive pressure from international online booksellers and the Government has formed the view that this pressure is likely to intensify. In addition, the technology of electronic books (e-books) will continue to improve, with further innovations and price reductions expected. In the circumstances of intense competition from online books and e-books, the Government has judged that changing the regulations governing book imports would be unlikely to have any material effect on the availability of books in Australia. I hope this information is of assistance to the Committee. from the Attorney-General, Mr MCClelland Aircraft Noise: Sutherland Shire Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 22 October 2009 enclosing a petition from residents of Kareela about aircraft noise in the Sutherland Shire area. Upon receipt of your letter, I requested Airservices Australia look into the issues raised by the residents of Kareela. In response, I am able to advise the following: Sydney Airport commenced its Runway End Safety Area (RESA) project in October 2008. During the first stage of the RESA project operations on the east-west runway were limited, leading to a decrease in the number of overflights experienced by areas to the west of the airport. In June 2009, the first phase of the RESA project was finished allowing arrivals on the east-west runway to recommence. The reopening of the western end of the runway also allowed for the full range of noise sharing modes for Sydney Airport to again be available between the hours of 6 am to 7 am and 7 pm to 11 pm. Full noise sharing under the airport's Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) will resume once the RESA project is completed in April 2010. A review of flights operating in the vicinity of Kareela since June 2009 indicates that while the overall number of flights experienced during July increased from 1883 to 1992 since then flights have decreased, falling to 1532 in October. The curfew arrangements that apply at Sydney Airport are established under the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995 (the Act). While the Act prohibits aircraft movements at the airport during the curfew hours of 11 pm and 6 am it does, however, allow for movements by emergency aircraft, and a limited list of other aircraft which are restricted to landing over Botany Bay. I remain committed to maintaining the curfew and LTOP at Sydney Airport and believe the existing arrangements ensure the safety of air travel and provide a good balance between community and commercial needs. Thank you for raising this matter. from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese Timor-Leste Australian Honour Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 17 September 2009 to the Prime Minister regarding a petition, submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions, for the nation of East Timor to receive an award in the Order of Australia. As the minister responsible for honours, I have been asked to respond on the Prime Minister's behalf. I note that there is an expectation that Ministers will respond to a referred petition within 90 days of presentation. The courage and loyalty shown by the ‘creados' of East Timor, in support of Australian troops during 1941-43, was remarkable. I am also aware of the commendable work undertaken by the Mary MCKillop East Timor Mission in raising awareness of the critical contribution made by the East Timorese people during the War. However, an award in the Order of Australia is not an appropriate form of recognition in this circumstance. The Order was established to recognise the merit of individuals as part of a living society of honour and its constitution precludes group awards. However, the Government is currently giving some consideration to other, more appropriate, forms of recognition. This letter has been copied to the Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon John Faulkner, and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon Alan Griffin MP, for their information. from the Special Minister of State, Senator Ludwig Pharmaceutical Benefits Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 29 October 2009 regarding a petition submitted for consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions by the New South Wales community of Wattle Grove/Holsworthy concerning access to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits by an approved pharmacist. I note that Chen's Pharmacy at Wattle Grove cannot be approved to supply medicines subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) as it is not the required distance from the nearest PBS approved pharmacy, as specified in the Pharmacy Location Rules (the Rules). The purpose of the Rules is to ensure that all Australians have access to medicines subsidised under the PBS through an effective, efficient and welldistributed community pharmacy network. In particular, the Rules encourage improved local access to pharmacies for rural and remote communities. In certain situations I have a discretionary power to approve the pharmacist under the National Health Act 1953 (the Act) where the application of the Rules will result in a community being left without reasonable access to a PBS approved pharmacy. The pharmacists at Wattle Grove, Mr and Mrs Chen, have requested that I exercise my discretionary power and approve them to supply subsidised medicines at their pharmacy. As required under the Act, I must decide whether to consider Mr and Mrs Chen's request by 18 December 2009, three months after it was made. If I decide to consider their request, I have ther three months to decide whether I will exercise my discretionary power and approve the pharmacists to supply PBS medicines at the Wattle Grove pharmacy. In deciding whether the Wattle Grove/Holsworthy community has reasonable access to the supply of PBS medicines, I will examine a range of factors including why Mr and Mrs Chen's application did not satisfy the requirements of the Rules, the characteristics and demographics of the local area, the community's current level of access to the supply of PBS medicines, and any other factors that are relevant to this matter. Further mation about my discretionary power under the Act is available by accessing my Department's website at www.health.gov.au and using the search criterion ‘ACPA'. I appreciate the strong interest and support from the local community and their representations will be taken into account as part of my consideration of this issue. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Air Traffic Noise: Beechboro Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you tor your letter dated 29 October 2009 enclosing a petition from residents of Beechboro about aircraft noise over Beechboro. Upon receipt of your letter, I requested Airservices Australia examine the issue raised by the residents of Beechboro and am able to advise the following: The sustained growth in aviation required to service the mining and tourism industries in Western Australia has seen an increased number of flights each year since 2000. Some aircraft departing on Runways 03 and 06 at Perth Airport are required to fly over the greater metropolitan area of Perth, which includes Beechboro. The flight path over Beechboro is a long standing procedure. It is only used when departures to the north-west are unable to transit directly through military airspace to the north of Perth. However, recent changes to aircraft arrival and departure procedures at Perth have resulted in some increases to the number of aircraft operating over a fur- Beechboro. These changes formed pan of the Western Australia Route Review Project and were implemented to ease airspace congestion which had the potential to impact on safety. Thank you for raising this matter. from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese Human Rights: Falun Gong Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 29 October 2009 referring a petition submitted for the considerainfortion of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China. In accordance with Standing Order 209(b), my response is as follows. The Australian Government has taken a strong and consistent approach to engaging the Chinese Government on human rights, including in relation to Falun Gong Practitioners. The Australian Government continues to engage China on human rights, including persecution of Falun Gong practitioners through the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, the most recent round of which took place in Canberra in February 2009. The next round of the Human Rights Dialogue will take place in China in 2010. The Government has made the point to China that it is important to guarantee both freedom of belief and freedom of religious activity without state interference. The Government has also expressed concern about reports that the Chinese authorities continue to suppress religious activities which they deem to be outside the scope of the statecontrolled religious system. This would appear to be inconsistent with the right of freedom of belief, including the right to observe, worship, practice and teach in accordance with that belief. The Australian Government has urged China to protect that right, and will continue to do so. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 26 November 2009, under reference 232/398, concerning a petition to end recreational hunting on public lands and reserves. The state and territory governments have primary responsibility for managing wildlife including hunting. The Australian Government becomes involved when the specimen is being exported, the activity occurs on Commonwealth land, or where there is a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance. The Australian Government supports sustainable use of wildlife where the activity is adequately regulated to ensure that the harvest is ecologically sustainable, does not have a detrimental impact either on the harvested species or their ecosystems, is conducted in a humane manner and is compatible with other management objectives for the relevant area. The Australian Government does not permit hunting or shooting by members of the public within Commonwealth reserves. Hunting on other public lands is a matter for the relevant slate or territory government. from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett Lymphoedema Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 29 October 2009 regarding the treatment of lymphoedema. The petition that you refer to asks that lymphoedema be recognised as a chronic medical condition. For the purposes of the Chronic Disease Management (CDM) items (which replaced the former Enhanced Primary Care items in 2005) on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), a chronic (or terminal) medical condition is one that has been or is likely to be present for six months or longer, including but not limited to asthma, cancer, cardiovascular illness, diabetes mellitus, musculoskeletal conditions and stroke. The MBS does not list all possible medical conditions that are regarded as chronic medical conditions, and does not preclude lymphoedema from being considered as such. It is up to GPs to use their cliniHunting cal judgement, taking into account both the eligibility criterion and the general guidance, to determine whether a patient with lymphoedema is eligible for treatment under the Medicare CDM items. Under the CDM items, patients who have a chronic medical condition and complex care needs and are being managed by their GP under a GP Management Plan (GPMP item 721) and Team Care Arrangements (TCAs item 723), can be referred for up to five Medicare-rebatable allied health services (items 10950-10970) each calendar year. Specific categories of allied health professionals, including physiotherapists and occupational therapists who meet specific eligibility requirements, and who are registered with Medicare Australia and in private practice, are able to provide these CDM (individual) allied services. The allied health services available under Medicare are not intended to fully cater for patients who require more intensive ongoing treatments. Rather, these Medicare services complement services provided by State and Territory Governments and increase access to private allied health services by making them more affordable. The Australian Government also supports access to allied health services more generally through subsidies on private health insurance premiums and through targeted non-Medicare initiatives, such as the More Allied Health Services Program funded through rural Divisions of General Practice. In addition to the CDM allied health (individual) services, patients with lymphoedema may be eligible for Medicare benefits in respect of monitoring and support services, provided by a practice nurse (or registered Aboriginal Health Worker) on behalf of a GP (MBS item 10997). This item is available to patients who have a chronic or terminal medical condition and are being managed by their GP under a GPMP, TCAs, or a multidisciplinary care plan. Activities that a practice nurse or other health professional may undertake on behalf of and under the supervision of a GP are not prescribed but must be within the nurse's professional competencies. A maximum of five services can be claimed per patient per calendar year. The petition requests that provision be made within Medicare for the cost of compression garments. The Australian Government acknowledges that the cost of necessary medical aids and appliances can be a significant financial burden, particularly for people living with chronic disease. Medical aids/equipment are provided by the States and Territories as part of their responsibilThe ity for the provision of health services. The Australian Government's role under the current health funding arrangements is to provide health grants to the State and Territory Governments. It is a matter for each State and Territory to determine its priorities and the funds that are allocated tween the many competing areas of government spending on health and hospital services. All State and Territory Governments operate aids and appliances programs to assist residents with the cost and/or provision of appropriate equipment, aids and appliances in the community setting. In addition, some private health funds provide benefits for aids and appliances, but are free to determine the nature of health related goods that attract benefits and any restrictions or limitations on such benefits. The payment of benefits usually depends upon the insured person holding a policy that covers aids and appliances. The petition also requests the establishment of regional and rural lymphoedema treatment centres, funding for a public education campaign, central register of lymphoedema treatment practitioners and a national lymphoedema helpline and website. The Australian Government recognises that our health system is in need of reform to meet a range of long-term challenges, including access to services, the growing burden of chronic disease, population ageing, workforce shortages, and the escalating costs of new health technologies. The recently released report of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, A Healthy Future for All Australians, provided a long-term, comprehensive view and health reform options. For your interest, page 22 of the report (Recommendations/Restoring people to better health and independant living/paragraph 41) recommends affordable access to aids and other devices to be considered under reforms to integrated safety net arrangements. The Government is using the recommendations of this report as a basis for direct consultation with the health sector and the Australian public between now and the end of the year. At the end of this process, discussions will occur at a Council of Australian Governments meeting about health system reform. Australian Government has established a website to enable members of the public and organisations in the health sector to engage with the Government about options for health reform. It is seeking debate which is realistic about the reforms that need to be undertaken, as well as about be- the cost implications and how they are to be funded. Views can be provided at www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publis hing.nsf/content/home. I trust that the above information is of assistance. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Granite Belt Orchards Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 25 November 2009 referring me to a petition on protecting Queensland fruit orchards from flying foxes which had been lodged with your committee. The petition raises issues about the impact of flying foxes on agricultural production, and strategies for managing flying foxes, which are primarily the responsibilities of state and territory governments. I am responding to you as Australian Government Minister responsible for matters concerning the environment. I understand that Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and. Forestry, the Hon. Tony Burke MP, has a legislative responsibility for agriculture and will respond separately. The Australian Government's responsibilities under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) focus on the protection of certain matters of national ronmental significance, which include nationally listed threatened species. The Australian Government's involvement with flying-foxes is confined to those species that are listed under the EPBC Act. The only EPBC-listed flying-fox species occurring in the Southern Darling Downs area is the Grey-headed Flying-fox, which is listed as vulnerable. Disturbance or reloregardless cation of populations requires consideration under the EPBC Act. Other flying-fox species that may occur in the area, the Black Flying-fox (Pteropus alecto) and the Little Red Flying-fox (Pteropus scapulatus), are not listed under the EPBC Act and are therefore primarily the responsibility of state government, except where they occur on Commonwealth land. In eastern Australia particularly, diminishing habitat and reliable food sources growing in parks and gardens has forced flying fox camps into local neighbourhoods and orchards. The Australian Government supports the effective management of flying fox populations and is reviewing the EPBC Act's Policy Statement for the Greyheaded flying fox to ensure it reflects current understanding of the potential effects of actions such as culling and relocating flying fox colonies. The Policy Statement will complement a recently released draft National Recovery Plan: (http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/the atened/publications/recovery/pteropuspoliocephalus.html) which is currently open for comment. Developed with the involvement of the relevant states, the draft Plan identifies threats and recovery actions to protect habitat critical the survival of the species. Submissions will be taken into account in formulating both the Plan and Policy Statement. Thank you, for writing on this matter. from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to your letters dated 19 and 26 November 2009 seeking a written response to petitions submitted to your Committee on 16 and 23 Novemenviber 2009 requesting that the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009 be opposed. As you may be aware, the Bill was introduced in the Senate as a private senator's bill by Federal. Green's Senator Hanson-Young on 24 June 2009. The Bill proposed to remove all discrimination from the Marriage Act 1961 on the basis of sexuality and gender identity and to permit marriage of sex, sexuality and gender identity. The Senate referred the Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report on 25 June 2009. The Committee tabled its report on the Bill on 26 November 2009, recommending that the Bill not be passed. The petitions suggest that the definition of marriage as ‘a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life' be maintained. The petition explains that to alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex ‘marriage' as proposed by the Bill would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially children. The Government is of the view that a range of factors contribute to supporting the well-being of children and society. For example, initiatives recognising and raising public awareness about human rights, the rights of children, the welfare of the family and the need for non-discrimination. The Government's clear view is that marriage is between a man and a woman. Support for the current definition of marriage in the Marriage Act 1961 was confirmed at the 45th ALP National Conference 2009 and is reflected in the ALP National Platform and Constitution 2009. The Rudd to Government is committed to ensuring that all couples whether married or de facto do not suffer discrimination. The Government's position is that the most appropriate way to achieve this is through the development of a nationally consistent framework for relationship recognition. These reforms are to be implemented consistently with the Government's commitment to maintainMarriage ing the definition of marriage. I hope this information is of assistance to your Committee when considering these petitions. from the Attorney-General, Mr MCClelland Youth Homelessness Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 19 November 2009 to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon Jenny Macklin MP, about the petition regarding housing for young people at risk of homelessness. Minister Macklin has asked me to respond to you on her behalf as this issue is sibility. I appreciate the concerns of the people who have signed the petition about the number of youth who are homeless. Young people are particularly vulnerable as identified in the petition. The Government has invested $48 million over the next two years for the Reconnect program. Reconnect provides early intervention support for young people aged between 12 and 18 years who are homeless, or at risk of homelessness, and aims to improve the level of engagement with their families, education, training, employment and the community. Reconnect is delivered by Local Government, and non-government providers, offering services such as counselling, group work, mediation and practical support to both the young person and their family. There are currently 107 Reconnect services in metropolitan, regional, rural and remote locations around Australia. More broadly on homelessness, I was proud to launch the White Paper on Homelessness with the Prime Minister, the Hon Kevin Rudd MP, in December 2008. Called The Road Home, the White Paper is the Government's plan to reduce homelessness. The Government has set two ambitious but achievable goals: to have overall homelessness by 2020 and offer supported accommodation to all rough sleepers who seek it by 2020. State and Territory Governments have also committed to these targets through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). Under the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, States and Territories and the Commonwealth have agreed to spend $1.1 billion to implement support services for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The State and Territory Governments are responsible for the distribution of funding for homelessness support and service delivery in their jurisdictions. The States and Territories have agreed to the goals and targets set in the National Partnership on Homelessness to reduce homelessness and are required to spend the funding on initiatives to achieve these goals. Young people feature significantly in these in my area of responagreements. This new funding includes $300 million announced with the States and Territories last year for the purchase of 731 new homes across Australia for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. In addition, under the Social Housing Initiative, as part of the National Building Economic Stimulus Plan, the Commonwealth Government has committed $5.64 billion to allow the construction of over 19,300 dwellings and to renovate more than 60,000 existing dwellings. This will help us to achieve the goals set out in the White Paper on Homelessness by providing more opportunities for people to access stable accommodation. The Commonwealth Government is determined to reduce homelessness, not just through extra funding, but through reform. A different approach is required to assist people to get back on their feet and into secure housing, with the support they need for mainstream social and economic participation. We also aim to significantly reduce the number of people becoming homeless in the first place, or cycling in and out of homelessness. I trust that this information demonstrates the commitment the Commonwealth Government has in facilitating a real reduction in homelessness. I genuinely appreciate the good work being done by the many individuals and organisations like the St John of God Foundation and their Horizon House in supporting homeless young people in our community. Once again, thank you for writing on this important issue. from the Minister for Housing, Ms Plibersek Outback Australian Technical College Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 19 November 2009 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning the petition regarding funding for the Australian Technical Colleges. The Australian Government believes that existing education systems are well placed to educate and train students in the trades, and that available public resources should be used to strengthen current education and training systems. However the Government undertook to honour existing funding agreements with the 24 Australian Technical Colleges (ATCs) and work towards their integration into the broader education and training effort before the expiry of their agreements on 31 December 2009. The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations has consulted with local stakeholders, including industry, education and training sectors, and state and territory governments regarding future arrangements for each existing ATC. In each case the aim was to determine future programs in ways that best met the Government's objective of expanding the provision of high quality pathways for Year 11 and 12 students covering senior secondary as well as technical education, and responding to the future skills needs of industry in the region. The Department is currently in close consultations with the South Australian Government to determine the best option for the future of the ATC Spencer Gulf & Outback. It is a priority in these consultations to ensure that current students of the ATC are given priority consideration and that all students currently enrolled with the ATC are able to continue their study programs in 2010. from the Minister for Education, Ms Gillard Administration of Justice Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to your letter dated 26 November 2009 attaching three petitions relating to the Family Court submitted to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions. The first and second petitions seek the removal of judicial officers pursuant to section 72(ii) of The Constitution. Section 72 provides for the removal of judicial officers, by the Governor General in Council on an address from both Houses of the Parliament, in only the most serious of circumstances-namely, proved misbehaviour or incapacity. As the judicial branch of the Australian Government, the federal courts are of fundamental importance to the Australian community and I take any dissatisfaction with them seriously. Where a legitimate and substantiated allegation of misbehaviour or incapacity is made against a federal judicial officer, that allegation should be treated seriously and given due consideration by the Parliament. Complaints against the conduct of judicial officers that do not amount to the level set out in the Constitution are appropriately directed to the Head of Jurisdiction in the court concerned. I also note that, if a person is not satisfied with the outcome of a particular matter, the appropriate avenue of redress is through the appeals process. The information contained in the two petitions is not sufficient to determine the nature of the alleged conduct. As a result, it is not possible to ascertain the seriousness of the complaint and therefore whether it is appropriately to be considered by the Parliament or the Head of Jurisdiction of the relevant court. It would also be difficult to assess the merits of the allegation. The third petition seeks the enactment of laws defining the rights and obligations of a MCKenzie friend in federal court proceedings. The petition requests that those laws be parallel to the provisions of the Family Law Rules 2004 on case guardians, including the right of audience but not the right to make written applications on behalf of a party. A case guardian is permitted to do, for the benefit of the disabled party, anything permitted to be done by that party whereas a MCKenzie friend is a person who is not an advocate, but sits beside the litigant at the bar table to take notes, make quiet suggestions and assist the litigant in presenting his or her case to the Court. The Family Law Act 1975 and Federal Magistrates Act 1999 empower judges and magistrates or a majority of them to make rules in relation to practice and procedure to be followed in family law courts. Whilst the Rules include provisions about case guardians, they do not directly address the position of MCKenzie friends, who play a less formal role in legal proceedings. The Committee might like to inform the petitioner that he may bring his concerns about the application or clarity of the relevant court rules-including as these relate to MCKenzie friends-to the attention of the Chief Justice of the Family Court or Chief Magistrate of the Federal Magistrates Court. The third petition also seeks amendment of section 33 of the Judiciary Act 1903. This section gives the High Court the power to make certain orders or direct the issue of certain writs: The amendment is sought for the purpose of enabling ‘correction of judicial wrongs and errors in the High Court'. The amendment that would appear to be sought is already given effect by subsection 38(e) of the Judiciary Act. However, if a person is not satisfied with a decision of a court in a particular matter, the appropriate avenue of through the appeals process. I hope this information is of assistance to the Committee. from the Attorney-General, MCClelland Airport Noise Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 19 November 2009 enclosing the petition about flight path activity at Sydney Airport presented to the House of Representatives by the Member for Cook on 19 June 2009. I note that the four points the petitioners wish to bring to the attention of the House relate to the issue of the implementation and use of certain Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs) at Sydney Airport. This issue was discussed at length at both the meeting of the Implementation and Monitoring Committee (IMC), which oversees the Sydney Airport Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP), on Tuesday 22 September, and at the meeting of the Sydney Airport Community Forum (SACF) on Friday 25 September. My replies to the three specific requests of the petition are as follows: 1. The Government fully supports noise sharing under the Sydney Airport LTOP. SACF and the LTOP IMC have been established as standing community consultative committees to oversee the implementation of the noise sharing principles. 2. Airservices Australia has undertaken to examine the reasons underlying the changes in patterns of aircraft overflight of the Cook electorate and to report back to me through the IMC and to SACF members. 3. I have asked my Department and Airservices to develop a paper scoping research into using new technologies to manage aircraft noise in ways that facilitate noise sharing while taking advantage of the gains in safety and efficiency that can be provided by advances in avionics. Thank you for raising this matter. from the Minister for Infrastructure, redress is Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese MCMillan Electorate: Moe Infrastructure Dear Mrs Irwin Mr Thank you for your letter dated 26 November 2009 about a petition submitted regarding the relocation of the Moe Library and Latrobe Council Services Centre. Funding of $2 million towards the Moe Community Hub building was announced as an election commitment by the Australian Government on 24 October 2007. The project is currently being considered by the Australian Government Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (the Department) for funding under the Better Regions Program. The Better Regions Program will provide $176 million over four years to assist regional Australia with much-needed community facilities and services, identified by local communities as priorities for their regions. The proposed Community Hub building will form part of the Latrobe City Council's proposed Moe Rail Precinct redevelopment, which is currently undergoing detailed design. The Community Hub building will provide a new library, mother and child health centre, meeting rooms, interne cafe and gallery area. These services were identified desirable in the precinct during extensive periods of community consultation by the Latrobe City Council. I understand that the petition received by the Committee represents residents who object to the relocation of the library from its present site to the proposed Community Hub building. I will consider this issue in the context of advice from my Department on the proposal for funding under the Better Regions Program. However, the appropriate channel to express concerns is to the Latrobe City Council which is the proponent for the development. Thank you for raising this matter. from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese National Rental Affordability Scheme Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 26 November 2009 to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon Jenny Macklin MP, concerning a petition submitted for the consideration of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS). Minister Macklin has asked me to respond to you as this issue is in my area of responregulations sibility. I appreciate the petitioners' concern that NRAS applications should receive Local Government approval and that community consultation should also occur. It appears that petitioners have been misinformed about the process for NRAS developments. Development applications for houses to be part-funded under NRAS go through exactly the same process as any private (non-NRAS) development. NRAS developments are not exempt from local government rules and requirements. The planning approval for any new NRAS development is made by the relevant local council in line with their usual practices, including community consultation where appropriate, and with reference to their requirements and town plans. If residents of the suburb of Coombabah are disas satisfied by the general process for approval that applies to any new residential development in their suburb, I suggest that that they direct these concerns to the local council. While applicants under NRAS are not required to provide evidence that their proposals have obtained planning approval before they apply, they are required to sign a declaration which states that they will be fully compliant with the requirements of the Scheme. This includes compliance with planning laws. Please also note that the National Rental Affordability Scheme Regulations 2008 require that each approved rental dwelling, and the management of it, complies at all times with the landlord, tenancy, building and health and safety laws of the State or Territory and Local Government area in which the dwelling is located. The NRAS assessment process takes into consideration several aspects of development, including housing need in the area, as well as accessibility and sustainability outcomes. The decision-making process involves consultation with the State Government. The Commonwealth Government will not approve an application without State Government support. Before a payment or refundable tax offset certificate will be provided, approved participants must indicate that they have complied with all local and provide a copy of the certificate of occupancy, or equivalent, for each dwelling. Providing NRAS approval and reserving an allocation allows applicants to forward plan and to include projects that will deliver dwellings over the four years of the Scheme. Furthermore, gaining approval under the Scheme may be a critical part of proceeding with the project and applicants may need or wish to secure this prior to applying for planning approval. Approval under the Scheme may also assist applicants to leverage finance. Improving access to housing for families is a major priority for the Commonwealth Government and the Scheme will help increase the supply of more affordable rental homes. Rent for properties participating in the Scheme must be 20 per cent below the market rate, and only eligible tenants on low to moderate incomes can be housed in NRAS homes. Eligible tenants may be single people, couples or families with children and may include key workers who make a significant contribution to the community, such as nurses, police officers and trades people. Once again, thank you for taking the time to write on behalf of the petitioners. from the Minister for Housing, Ms Plibersek",136
149,Mrs IRWIN,HOBART,"On behalf of all members of the Standing Committee on Petitions, I would like to place on record that we are very happy with the quick responses that we have been receiving from ministers. NA Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee",159
150,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled Defence Sub-Committee visit to East Timor. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",159
151,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,"The Defence subcommittee visited East Timor-Timor-Leste-in the second half of last year for a short one-day visit. It was an important event in respect of the Defence committee's work, and well attended. Some 14 members of the committee participated in that one-day visit. The work of Australian Defence personnel in Timor-Leste has been very significant now over quite a period of time, and it is likely to extend into the future. Members of the committee did believe it was important both as a bipartisan sign of support for the work that is there and also as an opportunity to better understand the activities being undertaken to visit physically. With such a large number, it would have been difficult logistically to remain overnight. It was difficult enough, I suspect for those who had to host us to look after the substantial number on the visit. In that respect I would like to place on the record again my appreciation for the cooperation and support of the Australian post and the Australian ambassador, His Excellency Peter Heyward. The visiting members of the subcommittee attended the Defence Cooperation Program headquarters, and Lieutenant-Colonel Steve Ferndale and his officers provided a very good briefing for those on the committee on the activities that they were undertaking, including their work with the development of the Timor-Leste defence forces and the construction of the DCP headquarters building itself. The committee also visited the International Stabilisation Force headReport quarters, and met with the ISF commander, Brigadier Bill Sowry. It is interesting in these sorts of events, having had briefings here in Australia in the committee on the work that is being undertaken there and having read many accounts in the public domain of these matters, that nothing quite compares with the opportunity to be in the presence of those involved in this work and to see first hand the conditions in which they are operating. In that respect, I think perhaps the most interesting part of the trip-certainly for me-was when we then went to the training centre at Metinaro-the officer in command there is Major Barry Rhodes-to see the work that is actually being done on the ground in a very fine facility, I have to say. The quality of the facility that has been constructed there by the Australian government for use in the training and support of the local defence forces is first class. It gave all of us on the committee an opportunity not just to talk with the ADF personnel involved but with the local defence and police recruits about what they needed, how they saw the development of their country and also how they saw the assistance that was being provided by the Australian Defence Force. It is fair to say that the training there ers a wide range of activities, from some of the most basic defence and security related training through to more sophisticated activities. Whilst we were at Metinaro we did get the opportunity to talk to some of the students of English language who were present and also the English instruction teacher who, if memory serves me correctly, was a former New South Wales school teacher. The work that is being done there is vital to the development of basic infrastructure in TimorLeste. On a broader point, it was also possible as we were driving across the island, to get a better understanding of the basic infrastructure needs of Timor-Leste. They are significant and should not be underestimated. I want to place on record my thanks to the members of the subcommittee, who gave their time to participate. I particularly want to record my thanks to Wing Commander David Ashworth, who more than anybody ensured that the logistics for the occasion ran seamlessly. David was the Defence officer attached to the committee last year and, for his sins, is now here doing a real job back at the ADF. But we greatly appreciated his support and hard work in ensuring that delegation trip went off without a hitch.",159
152,Mr BALDWIN,COMMITTEES,"Paterson) (8.42 pm)On 5 August 2009 I joined with members of the Defence subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in a brief visit to TimorLeste. The objective was to develop a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by our ADF personnel and to observe the development of Timor-Leste defence forces as Timor-Leste matures as a nation to a future where it no longer requires Australian forces as a part of its domestic security support arrangements. For a nation that has been ravaged by events of the past, Timor-Leste is making covsolid progress since independence toward a more stable security environment. That progress has been driven by the tenacity and bravery of the men and women of TimorLeste under the resilient leadership of the President, Dr Jose Ramos Horta, and supported by several nations and NGOs in which Australia has played an important role. At the Defence Cooperation Program headquarters in Dili, Ambassador Heyward briefed the committee on Timor-Leste's progress and challenges, and gave an explanation of its ongoing relationship and links with Australia and a detailed briefing on the many organisations-governmental and nongovernmental-engaged in Timor-Leste's ongoing development as well as the country's neighbourhood and its resource base, economy and trade. Senior DCP Adviser to the Timor-Leste Defence Force, Lieutenant Colonel Steven Ferndale, briefed the committee on the DCP's role in assisting to create and sustain a professional military culture. A long-term goal would be to enable the Timor-Leste Defence Force to reach a standard of training and effectiveness that could see it contributing internationally. The briefing also explained how the DCP interacts with the International Stabilisation Force and the Timor-Leste Defence Force. The committee were informed that the DCP's major projects included the establishment of the Specialist Training Wing, the Maritime Security Program, improvements to logistics management, communications capability and the construction of buildings. At the International Stabilisation Force Headquarters at Camp Phoenix, Dili, we were briefed by Commander ISF, Brigadier Bill Sowry and his team from the Joint Task Force 631. Briefings covered the ISF's mission, tasks, organisation, disposition and challenges. We were advised that the ISF was becoming more engaged in liaison and nation building alongside the NGOs through the establishment and use of liaison officers. The visit to the Timor-Leste Defence Force Nicolau Lobato Training Centre at Metinaro gave the committee an opportunity to meet with trainees, to understand their backgrounds and their reasons in joining the Timor-Leste Defence Force. I was impressed with the newly constructed facilities and the briefing from the Officer Commanding the Specialist Training Wing, Major Barry Rhodes, on the training program, which includes a comprehensive English-language training program. This is an integral part of the DCP strategy, alongside the development of a training culture that will underpin a professional military culture. In conclusion, the International Stabilisation Force's mission is to ‘support the government of Timor-Leste in maintaining stability and the development of its security sector in order to allow the continuing growth of Timor-Leste as a stable economic nation'. I am happy to report that this is being achieved and that the strengthening of the Timor-Leste Defence Force will enable Australia and others to reduce their commitment to the ISF and other supporting infrastructure. In recognition of the above, the President of Timor Leste, Dr Jose Ramos Horta, today presented nearly 200 Navy, Army and Air Force personnel with the Timor-Leste Solidarity Medal and expressed his nation's gratitude to those personnel who are about to return home. To quote President Ramos: Together we have been able to restore peace and security for the people who so much deserved it … As you depart for Australia. I wish to thank you for the services you have provided us on behalf of the Australian people. I should also note that the ISF Commander, Commodore Stuart Mayer, whom I first met on board HMAS ANZAC during the wreath laying ceremony over HMAS Sydney on 16 April 2008, was awarded the medal of merit, the medhala de merito, one of the highest accolades that can be presented by the President, becoming one of only a select few people from outside Timor-Leste to receive the medal. I thank the members of the committee, in particular Wing Commander David Ashworth, and those who made the time as informative as it could have been. Most of all I thank the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, who carry out their role with absolute distinction and do Australia proud. Along with the chair and on behalf of the committee, I would like to personally thank  staff at the Australian Embassy in Dili; the ADF staff at the Defence Cooperation Program; the members of Joint Task Force 631 and No. 34 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force for their support and assistance during this trip. Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Report",160
153,Mr DREYFUS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled A time for change: yes/no? Inquiry into the machinery of referendums, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",161
154,Mr DREYFUS,COMMITTEES,"It is my pleasure to present the report A time for change: yes/no? Inquiry into the machinery of referendums. This is the fourth report of the committee for this parliament. It is over a decade since Australia last a referendum, over thirty years since there was a successful referendum to change the Constitution, and it is nearly a century since the introduction of the yes/no pamphlet as the principal means of informing voters in a referendum. This inquiry concerned the machinery of referendums-principally how voters are engaged in a referendum and how the yes/no cases are communicated. There have been many changes in effective communication methods over the last century, and yet our method of communicating to voters during a referendum has remained relatively unchanged over this time. In 1912, when the requirement was introduced for a pamphlet outlining the yes/no cases for constitutional change, it was considered an innovative development in the way in which the government communicated with electors. In today's array of communication technologies and expectations of public debate, we could hardly see such a pamphlet as innovative. Nearly a century later, it is appropriate to ask whether there is a more effective way of informing and engaging the Australian public about proposed constitutional change. The requirement for constitutional change is rightly set high. Section 128 of the Constitution requires that a majority of electors in majority of states approve of the proposal. It is therefore critical that electors understand the proposal being put to them so that they can make an informed decision at a referendum. It is also clear that a lack of understanding plays a significant part in an elector's decision to vote no. Indeed, the 1999 republic referendum campaign demonstrated this plainly with the ‘Don't know; vote no' slogan against change. It is the view of the committee that, while the distribution of a yes/no pamphlet has provided a reasonable starting point for communicating with voters, held it is the minimum of what might be needed and is no longer appropriate or adequate as the sole material provided to electors. As such, the committee has made 17 recommendations to improve the referendum process. These innovations recognise that in the 21st century a range of communication approaches are required to inform and engage with voters. First, the committee recommends amendments to the act to require that a yes/no pamphlet is posted to every household rather than each elector. This change has been long supported by the Australian Electoral Commission. Additionally the current restriction on the word limit of the yes/no arguments should be removed from the act. It was agreed that parliamentarians should continue to authorise the yes/no arguments. Parliamentarians are elected representatives and are responsible and accountable to the Australian people. It is appropriate that they retain responsibility for authorising the official yes/no arguments. In seeking to provide a more flexible and adaptable approach, the committee has recommended that a referendum panel be established for each referendum. The panel would be responsible for promoting the referendum and educating voters regarding the arguments. This would include determining the a word limit of the yes/no pamphlet, as well as providing background material to electors on the referendum proposal. These changes mean that there would be more than one way to communicate with electors before a referendum. The yes/no pamphlet would continue to be provided to electors and this would serve as a guaranteed minimum for referendum material. However, additional material, using a range of communication technologies, could be more effectively targeted to different groups of electors. The panel would comprise a maximum of eight persons, and should include a representative of the Australian Electoral Commission. The method of appointment to the panel should ensure independence and bipartisanship, and the government would determine the budget for the panel. Further, it is clear that many Australians are not familiar with the Constitution. The committee has recommended that the Australian government develop and implement a national civics education program to enhance the engagement of the public in democratic processes and to improve knowledge and understanding of the Constitution. The title of this report is A time for change: yes/no? The report concerns the opportunity to change our Constitution. It does not promote change but acts to ensure that the opportunity for change is fair and represents the informed views of voters. We can and should do better in educating and engaging voters in the referendum process and so, yes, it is time to change the machinery we use for referendums. I thank those who participated in committee hearings and roundtables and provided submissions to the inquiry. I also thank the secretariat for their work. And finally I thank the other members of the committee for their dedication and contribution to the inquiry. In particular I thank the inquiry secretary, Serica Mackay and research officer Angela Arundell, and also Anna Dacre, Sharon Bryant, Claire Young and Ozi Kosemehmetoglu.",162
155,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"This is one of the few reports of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which have a dissenting report from a number of opposition members. While there is a dissenting report, I think that one ought to recognise that the process of the inquiry, with the round-table, was very positive. There was a lot of initiative expressed by many people, and the committee worked well together despite the fact that at the end, when one was considering the deliberations emanating from the round-table, members of the opposition found it necessary to lodge a dissenting report. There is no doubt that the Australian Constitution is the foundation on which our Australian democracy is created. We have freedom; we have stability; we have a way of life that makes us the envy of people around the world. Consequently, any attempt to tamper with our Constitution or to interfere with the process of referenda to alter our Constitution ought to be undertaken only after the most careful consideration. Consequently, while the concept of a discussion on streamlining the process of constitutional referenda certainly is something in which all of us ought to participate, on balance the opposition members of the committee-or those who signed the dissenting report-could not go along with the majority view as expressed by the chairman. I would like to join the chairman in thanking the inquiry secretariat and indeed the committee secretary for the excellent service which the committee received, as always, when preparing the report entitled A time for change: yes/no? In the time that is available to me, I would just like to mention briefly that the opposition members who signed the dissenting report wanted to make a comment about a number of recommendations. With respect to recommendation 1, it was felt that the generality of the recommendation calling for an amendment of the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 to improve the process was unhelpful, and it did not detail what amendments should be made. It was felt that this recommendation could not be accepted. Recommendation 2, which referred to the removal of the word restrictions of the yes/no cases, was a matter of concern because the recommendation did not preclude a decrease in the word limit. Recommendation 3, if adopted, would have resulted in the yes/no booklet only being delivered to each household. As we know, in a democracy not everyone in every household necessarily agrees on everything. It was felt by opposition members that if individual electors did not receive a yes/no case then it could be that electors, who had a responsibility to participate in the referendum process, would not necessarily each receive a list of the cases in favour of change and, of course, against change. With respect to recommendation 6, while opposition members generally agreed with the recommendation for the development and implementation of a national civics education program, it was felt that the recommendation would be enhanced if it included provision for such a program to be developed and delivered in conjunction with nongovernment organisations currently promoting and operating education programs about the Australian Constitution. Such organisations, as was indicated in the dissenting report, could include CEFA and the Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies. Recommendations 7, 8 and 9 referred to a referendum panel. The feeling was that such a panel would be unelected and unaccountable, whereas all of us are elected to the parliament and we are at least responsible to the Australian people. Consequently, recommendations 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15 could not be supported because they referred to the referendum panel. Recommendations 4, 5, 11, 16 and 17 are supported. This was an extremely useful and worthwhile inquiry. We were all pleased to be able to participate because-let us face itdemocracy is a fragile flower and our Constitution is the foundational structure which makes sure that we are the wonderful country that we are. That is why any attempt to tamper with our Constitution or processes ought to be carefully scrutinised.",163

159,Mr DREYFUS,COMMITTEES,I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Main Committee for debate. Question agreed to. WILD RIVERS (ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Abbott.,164
160,Mr ABBOTT,COMMITTEES,"The Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2010 is, I would like to think, an important and significant attempt to give the Indigenous people of Cape York back their birth right, because the Queensland government, through the application of the wild rivers legislation to the rivers of Cape York, has effectively taken away from the Indigenous people of Cape York the ability to use what we say is their land in the way that they would like. We understand, throughout this parliament, that the great challenge is to ensure that Aboriginal people have the same economic opportunities that other Australians do. We understand that the great challenge is to enable them to use their land not just as a spiritual asset but as an economic asset, because, if they cannot use their land, it is not really theirs. That is the problem with the Queensland wild rivers legislation. In moving the historic apology two years ago, the Prime Minister said: … unless the great symbolism of reconciliation accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong. In making that statement, the Prime Minister was absolutely right: unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong. Yet, paradoxically, on the same day that the Rudd government subscribed to the International Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Bligh government in Queensland applied the wild rivers legislation to the significant rivers of Cape York-effectively blocking Aboriginal people from developing their land in the catchments of the Archer, Stewart and Lockhart rivers in Cape York. I lead the Liberal and National coalition in this parliament. The Liberal and National parties in this parliament are the traditional defenders of the rights of the states, but the truth is that where a state government has erred in a very significant way and where the national government has the ability to correct that error, it should do so. Under section 51(xxvi) of the Constitution we in this parliament have the power to make laws for the people of any race, and I think we should make laws to ensure that the Indigenous people of Cape York are given back their birth right in respect of their land. That is why I have moved this private members' bill. As I said, the great challenge is to ensure that Aboriginal people are not just honoured as the first citizens of this country, are not just honoured as the first Australians, but actually enjoy full participation in our society. They will never enjoy full participation in our society if they are not able to start a business, to own a home and to earn an income in the same way that other Australians take for granted. Yet how can they do that if in the land that they love, in the land where they and their ancestors have lived for milis lennia, they are prevented by yet another layer of bureaucracy from doing what the rest of us take for granted? That is why this legislation is important. I know that the last thing the Rudd government would want to do is to pick a fight with the Bligh Labor government in Queensland, but I think the Prime Minister was sincere when he made that apology. I think he was sincere when he said that the symbolism of the apology had to be accompanied by practical action to help Aboriginal people to lead a better life. So, in the spirit of bipartisanship, in the same spirit in which the Prime Minister invited the then opposition leader to participate in the war cabinet on housing, I invite the Prime Minister to think seriously about making time for this legislation to be debated and voted upon. If he thinks there is a better way of doing it, I am not proud. I am happy to concede a better way of doing it, but something must be done- (Time expired) Bill read a first time. Ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Sexualisation of Girls in the Media",164
161,Ms RISHWORTH,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the House: (1) notes with concern the increasing sexualisation and objectification of girls in mainstream media; (2) recognises that both media and peer influences contribute to the sexualisation of girls including: (a) television, music videos, magazines, music lyrics, movies, cartoons, clothing, toys, computer games and the internet; and (b) attitudes of peers and family; (3) notes with concern the potential negative consequences of the sexualisation of girls on children and young adults, including negative body image, eating disorders, low self esteem, mental illness, poor physical health and gender role stereotyping; (4) believes further research is necessary to understand the full effects that early sexualisacould tion and objectification of girls in the stream media has on children and young adults; (5) urges governments, publishers, broadcasters, advertisers, retailers and manufacturers to: (a) work together to review and develop appropriate standards and industry guidelines to address the sexualisation of children and limit its negative impact; and (b) assist parents and children to understand and manage the influence of sexualisation of girls in the mainstream media and associated negative consequences.",166
162,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Is the motion seconded? Ms Vamvakinou-I second the motion.,166
163,Ms RISHWORTH,COMMITTEES,"I am very pleased to rise tonight to move this motion, because the increasing sexualisation of our girls through mass media has become of increasing concern to me. Having raised this issue publicly over the last few weeks, I have come to appreciate that this is a concern shared by many people-most of all, parents who feel that they are at a loss when it comes to moderating the images and the messages that their children are exposed to. Whether it is the Bratz dolls, who are wearing fishnets, heavy makeup and boob tubes and are targeted at young girls, the music video clips that depict women gyrating around fully clothed male singers that play alongside the Saturday morning cartoons or the pre-teen magazine as for sexy lingerie, we have all seen confronting examples of disturbing messages that are being sent to young children through the mass media: a message that is telling women and girls that being sexy is the only thing that defines who they are. My own decision to speak out publicly on this issue was made after watching many of my friends trying to navigate through this area with their own children. Through them. I see that ensuring that the messages that main- their children were exposed to were age appropriate was becoming more and more difficult. It goes without saying that it is not just children who are absorbing messages from general advertising, but what I find particularly disturbing is the increasing stronger and more persistent message being sent to girls through toys, magazines, clothes, cartoons and the internet that they need to be sexual objects. A very topical illustration of thisand this has been reported on recently-is the My-Minx website, which is gaining popularity amongst pre-teen girls. On this website young girls are encouraged to create their online profile, or avatar, selecting features like breast and lip size, as well as skin colour and hairstyle. This online persona, or Minx, is then required to be dressed and can buy lingerie and designer clothes from outlets using fake ‘pink pounds' from an account which needs to be topped up with mobile phone credit. Having dressed their persona, users can then take their Minx to clubs, earn money by working as a stripper and increase their Minx's happiness rating by getting plastic surgery. I think everyone in this House would find that is not the message that we want to be sending to our young children. While adults are hopefully capable of critically reflecting on and evaluating games such as this one and other general advertising, we know that younger children are more likely to accept the behaviour depicted in these false realities and, through the mass media, more generally accept it as a norm. It is not difficult to understand and see that exposure is having a negative influence on both young girls' self-perceptions and relationships to peers. The findings of research and academic work into the consequences of the sexualisation and objectification of young girls are quite alarming. In response to public concern in this area, the American Psychological Association recently outlined the impacts that it can have: negative self esteem, appearance anxiety, eating disorders, more depressed moods and depression, and negative effects on cognitive functioning. Certainly, in some accounts that I have heard these have a significant impact on a young person's life. From the correspondence and support I have received, I know that these fears are shared by many. To mention just one, I would like to mention Mr Andrew Lines, a teacher from a school in my electorate who recently contacted me, highlighting his concerns about the effect that objectification of women in the mass media is having not on women but on the attitudes of young boys, especially in the way he sees them treat girls and women. Mr Lines's concerns have prompted him to develop a school program called The Rite Journey, which seeks to help young people develop into self-aware, responsible and resilient adults. Since raising this issue I have been overwhelmed by the support of parents, psychologists, teachers and authors who have expressed their support and concern. In particular I would like to thank and acknowledge Dr Amy Slater, a researcher from the Flinders University near my electorate, for her assistance and patience in helping me understand some of these complex issues and the negative impacts that will be felt by the next generation. In collaboration with her colleague Professor Marika Tiggeman, Dr Slater is conducting much-needed research this into the negative impacts on young people of this disturbing message. This motion before the House recognises that this is a complex issue, but it also recognises that, as a society, we need to start actively addressing this issue.",166
164,Ms LEY,COMMITTEES,"There are many wise words about how a childhood shapes a man or woman irrevocably and for life. One of my favourites comes from Nigerian author Ben Okri, who said: We plan our lives according to a dream that come to us in our childhood, and we find that life alters our plans. And yet, at the end, from a rare height, we also see that our dream was our fate. Our job as parents and leaders in society and the community is to make sure that we do everything possible to ensure that positive dreams come to our young peopleespecially our girls-and I think that that quote provides a good sense of the critical importance of childhood and the way it shapes a future. The sexualisation of girls is all around us and it is damaging our youth-bras and wetshine lip gloss for five year olds; see-through lace, Tweety Bird G-strings, plunging necklines and full make-up kit.s for eight-to-12 year olds. It even leads through to the car advertisements, where we see a man who gets the top-of-the-line sports car and then a glamorous woman to ride in it-two possessions to be acquired. Sexualisation occurs when a person's value comes only from his or her sexual appeal or behaviour to the exclusion of other characteristics and when a person is portrayed only as a sex object. This debate is not about sexual liberation-the freedom of women to have the sexual relationships they choose where and when they choose-we all have our individual views about these things. What this is about is the corporate exploitation of children's sexuality. It is not the sexuality itself but the sickening falsification and then the mass marketing of children as sexual beings that hurts us all. I had a look at the current issues of Dolly and Girlfriend. ‘Dolly doctor' this month has been asked about how you get rid of cellulite, how you get rid of big breasts, how you get rid of the freckles on your face and how you get surgery to get rid of the scars on your knees. The cover of the February issue of Girlfriend, which I think is only aimed at primary school and early high school, has a girl of somewhere between 13 and 23-the level of airbrushing makes it impossible to tell-wearing an off-the-shoulder dress and a come-hither look. One of the stories featured is how to be the girl who gets the guy that everyone wants. As a society we are visually absorbed; it all about how you look. And to a certain extent we recognise and lament this fact, and some of us from time to time feel the need to embrace it and jump on the bandwagon. It is a hugely conflicted and contentious area that challenges women of all ages, but it should not challenge children. Children are being bombarded with huge volumes of graphic sexual content and they simply do not have the maturity to process or understand the images or the messages. What are young girls to make of all this? There is a clear message which associates physical appearance and buying the right products with being sexy and successful. These lessons learned early will shape identity values, sexual attitudes and the capacity to love and connect with other people. A woman I know who is the mother of three girls recalls when her oldest, who is now 25, came to her when in primary school, wanting to know why she was not as pretty and little as the girls on TV. Teen clothing manufacturers have introduced a zero size for women in America. What does that say to women-that anything in a positive number is a failure? Could we imagine a zero size for men? The message that our mass media and, more importantly, the advertisers who are their revenue stream, are giving to children is that sex has nothing to do with pleasure, desire or intimacy and everything to do with the things you consume and the things you buy. In this universe, the space in our brain where we should be developing sympathy and understanding is not nearly as important as the space in our shopping malls. When children are imbued with adult sexuality, it is imposed on them rather than chosen by them. There is so much evidence of the sexualisation of women and girls in television, music videos, movies, magazines and sports media. The next step is selfobjectification, where girls actually think of is their own bodies as objects to satisfy others' desires, as objects to be evaluated for their appearance. The research tells us that sexualisation and objectification undermine confidence, comfort and self-esteem, leading to a host of negatives: shame, anxiety and selfdisgust. This in turn leads to eating disorders and depression. There is evidence that young women who hold the conventional feminine beliefs-avoiding conflict and valuing being nice, sweet, pretty and thin-are more likely to be depressed. This debate is about the current and future emotional, physical and psychological health of our girls. In telling our girls they can be anything, are we actually demanding that they be everything? In a world where girls face paralysing pressure to be perfect and where competitive pressures shape such a large part of who we are, surely we can allow girls the freedom to be children.",167
165,Ms VAMVAKINOU,COMMITTEES,"I would like to begin by congratulating the member for Kingston for bringing to the House this evening this very important motion on the sexualisation and objectification of girls in the mainstream media. The relationship between modern media and our children is of ever-increasing importance to us all. It is a complicated issue that becomes more challenging as the media and corporate interests seek new and innovative ways to influence and encourage the thoughts and behaviour of children and, in particular, young girls. I speak to this motion this evening as a mother of two teenagers. I am keenly aware of this issue and watch with a degree of anxiety as both my children grapple with the pressures of their adolescence. I watch as they try to keep up with the latest fads and fashions, and I have watched with concern as they and their peers have been enticed by the many forms of media that target them and attempt to sell them images and lifestyle choices that are well beyond their years. As parents we strive to make our children feel happy and confident despite the media's constant influence on their image and lifestyle choices. But it is a difficult battle that you are also up against peer group pressure, which is itself heavily influenced by television, the fashion industry, the IT industry and of course the internet. Most vulnerable to these pressures are young girls, and it is my 15-year-old daughter and her peers that I have in mind when speaking to this motion. It is the fragility of how they perceive themselves physically and how that relates to their sense of self-esteem and self-worth that is the essence of this motion tonight. Children begin to pick up messages at a very young age. Therefore the messages we as parents and as a society send them become critical to their development. The level of sexualisation and objectification of young girls in particular needs scrutiny from this House precisely because it can have negative consequences, consequences that we all know about and are concerned about: negative body image that leads to eating disorders, low self-esteem that can lead to mental illness, and gender role stereotyping that can lay many traps for the unsuspecting young mind still in the developmental phase. I recall some years ago standing in the children's clothing section of our local Kmart store. I was mortified to see hanging on the racks little bralettes, with matching undies, on sale for girls as young as five. While some see this as cute and harmless, it is actually a new frontier in children's fashion. I objected to the availability of this attire for young girls, yet many parents would have bought it, encouraged further by the many glossy girlie magazines and supermodel reality TV shows that reinforce and in fact normalise and set the trends that make their way onto the clothes racks of our stores. Wellmeaning parents become unwittingly complicit in the sexualisation and objectification of their young girls. I am not suggesting we should regulate given the personal choices parents make for their children's day-today dress. But I do urgently wish to pose the questions: is this acceptable; what are the societal outcomes of dressing girls as young as five in bralettes or bras; and who is accountable? In its report Sexualisation of children in the contemporary media, the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Communications and the Arts made a number of important findings. The report said: Narrow or stereotypical portrayals of body type, beauty and women were commonly identified as the major source of sexualisation of children. While the report acknowledged methodological limitations in accurately linking the media and the sexualisation of children, it noted: … the report's findings may be cautiously applied to at least conclude that some level or prepondervanced ance of sexual material in advertising and media content has the potential to contribute to, and perhaps even cause, emotional and physical damage to children. Many of the submissions to this inquiry were from individuals, grandparents and parents. As one parent submitted: Childhood is a time of joy and innocence, and should be an absolute right for all our children. They become adults soon enough, and childhood is a time to be cherished. I strongly agree with this. Ultimately, however, this issue is about responsibility. This motion is important because we have a collective responsibility as legislators to hold to account those who influence but also profit from children and young people. It is their responsibility to adhere to appropriate standards and industry guidelines. We must therefore work together with the industries concerned so that children and parents can be assisted in managing and understanding the influence of sexualisation of girls. Ultimately our aim must be to give our children and indeed our young people every chance(Time expired)",169
166,Mr SIMPKINS,COMMITTEES,"I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution tonight on this fine motion on the sexualisation of girls in the media. I have enjoyed being able to hear what the previous speakers have said, to make sure that I do not go over the same ground. As a father of two girls, aged 11 and seven, these are exactly the sorts of things that concern me. I am sure that I am like all parents, particularly all fathers, out there across country. You have to be on your guard the whole time. No matter where you go, there is the potential to encounter the sexualisation, the rapid onset of adult themes, that face young people, our children. You only need to be sitting in the car listening to commercial radio and you hear some of those abhorrent as from AdMedical Institute, or whoever they are, about nasal delivery systems. It seems that you can hear those as on the radio at whatever time of day you might happen to have your children in the car with you. We must always be on our guard against those things. Fortunately, in the area where I usually this have my kids in the car with me, we do not have the sorts of billboards that seem to be so prevalent in the major cities over here on the east coast. Some of the things that are up on those billboards I do not want to have to explain to them. I do not want my 11-yearold or, worse, my seven-year-old saying to me, ‘What does that mean?' I do not want them to be asking those sorts of questions. We must be on guard against these sorts of images, these sorts of ideas. Also, particularly as legislators, we should give careful consideration to what is authorised. Another problem area is Facebook. I have recently become aware that there are some very young children with Facebook profiles. Let us face it, there is quite a deal of adult conversation on social networking sites. As a parent, I regularly look over the shoulders of my kids when they are on the internetwhen I am in town. They do not have a Facebook profile. I am very glad that they are more into horsy websites and things like that-pretty positive stuff or, at least, not harmful stuff. But it is important to keep an eye on that. It is also important to look at filters. Parents should invest in filters to make sure that, while they are not looking over their children's shoulders, safety for their children is still available. Some TV shows are also worth considering, particularly those after 7.30 or eight o'clock at night, such as Two and a Half Men. Really, these are not shows for children at all. We should not be letting our 10and 11-year-olds look at this stuff. They do not even understand what the concepts are. I was at school one day last year for my daughter's year 1 class, and one of the boys made a comment that I thought was somewhat offensive and obscene. I will not mention the boy's name, but I said to him, ‘Do you want me to tell your mother that you said that?' and he backed off immediately. He did not appear to know what he had actually said. Later, I heard from a sibling that they had been watching Two and a Half Men the night before. It just shows that being on guard is always required. I would also like to mention another bane of my existence, and that is swearing. I am one of those people who think that if you want to swear in front of your kids, if you want to use the ‘F' word or worse in front of your children, then you can expect nothing else but that they will use that language in the future. I think a lot of people inflict probis lems on their children by not showing a bit of self-control in that regard. The dangers are all around, and parents should stand up to the mark. At the same time, we should look at some of the things that we allow to be out there in front of them. I thank the member for Kingston for bringing this motion forward.",170
167,Ms BURKE,COMMITTEES,"I think this is a very worthy motion, and it is something I have pursued in previous parliaments. I congratulate the member for Kingston for looking at this vital area. As a mother of a 10-year-old child, I, like many speakers before me, deal with this on an ongoing basis. My daughter is, of course, gorgeous, as all our children are, and I am terrified for her on a daily basis. My husband says we are going to homeschool her from the age of about 12. But this cannot be done. I cannot wrap her in cotton wool and I cannot protect her from everything in life. We as a government cannot wrap the nation's children in cotton wool, but we do need to do things to ensure that our children get a childhood and that they do not get bombarded with images that lead to negative thoughts that can lead to dangerous areas like eating disorders. Eating disorders is an area I have pursued in this parliament, and I want to commend the government for taking action on it. I will get to that in a minute. My 10-year-old child was given a dreaded Bratz doll. She burst into tears because she thought her father would take it off her because he had previously told her that Barbie was ‘Satan'. This was pretty bad, as she attended the Syndal Baptist childcare centre and had said she could not have Barbie because Barbie was Satan-because my husband was of the view that it was such a negative image that we should not have it. Lo and behold, her birthday party arrived, and there the dreaded Bratz doll, with the unbelievably large lips. Anyway, we took the Bratz doll and we have lived with the Bratz doll. We have lived with Total Girl, a magazine aimed at small children, which has pin-up posters of boys and things and also cute kittens and giveaways to attract 10-year-olds to pick it up in the store. We have had the dreaded High School Musical 1, 2 and 3. I recommend them to all of you highly-not! Again, it is bombardment with images of what my child should perceive herself to be. I want my child to be herself. That is a really dreadful thing to ask of any child, and it is a very hard lesson to learn, but we have to teach her resilience so she can get there. We had the dreaded experience of going into a store to buy her an outfit, and a woman saying she looks so grown up. I do not want her to look grown up. I want her to look 10! That is all I require. I want her to have a childhood. I do not want to mollycoddle her, I do not want her to not be a feminist, but I believe that she, like all our children, deserves to enjoy this precious time and not have the mass media somehow consume and take it away from her. In the previous parliament, I called on the former government to take seriously the issue of body image and eating disorders. A lot of the research demonstrates that this sexualisation, this constant bombardment with what you are meant to look like, does have serious negative consequences for many young women and, increasingly, young boys. The AMA, in its most recent report, states: Eating disorders are serious psychiatric illnesses. The prevalence of eating disorders among children and adolescents is rising. to assess exactly how common eating disorders are (as many cases may go undiagnosed) it is estimated that one in 100 adolescent girls develop anorexia nervosa, and that it is the third most common chronic illness in girls, after obesity and asthma. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) state that eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness, with a death rate higher than that of major depression. And we treat this illness with contempt. We do not take it seriously, we do not fund its research and we do not treat it as an illness, which it is. I commend the Rudd Labor government for finally realising that we need to do something about it. Last year the Minister for Health and Ageing announced funding of $3.5 million over four years to tackle the growing epidemic of eating disorders, including $500,000 for the Butterfly Foundation to establish a national eating disorders collaboration. I have dealt with the Butterfly Foundation for many years, and I again want to congratulate Claire Vickery, the CEO and founder of the foundation, who has been committed to raising the issue of eating disorders and how people end up in this terrible spiral. Nothing had been done for many years, and now we are doing more. In addition, the federal Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth has tackled this issue, appointing a national advisory group on body image. She received their first report in October 2009. The report notably called for the development of a voluntary code for body image. A lot of this needs to be done on a voluntary basis. There is a lot of angst in the debate. Clive Hamilton, who in 2006 put out a report entitled Corporate paedophilia, raised the issue, and more needs to be done.",171
168,The SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next While it is difficult sitting. NA,172
169,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mobile Phone Services",172
170,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"Widgee is a community of fewer than 700 people located 24 kilometres west of Gympie in my electorate. Widgee does not have mobile phone coverage and, in spite of its relatively small population, a petition calling on the Australian government to install mobile phone coverage for the Widgee community has attracted 1,181 signatures. The Petitions Committee has determined that this petition does not meet the technical requirements, so I seek leave to table it as a document. Leave granted.",172
171,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the House. Part of the reason why the petition attracted so many signatures is Widgee's popularity because of local events, including the Widgee Bushman's Carnival in May, the Widgee Pony Club Annual Gymkhana and Campdraft in June, the endurance trail ride in July and Bush Balladeers festival on the last weekend in October. The Widgee community has identified three possible sites for a mobile phone tower, including the Amamoor State Forest, where a temporary mobile phone tower is located every year for the Gympie Music Muster; a local landowner has offered land where emergency services towers are already erected; and the old forestry tower might be an option, located in the state forest. Telecommunications companies should recognise that they have a social obligation to extend services and to roll out telecommunications services even in less economic regional communities. But the government should also have a role. The former coalition government understood that telecommunications companies could not always be relied upon to improve mobile phone coverage and access to broadband in regional areas. That why, when in government, the coalition created the original mobile phone black spots program, which improved mobile phone coverage in communities where it was not commercially viable for telecommunication companies to make those investments. Regular reviews of the adequacy of the network, such as the Estens review and the Glasson review, identified gaps that needed to be filled. Approximately $175 million was provided by the previous government to extend mobile phone coverage through this program, delivering mobile phone coverage to upwards of 230 regional and rural communities and along stretches of at least 34 highways. Regrettably, the new federal government has not funded the Glasson review's recommendations, which could have helped little communities like Widgee obtain that mobile phone coverage that they need. The former government also established a $2 billion the Communications Fund that was to be invested and the earnings used to improve a range of communications services in rural and remote communities. Regrettably, the federal government has taken this money for its NBN program, which now will not be extended to regions with small populations like Widgee. The government has a responsibility to ensure that people living in regional communities have access to fast, reliable communications services. Instead of spending more than $43 billion on broadband in the capital cities, taxpayer funded improvements across a whole range of communications services should target communities where it is not commercially viable for these services to be provided by the private sector. Accordingly, I appeal to the government to help Widgee in its quest for mobile phone coverage. I thank the Widgee community for organis ising this petition and all those who put the effort into collecting the signatures. They have been campaigning for mobile phone coverage for a number of years. I have raised their plight with Telstra and other telecommunications companies, and there have been times when I thought they were on the list and that one day soon they might get the mobile phone coverage that they want so much. The loss of the black spots funding was a critical blow. Communities like this one are never going to be likely to be commercially viable as far as the telecommunications companies are concerned, so there will need to be some support to enable them to receive mobile phone coverage. I call on the government to acknowledge this petition and to work with me and the Widgee community to establish permanent mobile phone coverage for the Widgee region. Victorian Bushfires",173
172,Mr HAYES,ADJOURNMENT,"It was just one year ago that I joined with my colleagues from all sides of the parliament in supporting a condolence motion in relation to the devastating Black Saturday bushfires. These fires will be eternally etched in our nation's history, given that this was Australia's worse natural disaster. It claimed a staggering 173 lives, destroyed more than 2,000 houses, left thousands homeless and crushed whole towns and communities. On this first anniversary of this tragedy that shook a nation, I would like to place on record my thoughts and prayers for the victims of the Victorian bushfires, for their friends and families, and for their loss of life or their loss of loved ones. This is something that should always stay with us. They should know that they are not forgotten, and certainly their spirit is admirable. I am proud to be a member of this government, which has committed to doing whatever is possible to help rebuild lives and communities and doing so in a bipartisan matter. In particular, I would like to congratulate Parliamentary Secretary Bill Shorten for his hard work and dedication to these devastated communities. I also praise the efforts of my parliamentary colleagues, in particular the member for MCEwen, who has been working very closely with the community in this difficult rebuilding phase. During my speech last year I touched on my gratitude for all those people who contributed in many ways in situations that most of us will not experience or understand ourselves. I spoke about those who provide counselling services and financial services, and the many volunteers who gave so willingly of their time. I also take this opportunity to praise our wonderful emergency services personnel, including our ambos, firefighters and police who held all those in need. They were, at this time last year, fighting to contain the remaining fires, sifting through the rubble of houses looking for bodies, providing medical assistance for those who were injured, hunting down arsonists and undertaking the very grim task of formally identifying those who tragically perished. I want to say to them that their tireless contributions are deeply valued by our community at large. I know, through my close association with police across this nation, that after being through devastating events such as the bushfires people just do not switch off. This stuff actually stays with you. The unprecedented nature of these fires, in particular, has meant that the welfare of many of the police in Victoria has required close monitoring. I have spoken several times about the difficult and dangerous nature of the role that police play in our community and the need to support our police, and once again I say that it is essential that we continue to protect those who unselfishly give of their time and efforts to protect our communities. Let us not forget that the Victorian police, like many of the victims, are still reminded of the tragedy on a daily basis. Police are continuing to investigate the deliberately lit Black Saturday bushfires. I understand from reports in yesterday's Age that the Victorian police have so far put in about 106,300 hours of investigative work into the bushfires. The task force investigators have already taken 4,000 statements from witnesses and are expected to take a further 500 to 1,000 statements over the coming 12 months. Police have already, as we know, arrested two suspects in relation to two of the three bushfires that they believed were deliberately lit, and are chasing several leads into others, and they are confident that those responsible will be brought to justice. No matter how long it takes to bring the people responsible to justice, I know that the commitment and the ongoing work of the Victorian police is deeply appreciated by the community and by the nation and that they will stay in our thoughts for the efforts that they have undertaken on behalf of our community at large. Green Loans Program",174
173,Mr LAMING,ADJOURNMENT,"Bowman) (9.39 pm)Children around the land for the last decade have been taught that the great future in jobs is green jobs. We have seen Prime Minister Howard's Green Corps; we have seen Tony Abbott's Green Army. But the true disgrace, where we have seen green to the obscene, has been the Rudd government and its triumvirate of ham-fisted failures in attempting to create jobs in the green sector. We all know very well how they managed to collapse the entire solar rebate scheme; that is history I do not need to go over it. Number two, we remember how they then quintupled, not doubled or trebled, the renewable energy certificates on home solar rebates, and that caused a complete collapse in the price of RECS and a loss of confidence in the system. Then of course there was the now famous home insulation program where the government plucked $1,600 out of the air and basically farmed three-point-something billion dollars into allowing, in many cases, anyone who could get hold of a ute and a couple of mates to drive out and solicit the opportunity to get into the insides of houses and put in home insulation. What have we seen? We have seen house fires, poorly trained installers and the tragedy of four electrocutions-one of those reported today, quite tragically-because of a lack of training. We also have the anecdotes of people pushing insulation up through the manhole and then lifting a couple of roof tiles and pushing it back out again into the truck, driving off and collecting the $1,600. This is a program that is a disgrace for any government that runs it. You might have thought it could not get any worse but, alas, it has. We have the home sustainability assessment scheme, HSAS. It will reverberate in your ears, members on the other side, for the next few weeks, because you have pushed not hundreds but thousands of young Australians-small business people, part-time employed people-basically over the edge because of a program that was promised to run through to 2013 and is about to collapse in the weeks ahead. Now, there is another thing that you learn at school: it is never good to get into a sector where the government controls both the supply and demand, let alone the accreditation. But they will soon be learning that it is not ever a smart thing to take a job in any opportunity run by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett, and his and department, because what we have is not the promise-from Senate estimates in 2008-of just 1,000 to 2,000 assessors being trained, but some bright spark in that department deciding it might be a good idea to completely deregulate training altogether. We have seen stories filtering in from around the country of training organisations shoehorning hundreds of people into auditoriums, of four-day courses becoming just a DVD in the mail and now not 1,000, 2,000 or 5,000, but 10,000 assessors paying up to $3,000, and in some cases $7,000, for training, accreditation and insurance-insurance for which no claims have ever been made. We have 200,000 houses assessed. With an additional 22,000 everyday, this scheme will collapse unless this government does something in the next month. These people have put their lives on the line. They expected some certainty through to 2013. They were promised an income by training organisations of $5,000 a week, incomes that will never, ever occur. Far from listening to the warnings in August, what we now have is the reality made clear in an ABSA email sent to Minister Garrett's department on 25 August. It begins: We are fielding a very large number emails from growing numbers of increasingly disgruntled assessors. It goes on to say that they are recommending, as they have a responsibility to their sessors, that the numbers are capped from 30 September and that that advice must go out on 1 September to prevent overloading of both ABSA and the DEWHA systems and to protect the work of the assessors currently trained. What happened? Nothing. Not until January did they finally wake up in that department. That is a very long Christmas holiday. We have heard of pyramid schemes before where those who get in first get something out of it and the late entrants get nothing, what we had from this government was a GFC induced panic to try and push as many people into work as they could regardless of any obligations made in promises made in 2008 to train between 1,000 and 2,000 assessors only. What we now have is the appalling collapse of the fourth scheme under this minister and we are looking at $15 million being paid by assessors, many of whom will never recoup those costs. It is a disgrace. What do we have in emails from 22 and 29 January from ABSA to its frustrated members who cannot get membership? They say they are ‘now holding over 5,000 new applications awaiting processing' and that it is counterproductive to take any further fees nor accept applications. So there is no guarantee of any assurance of any particular volume of work. But in the end all of your money will ensure you remain a member of ABSA and that you will ‘receive ongoing communications' by email from us of further government programs. That is all that your government can offer these Australians, many of whom came home from the GFC looking for a secure occupation and got nothing but the disappointment of a Rudd generof calls and ated pyramid scheme. You expect more from a government. Running through a crisis and controlling the economy is not easy, but running a home as- sustainability assessment scheme should be. (Time expired) Climate Change  Speaker, I am sure that you, like me and a lot of other members of this House, received a lot of emails starting last year about Lord Monckton and his views on climate change. I am speaking here tonight to draw attention to an excellent article by Mike Carlton in Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald. I must say, when I first got an email suggesting that at but Copenhagen the first draft of the agreement was one that would impose world government on all signatory countries, I was a little alarmed. So I made some inquiries. Was this so? Did the first draft of the Copenhagen agreement contain, as Lord Monckton had suggested, this draft? Of course it did not. At Copenhagen there were lots of submissions-from, I think, about 160 countriesand in fact there was no draft, and no such proposal. Copenhagen has been and gone, and we still do not have world government and nor will we. Lord Monckton claims to be a mathematician. As the article points out, that is: Baloney. He has a Cambridge degree in Classics, ie Latin and Ancient Greek, and a diploma in journalism … from Cardiff. So he is no expert on mathematics, as he suggests in his interviews. He also claims that he was a ‘science adviser' to Margaret Thatcher. As the article points out, this is incorrect: Thatcher has a science degree herself; she hardly neededit says, and I agreea science adviser who didn't. Lord Monckton was hired in 1982 as a lowlevel policy adviser in her policy unit, working on public housing and the like-nothing to do with the environment; nothing to do with climate change. Lord Monckton claims that he is a member of the House of Lords. He is a lord; he is a hereditary lord. There has been a change in the UK and hereditary peers no longer automatically have the right to sit in the House of Lords. At a by-election that he contested for the Lords in 2007, he got not one vote-not one vote! Lord Monckton also claims that he has received a Nobel Prize-that he is a Nobel Prize winner. This is on the website of his grandly titled Science and Public Policy Institute, which states: His contribution to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 … earned him the status of Nobel Peace Laureate. It states he has received a: … Nobel Prize pin, made of gold recovered from a physics experiment … This, of course, is utterly false. Al Gore and the committee received the prize. Lord Monckton does not have a pin. There is no such honour as a Nobel Prize pin. So I guess the point I am making is that this guy has tremendous form in making claims about his own background. I noticed that Andrew Bolt on Insiders said, ‘But Al Gore has made mistakes.' Well, Al Gore has not falsely claimed to have received a Nobel prize. He has not falsely claimed that he was Vice President of America. He has not falsely claimed that he ran for the presidency. There seems to me to be a world of difference between that and lying about your background and then seeking credibility. What disappoints me, I suppose, is that so many people have actually put their faith in what he has to say as being gospel. It is true that Barnaby Joyce has come under some criticism in his role as shadow finance minister, but he had this to say about Lord Monckton: Obviously I and my constituency have some doubts (about the science) but when you find yourself waltzing with the fringe you should take a step back … Regrettably, last Wednesday night, the Leader of the Opposition did not take a step back; he took a step forward. He met with Lord Monckton. And what a fraud Lord Monckton is. Mission Australia's 34th Christmas Lunch in the Park",175
174,Mr IRONS,ADJOURNMENT,"On a brighter note: Christmas lunch in 2009 was an experience for me and many others in Perth that I will raise today and I will never forget. In our second week back in parliament, I hope that all our colleagues are refreshed from the summer recess and are looking forward to another hectic and busy year. The summer recess allows us as members to spend time in our electorates and also with our families. There are three major days on our calendar-Christmas Day, New Year's Day and, of course, Australia Day. I spent my Christmas Day in Wellington Square in East Perth. It was pulsing with over 1,200 guests attending this Mission Australia event. Mission Australia's annual Christmas Lunch in the Park, also known as CLIP, is held on Christmas Day and brings some Christmas cheer to Perth locals seeking a place to celebrate the festive season. As we all know, in the fun and excitement of Christmas it is very easy to forget the true meaning of the season. This lunch is held for Western Australians who are less fortunatehomeless, isolated or lonely. Christmas can be a day of uncertainty and struggle. Mission Australia's annual Christmas Lunch in the Park ensures a Christmas Day full of fun, food and friendship for 1,500 Perth locals, including volunteers. On Christmas Day, Mission Australia, along with the help of over 400 volunteers, delivered their 34th annual Christmas Lunch in the Park, and each guest received a traditional Christmas lunch, a gift from Santa, entertainment and great company. Despite temperatures of up to 35 degrees, guests had a fantastic time, thanks to the generous efforts of those 400 men and women who volunteered their time on the day and in the months leading up to the big event. I was fortunate enough to be given the privilege of hosting the lunch and, along with Perth sports presenter Adrian Barich, we launched the lunch and event with gusto. Adrian, as a former West Coast Eagle, got the crowd going with some good old home town football rivalry by asking the crowd to declare their support for the Eagles or the Dockers. On balance I would say the Eagles just won. There was plenty of entertainment on the day provided by the Perth Christian Choir and Perth opera singing duo Katherine and Justin Freind. Their singing and range of songs were just an added bonus for the day and they sang many songs that we all knew and could sing along with. They finished the day off with a version of Time to say Goodbye, which bought a tear to many an eye. Perth has been booming, with new people settling from interstate and overseas, many of whom do not have established networks or family to celebrate Christmas Day with. One young family attended the lunch for the first time, as they had no extended family in Australia after moving here from the UK. In the true spirit of the day, the family found their friendly table hosts were also from the UK and made plans to catch up again. CLIP is now one of Perth's major annual community events and a true demonstration of social inclusion. Guests ranged from single people to couples and families, some who had recently arrived in the country, and others who may have been lonely, struggling financially or homeless. I take this opportunity to congratulate all the staff and organisers of the day from Mission Australia. It is a massive project to organise and the event ran like a well oiled machine. The 400 men and women who volunteered their time on the day as table hosts must also be applauded. The people of Perth are very generous when it comes to this event and there is never any doubt the 400 host and volunteer positions will be filled. The cut-off date for the volunteer positions is usually in October, so eager and generous are the people of Perth. At the end of the day I rose to close the event and I quoted a line from the movie The Bucket List that was asked of Jack Nicholson's character. It was: ‘Have you bought joy to anyone's life today?' I then told the organisers and volunteers that they had indeed done that on this Perth Christmas Day Lunch in the Park. Mission Australia, I applaud you for your efforts and commitment to the people and families of Perth. This ongoing event is a great example of our community working together with a commitment to those who are more in need than others in our society. Modbury Hospital",177
175,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT,"On 20 March there will be a state election in South Australia, and once again Modbury Hospital is being used as a political football by the Liberal Party in South Australia. Yesterday, in an article in the Sunday Mail, the member for Sturt entered the state election fray with some political posturing in respect to the Modbury Hospital. It comes as no surprise that truth is often a casualty when you listen to the member for Sturt. That was very much the case as he tried to make the Modbury Hospital a state election issue on behalf of his state colleagues. The Modbury Public Hospital was built by the Dunstan Labor government and opened in 1973. It lies within the seat of Makin. a good hospital that serves Adelaide's northeastern community well. As with any hospital, things can go wrong from time to time. But the serious concerns with the hospital occurred under the watch of Liberal governments, both state and federal. Firstly, it Liberal government in 1995 that privatised Modbury Hospital by handing over the management of it to the private organisation Healthscope. It was under that privatisation that the hospital's service and reputation rapidly deteriorated, so much so that by the 2002 state election the local community was demanding that the state government take back administration of the hospital. So too was Healthscope, which by that time was only too willing to hand it back to the state government. In 2002 the state Labor government was returned to office and the hospital reverted to public management on 1 July 2007, when the agreement with Healthscope expired. Because of the Liberals' privatisation, Modbury Hospital was returned to public hands in a very stressed and rundown state. Labor set about restoring the hospital's reputation. But then along came the federal Liberals, and what did they do? They cut hospital funding by $1 billion. Who was parliamentary secretary for health between 2004 and 2007? It was none other than the member for Sturt. So we have a state Liberal government that washes its hands of the hospital and privatises it and, then, when the Labor government takes it back the federal Liberals cut national funding to hospitals by $1 billion. Since coming to office, the state Labor government has in fact worked methodically on reforming the whole of health system in South Australia. Using additional funding provided by the Rudd government, health services in the north-east are being restored. It is Since being elected in 2002, the Rann government has spent an additional $39 million on Modbury Hospital. That is an increase of 73 per cent. Since 2007, the Rann government has employed an extra 39 doctors and 42 nurses at Modbury Hospital. The Rann was a Labor government has also committed $12 million to infrastructure upgrades at the hospital. An additional $2.5 million has been spent on renovating the outpatient clinic areas, radiology and lift foyers. South Australia's Health Care Plan 200716 identified Modbury Hospital as both a high-volume elective surgery site and a hospital that would tailor its services to meet the needs of the ageing population in the northeastern suburbs by expanding in the areas of rehabilitation, aged care and palliative care. Modbury Hospital, while still undergoing some adjustments, is once again rebuilding its credibility and reputation. Furthermore, the hospital will be supported and complemented by a $25 million GP superclinic being built almost adjacent to it. The $25 million clinic is being jointly funded by the federal and state governments, and I am working closely with the local state members, Frances Bedford, Jennifer Rankine, Tom Kenyon and Jack Snelling, to ensure that the people of the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide have access to the best possible health services. I say ‘best possible' because we all know that we could always provide better services if there were unlimited money available or more doctors and nurses in the system. Again, it was the Howard government that limited entry places into university for doctors, and now we are playing catch up. The fact is that people in the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide know that it was the state Labor government that built the public Modbury Hospital and a state Liberal government that privatised it. It was the Rann Labor government that restored the hospital into public hands. They know that the Howard government cut hospital funding to the states by $1 billion, and it was the Rudd government that restored that funding. They also know it was a federal Labor government that increased funding for elective surgery and training of more doctors and nurses. And it is the state and federal Labor governments, working together, that will be making a $25 million commitment to health services in the north-east with the development of GP superclinic at Modbury. These are real commitments, not political spin or political rhetoric. When it comes to the Modbury Hospital, the Liberal Party has no credibility and a lot to answer for. Voters will judge them accordingly on this issue at the coming state election. Adelaide Sporting Events",178
