4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"In answer to the honourable member's questions, I beg to state1. I have no particulars regarding the alleged sweating. 2. Yesterday an - application was received by me from the Postal Department for ,£13,000 for temporary assistance, and I am now considering this application. All that is voted is j£q,ooo for this purpose, and this sum is in addition to that amount.

I suppose the object is to prevent the importation of acetic acid vinegar, and while I have no objection to the duty proposed for that purpose I suggest that it might be well later on to consider the advisableness of imposing an Excise duty on vinegar made from acetic acid to check its manufacture here.",15
7,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Trea surer) [11:9] - Paragrap h E of this item is incorrect and misleading. Acetic acid is not imported in powdered form. Acetates for the manufacture of acetic acid are, however, imported, and I move as an amendment That, after the words "" 15 per cent.,"" graph E, the words "" and on' and cember, 1007, Acetates for the manufacture of acetic acid, ad val., IJJ oer cent.,"" be added.",15

10,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,But it may be used for making acetic acid from Which the vinegar objected to is produced.,15

16,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [11.16] - The Treasurer has moved what is an entirely new item, and without any explanation expects the Committee on the spur of the moment to deal with it. I think that he ought to give us some information as to the reason for the alteration.",15
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The item, as it stood, was wrongly worded. The Department has been carefully looking through these items to guard against any mistake, and has submitted this amendment to me.",15
18,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I suppose that as long as the Department is satisfied the Committee should be satisfied. If that be so, the whole Tariff should be referred to the Department instead of Parliament being asked to deal with it.

The duty proposed is a comparatively small",15
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is this a clear case of where the price has been brought down by a duty ?,15
21,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"The honourable member is quite right. The product is made entirely from Australian articles, such as the by-products of the gas comsugpanies. The industry is also a big consumer of coal; ancl the article is made largely from Australian lime. This is a native Australian industry and we are making the product much purer than any which",15
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [ri.22] - Is the duty to be protective, or for revenue purposes ? If it is to be protective will 15 per cent, be enough?",15
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The manufacturers are satisfied.,15
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"1 5 per cent, is only a revenue duty. Is the Minister going to be content with that in the case of this important and growing industry ? My own opinion is that the proposed duty should not be agreed to. The article is manufactured from by-products, and there is abundant evidence that we can make it as cheaply as can anybody else in the world. At any rate, .we ought to be able to do so. The item should either be placed on the free list or subjected to - a small duty, say of 5 or 10 per cent. If there is to be a protective duty, 15 per cent, is too low. If there is to be a revenue duty, the proposal is too high.",15
25,Mr SOLMON,Unknown,"Laanecoorie) [11.24] Most of these products are waste products, both here and in other parts of the world. There are five manufacturers of them in Australia, and the internal competition is very keen.",16
26,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Does the honourable member know that we are exporting them?,16
27,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I know that these products are, being imported,"" and sold here at a lower price than they are sold at in the Old Land.",16
28,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,What quantity was imported last year?,16
29,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I could not say. Carbonate of ammonia is not made in Australia, yet it was the only one of these articles made dutiable in the Tariff as submitted. I am glad that the Government are prepared to impose a duty on these products. Fifteen per cent, will satisfy the manufacturers and give them the amount of protection necessary to enable them to enter into competition with the importations.",16
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If ' they are fied with 15 per cent., it is the best of all proofs that the duty is not necessary.",16
31,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"H it high or hit low, we cannot satisfy the honourable member. The honourable member uses either argument to suit the particular circumstances of his case. I believe that 15 per cent, is too low, and am prepared to vote for . 30 per cent.  is established.",16

33,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"The Australian manufacturers have to compete against products dumped from other .parts of the world, which are really the waste products .of large manufactories. It pays the manufacturer to send them to Australia for much less than they are being sold for in the Old Country. I believe the Committee will be prepared to agree to a higher duty than 15 per cent.",16
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Parramatta) [11.27] - Before I vote I want to know from the Minister whether this is to be a protective or revenue duty ?,16
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [11.28] -/The honourable member has asked the question in a tricky way. I do not consider that 15 per cent in this case is a true protective duty, but I have letters from those interested to say that they will be quite satisfied with 15 per cent. Why, then, should I propose more ? If I had proposed 30 per cent, the honourable member would have jumped over the table at me.",16
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [11.29] - The honourable member need not try to pose before people in Melbourne. I know him of old, and his prowess in that direction. Is the new protection to apply to these manufacturers? We are told that the industry is nourishing, that the works are multiplying throughout Australia, and producing an exceedingly good article, which is much superior, according to the honourable member for Fawkner, to the imported. The manufacturers are able to compete with the imported article, and even to invade foreign markets. Even protectionists believe that when there is a considerable export business, import duties are no longer effective. Here we have a case ir; which, apparently, the Australian product can compete successfully with the product of satisthe world, and yet manufacturers ask for a duty, which, of course, cannot be protective.",16
37,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The duty is to prevent dumping.,16
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member has been challenged as to the exports, and he evidently knows nothing about the matter.",16
39,Mr SALMON,Unknown,This product is being in Australia today at a lower price thanthat at which it is sold in the Old Country.,16
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Does not that afford the best .proof that no duty is required? If , in spite of this ""dumping,"" the local industry is flourishing, why impose a duty ?",16
41,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"If the home market be taken away, the industry might just as well cease at once. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - It seems to me that the manufacturers ask for the duty for the sole purpose of putting it into their own pockets.",16
42,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"No ; there is undue competition a,t the'present time, and prices are abnormally low.",17
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then I understand that the object of the duty is to raise prices ?,17
44,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,Yes ; I suppose to enable the manufacturers to carry on the industry.,17
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,JS O\V we know from the frank statement of the honourable member that the real object of the duty is to increase prices.,17
46,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,Otherwis e the factories must close.,17
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member is departing from the usual protectionist argument that duties cheapen prices. I decline to be a party to putting up prices in view of the present prosperous condition of.the industry. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 276 (Carbonic Acid Gas) agreed to. Item 277. Carbide of calcium, ad val. (General Tariff), 10 per cent.; (United Kingdom) free.",17
48,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [11.35] - This item ought to be made absolutely free. When the first Commonwealth Tariff was submitted, the proposal was to impose a duty of 20 per cent., but, after discussion, it was decided to make the item free. The official statistics show what the proposed preference to the United Kingdom is worth. The total imports from the United King- dom last year were represented by £ 1 , 4 6 9 , while the imports from foreign countries were represented by .£63,132. Carbide of calcium is used for the manufacture of acetylene, gas, which is the illuminant of many country people; and the duty simply means additional taxation to the extent of £ 6 , 3 0 0 per annum. I think I need say no more in favour of the suggestion that the item should toe absolutely free.",17
49,Mr EDWARD S,Unknown,"Oxley) [ . 6 ] Under the old Tariff, as the honourable member for Angas has pointed of calcium was free; and I think the Treasurer might give some reason for proposed duty of 10 per cent. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [11.37] --The duty of 10 per is imposed in consequence of representaTariff, tions made from persons in Queensland, from the United Kingdom. who have entered into some arrangement with the State Government for the supply of motive power . from Barron Falls. These people propose to manufacture carbide of calcium, and, as I say, it is in consequence of their representations that the duty is proposed.",17
50,Mr EDWARD S,Unknown,"Oxley) [11.38] I am much obliged to the Treasurer for condescending to give the Committee infor.so- mation which he should have afforded at the outset. However, I place no value on the information- I take it for just what T it is worth. Carbide of calcium ought to be placed on the same footing as kerosene, because it is used as an illuminant mainly by country people.",17
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"If the honourable member does not wish a duty to be imposed, I have no desire to press the matter.",17
52,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,My intention is to move that carbide of calcium be placed on the free list.,17
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I accept the suggestion.

54,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Hunter) [11.42] - I fail to see why it is proposed to levy a duty of 25 per cent, upon the artiqles enumerated in paragraph A of this item, 1 T 3 seeing that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of out, carbide only 20 per cent.",17

I point out that under the old Tariff the duty on saccharin was 550 times the the duty on sugar, being equal to 30s. per lb.; but under this Tariff its use is prohibited except for medicinal purposes. I desire to elicit the reasons why the Govern the ment have submitted this proposal.",18
60,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"For Queensland reasons also.  paraSome time ago a petition was presented 20 per to the Treasurer from the aerated water makers and brewers of non-intoxicating ales. It reads as followsWe, the undersigned aerated water makers and 14 brewers of non-intoxicant ales, desire to respectfully and urgently bring before the notice 35 of you and your Government the hardships entailed on us by the prohibition of the importation of saccharin into the Commonwealth (for other than medicinal purposes). The endorsements of the medical profession show the proAYES. perties of saccharin to be innocuous to man, only the mere fact of its having no food value can be advanced against its use. We do not pretend to sell our goods for their food value, though the sweetening oroperties of our aerated waters contain two-thirds sugar. Saccharin has been of inestimable value to us in lessening the risks of fermentation in aerated waters, and in keeping the spirit in non-intoxicating beers down, to the 2 per cent, limit allowed by the Excise. To prohibit its importation means the total exNOES. tinction of the non-alcoholic ale industry, it being impossible to keep within the limits of the Excise by the use of suear only. As a matter of fact it is claimed by all the manufacturers that they cannot produce tonic ales with less than 2 per cent, of alcohol if they have to use sugar only. What they do is to use two-thirds of sugar and one-third of saccharin, and the result is that they can keep the intoxicant percentage down to that which is prescribed 1  Wilkinson, the Victorian Government analyst, had made this statement Stringent prohibitions of the use of any saccharin in any food or beverage under extremely faeavy penalties are now in force in Great Britain. In respect of that statement by Mr Wilkinson, the petitioners sayThis is absolutely incorrect. Saccharin is prohibited in Great Britain in beer for revenue purposes, but is used freely, and to an' enormous extent, in other beverages, mineral waters' especially, and no case of any,trouble through its use has been recorded here. less. In proof of their contention, the petitioners cite an expert opinion by Thomas Stevengive son, M.D., F.R.C.P., London, lecturer on forensic medicine and chemistry at Guy's Hospital, and Official Analyst to the Home ther. Office. He s a y s Saccharin is quite innocuous when taken, in - quantities largely exceeding what in any ordinary dietary* It. does not interfere with or impede the digestive processes when taken in any practicable quantity. Our personal experience i's that saccharin may be taken for an extended period without interfering with the digestive or other bodilv functions; hence there is no reason to think that its continued use is in any way harmful. The Medical Press of the 31st October, 1888, states that "" saccharin is perfectly - wholesome""; while Dr T. Lauder Brunton declares that "" saccharin has no injurious action in man."" I have a list containing the names of scores of medical men of high repute who all claim that the use of saccharin is not injurious. I may mention that in the case of certain diseases it is prescribed because it is better than - sugar for sweetening purposes. My object is to elicit the reason why the Government have taken this extreme step, because so far as I can see it is not warranted by any statement in the .evidence given before the Tariff Commission.",18
61,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No evidence was given on this matter, except on behalf of the Department.  duty is imposed in the interests of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Committee ought to be made acquainted with the fact. If the use of the article is injurious to health, we ought' at least to be furnished by the Government with convincing testimony.",19
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [12.0] - The reasons given for the proposed duty are theseThe limitations made by this item are identical with those framed and gazetted on the nth December, 1906. The object is to pTace limitations on the use of saccharin, which is not viewed with favour by the medical faculty. The use of saccharin in the preparation of foods, .cordials, & c , is prohibited in some States. The Tariff [4 DECEMBER, 1907.] (Item 278). 6973 importation of saccharin is forbidden except for medical purposes. The Tariff Commission is very strong against its use, and the duty is their recommendation. Its use is said to be'tfery deleterious in many cases, and the local Acts of some of the States forbid its use. The health authorities are against it, and the duty is no doubt prohibitive. I hope there will not be a long debate on It is quite harm- the subject.",19
63,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Giv e way.,19
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Why 'should I way if this statement is true?,19
65,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,If that statement is true the Minister ought to go fur,19
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The proposed would be taken duty is prohibitive.,19
67,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"No , it is not.",19
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have this feeling about the matter-that it might reasonably be left to be dealt with by the States. If in some States the use of saccharin has been prohibited under local Acts, I do not see why we should waste time in discussing it, or take the responsibility for the exclusion of saccharin upon our shoulders. Attention will be drawn to the subject by the debate which we have had today, and the reasons for the proposed duty will be made known. Personally, I do not feel disposed to occupy much time about it, and if there is any serious objection to the proposed duty I will strike it out, leaving the States to deal with the matter. That seems to be the fairest thing to do. The information that the proposed duty would be prohibitive comes from the head of the Department.",19
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The duty would be prohibitive for certain purposes, but not for others. *",19
70,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The proposal is to admit saccharin for medicinal purposes only under departmental regulations.,19
71,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"If it is prohibited under the Tariff, it can be manufactured, in the country.",19
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I am disposed to strike out the provision rather than waste further time in discussing it.,19
73,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [12.5] - As the honourable member for Grey has shown, there are two widelv different opinions amongst medical authorities as to - the wholesomeness, or otherwise, of saccharin.",19
74,Mr FISHER,Unknown,They all agree that it is not a food.,19
75,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It is not a food, but certain manufacturers have found it desirable to use it in very small quantities in order to prevent the fermentation which often takes place if sugar is used, and which imparts alcohol to beverages. In some States the importation of saccharin has been interfered with really on the ground that its consumption reduces the quantity of sugar used; though that cannot be the case to any considerable extent. If its use is deleterious, we should be still admitting it for human consumption under the proposal of the Government. A duty of 30s. per lb., while it excludes. saccharin for manufacturing purposes-for use in aerated waters, for instance-woul d not exclude it for consumption medicinally.",19
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I will strike out the provision.,20
77,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,But what about the prohibition of importation ?,20
78,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That is a matter for the Department to deal with.,20
79,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Saccha rin is often used for putting in tea instead of sugar.,20
80,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"What I would be that the States should make their own regulations for the use of saccharin under their Pure Food Acts, and that the Department should do what the States desire to be done, unless there is a serious reason for doing otherwise.",20
81,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The Minister would allow saccharin to be imported for human use in the way in which possibly it 'is most largely consumed. A man who takes saccharin with every cup of tea he drinks consumes infinitely more than he would do by drinking occasionally aerated waters. So that taken in the form in which its consumption would be largest and most deleterious it is proposed to admit it ; because the duty of 30s. per Ib. would not exclude saccharin for use . in that form. The position is absolutely illogical. aerated water manufacturers would be prohibited from using it on account of its price, but people could still consume it as a substitute for sugar under doctors' orders.",20
82,Mr SALMON,Unknown,Doctor s are allowed to prescribe arsenic.,20
83,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"AV e do not exclude arsenic for manufacturing purposes. It is put in proprietary medicines. It would be absurd to exclude arsenic from being used by manufacturers of medicines, and still allow it to come in for personal consumption.",20
84,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have no doubt that a proclamation can be framed which will prohibit saccharin for use in certain cases, and admit it for use in certain other cases.",20
85,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [12.9] - I am glad that the Minister has promised to allow the duty on saccharin to be struck out. The States can do whatever may be necessary. It seems to be fairly well established that saccharin is innocuous, but if it is not the States can pass the necessary legislation to prohibit its use. In any case, if we - prohibited its importation we could not stop the English firm which manufactures and exports it from establishing a branch for its manufacture here. So that we might still have it used ir» mineral waters even if we prohibited its importation. I draw attention to a case which occurred in England in which it seems to have been shown that where the strength of saccharin was lower than 330 above the strength of sugar, it was not saccharin within the meaning of the Finance Act 1901. I draw attention to this decision in view of the possibility of the suggest importation of saccharin being regulated by the Customs Department. As the matter stands now, saccharin seems to be a constituent which is 550 above the strength of sugar. In England it has been de- tided that saccharin is not saccharin unless it is over 330 and anything up to 550. It has been held that a substance possessing a-sweetness of 329 is not saccharin. Therefore it is possible that, if paragraph B is not struck out, an inferior class of saccharin will be imported, notwithstanding our attempt to prohibit its importation. The matter was gone into thoroughly in the case of MCNicol v. Pinch, 2 Q. B. R. 1906.",20
86,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,Hunter) [12-'. 11] - It seems to me that the action of the Minister will lead to the absolute prohibition of the importation of saccharin. The Sir WILLIAM LYNE - No . Saccharin for medicinal purposes may be allowed to come in free under departmental by-laws.,20
87,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"But saccharin is used in the manufacture of aerated waters. Although the Minister has declared that the use of saccharin is injurious to health, the Victorian Pure Foods Act allows it to be used in the making of aerated waters, which honourable members, since most of them are teetotallers, should encourage. It is hardly fair that it should go abroad that saccharin is a harmful substance. After the most careful investigations, Drs. Stevenson and Woolridge stated, in an article which appeared in the Lancet on the 17th November, 1888, that they had proved conclusively thatSaccharin is quite innocuous when taken in quantities largely exceeding what would be taken in any ordinary dietary; saccharin does not interfere with or impede the digestive processes when taken in any practicable quantity; and our personal experience is that saccharin may be taken for an extended period without interfering with the digestive and other bodily functions. Hence there is no reason to think that its continued use is in any way harmful.

But there is no warrant for maintaining that saccharin is a food. Unless it is diluted before being taken, it is a very unwholesome product, in fact, dangerous if consumed in its raw state. But if saccharin were allowed to be imported freely, it would be used by unscrupulous manufacturers, not only - iri the making of aerated water, but also in the making of sweetmeats, to the injury of the health of the youth of Australia.",21

In England the local manufacture of saccharin is. regulated under the Finance Act of 1901.

Sheep dip is imported in a concentrated form, and water has to be added after its arrival; but the importer is so' anxious about the welfare of the community that a certain percentage of water is added before its arrival. Honourable members should be made aware that, not only in Victoria, but in other States, there is being manufactured sheep dip which will compare most favourably with the imported article. Honourable members may ask why the local producers do not obtain the whole of the trade. The reason is simply because, like other Australian manufacturers, they have to compete not only against enormous capital, but also against enormous prejudice. As a matter of fact, it is prejudice which prevents the local manuhe facturers obtaining the market. Only a little while ago, £10,000 worth of sheep dip was landed here at something like third below ordinary cost.  member mean by "" ordinary tost ""-the tants. selling price?",25

163,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I am giving a specific case. The importer, by reason of his greater capital, is able to employ large numbers of advertising agents; and it is in this connection that the local .manuturers facturer is seriously crippled.

178,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson) and [2.30] - Fro m the arguments which have been advanced, it appears that Australian phenyle, as a sheep wash, is far superior to the imported article. It seems to me, that the industry is one which does not require protection. If it were otherwise, the representatives of the firms which have embarked upon it would have given evidence before the Tariff Commis-. sion. To levy a duty upon insecticides, sheep washes, and disinfectants, in a country like Australia, where there are so many insect pests, is altogether out of the question. Further, any Customs impost would not induce stock owners to purchase a particular sheep wash in preference to others on account of its slightly decreased cost. Their great object is to obtain the very best sheep wash that is procurable, altogether regardless of its price. Consequently sheep washes should be admitted free. If imported sheep washes are superior to the Australian article they will command the trade, and vice versa. I hope that the Treasurer will stand firm upon this item.",26

Instead of endeavouring to increase their price to the consumer we ought to do everything in our power to lessen it. I hope that the Treasurer will not allow even one of his supporters to influence him ih this matter.,27
189,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Laanecoorie) [2.37] - I wish to read a few figures which will effectually dispose of the contention of the honourable member for Oxley that the imposition of a duty upon this item will have the effect of increasing the cost of the articles specified therein. The particular sheep wash, the price of which I intend to quote, is being manufactured in Melbourne.",27
190,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,"That information is The honourable member cannot see beyond Victoria, and a little",27
191,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"This shejep. wash is being manufactured from a recipe supof a plied by sheep-dip manufacturers in the Old Country. It is identical in every rethe spect with the dip which is imported by, Yet the price charged to in. the user for the imported article in 5-gallon. drums is 6s. per gallon, whilst the price of the Australian wash to the consumer is only 4s. per gallon.",27
192,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,The sheep-owners must be very bad judges of quality.,28
193,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The honourable member has had as much experience as has any honourable member of the benefits which flow from advertising. All that I have said about the opportunities which outside firms enjoy for ruling the people of Australia seems to have fallen upon deaf ears.,28

195,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I have spoken of onlytwo firms, neither of which are very large. They are merely struggling concerns. The 40-gallon casks containing this sheep wash from abroad are sold to the user at 5s. 6d. per gallon, whilst the Australian article is supplied to him at 3s. gd. per gallon. It will be seen, therefore, that the statement of the honourable member tor Oxley is an utterly fallacious one. Further, I hold in my hand an undertaking from the manufacturer of this particular sheep wash, that if a duty be imposed upon the imported article, he will not increase the price of the Australian article to the consumer.",28

204,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Hunter) [2.42] - It is shame that the Treasurer should listen for a moment to a suggestion to levy a duty upon this item. The articles specified in it were admitted free under the old Tariff and the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission have also recommended that they should be placed upon the list of sjiecial exemptions. Strangely enough, the free-trade section of that body recommended that they should be dutiable at 5 per cent. These facts furnish convincing evidence that the question is one which should be considered from two points of view. Various reasons have been advanced in favour of the imposition of a duty. The honourable member . for Laanecoorie has brought forward the stale argument that by adopting that course the price of the articles would not be increased. Yet we hear complaints every day that the imposition of duties under this Tariff has led to an increase in the price of goods. That circumstance, I think, effectually disposes of the honourable member's contention. . Unfortunately, we have persons coming to the precincts of the Chamber and button-holing various honourable members. From what I have noticed this morning, and also this afternoon, I suspect that the honourable member for Kooyong is in favour of. increasing this duty. ' I do not see any reason why I should not mention an incident of that sort. It is not right that this button-holing should take place. Only the other day, a man sued in a Court for the payment of a certain sum because he had influenced the votes of honourable members on items in the last Tariff.",28
205,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,We have had the principal agent of the free-traders about the premises since the consideration of the Tariff began.,28
206,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I propose to read a letter which I have received from a gentleman who is interested in the question of sheep dips and disinfectants, and who represents Arnold's Balsam Co. If this industry is fairly established in Australia d I think we have good ground to believe that it is-ther e is no reason why a protective duty should be imposed. The Chairman of the ' A section of ,the Tariff Commission quoted the evidence of Mr E. Dearman. I notice that the witness stated that this article was not produced in quite such a large way. as it might be, and the reason which he gave for that state of things was not the want of a duty, but simply the fact that people would not buy the local article. He asserted that' not only a was there a prejudice against the local article, but that it existed to such an extent that the local article was sold under an English name, so that the imposition of a duty has very little to do with the matter. My correspondent, who represents Arnold's Balsam Co., saysWe are importers of "" phenyle,"" mentioned in the .Tariff as a saponaceous compound of cresylic acid, carbolic acid, tar, &c. The duty proposed is 6d. per gallon. For years this has been made in the different States from coal tar, to be had in large quantities from the gas-works. The formula is simple, very little labour required. It is sold in Melbourne by Chas. Atkins and Co., 472 Flinders-street, at is. 4^d. per gallon, and Morris and Ladwig, Prahran, at the same price. The cos't to make will work out at under is. per gallon. In our opinion there is JIO necessity for a duty; the freight is sufficient protection.",28
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"On e fellow saw the honourable meiriber for Kooyong, and the other fellow saw the honourable gentleman.",29
208,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"This man did not see me; but he forwarded to me this letter which I have quoted in support of my argument. He states that, in his opinion, there is no necessity for a duty, and that the freight is quite sufficient protection to the local manufacturers. When an item of this kind is brought under consideration, it is only right that the Committee should hear both sides of the question. The letter I have read represents one side of this - question, and if honourable members wish it, I am prepared .to quote from several letters which I have received, and which will support an argument to the contrary effect. I have received a letter from MCKellan & Ramsay, chemical manufac^ turers, of 62 and 64 Bouverie-street, Carlton, with a town office at 317 Little Collins-street, Melbourne. No doubt, honourable members will recognise that the writers are quite capable of expressing an opinion. They write in these termsWe write to bring under your notice a gross tinomaly which affects the disinfectant and sheep dip manufacturers. Under the present Tariff, coal-tar oil and carbolic acid, both formerly free, are now dutiable at 6d. per gallon, wherens disinfectants and sheep dips are admitted free. Coal-tar oil and carbolic acid form the raw materials in our manufactures, and thus we have the absurd anomaly-ra w material, duty 6d. per gallon, manufactured article admitted free. We would respectfully ask that the duty on coal-tar oil and carbolic acid (our_ raw material) he, at once removed, and a duty placed on disinfectants and sheep di""s, and the duty on saponaceous mixture of creosote increased, local manufacturers (numbering at least nineteen in Victoria) could easilv manufacture enough disinfectants and sheep dips to supply the. of the Commonwealth, if they were protected. There are one or two matters to which I desire to draw the attention of honourable members. A manufacturer of sheep dips and phenyle writesRegarding item 279 in the Tariff, we wish to bring before your notice the anomaly, of placing the duty of od. per gallon on carbolic acid and tar o i l , while allowing sheep dips and phenyle to come in free. All phenyles as Little's, Jeyes' fluid, Quibell's, & c , and all liquid sheep dips such as Cooper's, Quibell's, &c.,' are made by treating carbolic acid and iar oil with soda to make soluble, then dissolving with resin. We do an extensive business in the manufacture of sheep dips and phenyle, and our manufactures are identical in composition with the above brands. In importing tar oil and carbolic acid we have to pay 6d. per gallon duty. We then mix with soda and resin as above explained and manufacture into sheep dip and phenyle. By instructing the manufacturers of carbolic acid and tar oil to neutralise them with soda ancl dissolve with resin it comes in free either as sheep dip or phenyle. This anomaly works out very unfairly, and as the phenyles and liquid sheep dips are made from carbolic acid and tar oil, the whole group of products should be either free or dutiable. Here is a gentleman who is arguing in one instance in favour of a duty, and who recommends that the whole group of products should be, as he puts it, ""either free or dutiable."" He goes on to sayThe analyses of duty free Little's phenyle and Cooper's sheep dip, as undernoted, wiil indicate this very plainly :Little's Phenyle. Tar oil ... ... ... 40 per cent. . Water ... ... 40 „ „ Soda ... ... ... 6 „ „ Resin ... ... ... 14 „ „ Quibell's Sheep Dip. Tar oil ... ... ... 30 per cent.

Carbolic acid ... ... 18 „ „ Water ... ... ... 23 „ „ Soda ... ... ... 8 „ „ Resin ... ... ... iS ,, ,, I have several other letters in my possession, but no doubt most honourable members have received a copy of each letter, and studied its contents at their leisure. This is another instance in' which, for the sake of bolstering up a few miserable manufacturers within the limits of the cities, our great primary industries are to as the be taxed. We know very well that these disinfectants and sheep dips are vvhat might whole almost be called the raw material of the wool-growers. For that reason alone they should be able to purchase them as cheaply as possible. The honourable member for Laanecoorie has attempted to argue that if we place a heavy duty on the articles, they will become cheaper, but I think I have shown' conclusively that his argument was entirely without any weight. I am opposed to the imposition of a duty. The Minister, in his wisdom, has proposed that the article should be free. The Chairman of the Tariff Commission made no comment on the matter: very little evidence was placed before him. Every one knows that the Treasurer is the last man to show want of backbone. If any one can sit tight and fast he can do so. I trust that on this item he will sit tight and fast as he has done on other occasions, and will refuse to have his schedule altered.",29
209,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Macquarie) [2.59] - I wish to protest against the sweepine generalities in which the honourable member for Hunter has indulged. He has spoken about this being a petty and miserable manufacturing industry confined to the limits of a. few cities. The manufacture of disinfectants and sheep dips is so easy that they are made in many country towns in New South Wales. Apart from several manufactories in Sydney, there is a company operating in Bathurst. The question of the duty on creosote and tar oils was involved in the question of the duty on sheep dips, but now that these oils have been made free, it is only consistent on'the part of the Government to impose an effective protective duty. on disinfectants and sheep dips, particularly on the latter. The honourable member for Hunter mentioned the constituent parts of certain sheep dips without making any deduction from them. The deduction is that the constituent parts of the local article go to show that it is much stronger and much more efficacious than the imported article, and it is sold at a cheaper price. The imposition of a duty could not possibly have the effect of raising the because, as I mentioned, almost any one can make the article. The manufacturers give the whole formula without any reservation so that any one can obtain the material parts and mix the dip for themselves. If any-. thing calls for a duty I maintain that this article does - The imported article is decidedly inferior to that which is locally made.",30
210,Mr WILSON,Unknown,Does the honourable memstatementber mean to say that Quibell's dip is ferior to the lqcaJly-made article?,30
211,Mr CARR,Unknown,"I da The honourable member, as a medical practitioner knowing the value of these ingredients, should be aware of that.",30
212,Mr WILSON,Unknown,A medical practitioner is not supposed to know anything about sheep dips.,30
213,Mr CARR,Unknown,"I should have thought that the rudiments of medicine ' would have taught a man the value of these materials, and that one who professed to know anything about medicine would be aware that when certain constituents appear in a certain mixture of greater, strength than in another mixture-presumin g that strength is desired-the stronger must be the more efficacious. No harm has ever been done by the local article, though it is stronger than the imported dip. I . strongly support the demand for a duty.  commendation of the Tariff Commission with regard to this item was that it should be free. It was free under the old Tariff and it is free under the Tariff proposed by the Government. I am one of those who believe that as protection is the policy of the country we should give a reasonable amount of protection on a commodity which can be manufactured in Australia. But this is a. commodity which affects the largest producing interest in the Commonwealth.",30
214,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Does the honourable member say that sheep dip cannot be made in Australia ?  thing of the sort. As it can be made in. Australia, the makers are entitled to a measure of protection. But in view of the great importance of the industry, affecting not only large sheep stations but small farmers and the bulk of the people generally-it is one which we cannot afford to trifle with. I should not have risen except for the statement of the honourable member for Laanecoorie to the effect that certain manufacturers of this commodity price in Australia were prepared to give a guarantee that the price would not be increased to the consumer. I view guarantees of that sort with a great deal of suspicion. We must take every precaution to see that the cost of these commodities is net increased.",30
215,Mr CARR,Unknown,Loca l competition will keep the price down.,30
216,Mr TALMER,Unknown,"I hold in my hand a. a copy of which has been sent into every honourable member-whic h shows the value of guarantees that prices will not be increased. As a matter of fact, the stern logic of events proves that in regard to almost every item in the Tariff, where an increased duty has been imposed, an increased price to the consumer hasfollowed. Numerous invoices have been produced in this Chamber to prove that statement. The honourable member for Laanecoorie assures us that some person who is. making these sheep dips is prepared to give a guarantee. I reply that the value of such guarantees is shown by a document that has been forwarded to honourable members by Mr. MCDougall, of the firm of Sands and MCDougall. His letter contains the following paragraphIn giving my evidence before the Tariff mission, I said that if the duty on strawafternoon board was increased by £ 1 per ton, the Australhave Ian Paper Mills Co. Pty., Limited, would increase their price for strawboard; House of Representatives has not yet dealt with that item, we have a perfect right to increase our price until such time as the duty is determined upon. In view of that statement, coming from one who gave a guarantee that the price of an article would not be increased as the result 'of a duty, what value can be attached to such a statement as has been made by the honourable member for LaaneTariff coorie? Although my vote may be at variance with what may be supposed to be protectionist policy, I am determined to cast it in such a direction that the larger interests of - this community shall not sacrificed for the benefit of the smaller ones.",30
217,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"Barker)"" [3.5] I understand that it is not possible for private member to move to increase or to add a new duty to the Tariff.

If he does, I shall have - little more to say hereafter.",31
218,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.6] - I think that there is a great deal in some of the statements which been made.

I have listened very attentively to the statements which have been made, and think that there is a great deal in them. An honourable member remarked in the course of the debate that I know something about this matter. So I do. I believe that I know as much about it as any one present, and I know that the best sheep dips are made in Australia. The bulk of them ought to be made here. There should be no importations in this line at all. It is ridiculous to say that the simple mixtures which these commodities are cannot be made in Australia.

The Minister in charge of this Tariff, with all the resources of the Government' at his command, with the recommendations of the Commission to boot, and with the assistance of Dr Wollaston and his officers, only discovers today that sheep washes can be made in Australia, and that, therefore, a duty ought to be imposed. If the be honourable member for Melbourne Ports is possessed of knowledge which is without the ken of men whose special duty it is to - investigate such matters, the Minister a ought to give him a huge salary, and ata duty tach him to the Department.",31

Only today-afte r the Chairman of the Tariff Commission has inquired into the subject, he being a strong protectionist, almost a prohibitionist in some things, and after all the resources of the Department have been utilized-it is discovered on the floor of the House that we want a high duty upon sheep washes ancl disinfectants.",31
224,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Not a high duty.,32
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I understand that what is proposed does not amount to more than about 50 per cent. That, of course, is a small duty from the honourable member's point of view. But what does he regard as a high duty? Yesterday he was clamouring for duties up to 200 per cent, and 300 per cent, to be retained. What would the honourable member regard as a high duty?",32
226,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Jus t exactly the opposite to what the honourable member would regard as a high duty.,32
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is about as reasonable an answer as could be expected from the honourable member.

232,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The Treasurer is absent just now. Who is in charge?,32
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Unfortunately , the Minister in charge of the Trade and Customs Department at present seems to be a perfect cypher in regard to the whole question.",32
234,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The Postmaster-General seems to be in charge just now.,32
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I despair of asking him for an explanation about anything. We had evidence the other day of the stores of knowledge that are wrapped up - in his cranium. I ' do not wish to go to that source of information. It is about time that the Treasurer either pleaded total ignorance in regard to most of the matters connected with the Tariff and acknowledged that he is prepared to accept the direction of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, whom he might very well attach to his Department, or investigated matters for himself. He told us that he knew all about sheep, having had to do with them all his life, and was therefore quite aware how his proposal would affect the pastoral industry. If he considered that the local manufacture of sheep dips should be protected, why did he not provide for its protection when framing the Tariff, or move in that direction when the last Tariff was under consideration. One begins to understand the criticismof the Minister of Defence, that the Treasurer seems to know nothing, about protection except when he is out of office. Now that he is in office, he has to take; his policy from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. The proposed duty is outrageously high. I am told that sheep dips are sold here at 4s. a gallon.",32
236,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The imported dips cost of the Depart- 5s. and 6s. a gallon.,32
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The pastoral industry is the basis of the prosperity of the Commonwealth, and why should we lay it under tribute, to give employment to persons in making sheep dips. We should rather take action-in the direction of cheapening all the requirements of the industry. But the Minister in the hands of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is like a marionette pulled with strings.",32
238,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [3.20] - The honTariff orable member for Parramatta has found fault with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports for suggesting the imposition of a. duty on sheep dip. Let me refresh the memory of the Committee as to what occurred when this item was uncier discussion in connection with the consideration of the old Tariff . The Treasurer was a Minis7 ter in the Protectionist Government which introduced that Tariff, the Government being supported by strong protectionists such as the then, honourable member for New England, Mr Sawers, and the then honourable member for Gwydir, the late Mr. Cruickshank. But when the item sheep dip was under consideration, Mr Sawers, who was a pastoralist, strongly supported a motion that it be placed on the free list, and that proposition was also supported by Mr Cruickshank and carried. Apparently the sheep in the large pastoral properties 'owned by the honourable member for Melbourne Port's on the shores of Hobson's Bay do not need dipping, and therefore he is ready to impose a tax on sheep dip. The Minister on the last occasion had nothing to say against sheep dip being admitted duty free. He then knew as much about' the pastoral industry as he knows now, and as much about the manufacture p f sheep dip, and yet he did not suggest that it be made dutiable. The proposed duty of 2s. per gallon is largely duty on water. As : the honourable member for Barker has pointed out, disinfectants are used in connection with other live stock besides sheep. The proposed tax would be a very heavy one on primary producers, and therefore I hope that it will not be agreed to, and that sheep dip will be placed on the free list.",32
239,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"Grampians) [35J--The Treasurer should stick to his 2 original proposal, and not spring an amendment of this sort on the Committee at a moment's notice. The honourable imember for Melbourne Ports is always ready to build up city businesses at the expense of country industries. Every farmer has to use disinfectants of one kind and another in connection with live stock, and a'medical man like the honourable member for Laanecoorie should be one of the first to encourage their use, because the greater the precautions against disease, the greater the health of the community, and of the stock, and the larger the production of the country.",33
240,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Disinfectant s used in connection with the cultivation - of plants.,33
241,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"Yes ; used for cattle, sheep, poultry and plants.",33
242,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The duty will not raise the price.,33
243,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"On e of the witnesses before the Tariff Commission guaranteed that if the duty which he suggested were agreed to, he would not raise his price. But when he found that some of his requirements had been made dutiable, he paid no regard to that statement, and increased his charges. I was also told that shortly after the Tariff was introduced, the price of a certain kind of bottle was to be increased by 2s. 6d. per gross. Those who are making sheep dips in Australia have been engaged in the business long enough to be able to do without this protection. If their dips are valuable, the pastoral and farming community will Ibuy them, because those engaged in rearing sheep know what best suits their business. They would not use imported dips if they thought Australian dips were better. The proposed duty is equal to 50 per cent, ad valorem on the cheaper imported dips, though it is not so high on concentrated clips, such as Cooper's, which cost ios. per gallon. The proposed duty will be a tax on primary production, and against the interests of the public health. The honourable member for Laanecoorie ought to encourage the use of disinfectants.",33
244,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"The imported dips are 50 per cent - dearer than the locally-made dips, although they are admitted free of duty.",33
245,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"The pastoralists and farmers are not fools, and if they pay more for imported dips, they do so because they know that those dips are better than the locally-made dips.",33
246,Mr SALMON,Unknown,Many people drink imported wine in preference to Australian wine.,33
247,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"That does not concern me. I have always been in favour of the reduction of the wine duties, which have been imposed largely for revenue purposes.

By what prowool, cess of reasoning he arrives at the conclumanufacture sion that he is a better Australian than those who happen fo differ with him the Tariff I do not know, and to use such an argument is only to be offensive. As to the item itself, I think that sheep were. dips and disinfectants should be free. New discoveries are constantly being made, and there should be no obstacle the way of the introduction of any improved disinfectant or . insecticide into Australia. Our climatic conditions are such that we have to fight against pests of all kinds, which attack both live stock and plant life, and I am of opinion that it would not be in the interests of the country to impose a duty on sheep dips, insecticides, and disinfectants. The honourable member for Laanecoorie has said that local manufacturers ,of these articles are able to sell their products at one-third less than the price charged for the imported article. That being so, it cannot be said that they need protection.

268,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"No ; I do not have much dipping to do. Most of my properties are in Queensland, and the climate there assists us in dealing with these pests. I am speaking now in the interests of New South Wales, Victorian, and Tasmanian wool-growers, who should receive a certain amount of consideration. The Treasurer has suddenly seized on a suggestion made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, our Bourke-street farmer.",35
269,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It was made by is about a dozen honourable members.,35
270,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"We should given an opportunity to look carefully into the matter, and should not be rushed headto use it . long into carrying a duty which might do a great deal of harm.",35
271,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"New England) [3.46]-1I have listened with interest to the arguwho ments on this item. What sheep-owners rethe quire is not a cheap, but an effective sheep dip, one which will do the work required of it . Any quantity of cheap disinfectants might be poured into a drain or sewer, but if they were not effective for the purpose of destroying the bacillus of typhoid, spread of the disease would not be checked. I am inclined in this matter'to support proposed duty in order to secure the premittee, paration of an efficient sheep dip in Ausis tralia. If such an article were manufacto tured here, local, competition would spur of the moment. regulate the price, and if it were found that local manufacturers formed a trust or combine to keep up prices, I should willing to have the Government take over the whole business. It is most that our people should be in a position to. obtain reliable medicines of all kinds and effective disinfectants, and in this connection the Government might well be asked to interfere in the terests of the health of the people, as well dips. as of the progress of our industries. Money spent upon ineffective disinfectants is only thrown away. W i th a view to having this preparation made under local supervision, I shall support the proposed amendments he intended to propose. duty. At the same time, I ask the Treaenter surer to give consideration to the question .of requiring every package of imported disinfectants to be accompanied by a certificate as to the nature and strength of the preparations. It is quite time that we dealt a blow at the importation of the rubbish which is introduced in the form of dare say it chemical preparations.",35
272,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Nepean) [3.50] - The arguments of the honourable member for New England would be efficacious if used in opposition to the duty. The honourable member is quite right in saying that what sheep-owners require is not a cheap, but an effective sheep dip. I suppose it is on that account that imported disinfectants are able to find a sale. We have been informed that locally manufactured disinfectants are sold at 4s. per gallon, whilst the imported article is sold at from 5s. to 6s. per gallon. This shows that what wanted is not increased protection through the Tariff. No matter what may be be added to the price of the imported article, those who prefer it will continue",35
273,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Then we shall never sell any Australian iron.,35
274,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"If the manufacturer requires to use the best iron believes imported article to be the best, he will buy it. When we find that the local article is sold for two-thirds of the price asked for the imported article, we must look to some means other than a protective duty to force the. local article upon the market the against the will of the consumer. I protested the other night against the Treathe surer springing new items on the Comand I now repeat the protest. It utterly impossible for honourable members deal properly with this question on the The result of the imposition of the proposed duty will probably be to force people to use tobacco disbe infectant, since we have already agreed that tobacco used in the manufacture of important sheep dip is to be admitted free.",35
275,Mr CARR,Unknown,We have agreed to admit carbolic oil and palm oil free.,35
276,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"And they, as well as intobacco, are the raw materials of sheep",35
277,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"The discussion on this item proves how necessary it is that the Treasurer should keep the promise he made to give honourable members notice of the I mv protest against the line of argument adopted by the honourable gentleman, that because we do not see eye to eye with him and those, behind him we have not the interest of the country as much at heart as they have.",35
278,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [3.55]--I "" common with other honourable members, I think it is rather a pity that this new item should have been sprung upon the Committee at the last moment, when honourable members have no opportunity to sufficiently consider it. When, as in this case, both the Government and the Tariff Commission propose that an article shall be admitted free, honourable members are justified in assuming that the item will go through in that form, and are, therefore, not likely to look into the question. Consistently with my protectionist principles, I always lend a ready ear to any argument in support of the establishment and development of Australian industries. The arguments put forward in this instance have influenced me to a certain extent, but not sufficiently to induce me to support the duties proposed by the Treasurer. The honourable gentleman proposes a duty of 2s. per gallon, and of ios. per cwt. on powder disinfectants. I think these duties should be reduced by one half. I am sorry that the item should have been brought forward in the way it has been, and. while I am prepared to support a reasonable duty of, say, is. per gallon, I am opposed to the present proposal of the Minister.",36
279,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"Capricornia) [3.58] The arguments used by the honourable member for New England are futile. see' no justification whatever for the imposition of a duty upon a sheep dip mixture or any other form of disinfectant. It sliould not be forgotten that the interests of the country are bound up with the interests of the stock industry. Honourable members must be aware that all sorts of pests are constantly threatening those engaged in that industry. It is not so long ago since we had to face the tick pest, and had to discover a dip to deal with it effectively.",36
280,Mr SALMON,Unknown,And we did not have to import it either.,36
281,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"I am glad that we did not have to import it while the present Government were in power, because it is very likelv that we should have had to pay a duty of 5s. per gallon on it. We have here a sweeping provision to impose a heavy tax on dip mixtures which might be. patented elsewhere, but which the owners of stock might be obliged to get. difficult to discover the most effective mixture for certain purposes, and it took some years of experimental work to discover an effective dip for the tick pest. The Government propose an absolutely prohibitive tax, and even the duty of is. per gallon suggested by the honourable member for Wimmera would be much too high. It . would mean a duty of 5s. on a 5-gallon drum of what might be a patent mixture. Many honourable members in this House have a knowledge of the rearing of stock, and they know what the effect of such a duty is likely to be. The big squatters are not the persons who will have to suffer. They would probably be in a position to afford to pay something extra for an effective dip, but it is the people who are engaged in dairying and small sheep farmers whom the Treasurer is proposing to tax. There seems to be an idea that the only people concerned in stock-raising in this country are wealthy squatters. The day when that was so has long gone by. Those who will feel this tax are the small farmers and dairymen,",36
282,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [4.1] - I am astonished at the Treasurer's action in proposing a duty on this item. It amounts on some phenyle preparations to a duty of over 50 per cent., as the invoice price in some cases is 3s. 6d. a gallon. Phenyle preparations are used not only for keeping stock clean and healthy, but also largely for sanitary purposes around dwellings. I can The duty on liquid disinfectants-would exclude such preparations as Calvert's carbolic acid, of which large quantities are used for disinfecting drains. . Mr SALMON - It is far too expensive for much of it to be used for that purpose.",36
283,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"It is used largely both in the powder and liquid forms. In some places it is not used fo the extent that it might be-in this building, for instance. The proposal to put a duty on liquid sheep washes raises the question of thegreat necessity throughout Australia for the proper dipping of sheep, in order to preserve our principal industry. These patent sheep washes, both liquid and powder, are used more by the smaller farmer than by any one else, because it is usual for the his; stations to prepare their own sheep dips, using arsenic, soft soap and sulphur. The small farmer uses these patent preparations in a handy form.  It is member call a small farmer?",36
284,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"A man who runs anything less than 5,000 sheep.  pleading for the poor farmer with 5,000 sheep? I wish all our farmers had 5,000 sheep each.",37
285,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"I am pleading simply for common sense in the treatment of this item. The man who has less than 1,000 sheep uses these patent preparations.",37
286,Mr SALMON,Unknown,He generally dips them at the nearest squatter's place.,37
287,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"The honourable member is wrong. I have seen them in my district with their small dips, liftin g the sheep in and out one at a tinie. is this process to the whole industry, that they will go to all that trouble. If we impose this duty Australia will be in the unique position of being the only country in the world that taxes preparations of this kind. Russia, one of the most conservative countries ' admits dips Cooper's free, because it is for the national good. They are admitted free in the Argentine. America, which is often held up as one of the most protected countries in the world, admits Cooper's sheep dip free. If the Treasurer had given the people of Australia time to consider this matter, he would have been as eager to take the duty off as he was to take it off wire netting.",37
288,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I did not take the duty off wire-netting.,37
289,Mr WILSON,Unknown,The honourable member voted for duties of 15 and 10 per cent. I - remember voting with him.,37
290,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Tell story, and do not manipulate what happened.",37
291,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"This question is similar to that of wire-netting-it is a case of keeping out pests. The Treasurer, who is an able representative of one of the largest and most important rural constituencies, now actually proposes a duty on something which is used to the .advantage of every man who earns his living on the land. Phenyles are used as a wash for poultry, sheep, horses and dogs, and also as household disinfectants.",37
292,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,We will climb down by a half if the honourable member will sit down.,37
293,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"Then presumably the duty of ss. per gallon was only proposed for amusement - The honourable member for Melbourne Ports says "" We will climb down."" How many new honorary Ministers have recently been added to the Cabinet? Other important articles in cluded in the Treasurer's proposal are insecticides and sheep branding preparations. We have already dealt with some forms of sheep branding preparations under other items. A duty of 2s. per gallon on these patent preparations amounts to over 20 per cent. At the same time, they are made from secret formula;, and therefore cannot be made or sold here. We could not possibly manufacture Cooper's dip and sell it as such, or make the same article and sell it under another name. All sheep dips are not alike, but Cooper's dip is unique. Its use has considerably increased the value So important of our great national asset. The local preparations can be bought for one-third less than can the imported. Surely, then, there is no necessity for a duty. I suggest that these articles should be allowed to come in free as before. I hope honourable members realise that if we impose this duty like we shall be going far' beyond what has been done in either Russia or America.",37
294,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [4.15] --Springing a proposal of this kind on the Committee without notice is not calculated to assist our deliberations and, further, I see no justification for imposing the duty proposed by the Treasurer. The arguments this afternoon show that if there are any articles in the Tariff that should be made free they are the articles now under discussion. When we consider the value of some of these disinfectants to the community, it is bordering on a criminal act to impose a duty amounting to 50 per cent, or over. The result of making a proposal the. whole of this kind without notice is that several hours have been occupied in its discussion.",37
295,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"Barker) [4.19]. --At an earlier stage of the debate, I said that the Treasurer knew' as much about stock as any man in Australia. At that time, however, I thought it was the honourable gentleman's intention to make this article free, but shortly afterwards I discovered that he proposed to impose a duty ; and that, of course, very much altered my opinion of him. I may inform the Committee that in South Africa all such requisites are carried free over the Government railways : and I think that example might be very well followed here, instead of increasing the cost by imposing a duty. Some years ago I was induced to try one of the new dips, but three months afterwards I found the sheep as though they had never been treated at all ; and I had to go back to the well-tried article. If sheep are not thoroughly dipped the wool will be reduced to nearly half its value; and that, of-course, is a very serious matter. I hope the Committee will not vote the proposed duty.",37
296,Mr CARR,Unknown,Macquarie) [4.20] - I cannot let some-of the arguments on the other side go unchallenged. From one section of the Opposition we hear that no duty should be placed on these commodities because they cannot be made here-that there is a special virtue in particular brands.,38
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Who said that?,38
298,Mr CARR,Unknown,"The honourable member for Capricornia. Then we have it from the honourable member for Corangamite that squatters make their own dip; and, as that is a fact, it shows that there is no virtue in sheep dip which cannot be attained in Australia. We have been further told that the locally-made article is not equivalent to the imported article; but I have before me the formula of both Quibell's and Burnet's sheep dip. In the imported article, the tar oil is only 30 per cent., as against 33 per cent, in the locally-made article; carbolic acid is 15 per cent., as against 1.8 Archer, E. W. per cent.; soda is 7 per cent., as against 8 per cent.; water is 32 per cent., as against 23 per cent.; and resin is 16 per cent., as against 18 per cent, respectively. In every case but water the percentage is higher; and the local dip has been tested and found to be not so strong as to be injurious. The wider sale of the imported sheep dip is due, not to superior quality, but to more judicious advertising, by which people are easily influenced.  gest to the Treasurer that he should postpone the consideration of this item until we have heard his understudy, the honourable member for Batman, express an opinion. We have not yet heard that honourable member on this particular item; and as the honourable member for Yarra and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports sav that sheep dip can be made in Victoria",38
299,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"And the honourable member says that it cannot.  the sort-the honourable member ought not to put words into my mouth. Anything that promotes thebrilliancy of wool ought to receive earnest attention from this Committee, seeing that the wool industry is the backbone of the Commonwealth. But for the wool industry, I do not know what the people of the cities would do for a living. Thank goodness, in Western Queensland the sheep are free from diseases which prevail elsewhere, and sheep wash has not been regarded as necessary. But I am told that, in order to promote brilliancy in the wool, it is intended to resort to dipping. This fact ought to be taken into consideration, and attention paid to this primary industry, as well as to the manufacturing industries in the cities.",38

345,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,It refers to wholeby a sale or manufacturing chemists.,41
346,Mr SALMON,Unknown,It refers to a wholesale manufacturing chemist or druggist or to be sold pharmaceutical chemist.,41

348,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The v should be allowed.,41
349,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Certainly . I ask the the Treasurer if he will see that the regulation is so altered as to extend to medical institutes and dispensaries which are conducted by duly qualified chemists the same of privilege which is now enjoyed by other of chemists.. I do not think he can fairly In Sydney and suburbs alone the regulation affects 25,000 poor persons connected with friendly",41
350,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member means that that should be provided Paragraph 4 for by departmental regulation? Ur. J. H. CATTS - Yes ; I wish to ask the Treasurer to introduce a departdemental by-law so as not to exclude the is a chemists in the Friendly Societies' Instia pertutes from being able to import opium in the wholesame manner as chemists carrying on business outside.,41
351,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea and surer) [5.1] - My only reason for hesitaabout this matter was that I felt that the opium traffic ought to be restricted to the fullest extent. When the matter was before me as Minister of Trade and Customs I was very particular in endeavouring to restrict the traffic in every way. I hold Associato the terms of the proclamation that I to subissued at that time. If what is asked for can be done without running any risk, of opening the door to the increased consumption of opium for other than medicinal purposes, I will' advise that it shall be done. That is all that I can say. hesitate to do anything suddenly which may open the door wider, because opium smoking is undoubtedly an awful curse, and I have always done my best to stop it.",41
352,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Nepean) [5.2.] - The position in regard to Friendly Societies' stitutes has hardly been properly stated by the honourable member for Cook. The Department of Trade and Customs made certain regulations as to the importation of opium. They considered that in order to carrv out their regulations effectively they ought to be able to trace the opium to the place where it was. consumed. They endeavour to do that in every case.,42
353,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Quite right, too.'",42
354,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I do not say whether it was right or wrong, but it did not work well. Where the Customs found that a certain amount of opium, which they considered excessive, was going in a certain direction-sa y to a country chemist-the y drew the attention of the wholesale chemists to the fact and said, "" If this goes on we will not allow you to import."" The Department put the screw on the wholesale men, who in turn put the screw on the retailers. The effect was that they apportioned out what they thought was a fair consumption, prescribing how much Tohn Brown, a country chemist, or John Robinson, a town chemist, ought to sell in a tain time. In other words, they endeavoured to determine what was a legitimate medicinal use of opium in any particular place. Now, the dispensary in Parramatta serves a very large district, and the restriction imposed by the Department of Trade and Customs, or by the wholesale importers under pressure from the Department,' had -.this effect. The allowance made to the Parramatta Dispensary was so small that in about a fortnight they had used in doctors' prescriptions the amount of opium they were allowed to use for a whole quarter.",42
355,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Does the honourable member know what quantity they were allowed ?,42
356,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"They were allowed a certain amount for a quarter, which they used in about a fortnight. The consequence was that the dispensary could not properly dispense the doctors' prescriptions. I drew the attention of the Minister to this matter about six months ago, and he directed that the regulations should be altered so as to allow greater latitude and to insure that the legitimate use of I opium would not be hampered. I believe that something has been done in that direction. I inquired the other day of Mr Button, the secretary of the dispensary, and he told me that they were now allowed the opium they wanted. I presume, therefore, that In the Minister of Trade and Customs has altered the regulation. I am as keen as the Treasurer, or any one else can be, to stop the use of opium absolutely for any but medicinal purposes. But it is such an alleviative of pain that the legitimate use of it should not be hampered in any way when prescribed by doctors.",42
357,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [5.9] - I think that the Treasurer is perfectly right in safeguarding, so far as he can, against the illegitimate use of. opium. I also recognise that no arbitrary regulation can be framed to fit all cases of chemists selling opium? What I think should be done is, to allow a certain amount of discretion to the responsible officers of the Department: to deal with cases on their merits. For instance, where it is known that there is a large Chinese settlement, or that there is an unusually large amount of opium going into a certain district, there would be a legitimate case for interference if there was reason to believe that the limits of ordinary medicinal uses were being exceeded. But, in addition to the demands of dispensaries and friendly societies and insticer- tutes, I point out that abnormally large quantities of opium are used by chemists who happen to have large veterinary customers. I happen to have one in my own electorate who is in that position, and who uses as much opium in a week as a chemist in another part of the country would usein a year.",42
358,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Provisio n has already been made to meet cases like that.,42
359,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The Minister is quite right in making regulations to meet such cases, and each case should be investigated on its merits. So long as proper safeguards are taken, I have no particular objection to offer to what is proposed, though I think that the duty on opium, for medicinal purposes is too high. ' Mr LIDDELL (Hunter) [5.11] - I do not think that the remarks of the honourable member for Laanecoorie should be allowed to pass without comment. Let me quote from information forwarded to me. some time ago in connection with the sale of opium by chemistsThe Acting Collector of Customs of New South Wales has issued the following memorandum to the licensed importers of opium :future, any licensed importer of opium or tract of opium shall be held responsible for supply of any retail pharmacist of any of drugs mentioned in excess of the following quantities per annum :-Cu m opium, 4 ozs.; solid extract of opium, 2 ozs.; liquid extract opium, 5 ozs.; tincture opium, 2 quarts. :idrlition| besides keeping shall supply the Department with a monthly - statement, showing the quantity of opium and its .preparations imported and manufactured, with a list of the names and addresses of persons to whom such preparations, & c , vvere sold and the quantities supplied."" A great many chemists sell much larger quantities of opium per week than is mentioned in that memorandum. the issue of it caused a considerable amount of consternation. The member for Nepean and the right honourable member for East Sydney, brought the matter up in Parliament. Thereupon, the and following memorandum was issued by the Minister of Trade and CustomsThere is no restriction to the bond fide use of opium preparations for medicinal purposes. was, however, found that special vigilance is imjjcratively necessary, in order that the supplies should not be diverted to improper purposes. Inquiry was made as to the fair average Quantities ordinarily required each year by chemists, and the Department was advised that such average quantities were :-Gu m opium, ^ l b . ; solid extract, 2 ozs. ; liquid extract, 5 ozs.; tincture of opium, 2 quarts. The collectors were advised"" so that the above should afford a guide lo trade requirements, and aid them in supervising - the .distribution. That this was absolutely necessary may be realized from the fact that in one case we found a country chemist being supplied with over 2 lb. in weight of extract of opium each fortnight. three chemists, whose supplies prior to July, 1906, did not reach 1 lb. each year, we found they were supplied by licensed importers as follows for nine months ending 3rst March last : - No . 1, 36^ lbs., about 1 lb. per week; No. 2, .47^ lbs., about i£ lbs. per week; No. 3, 22 lbs., about f lb. per week. It is obvious these - quantities were not required for legitimate purposes, and the action recently taken is to insist upon those persons who are licensed to import opium exercising every reasonable precaution, so that the law may be observed. has already decided that if he finds reasonable care is not exercised by any persons licensed to import opium"" for medicinal purposes, he will not hesitate to cancel the licence. quite impossible to give effect to the desire to suppress the evil of opium smoking if the irregularities drawn attention to were permitted. This was the effect of the protest made the honourable member for Nepean and the right honourable member for As regards the question whether the duty is too high, I point out that it operates as almost a prohibitive impost on a number of proprietary lines, containing only an "" In infinitesimal quantity of opium. The duty exis therefore hardly fair to the ordinary conthe sumers of opium medicinally. It certainly the is not right to tax the users of a proprie-. tary article to the full extent of the amount of of opium contained in the preparation. In The duty will press hardly upon friendly books, such licensee societies.",42

Moreover, the Minister has consented to a reduction of the general rate from 35 to 30 per cent.; and as he originally proposed a preferential difference of 10 per cent, in favour of Great Britain, he should, to be consistent, agree to this amendment in order that that preference may remain.

I appeal to the Minister in a friendly way to give us an opportunity of determining the question of whether 7 s. 6d. each shall be charged as an alternative to the duty on chairs.

Those words embrace all that was previously contained in the item in a much more comprehensive and less cumbersome form. They have been prepared by the Chinese, Department. As to the rates of duty, I intend to propose 40 per cent, in the General Tariff and 30 per cent, against the United Kingdom. I - shall afterwards move to bring the rates of duty on the next two items into accord with whatever are agreed to on this item.",48
430,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [6.9] - I am not particular about the wording of the item, so long as lounges, chairs, and settees come in at the same rate as other furniture. I will not proceed with my amendments.",48
431,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [6.10] I thoroughly approve of the Treasurer's generalization, embracing, as it does,- in a comprehensive manner every possible description of furniture. It is a very convenient and logical description of furniture, and is better than the minute specification of a large number of articles in detail. I think a duty of 30 per cent, all round is quite sufficient. Although the Treasurer proposes a generalized description in this item, I am disposed to think that lounges, settees, and chairs should be separately dealt with, so that the Committee may have an opportunity of giving a straight-out vote in those cases. The reason why the specific duties' on those articles, apparently high ori the ""face of them, were proposed, was because the Tariff Commission were informed that most of the articles of this description came from cheap labour countries, such as where they were turned out at such dirt-cheap rate that an ad valorem duty of 30 per cent, would be practically uset u r e "" the less and inoperative.  chairs are made in China?",48
432,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I do - not intend to argue the question, because I know that the feeling of the Committee is against the proposed high specific duties, but I wish to cite the evidence upon which it If the Committee do not think that those fixed duties are reasonable, I ask them to impose such other fixed duties as they may consider operaDetive or effective. Evidence was given in any Melbourne by furniture manufacturers. or One witness was Mr George Dellit, realso presenting John Dellit and Sons, wickerware furniture manufacturers, North Melbourne. In reference to the wicker and bamboo furniture trade, he said- We canndt compete against Japanese and whose labour only costs 4d. per day. For example :1 chair in China, 1 day's work, 4d. 1 chair in Melbourne, 1 day's work,' 6s. The only way we can settle same is to fix a fixed duty on each chair and lounge, as Chinese chairs are sold in Melbourne, four days' work in rates each, ios. to 12s. each. In another part of his evidence he statedThis part of our trade is crippled through the importation of goods from China, India, and Japan, including the Straits Settlement, where wages range from 5d. to gd. per day. Some of the lounges and chairs coming from these countries would take any man three days to make, and 2.5 per cent, (ad valorem), say, on a lounge with three days' work on it, invoiced at 5s. in Canton, scarcely alters the price of it here, as we have seen them sold at 12s. 6d. to 15s., including all costs. 'We, therefore, ask that a duty of ios. be nlaced on each lounge or icttee, and 7s. 6d. on each chair.",48
433,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It should have been specified as bamboo or wicker.,48
434,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I do not know whether it is confined to bamboo or wicker; but that is the evidence o n ' which we decided to recommend the fixed duty; and, without comment, I leave the matter entirely with the Committee.",48
435,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [6.15] Personally, I think 5 per cent, more or less on furniture used by private individuals is not a very vital imatter. But the honourable and! learned member for Bendigo ought to have read a little more of the evidence, in order to have shown the other side of the case.",48
436,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,The honourable member for Bendigo has not informed us what the imports are.,49

460,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"I do not think that any arrangement of the kind suggested would cause any committee of management to resort to direct importation; the quantity of furniture required at any one time is never sufficiently large to' make such a plan payable. Just imagine, in the case of a country hospital, strugglingfor existence, the committee proceeding to directly import one or two lounges ! If a hospital committee went to a local dealer, would the duty be refunded on the particular article sold? The common experience is that committees of management, when purchasing furniture, do not ask. whether the goods are made by Chinese or black labour, but simply purchase what they require. As a matter of fact, most of the furniture used in hospitals is locally made, because it is then possible to get articles made to order. should be very glad, indeed, to do anything to assist the hospitals; but I - fail altogether to see how any assistance can be rendered in the way suggested by the ' honourable member for Coolgardie. In my opinion, it is a mistake to have the word "" hospital"" mentioned, because it may only tend to lead subscribers and others to believe that some relief is to be given when no relief is possible.",50
461,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Robertson) [6.26] - I do not think that the honourable member for Coolgardie has made out a case. I should be prepared to support a general reduction of t.he duty; but I cannot see how it would be possible to provide special exemptions in the case of furniture required by hospitals.,50
462,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The Tariff Commission made a similar recommendation in various other items.,50
463,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"I do not know of any hospital which has refurnished in any general or extensive way, single articles of furniture, such as wheel chairs, being replaced as they wear out. Of course, if a new hospital were built in Melbourne, there might be extensive furnishing, and such a concession might prove of substantial benefit; but I do not see that the suggestion of the honourable member for Coolgardie can be carried out. A reduction in the duty, however, would benefit every one concerned.",50

465,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [7.45] - I do not think that the Committee need concern itself very much about the question which has been raised by the honourable member for Coolgardie. My own experience in connection with hospitals is that those institutions are never called upon to pay anything like the retail price for the furniture which they require. The liberality of our merchants prevents that - In order to overcome the difficulty, I would suggest that a new line should be added' to this item to read, "" Chairs, the product of coloured labour, each 7s. 6d.""",50
466,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,We have not reached the item of chairs yet.,50
467,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,All other chairs would then be included in the item that we are discussing.,50
468,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"A difficulty might be experienced in tracing the source of their manufacture. I Mr SPENCE - Thei r country of origin would have to be declared. But, in any case, we import a comparatively small quantity of furniture from the East. In conclusion, I am in favour of the new proposal of the Treasurer in regard to the classification, and I hope that the Committee will adopt it.",50
469,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Hunter) [7.49] - I think that the' Treasurer will be acting very wisely if he agrees to hospital furniture being placed upon the free list. We all know that our public hospitals are intended primarily to assist the suffering and the needy, and that they are almost entirely supported by voluntary subscriptions.",50
470,Mr STORRER,Unknown,How can we distinguish between furniture which is intended to be used in hospitals and furniture which is to be used elsewhere?,50
471,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I shall presently show the honourable member the difference between ordinary furniture and hospital furniture. These institutions are established primarily for the purpose of assisting the suffering and the needy, and it would be unwise on our part to add to the - cost of their maintenance. The honourable member for Robertson, I am sorry to say, did not appear to know very much about this - subject, because he stated that all the requirements of hospitals in the matter of furniture would be met by the occasional mending of a wheel chair, or something of that sort. In his own electorate there has recently been erected a cottage hospital which has been equipped in modern fashion. The furniture which it contains is of a special class, and has been designed for a special purpose. It is what is known as aseptic furniture. It hias recently been discovered that many of our surgical diseases are aggravated by the presence of germs in the atmosphere, and it is with a view to combating these germs that furniture of this special type has been introduced. It is usually made of iron enamelled and glass. Every up-to-date hospital erected since this new theory was adopted has been furnished in this style. Nevertheless, the demand for this class of furniture is exceedingly small, and consequently it does not pay to manufacture it locally. The greater portion of it is imported, and will continue to be imported for many years. Let me instance the ordinary table which is used by surgeons in operating theatres. In some respects it is a very simple contrivance, whilst in others it is a very intricate one. Many of these tables are patented, so that it is impossible to manufacture them in Australia.",50
472,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,The merchants import them.,51
473,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"But if the merchants charge the hospitals only the wholesale price why should they be specially taxed for their philanthropy ? There is too of that sort of thing in connection with our wages. public institutions. I am perfectly fied that the Treasurer will consent to admission of hospital furniture free. claim that it may fairly be included same category as surgical appliances. We need not be afraid that Chinamen will manufacture it, because it is altogether yond their capacity to do so. to be made by specialists. I would also point out that this furniture is extremely - expensive. Only the other day a new pital was erected in my own electorate, the cost of equipping it was so heavy a special call had to be made upon the habitants of the district. by organizing two race meetings, the profits of which were about £ 4 0 0 with this money the operating theatre was furnished.. There is practically no country in the world where hospital furniture is dutiable. I again urge upon the Committee that it should be placed upon the free list, so that the cost of maintaining our hospitals, which are almost entirely dependent upon public subscriptions, shall not be increased.",51
474,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson) [7.58] - The honourable member for Hunter has given us a long dissertation upon hospital furniture. As he was good enough to say that I understood very little about the subject, may I point out that he is evidently unfamiliar with the item that we are discussing, which readsFurniture (except of metal, wicker, bamboo, and cane). Now, the whole of his speech was devoted to hospital furniture, which technically does not embrace wood or wicker ware, but all those articles used in equipping hospitals which are made of metalware. It will thus be seen that the honourable member has still something to learn in reference to this matter. I take it that the Treasurer will consent to a reduction of the duty upon this item, so that it will affect all persons concerned and not a particular section of the community.",51
475,Mr COON,Unknown,"Batman) [7.59] - I find that last year £'212,526 worth of furniture was imported into the Comonwealth.",51
476,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,That was inclusive of chairs?,51

This witness said that the average mechanic's wages in Japan was od., and that the hours of labour were from 13 to 14 per day, including Sundays.

That refers to Java only. The wood is teak, which is very cheap, and a very high class of wood. I also explained to the Commission that during my last visit to Java I met an Australian merchant there, who was on the spot preparing to introduce the furniture here.",52
490,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Las t year ,£24 worth was imported from Java.",52
491,Mr COON,Unknown,"He continuesI also told the Commission, in answer to a question, that if I were not engaged ""*at sent time, and I thought the Australian Tariff would not be raised, I myself would enter into the business of importing furniture from Java.",52
492,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Does the honourable memberthink that the importation of £ 2 4 worth of furniture from Java is a serious question to talk about?,52
493,Mr COON,Unknown,"It is not a question of what is coming in, but of what may come in. We are legislating not for today but for the future. This witness also said that he had seen women with children on their backs engaged in loading ships. If we could get this duty imposed it would give employment to hundreds of men. The machinery, has been ordered, and is on its way to the Commonwealth for the purpose of making a large quantity of this furniture. I hope that honourable members will give favourable consideration to the testimony of an independent witness who is not a Victorian or a New South Wales man, nor interested in a factory. I trust that they will give to this industry the protection it is entitled to receive.",52
494,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) [8.8]. - I think that the suggestion of the honourable member for Coolgardie to exempt furniture for hospitals and charitable institutions is worthy of consideration, but my difficulty is to devise some means by which it can reasonably be done.",52
495,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The Government themselves do so in the Tariff.,52
496,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"If the Government are able to do that I am prepared to support the honourable member in that regard. We are now dealing with a line of articles which practically enter into every home which has any pretensions to decency and civilization. This duty if I imposed will fall upon a very large section of the community. Under this Tariff the fur- the poorer classes who are compelled by 'their needs to buy the cheaper lines of furniture will have to contribute to a I larger extent towards the revenue. The proposed minimum duty of 7s. 6d. per T say chair means that a number of the more expensive chairswill probably cost twice as much as they do. But a large percentage of the chairs which are used by the working people do not cost much more than about half that sum. It means that the burden of this taxation will fall upon those who are least able to bear it, and who should receive some consideration at our hands. The honourable member for Bendigo has informed the Committee how. the pre- these high duties came to. be proposed. Some witnesses went before the Tariff Commission, and raised the Asiatic bogy. They said that Australia was suffering from or threatened with competition from the East of such a character that the imposition of high duties was absolutely essential to maintain, the Australian industry. The position was stated as one ""'Chinaman making one chair per day at a wage of 4d. competing with a white man making one chair per day at 6s. It was asked,, was it possible under those conditions for white people to compete with importations from the East. The honourable member did not state the extent of the competition or quote the figures derived from the Customs returns. I hold in my hand a return prepared by the Commonwealth Statistician and giving the figures for last year.",52
497,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is it customary to pay 6s. for the making of a chair 'valued at 3s. 6d. ?,53
498,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"After this Tariff has passed through the House, I am very much afraid that the honourable member' will have to pay that. According to this return, which covers all descriptions of furniture, the total importations for 1906 amounted to £ 2 4 4 , 3 5 5 . On l v ,£24,572 worth came from the East, namelv, £ 8 , 5 7 7 from Hong Kong, £ 1 , 1 4 6 from the Straits Settlements, £ 8 7 8 from China., and ,£13,971 worth from Japan. The new bogey which has been raised by the honourable member for Batman-Java is not mentioned in the return.",53
499,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Yes ; it shows that in 1906 we imported £ 2 4 worth from Java.,53
500,Mr THOMASBROWN,Unknown,"I had not noticed the figures for Java. At any rate, that is an item which the Commonwealth can very well disregard. In 1906 £ 2 1 9 , 0 0 0 or £ 2 2 0 , 0 0 0 worth of this furniture was imported from European countries, ' Great Britain sending £ 1 0 2 , 0 0 0 worth, and Germany £ 6 3 , 0 0 0 worth; while from the United States we imported £ 4 6 , 0 0 0 worth. That is a complete reply, I think, to the scare which was raised before the Tariff Commission, and which may be raised here as to the competition from eastern countries. I remind the Committee that the competition is in a line of articles which do not enter very largely into general use. It relates chiefly to cane and wickerwork chairs, settees, and articles of that description which are not used for the general purposes to which the kinds of furniture under consideration are adapted. The chair which is more commonly used now is a bentwood chair known as the Austrian chair, but not necessarily made in that country. It is practically the only description of chair which is suitable to the varying temperatures which obtain in the Commonwealth. To place a duty of 7 s. 6d. on a chair of that class is simply to prohibit its use, and to inflict a great burden on .a large section of the citizens. The amendment foreshadowed by the Treasurer is certainly an improvement on the-item as it stands,' and will, I hope, be adopted. I trust tnat a very reasonable reduction will be made, and that the specific duty will be replaced by an ad valorem duty, because the former places a very heavy burden on those who are compelled to buy the cheaper descriptions of chairs.",53
501,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [8.14] - I regret that the Government-have seen fit to amend their proposals, and to place a number of items together. I understand that the Treasurer has proposed to put all furniture and all settees, lounges, and chairs under one heading.",53

503,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That , I ' believe, is the about proposal which the Treasurer made before, the adjournment for dinner- "" Furniture n.e.i.""",53

505,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,When we come to those items no doubt the Minister will have them struck out.,53
506,Mr STORRER,Unknown,No ; they will be put on the same footing as other furniture.,53

508,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Does the honourable member flatter himself for a moment that he can get more duty put on chairs than on anything else ?,53
509,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I intend to put the case for chairs before the Committee, and to show that they differ from other furniture on account of the cost of packing. Some honourable members have spoken about the poor shopkeepers who have had thousands of cases of chairs kept in bond. Now, if a shopkeeper is in such a position as to have thousands of cases of chairs consigned to him, he is by no means a poor man. There are four dozen chairs in each case.",53
510,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What sort of chairs ?,53
511,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Ordinar y Vienna bentwood chairs and American chairs.,54
512,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Not bentwood chairs, surely?",54
513,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes ; they are taken to pieces and packed for export. They take up less than one-fourth the amount of space that ordinary furniture does, so that the cost of freight would only be one-fourth as much.",54
514,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Furnitur e is knocked down for packing, too.",54
515,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,But it cannot be taken to pieces and packed so closely as chairs can be.,54
516,Mr STORRER,Unknown,Yes ; it can be packed in a much smaller space.,54
517,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"There are four dozen chairs in 16 cubic feet of space. The honourable member for Batman stated yesterday that goods had been brought out to Australia at a cost of 5s. per cubic ton. As a matter of fact, a ship which arrived in Melbourne last week brought out goods that were consumed in the fire on Saturday night at less than 5s. per ton measurement.",54
518,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,What vessel?,54
519,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Metropolis. She is the last,. I believe, of the cheap-freight vessels, , because the shipping companies have arrived at an arrangement amongst themselves, and I have no doubt that freight will go up.",54
520,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Where did the goods come from?,54
521,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not know; but freight went down below 5s. per ton measurement recently. Goods were brought out at that figure, not only to Melbourne, but also to Sydney. There is no trade in which labouri represents so large a proportion to the value of the article as it does in regard to furniture. If we take the timber as it stands in the forest,, and consider the amount of labour expended upon it before it takes its place as furniture the homes of the rich or of the poor, or in the hospital, we shall find that the labour in some cases represents 95 per cent, of the value of the article.",54
522,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Does not that apply to everything ?,54
523,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The proportion is not nearly so great in other lines as it is in regard to furniture.,54
524,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Tak e the iron line.,54
525,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Tak e the honourable member's suit of clothes. From the raw wool to the suit of clothes, the labour cost does not represent anything near the same percentage as the proportion of labour in volved in furniture, from the timber to the finished article, although wool is a more valuable product to start with than timber is. I regrtet that the Government have not seen fit to adhere to their original proposal. The Tariff Commission went carefully into this matter, and the Chairman has told us that the chairs they had in mind in making their recommendation for a duty of 7s6d. per chair were the cheap chairs that are imported into this country from places like China and Japan. Speaking of furniture generally, honourable members who have taken the trouble to look into the figures, will have observed that the imports have increased during the last three years. In 1904, the imports were valued at £ 1 8 1 , 6 2 0 ; in 1905, they went up to £ 2 0 1 , 2 8 4 ; and in 1906, to £ 2 1 2 , 5 2 6 . It may be said that there has been an increase in local manufacture, but I think we are entitled to have the whole of this trade for the benefit of Australian workmen. I believe that Australians have a greater right to share in the prosperity of this country than any foreigner has, no matter where he may be domiciled.",54
526,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The honourable member .wants trade for Ah Wong of Little Bourke street.,54
527,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No ; I have always been in favour of securing the trade for the white workman. There is not to-dav. and there has not been, a Chinaman employed in the only chair factory in Melbourne, which, I am given to understand, is the only chair factory pure and simple in the Commonwealth. Of course, any cabinetmaker can make a chair, but not at a price to compete with articles imported at very low figures. An invoice has been handed to me by the honourable member for Batman, which shows the low price of imported chairs. Messrs. JohnCA. Dunn's chairs, imiin tation walnut, imitation rosewood, imitation mahogany, and imitation antique oak, are sold at £ 1 1 is. 3d. per dozen f.o.b., New York. Chairs in natural oak, antique oak and English oak, are sold at £ 1 15s. sd. per dozen f.o.b., New York. I admit that the duty proposed on chairs is probably the highest duty in the Tariff. But that does not frighten me.",54
528,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I suppose the honourable member has bought all the chairs he wants?,54
529,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I think not. Even in such a well-kept family as the honourable member has, the children will occasionally break the furniture. I am a family man myself, and t do not think I have all the chairs that I shall require if I live rrgich longer, as I have no doubt that my children will break chairs. Referring to the imports - from foreign countries, the honourable ber for Lang endeavoured to ridicule the amount of furniture imported from Java.",54
530,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I referred to the statiselected tical returns for last year.,55
531,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have the same returns before me. They show that the value of the imports from Germany was £ 4 9 , 1 6 0 .",55
532,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The honourable member for Batman was complaining about Java.,55
533,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The value of the imports from Japan was £ 1 4 , 1 9 4 ; and from China, £ 7 , 4 8 9 . We can, at any rate, deal with the Chinaman whom we have in this country; but we cannot deal with the Chinaman in China. We have no control over the conditions under which he lives and works. In Victoria, we have endeavoured, by means of our Factories Act, to insure that the Chinaman shall receive the same wages as are paid to Europeans. According to their employers, they receive more; although I and many others, especially those in the trade, doubt this.",55
534,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The honourable member for Batman said that the competition which we have to fear is the Javanese.,55
535,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I say nothing about that, because the Javanese competition does not appear to be very great according to these figures. From Great Britain we imported £|6o,ooo worth, and from Austria £ 1 6 , worth, of the total of £'212,000 worth furniture, and I have not the slightest doubt that by far the greater proportion that furniture could be made here.",55
536,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Is it sent here for noployed thing, or do we send anything of ours return ?",55
537,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Accordin g to the export returns for last year we sent away a great deal more than we got in return. We do Mr Wilks not receive in return the full amount of the goods that we send out. I hope the Committee will agree to the duties on general furniture proposed by the Government-4 0 per cent, and 30 per cent. If I could get a majority to vote with me, I would support a duty of 40 per cent, al l round. I have never said that I was going for preferential trade; or, rather, I would vote for preferential trade in precisely the cculd same way as free-traders do. They vote wood. for preferential trade to reduce duties, and I will vote for preferential trade if by so doing I can increase them. If I can only get a comparatively small duty against memGreat Britain, and a largeduty against other countries, I am to that extent a preferential trader. But I did not try to get on the preferential trade ticket. .My attitude is perfectly clear on that subject.",55
538,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Is not Great Britain the "" dear old Motherland""?",55
539,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have nothing to say against the Mother Country. I had as good a time when I was there as most Australians have. But we are now considering the interests of Australia. I trust the Committee will recollect that by far the larger part of the cost of furniture goes in labour, ' and, further, that it is a highlyskilled trade, and that in that respect it is a more important industry than any other. It is true that the furniture trade in this State is today practically monopolized by the Chinese. If I had my way I would impose a heavy Excise duty against them. If we could impose an Excise on Chinese furniture, as we have done against blacklabour sugar, I would heartily welcome such a proposal.",55
540,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It is unnecessary, if the trade is worked under a sumcient award of the Arbitration Court.",55
541,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The difficulty is to enforce a Wages Board determination, or an Arbitration Court award, . in ' the case of 0 0 0 Chinamen. No matter how fair the deciof sion of the Judge may be, if the employer and employee' like to act in collusion theof award can be broken down. That is what I fear is being done in regard to the furniture trade. About 500 Chinese are emin the furniture industry in Victoria. in We have been told by the honourable member for Dalley, in one of his lectures, that we should not go outside the reports of the Tariff Commission for our information. - We l l , read the blue book.",55
542,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I intend to read from the red, book; the honourable member can afterwards read from the blue book, if he desires to do so. This is some of the evidence of Mr Archibald Dobson, the secretary to the United Furniture Trades Society, MelbourneEighty per cent, of the furniture imported be made in the Commonwealth. furniture that cannot be made locally is bent The",55
543,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That is not quite correct, because a plant has been put down for the manufacture of such furniture.",56
544,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Yes . A firm in Melbourne has gone to the expense of ordering machinery which will be useless unless a high duty is placed on chairs.,56
545,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Are we to save rash speculators?,56
546,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The members of the firm knew that the Tariff Commission had recommended a duty of 7 s. 6d. each on chairs, that the Government were pledged to protection, and that in addition to the Ministerial supporters, many of the honourable members sitting on the Opposition corner benches were elected to support effective protection. Mr Dobson continued The furniture that cannot be made locally is bent work, though chairs are produced in Australia that take the place of bent wood chairs to a great extent. One of the greatest troubles is the Chinese competition. This, in conjunction with the imports, leaves very little for white cabinetmakeis in Australia to do. There are factories in Melbourne which used to employ numbers of men in making furniture, but which employ none now. In New South Wales the trade has been saved somewhat by the piano factory being established. A great number of furniture makers are now employed at that work. They wanted more duty and fewer Chinese.",56
547,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,What does Mr Dobson know about the conditions of employment in Sydney i,56
548,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Mr Dobson has made many journeys to Sydney during the last few years, and as secretary to a federated society knows the conditions that obtain in both Sydney and Melbourne. Melbourne workers often go to Sydney to obtain employment, while many Sydney workers are to be found in Melbourne. It has been stated in this chamber that high duties tend to increase prices, but, according to a witness before the Tarjff CommissionPrices have decreased under increased protection. Under a 15 per cent, duty the price for a five-drawer cedar chest was a 25 per cent, duty the increased output enabled them to sell the same article at £2 ios. seven-drawer chest, formerly sold at £4 17s. afterwards sold at £2. 15s.; and an eight-drawer serpentine Scotch chest, sold then at £Q unpolished, is now £6. That is the evidence of Mr Mathias, of South Australia.",56
549,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Apparently , if we make the duty high enough, furniture will be given away.",56
550,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It was also stated thatA certain imported overmantel is quoted at Ss. 6d., or in half-dozens at 8s. To produce that locally it would cost 5s. 6d. for labour, 8s. for glass, and 4s. or 5s. for timber. Mantels ancP overmantels vary in price. A mantelpiece is sold as low as - s. 6d., and an overmantel at the same rate-o r 15s. for the complete article Some honourable members have contended that hospitals should get their furniture free; but hospitals, and all public institutions, which are supported by Government money, should pay duty on imported furniture, just as private persons must do.",56
551,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Such duties are a tax on the suffering and sick.,56
552,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I trust that the Committee will impose a sufficiently high duty on furniture to increase the employment available to the men engaged in the chairmaking and general furniture trade, so that the industry will the more profitable to the workers engaged in it in the future than it has been in the past.",56
553,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [8.36] - The honourable member for Yarra has spoken with the great vigour, as, he always does, in favour of high duties on furniture. He might appropriately have said, in the language of Macbeth- "" This line ' will chair me ever, or disseat me now.' "" Although he asks for more protection to the furniture trade, I have evidence that in South Australia that trade is in a very flourishing condition. He has read Mr Mathias' evidence, and I would accept Mr Mathias' statements, even if they were not sworn, because I know his character and ability. He is managing a factory which was started under him a few years ago, about 3 miles from Adelaide, and did so well under the old Tariff that it can scarcely cope with its orders. It turns out a tip-top article, with the result that its output has increased enormously, and I believe that Mr Mathias would he able to find work for 50 or 100 hands tomorrow, at high wages, if the honourable member for Yarra could supply them to him.",56
554,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,He could take on £3 17s. 6d. ; under fifty men.,56
555,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I speak from knowA ledge. I do not think that he wishes 6d., for a higher duty than 25 per cent. The factory to which I allude has been successful from every point of view, and this afternoon I received a letter in regard to the condition of the furniture-making industry in South Australia, in which the writer saysReferring to the policv of a high Tariff upon chairs and upon furniture generally, the trade desires to point out that the equipment of the manufacturing trade, though large and increasing, is quite. unsuitable to adequately increase the supply of locally-made goods. In men the trade is most seriously deficient, and every State is competing with every other, almost successfully, to obtain men. In an instance which I have personal knowledge, the largest manufacturer in Adelaide has had an order twenty-four dozen chairs of one pattern for over five weeks, and has only succeeded, after serifor more'than 3s. 6d. ? ous delay, in delivering half-a-dozen, and sequently a few more, whilst there is no pect in sight of obtaining sufficient for pressing needs. This kind of difficulty has been chronic for over twelve months with regard, also furniture. As a matter of fact, I believe that it does not pay to manufacture in Australia chairs of the kind upon which a duty of 7 s. 6d. each has been imposed. Such chairs will not be made here - for many years to come; one of the reasons being that,, with skilled labour so scarce, it is more profitable to employ men in making betterclass furniture. There is a great disparity between the wages paid in Austria and America, from which countries most of these chairs come-o r in Japan-fro m which there is a small importation-and those paid in Australia. It does not pay the Australian manufacturers who have a big business in better-class furniture to make chairs which are exported for 2s. n d . each.",56
556,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The cheapest chairs come from America.,57
557,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Te n firms have quoted the f.o.b. price to me as 2s. n d . each. As regards the proposed duty of 7s. 6d. each, I will quote the figures of two invoices, which show how unfair it is. The value of twenty-seven chairs imported was £ 7 7s. 9d., on which the old duty would have been £ i 2s. 5d.. but on which the new duty will come to £.10 2s. 6d. On 888 other chairs, valued at £ 1 8 3 8s., the old duty of 20 per cent, would have been £ 4 2 2s., whilst the new duty of 7s. 6d. each will be £ 3 3 3 . Should such a duty as that be allowed to remain? My opinion is that the furniture trade, which is a flourishing one, would be fairly treated if an all round duty of 25 per cent, were imposed.",57
558,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [8.43] - There are one or two figures which I sbould like to put before the Committee. The more I see of the reportssigned by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, the more surprised I am at the manner in which they have been framed in respect to the evidence upon which they have been based. To-dav we were informed that one witness told the Commission that Australian manufacturers could not compete against importations from China and Japan; that in alone, China, men got 4d. for making a chair, xmwhile here they would get 6s. That state of ment was, on the face of it, absurd. Who would pay 6s. for the making of a chair for which could not be sold in the open market Such statements subcarry their own refutation. Yet the Chairprosman of the Tariff Commission has built up - his reports on them, and has made them the to all ground for recommending high . duties. There is very little furniture imported from the countries I have named, only ^8,000 worth coming from China; and £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 worth from Japan, or £ 2 2 , 0 0 0 worth altogether from the East; while from Great Britain, Canada, and the United States we get £ 1 2 0 , 0 00 worth Clearly, there again we have to fear not the cheap pauper labour, but the highly paid, intelligent labour of the world. That is the cause of our trouble, if trouble there he. We import about £212,00 0 worth of furniture per annum. I find from the Statistical Year-Book that as far back as .1904 we had engaged in this industry in Australia 5,000 male hands, in addition to about 428 females. I presume that the number has since greatly increased; but for the purposes of our argument let us assume that there are only 5,000 male hands engaged in the industry today. I have just made some inquiries from a practical man in the chamber, who tells me that it is safe to say that the total market value of the furniture turned out in twelve months by a fair average furniture-maker is at least £500. That being so. ancl assuming that these 5.000 men are fully employed, we are annually manufacturing' furniture of the value of £2,500,000. That is really an under-estimate, for even in 1904 there were, as I have said, 5,000 males ancl 428 females, engaged in the industry. We import about £ i worth for every £ 1 1 ios. worth of furniture that we make in Australia; in other words, our total importations today represents only about 8 per cent, or 9 per cent, of the value of the furniture that is locally made. Does that show that we cannot hold up our heads under the old duties? Does it show that the industry is strangled? On the contrary, it clearly and unmistakably indicates that we are able to-dav to compete with the rest of the world-that the industry is flourishing, and that we do not need the imposition which the Treasurer, acting on the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, has seen fit to propose. I wonder why the Chairman of the Tariff Commission has not been able to give us some of the information that I have just furnished to the Committee, and which any honourable member could obtain by ferring .to Coghlan. I fail to understand why we have been paying thousands of pounds to enable the Commission to make investigations when, by reference to Coghlan, we can obtain better information than it furnishes. The honourable member for Bendigo must be playing with the mittee when ihe declines to give us any formation except from one interested'indiunder vidual who says that he cannot carry on, and that if we do not put a stop to Chinese labour he will have to go under. The figures I have quoted show that it is the Chinaman in Australia and not the Chinathe man abroad that is hurting us. Does honourable member for Yarra expect me. a self-respecting decent white man, to cline to take the furniture made by men my own kith and kin in order to for Chinamen in Melbourne? Before he asks for these prohibitive duties he ought to tell us what he is going to do with the Chinese in the furniture trade in tralia. He is frank enough to tell us that below. the furniture industry here is in the hands of the Chinese, and yet he is clamouring prohibitive duties in order to protect them against our own kith and kin at Home.",57
559,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,What about the white men engaged in the industry in South tralia?,58
560,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"So far as I am sider able to see, the white men in the furniture trade of South Australia are doing very well; I have not heard that their industry is being strangled. The industry in Sydhave ney is not. Most of the large warehouses in Sydney are making their own furniture, and excellent it is. On visiting Anthony Hordern's warehouse, onefindsthat furnidoing ture equal to anything that produce is being manufactured there. The figures I have quoted show that under the do better? old duty of 20 per cent, furniture-makers in Australia have found no difficulty in comto peting with' imports from China, Japan, have and the rest of the world.",58
561,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Does not all the bamboo furniture come from China?,58
562,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have just I quoted the figures.,58
563,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I do not' think that they were fair.,58
564,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Mr Knibbs walls shows that only £8,000 worth of furniture was imported last vear from China.",58
565,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Has the honourable member any figures as to the imports from the Straits Settlements?,58
566,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Our imports from the Straits Settlements last year were reof the value of £1,100. Can we survive : such an importation ? We are annually manufacturing furniture of the value of .£2,500,000, and ,£1,100 worth is coming 1 in from the Straits Settlements ! I wonder that the Chairman of the Tariff Commission did not sink to the earth when Comhe heard of those figures. We ought at inonce to cease passing Tariff enactments which £1,100 worth of furniture can be imported from the Straits Settlements ; we ought to pass a general prohibition Act, preventing anybody or anything from coming into Australia. . As to 7s. 6d. chairs, I do not think that we the need trouble about them. If I am any as judge of the common-sense of the Comdemittee,,, they are doomed, and I hope that of we shall not waste time in debating that find work phase of the question.",58
567,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Does the Minister intend to include them in this item?,58
568,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,They will not be Ausin this item unless I strike out an item,58
569,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is the Treafor surer going to do that?,58
570,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not know.,58
571,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member would save a great deal of time Ausby telling us what he intends to do. At any rate, I ' invite the Committee to conwell the broad facts of the situation. If there were any danger of our furnituremakers going under, I should not object to the old duties being increased. But they established themselves in the Commonwealth, and all the statistics I can find show that they are prospering, and need not fear outside competition. They are very well, and we ought not to in the world can crease the duties.",58
572,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Why should they not,58
573,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We ought not impose further duties, because when we brought our industrial enterprises into a state of fair competition with outside industries we have done, even from a protectionist point of view, all that we ought to do. f we do more, we close the gates; we prohibit importations of any kind, and assuredly in such cases our industries will not thrive. The. moment it begins to build to keep out the skill, efficiency, enterprise, and competition of the world, a nation begins to decay. That is the history of the world, and therefore those honourable members who talk about effective protection simply mean to level the conditions of competition, and not to abolish competition altogether.",58
574,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Cook) [8.56] - The honourable member for Parramatta has just told us that 5,000 males are engaged in the furniture trade of the Commonwealth, and he has chided the Chairman of the Tariff Commission for not putting before the Committee information gleaned in the course of its inquiries. The honourable member, however, instead of seeking information . from the Minutes of Evidence taken by the Commission in 1906, has turned to Coghlan for 1904. Had he examined the reports of the Commission, he would have found that the employment of Europeans in the furniture trade of Australia is, not as he suggests,, increasing, but is decreasing, and that the Chinese are largely displacing the white man in the industry. Mr. JOSEPH ' COOK - And yet the honourable member proposes to grant further protection to the Chinese.",59
575,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I hope that the honourable member will join with others on this side in their efforts to place some kind of an embargo on the employment of coloured men in this industry, and to grant substantial protection to the white-workers. At page 404 of volume V. of the Minutes of Evidence taken by the Commission appears a statement by the Secretary of the United Furniture Trade Workers of Melbourne thatOne of the greatest troubles that we suffer from in the States is, of course, the Chinese difficulty. What with the Chinese in the furniture trade, and the imports, there is very little left for the cabinetmakers of Australia to do. In Victoria, I think the last returns show ""lhat there were not more than 145 cabinetmakers working in the whole State . I am given to understand that the last returns available show that there were 672 Chinese working at furniture in Melbourne alone. I hope that the honourable member for Parramatta will examine this sworn evidence, which shows that, according to the latest returns available, there were 672 Chinese engaged in the furniture trade in Melbourne as against 145 white men so emHe ployed in the whole State.",59
576,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And the honourable member wishes to put a ring-fence round the Chinamen. There is a fine lot of White Australians on that side of the House.,59
577,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"We shall know what kind of a White Australian the honourable member for Parramatta is when we ask him to vote for an Excise duty on furniture made by aliensin. Australia, with the object"" of lessening the number of Chinese employed in the furnituire trade. The witness from whom I have quoted dealt later on with the wages paid to Chinese in Victoria, and he said"" We have come to the conclusion, reckoning the cost of material and so forth, that the Chinese are not getting more on an average than ios. or ns. per week in the furniture trade. We do not feel' disposed to come down to that standard of living, and therefore they can beat us every time. It is a matter of impossibility to compete against them."" At question 76223 the witness was asked"" Can you say whether these Chinese furniture makers are as a rule properly-trained tradesmen?"" and his answer was""They are not. They used to come here imported in batches. About nine years ago one Chinaman who could not pay his creditors went away, and he agreed with eighteen Chinese to pay them 2s. 6d. per week and their rice. He went away without paying the half-crown a week. Those Chinese came out here, not as boys, but as grown-up men, and they were put on to clean up stuff. Chinese are very good copyists. They do not work from drawings or designs, but from the finished article in front of them."" We often hear statements made about the States Parliaments introducing legislation to check the employment of Chinese in factories. In answer to question 76177 this witness admitted that the Chinese had an unlimited right to work at the furniture trade in Victoria, and I am in a position to say that they have the same right in New South Wales. Mr Dobson is an expert in the furniture trade, and understands its conditions in all of the States. In another part of his evidence he made this startling statemejnlt in reference to Victoria"" We should also be glad if rorae recommen. whereas dation could be made in connection with the Chinese difficulty. The Chinese, as I have explained, have got the furniture trade of Victoria in their own hands. In New South Wales they have it nearly in their own hands; and in Western Australia, not only have they gone into the manufacturing part of the business, but they arc doing the retail trade as well. They have their warehouses, and they pocket the middleman's profits by selling to the public direct."" states what, in his opinion, the ultimate outcome is likely to be, and he says"" If the Chinese have come here to stay, and nothing can be done to stop them, all I can say is that the cabinet-making 'industry will go ultimately out of the hands of white workers. There is no question at all about that."" I admit the necessity for a duty on furniture to protect our white workers in the trade against the cheap labour of Germany, China, Japan, Java, and other places where furniture is manufactured very cheaply, and we can. apply the. new protection to protect the public. But it is just as necessary that we should do something to protect ""the white workers in the trade in Australia from the unfair competition of Chinese within the Commonwealth. Coloured labour is as great an evil in the furniture industry as it was in the sugar industry, and we know that in the past this Parliament made special provision to meet the disabilities under which white workers in the sugar industryhave to labour. I ask the Minister now to say whether he will not make some attempt to' deal with the Chinese in the furniture trade, and protect the white men engaged in that trade by means of an Excise provision such as that which has been applied to the sugar industry and to the agricultural implement trade. In dealing with the sugar industry this Parliament has already given effect to the principle that white workers must be protected against coloured labour in the cane-fields. ficient to protect the white men employed in the furniture trade against the products of black labour outside of Australia. It - is absolutely imperative that we should do something to prevent white men from being expelled altogether from the furniture trade by the employment in Australia itself of coloured labour in the industry. The'necessity for action in the matter is shown by the statement that in this trade there are 672 Chinese employed in Melbourne alone, as against 145 white men throughout Victoria. I ask the Treasurer now to say whether he will not make some statement on this matter?",59
578,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I cannot be always making statements.,60
579,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"If there is a big evil in our midst we should take advantage of every opportunity afforded to us to deal with it. An opportunity is afforded now in dealing with the Tariff, and it is only at rare intervals that a Tariff is before Parliament. We can make some provision to protect white workers against the competition of Chinese in this industry in Australia. I say that the Treasurer should inform the Committee whether the protection to this industry for which he is asking is to be for the benefit of the white men or the coloured men engaged in the industry. If I did not believe that we might do something to secure the protection asked for by these duties for the white workers in the furniture trade I should be prepared to vote free-trade on these items. If the Treasurer will not make a statement on the subject, and if he is not concerned",60
580,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"What right has the honourable member to say that I am not concerned, when he knows that I am? He is asking me to interpose something which should be dealt with at another time. He is asking me to make a statement that would provoke a debate quite outside the question before the Committee.",60
581,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"If we do not ask the Treasurer at this stage for protection for the white man against the Chinaman in this industry, when are we to ask him. for it? . Mr BATCHELOR - We do not want it.",60
582,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I am surprised to hear a Labour man say that. From, an intimate knowledge of men engaged in the furniture trade, and from associating with them in the Trades Halls of Melbourne and Sydney, I say without fear of truthful contradiction that the white, men in the furI t is not suf- niture trade do require protection against the local Chinese. Is it not well known that they have been seeking in vain to secure that protection by means of State legislation? They cannot get the protection they desire uncier State laws, ancl as we have the opportunity now to give it to them w« should do it. If we let this opportunity pass, we do not know when we shall have another opportunity to impose Excise duties on Chinese made furniture, which would give a real protection to the white men engaged in the industry.",60
583,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What is the honourable member going to do abojt it?,60
584,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I am going to do my best to secure Excise duties on Chinese made furniture. I find that the Treasurer will not make a statement on the subject.,60
585,Mr HARPER,Unknown,Of course he will not.,60
586,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I am'not asking the honourable member for Mernda fo make a statement.,60
587,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"The honourable member is out of order, anv way.",60
588,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"When I am asked to vote for a duty on furniture I cannot be out of order in asking the Treasurer whether he will see that the white workers in the industry obtain the benefit of the protection proposed. If I cannot get the information I desire now, I suppose I shall have to be content to get it later on. The - honourable member for Parramatta laughs, but it is very likely that when the time comes we shall not find him ready to secure protection for white men engaged in this industry.",60
589,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am tired of the honourable member's blank cartridge.,60
590,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I think we shall find that the honourable member will not be ready to fight the battle of the white in workers of Australia. I hope the Treastreet surer will take some note of what has been said in connection with the employment of Chinese in this industry. There is phase of the question of so much importVictorian ance to the white workers in the furniture trade as that connected with the competiexpert tion of Chinese within the Commonwealth.,61
591,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Is this a second reading speech ? Mr J. H , CATTS - i A number of orable members, and especially those in the capitalistic corner, grin when we talk about protecting the white man against the Chinese; but this is a most serious matter, and I hope that the Treasurer, when we come to deal With the Excise duties will see that protection is given to white in the furniture trade just as it has ney. been given to white men engaged in the sugar industry and other industries in - Commonwealth. I hope that when the Tariff is finally dealt with it will be that we have done something, not only protect this industry in Australia, but to conserve it for white men.",61
592,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [9.14] - I did not intend to speak on this matter, but several supporters of the Government made speeches so closely resembling a stone-wall of the Tariff, I may be pardoned for attempting to reply to some of the' statements that have been made, which are of such a nature that we cannot allow them to pass without criticism. The ments, advanced by those of the members who support these high duties, New South Wales 1898 69 igoo 77 Victoria1898 1900 59 New South Wales1898 ... ... 22 1900 ... ... 27 Victoria1808 ... ... 18 1900 ... ... 24 Includes Bedsteads, not included in New South Wales. show that their only effect will be to give a greater monopoly of the work to the Chinese Australia, particularly in Little Bourkeand other parts of Melbourne. The original reason why the Chinese have outstripped the Europeans in the manufacture no of furniture was the imposition of the high duties. Twenty-five years ago, when the Chinese came here, they were not cabinetmakers. They manufactured a low grade of common cedar chair. When the Victorian duty was imposed, the dealers, owing to the low price of the imported lowhongrade chair, were forced to go to the' Chinese for their supplies, and under their tuition the Chinese gradually became more expert. At that time we had no Chinese cabinetmakers in Sydney, but as the Melbourne Chinese became experts, they crossed the border and entered into competition men with the European cabinetmakers of SydConsequently, we in New South Wales have had to bear the burden of this the Chinese competition, resulting from the high Victorian duty in the past. A return found called for by the honourable member for to Kooyong showed that in New South Wales in 1898 there were sixty-nine factories, and 1,075 adult males employed; while in 1900 there were seventy-seven factories, and as )333 adult males employed in cabinetJ Gave making, &c. In Victoria in 1898 there were fifty-six factories, and 808 adult male operatives; while in 1900 there were fiftynine factories,. and 922 adult males employed. The following return shows the proportion of male and female adults and arguchildren employed* and the total number Labour of operatives in each State: CABINET MAKING AND BILLIARD TABLES. - 1) a S !=.U s HO 1.075 6 1,087 1.333 8 1.346 56 S08 12 827 20 942 . - 922 BEDDING, ETC. UPHOLSTERY, 308 80 389 315 -34 456 214 100 317 124 407 *3 These figures make it clear that under the lower New South Wales Tariff there were more factories, giving more employment, and making a better class of furniture, and that altogether the industry was much more flourishing than it was in Victoria under the higher protective Tariff. From evidence given by representatives of the Upholstery and Cabinetmakers' Unions of Sydney and Melbourne, it would appear that the competition of the Chinese was not felt very severely at that time, and that the wages in Sydney were higher than in Melbourne before the trade in the latter 'city was put under Wages Boards, and were somewhat higher even for some time afterwards. The following evidence was given before the Royal Commission on the Victorian Factories Act, sitting in Sydney, in July, 1901. Mr T; H . Thrower, president of the Sydney Labour Council, and well known in New South Wales as a prominent trades unionist, saidIn the furniture trade the work was mostly done on the piece-work system, in the cabinet branch the average earnings being from £ 2 5s. to £ 2 ys. 6d. for forty-eight hours. The torian Factories Act had not drawn any of their best men from Sydney. On the same occasion Mr E. W. Cutler, secretary of the Cabinetmakers' Union, of Sydney, statedWages average £ 2 12s. 6d. for barely fortyeight hours per week. The average is as high as in Melbourne under the Wages Board determination. Mr A. Dobson, secretary of the Furniture Operatives' Union, of Melbourne, addressing the Trades Hall Council, as reported in the Argus, of the 2nd August, 1901, quoted a letter received from the secretary of the Sydney union, showing wages to be higher in Sydney than in Melbourne. Mr. Dobson addedWages of furniture makers and polishers in Sydney have never come down to the level of those ruiing in Victoria. Men receive Sydney for work for which men are paid 35s. in Melbourne. This was all under the influence of the lower duty in New South Wales, where the wages paid' were higher than those paid in Melbourne, although the workers in the latter city were supposed to be getting the benefit of the higher protective duty, which was presumably imposed in the interests of the workers. The conditions in Melbourne before the minimum wage enactment was passed are shown by evidence given by delegates of various trades at a conference held between the Trades' Hall Council and the Anti-Sweating League, as reported Mr Johnson. in the Age of n t h June, 1900. The wickerworkers' delegate stated that under the piece-work system boys were employed to do the work, one factory having fourteen men, twenty boys, and three improvers. The Chief Inspector of Factories of Victoria, in his annual report for 1897, stated that adult furniture operatives earned an average of 31s. i d . per week at that time. A comparison of prices of most of the furniture is almost impossible, but it can be made regarding some lines. Kohn's Vienna chairs may be cited, the prices being those of Messrs. Anthony Hordem and Sons, of Sydney, and Messrs. Wallach Brothers, of Melbourne, before 8th October, 1901. For number 14 the. Sydney price was 4s. 9d., and the Melbourne price 5s. 6d. for the same chair. For number 20 the Sydney price was 5s -6d., and the Melbourne price 6s. 3d. I have here a great deal of statistical information, as well as a number of invoices, which I might quote to the Committee, but I do not want to occupy too much time. I wish to be as brief as I Vic- can, consistently with giving the necessary reply to some of the arguments which have been advanced on the other side. At the present time some of the best furniture made in Melbourne is being made by Chinese workers. I went with Mr Lonsdale, who formerly represented New England in this House, through one of the furniture factories of Melbourne. When we were admiring some magnificent specimens of cabinet work on exhibition, we were greatly surprised to learn that the furniture which we most admired, and thought to be high-class European manufacture, had been made by Chinese in this city, who were receiving wages higher than those paid here to Europeans.",61
593,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,A Chinaman cannot 45s. in turn out a good article.,62
594,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"That statement is not borne out by facts which are easily obtained in this city. The honourable member is not in possession of the facts as Mr Lonsdale and myself were. I am speaking from my own personal ' observation of the ' work. The manufacturers said to us, "" We do not mind telling you that this is all Chinese-made furniture, that we pay the highest wages to Chinese, and get the best class of goods from them; but it would not do for us to tell that to our ordinary customers, because there would be a prejudice against the furniture on that account."" I mention those facts to show that the effect of the high Victorian duty in the beginning was to encourage the'making of furniture by Chinese, and 10 establish them firmly in our midst, that the only effect of the high duty now proposed will be to further entrench them in this trade, and give them a practical monopoly as against their white competitors in America, Canada, and Great Britain. In the light of thosefigures,I hope that honourable members who claim present labour interests will pause before they consent to the imposition of such high duty, or anything approaching it, is proposed in this Tariff.",62
595,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Boothby) [9 28] I wish to reply briefly on one or two points. I believe there is a general derstanding in the Committee as to what duties are to be agreed to. The honorPengelly able member for Angas, in referring the great prosperity of the furniture tory at Edwardstown, South Australia, spoke as though its proprietors and manager did not desire increased duties. The honourable member argued that the previous duties had brought about such an era of prosperity that the firm required nothing further. But the evidence of Mr. Mathias, the manager, given before the Tariff Commission, in Adelaide-and since Chinese. repeated to me and a good many other honourable members personally-wa s that tions they could compete with the high-class goods imported, but complained that under the existing low Tariff the markets flooded with cheap importations from foreign countries, where low wages were lation as well. paid. This is the largest firm of furniture makers in Australia. Their manager added that they were not afraid of outside competition in high-class goods, such as bed-room suites, roll-top desks, &c.; but they could not compete against every time. shoddy importations, such as overmantels and wire doors, closet seats, and similar articles. He mentioned that the firm were about to start the making of bentwood furniture from Tasmanian tralian blaekwood. Since that time they have put down the necessary plant, have successfully experimented with the bending of Australian and Tasmanian cannot blaekwood for making bentwood chairs. ' The plant has now been put down, and work will be proceeded with as soon as the necessary operatives can be secured. The chinery. honourable member for Cook suggested that some special anti-Chinese legislation be passed, but to any proposal of that kind I am strongly opposed. Ever since I have had a seat in Parliament i have protested against the introduction of Asiatics or any and undesirable persons, but I have always taken the view that if these people are admitted into the country we ought to treat them as we treat other citizens.",63
596,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The Chinese cannot . be made to observe European conditions. to re Mr BATCHELOR - Our great obiection to the Chinese is really that their work a is cheaper than ours. I would point out, as however, that this problem has been solved in South Australia without the aid of any - special legislation. In that State formerly, as in Victoria and elsewhere, the unfurniture trade was practically in the hands of the Chinese until the firms of A. and Company, Edwardstown, and to Marshall and Company, Adelaide, erected facup-to-date machinery, and by this means drove the foreigners out of the business. There are more white men employed in the one factory at Edwardstown than, according to the honourable member for Cook, there are employed in the trade in the whole of Victoria. This is not a matter of protection against the outside world, but one of internal competition between whites and New protection, wages boards, and so forth, which make for equal condifor all, ought to be sufficient, in combination with up-to-date machinery, to enable white men to successfully compete were against the Chinese workers.",63
597,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,We require special legis,63
598,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"In my opinion it is a reflection on us as white men and cm our civilization, to admit that any special legislation is necessary. Given equal conditions, we can compete with the Chinese",63
599,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Why was an Excise duty placed on black-grown sugar?,63
600,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,In order that the and Auskanakas might be deported.,63
601,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,We ought to get rid of and the Chinese who are here.,63
602,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I am afraid we quite do that. ' It is necessary to have a duty sufficiently high to secure the home market, and thus make it worthwhile to invest in thoroughly up-to-date maUnder such circumstances furniture would probably be cheaper than should under free-trade conditions.",63
603,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [9.34] The acting leader of the Opposition plained - that I had not afforded sufficient information or evidence to justify the commendations of the Tariff Commission, and particularly the recommendation in ference to chairs and lounges. I do deem it necessary in all cases to go through the reports of the Commission, which are accessible to all honourable members.",64
604,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Does the honourable member not think, it his duty to justify this very large increase of the duty on chairs ?",64
605,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I did not think i necessary to make a long statement. merely desired to draw attention to one lowspassage in the evidence, though I might have referred to many; However, as the honourable member has challenged me I value shall invite his attention to another passage in the report of the Tariff Commision, Commonwealth page 471In Victoria it was pointed out that the wages in China, India, and Japan (including the Straits Settlements) are abnormally low-fro m Sd. to od. per day. Some of the lounges and chairs coming from these countries and invoiced at 5s. would take three days .to make. Similar statements were made by Mr Lowe and Mr Dobson, who are engaged in the trade in Victoria. In Western Australia, Mr Baker, a furniture maker, voiced the complaints of the manufacturers as to the bitter competition caused by imports from the Straits Settlements, and as to extensive dumping on the part of the United States. Another wickerworker, named Jarvis, in Western Australia, complained that the price of wicker furniture in that State had decreased considerably during the last fifteen years, owing to the importation of inferior goods, while in some cases the cost of material had increased, and in other particular lines had decreased, during that time. Mr Baker further said that locallymade rattan lounges, which are of superior make, were sold wholesale at from 25s. upwards, while the imported article was retailed at 17s. 6d. ; and that chairs were sold at Singapore, f.o.b., at 4s. 6d., while similar chair's were marked in the shop windows at Adelaide at n s . 6d., and had been sold at auction for 9s. 6d. price, Mr Baker said, does not pay local manufacturers, and Mr Jarvis added that ordinary lounges could be produced locally at about 22s. 6d., while the imported article was sold at ios. or 12s. It will be seen, therefore, that it was not only the evidence of the three witnesses in Melbourne on which this fixed duty was based. By the way, this duty was intended to comoperate on wicker and bamboo work; but, unfortunately, by inadvertence in the redrafting of the Tariff, it was made generally applicable to all chairs. I propose reto ask the Committee to so amend theso not items as to confine them to wicker and bamboo chairs, leaving other chairs and lounges to come under the general duty of 40 per .cent.' In regard to importations, the Commission and myself have been accused of negligence in not giving consideration to that questioin. However, I invite the attention of honourable members to the t complete details, as shown on page 475 of I the Tariff Commission's report, as folThe following figures, taken from Trade and Customs Returns, 1904, pages 420-1, show the of imported wickerware into the Commonwealth for the years specified :-190 0 (prioT to Tariff), £90,397; 1901, £117,528; - 9 ° ; ^'.53.764: 1903.

The imports into Australia from the Straits Settlements were :-1900 , £5,980; 1901, £12,458; 1902, £5,627; 1903, £6,432; 1904, £7,198; total, £37,695.",64
606,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The imports were practically stationary with an increasing population.,64
607,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,The population was not increasing in the same ratio as the importations.,64
608,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , ancl in greater ratio. The importations from the Straits Settlements last vear dropped to £ 1 , 1 0 0 . Sir JOHN ""QUICK - Importations fluctuate. I have now laid before honourable members the information which was available to the Tariff Commission; and I submit that the acting leader of the Opposition was not justified in his charge that we did not properly investigate the matter 1 or place sufficient material at the disposal of honourable members.",64
609,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"Cowper) [9.42] - When this item was reached, before the dinner-hour, the Treasurer led us to understand that its consideration would occupy only a few minutes. As a matter of fact, the discussion has continued for a That considerable time; and it would' be out of place on my part to prolong it further than to make a suggestion which I think may meet with approbation. If I am able to judge the feeling of the Committee, the duty is objectionable chiefly in its application to chairs; but I understand that the Treasurer will so arrange the items as to meet that objection-the duty of 7s. 6d. being abandoned. There seems to be a feeling that the general duty on furniture is rather high; and I think that 'the discussion might be shortened if the Treasurer were to accept duties of 35 pet cent, and 25 per cent.",64
610,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [9.45] - I wish to say a word or two in reply to the honourable member for Bendigo, who acted as Chairman of the Tariff Commission. I am glad thlat he quoted the figures which he did, because they furnish incontestable proof that higher duties are not needed to protect our furniture trade. The honourable member referred to wicker furniture. But I have learned from the Customs officers in attendance upon the Treasurer that last year the total importations of this class of furniture into the Commonwealth were valued at about £25,000. So that there has been a huge drop in the importations since the period to-which the honourable member referrea.",65
611,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Th efigureswhich the honourable member has quoted have been obtained since our report was drawn up.,65
612,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member's own statistics show that our furniture manufacturers have "" scotched "" the importations",65
613,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,No . They fluctuate a great deal.,65
614,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The increase in our importations of furniture has not been proportionate to our increase in population. Last year the total value of the importations of wickerwork furniture into the Commonwealth was less than £25,000. The honourable, member for Bendigo talked about our importations from Japan and China. I invite his attention to the fact that the furniture used in Australia represents more than (£2,500,000 annually, and that our total importations firohr Japan and the Straits Settlements were valued at only £10,000. The Government proposal is so absurd as not to merit serious consideration. For every pound's worth of furniture imported from those countries we manufacture £250 worth in Australia. Could any better proof be forthcoming that these extraordinary duties are not required to protect the furniture industry from outside competition ?",65
615,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [9.48] - I should very much like to adhere to the duties scheduled in connection with this item, namely, 40 per cent, under the general Tariff, and 30 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. But after listening to the exhaustive debate which has taken place, I feel that I shall be meeting the temper of the Committee if I propose to substitute for those duties 35 per cent, and 30 per cent, respectively.",65
616,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Will those rates also apply to the next two items ?,65
617,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I think so. Wicker furniture will be dealt with under item 304. Under the circumstances, I am compelled to accept lower rates than I should have liked to see imposed. If I thought that by prolonging the debate I could attain my desire, I should have no hesitation whatever in consenting to the House being called together immediately after Christmas for the purpose of completing the consideration of the Tariff. I do not think it is right that we should sacrifice duties merely for the purpose of securing an adjournment before Christmas. But I do not know that I can do any better than agree to the rates upon which the Committee have evidently determined. Consequently, I intend to move that the amendment be amended by adding after rhe words-"".ad val.,"" the'words ""(General Tariff), 35 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 25 per cent.""",65

An hour ago I understood that the'rates to be'proposed were 30 per cent, and 25 per cent.

The public of Australia contribute to the maintenance of the hospitals, and the patients have no greater desire to rest their bodies on imported furniture than have other people.

646,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes ; I was going to give some details, but that will really be the effect of the amendment.",67
647,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [10.13] I wish to explain that this foot-note was introduced in order to secure a statutory definition of the term ""superficial feet."" It appears that in the various States, there was a conflict of definition. 'The Customs It is authorities investigated the matter, but were unable to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. The Tariff Commission were asked to remove doubts by introducing a statutory definition, and we accepted one which was given to us in Queensland, and which was supported by a certain measure of authority. I was never very ""sweet"" on this definition. I have always thought that a superficial foot should mean an area of one square foot'on one square surface, and not less than 1 inch thick. I could never see the justice of charging as an inch that which was under an inch; but some of my colleagues thought that that was the true definition, and for the sake of having the point discussed by Parliament, I signed a report embodying that definition. Parliament is now afforded an opportunity to deal with the question. I .shall not regret the omission of the definition. I think it will remove a considerable cause of complaint and irritation, especially in connection with dressed timber dutiable at 3s. per LYNE) 100 superficial feet.",67
648,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [10.14] This question has been discussed a good deal in connection with the old Tariff. ""Undoubtedly, a number of timber workers have claimed that the real intention of the old Tariff was that whatever the thickness of a board might be, it should be charged duty as if it were an inch thick. It was contended, in various States, that if a board were a quarter of an inch thick, it should be treated as if it were an inch thick.",67
649,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"That is the trade practice, anyhow.",68
650,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That is so; but the Crown Solicitor advised the Department that under the old Tariff, it had no authority to do. so. The idea of the Government in putting the asterisk in this line was to give them legal authority to charge for i inch, whatever 'the thickness of the plank. I think that the Treasurer might very well have stated the real reason why he desired to omit this definition.",68
651,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,In some cases it would make the duty four times as much.,68
652,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"There exists a difference of opinion as to how the duty should be charged. If this authority is not inserted, it means that if planks are J-in. thick eight of them will come in as i-ineh timber. Wha.t the Committee want to keep clearly in mind is, that if they omit the asterisk with the accompanying footnote, we shall simply be declaring that everything will be charged up to the inch, if sixteen planks go to make an inch, then sixteen thicknesses will be charged as i-irtch limber.",68
653,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,It means that if we omit the definition the timber will be charged in proportion to its thickness.,68
654,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is what it really means. A great deal of evidence was given before the Royal Commission. The Treasurer might very well explain the far-reaching consequences of the amendment which he has moved. Some people thought that authority existed under the old Tariff to charge as the Customs have been charging during the time of the temporary collection of duties under the new Tariff. The Attorney-General and the Crown Law officers always advised that no power to charge in that way existed under the old Act.,68
655,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Barrier) [10.20] - I desire to know whether I shall be in order if the Treasurer's amendment is carried in moving another amendment to the effect that oregon and New Zealand pine be added after the word ""undressed""?",68
656,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Does the honourable member desire to make them free ?,68
657,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Yes .,68
658,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, The honourable member would not be entitled to go back.,68
659,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"In view of that information from the Chair, I take it that the Minister will be prepared to withdraw his amendment for the time being.",68
660,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.22] - Perhaps in view of the speech of the honourable member for Wide Bay, I had better carry out my first intention, and give the Committee some details as to the method that will be adopted regarding measurements. I thought the Committee would be satisfied after. what I said in reply to the interjection of the honourable member for Flinders, and that it would be sufficient to simply say that the old system would be reverted to as far as measurements are concerned.",68
661,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I think there was a difference of opinion, and the Crown Law officers gave their view.",68
662,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The method is as followsIn the timber trade "" superficial f o o t "" means timber measuring 12 inches long by 12 inches wide by 1 inch thick. A piece of timber measuring 12 x 12 x '£ measures in the trade half a superficial foot. In other words, the timber trade, in selling timber by the superficial foot, measures it on its actual thickness. The provision in the Tariff as recommended by the Commission, however, directs that when timber has a thickness of less than 1 inch, the thickness shall be taken as 1 inch for purposes of duty. E.G - A piece of timber measuring 12 x 12 x which in the trade is sold as half a superficial foot, is regarded for purposes of duty as being 1 superficial foot. If it is desired to - revert to the practice under the old Tariff (which was the same as the trade practice mentioned), it is only necessary to strike out the asterisks wherever they appear against "" super, foot,"" and delete the footnote. That is a description which I put on record with a view of showing what I am proposing. By removing the asterisk we revert to the old system of measuring, instead of slicing the timber, so to speak, into so many small thicknesses. I think that honourable members will be satisfied with that explanation, which shows the bona fides of what we arte proposing. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",68
663,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Barrier) [10.23] - I move That after the word "" undressed,"" paragraph A, the words ""oregon and New Zealand pine"" be inserted.",68
664,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Why confine it to Oregon and New Zealand pine? What about yellow pine and other varieties?,68
665,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I shall raise no objection to the addition of yellow pine and other varieties, but, for the moment, I am confining myself to oregon and New Zealand pine. The reason why I move that these timbers be admitted free in these sizes is because they are timbers which are used very extensively in the Broken Hill mines. I will confine myself to the case as it affects those mines, leaving other honourable members to speak on behalf of their constituencies. It is absolutely necessary for the safety of the mines at Broken Hill that a large amount of oregon timber should be used. In the first place, it is used on account of its lightness; secondly, on account of its cost; and also because we are informed by the mine managers and by the men who work in the mines that oregon timber gives notice by creaking when some portions of the mines are, as they say, "" coming together.""",68
666,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,It is also much lighter to handle.,69
667,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"It is, and consequently it is very advantageous to use it in some portions of the mines. But the great advantage, apart from that, is that it does not snap off suddenly, as hardwood does, biit gives the men notice by creaking. To use a term that is employed at the Hill , "" it talks,'-' and the men in the stopes have ample notice before a collapse takes place.",69
668,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Would the companies refuse to use it if the duty were made higher?,69
669,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"No ; in certain portions of the mines oregon timber must be used, irrespective of the duty. Even if the duty were considerably higher than IS. 6d. proposed, it would have to be used. ber has made.",69
670,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,What jarrah ?,69
671,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"In the first place, it too costly a timber, and, in the second place, it does not offer the advantage that I have referred to in the case of oregon. I will give a few figures as to the added cost that this duty means to the mines Broken Hill . As far as the Broken H i Proprietary Mine is concerned, the duty exploration work. will mean an increase of £ 4 , 0 0 0 a year. Under the old Tariff £ 2 , 0 0 0 per annum was paid. The new duty would mean an the added cost of £ 4 , 0 0 0 , making the duty £ 6 , 0 0 0 in that mine alone. I Broken Hill South Mine the duty would mean an added cost of £ 1 , 6 5 3 ; U 1 Hill Block 10 an increase of £ 8 4 6 the British Broken Hill an increase £ 6 2 0 ; in Broken Hill Block 14, £ 3 0 0 ; in junction North, £ 3 2 0 ; in . Soutb Blocks, £ 2 4 5 ; to the Sulphide Corporation, £ 2 , 6 8 7 J i ° North Broken Hill , £2,200. That means a total of £ 1 2 , 8 7 1 in added cost for the mines which I have mentioned. Then there are a number of smaller mines, whose expenses in connection with timber have been i ncreased by the duties by, say, £ 3 , 0 0 0 , making the extra taxation of the Broken Hill mining industry in respect of timber duties alone, over £ 1 5 , 0 0 0 . Besides Oregon, a great deal of stringy bark is used in the mines, over 500,000 superficial feet being needed in a year for lining. A small quantity of South Australian timber is used, but its use is limited because of its weight, and the consequent cost of freight and handling.",69
672,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,Is oregon used in the round ?,69
673,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,No ; in the square.,69
674,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"It is put in in sets, roughly squared.",69
675,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Yes . In connection with the big wide lodes which occur at Broken Hill-som e of them 300 feet wide - squar e sets of timber have to be used. Some of the mines which I have mentioned pay handsome dividends, and perhaps could afford to contribute more largely to the revenue; but it must be remembered that the extra duties will have to be paid by all mines, both those which are being worked at a profit, and those which are not.",69
676,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"That is the the strongest point which the honourable memabout Mr THOMAS - I think the strongest point which I have made is that oregon is timber is required to insure the safety of the men working in the mines. Some of the Broken Hill mines are not very profitable at the present time. Only recently - it was stated that the Junction mine, which at has been employing a good many imen, is l l likely to be closed down, except for some No doubt, the main reason for closing that mine is the f all in the 'price of lead, but another reason' is fact that it is now more costly to cany total on mining operations than it was before n the the new Tariff was imposed. Whatever our fiscal faith may be, we must acknowBroken ledge that duties when first imposed make ; in commodities dearer. No industry has been of more heavily penalized by the Tariff than the mining industry, which has had to carry the baby all along. been done for the benefit of that industry.",69
677,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Have not the machinery duties been reduced to almost nothing?,70
678,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"If the honofable Memask, ber was importing machinery, he would say that to pay £ 3 0 or £ 3 5 on every £ 1 worth was nothing. The machinery _ duties were imposed to benefit, not the mining in this subject. dustry, but the engineering trade. I do not say that - our engineers and artizans should not receive assistance; but I feel mining purposes. bound to point out that this Parliament has done, and can do nothing, directly for benefit of the miner, although, to assist other people, he is being taxed on everymost thing he uses. I trust that an unduly boxes. heavy tax will not be placed on the timber that is necessary for the safety of mining operations. Not only do the miners desire to obtain undressed timber free, but, according to a paper which I have received from the Melbourne Timber Merchants' Association and the Federated Saw-mills Employes' Association, the employers and employees connected with the timber trade ask that oregon timber, 12 x 7, and larger sizes, be admitted duty free.",70
679,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Thos e connected with the timber industry ask for higher duties on other timber.,70
680,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"We must Heal with that request when we come to the item which it concerns. While I may not be prepared to vote for the rates asked for, I shall, if the Government gives reasonable and fair treatment to undressed timber, deal in like fashion with dressed timber.",70
681,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Is dressed timber used at Broken Hill ?,70
682,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Not though a great deal is used for house building and other purposes. There is a large saw-mill at Broken Hill for the dressing of timber, which employs a number of men and does a great deal of work.",70
683,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"The member proposes that the rich companies shall get their timber free, and that the poor men who live in cottages shall pay duty.",70
684,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I do not desire that the torich companies shall escape their fair share of taxation, but if a duty is imposed on undressed timber, a still higher duty will be imposed on dressed timber. cheaper the production of ore, the more the Nothing has employment that will be given. It is better to have a dozen mines working than to have only two or three, because, when there is a great demand for men, wages are higher than when men have to run after the mining managers to get employment. I . too, that New Zealand pine for the not manufacture of butter boxes be admitted 0 0 duty free, though I shall leave it to other honourable members to speak at length on In the last Parliament we did not act fairly in allowing New Zealand pine to come in free and taxing Oregon for The butter export trade is a big one which we all would like to see the grow, and those connected with the butter industry should be able to get the best and suitable timber for making butter But, at the same time, an industry which employs a great many more persons, pays better wages, and has a much more valuable export trade, should be allowed to get its raw materials as cheaply as possible. However, if I were to speak for a considerable time. I should probably not alter a vote, and, therefore, having put my case before the Committee, I hope that honourable members will allow this timber to come in free.",70
685,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [10.45] - I suggest that this would be a convenient time to report progress. We have had two long nights and three long days this week. I venture to say that if the honourable member permitted us to get a good night's sleep, it would tend to facilitate, rather than to retard business. I promise him that he will not lose anything by acceding to my request. We all recognise the necessity of pushing on with the Tariff, and it will tend to facilitate business if we adjourn to-night at a reasonably early underground, hour.",70
686,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.46]- I am quite agreeable to progress being now reported, for I admit that the two long sittings that we have had this week have been rather exhausting. honourable Progress reported.
