1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have to inform the House that ou the 19th January I received the following letter from Mr Charles Gavan Duffy, who has been Clerk of this House for the last'fifteen years:Dear Mr Speaker, The President. has been good enough to inform me that he will nominate me ior appointment as Clerk of the Senate, which position is vacant through' the regretted retirement of Mr Boydell. I much regret severing my connection with the House of Representatives, of which I have heen Clerk for more than fifteen years. I am anxious, however, before finishing my long official career, to fill the office of Clerk of the Senate. I therefore ask your approval to my transfer. I desire to thank honourable members of the House generally for the uniform courtesy they have extendedto me. I have served under all the Speakers of the House of Representatives, and I am most grateful for the consideration I have always received from them. For the consistent kindness and consideration I have received from you . during your long term of office as Spe&ker l shall always have the most grateful recollection. To my colleague, Mr Gale, and other members of the Btaff I am much indebted for their loyal and' efficient assistance. I am, dear Mr Speaker, - Faithfully yours, C. GAVAN DUFFY, Clerk of the House of Representatives. To this letter I replied as follows:22nd January, 1917. My dear Mr Daffy, I have to acknowledge the receipt of yonr letter of the 19th inst., in which you inform me of your proposed appointment to the position of Clerk of the Senate. Allow me to congratulate you, after your long and honourable parliamentary career in connection with the Legislative Assembly in Victoria, and the Senate and the House of Representatives in the Commonwealth, upon your new appointment. Let me also express to you my personal regret that the long official acquaintance between you and myself is closing. For more than nine years, first as Chairman of Committees, and subsequently as Speaker of the House of Representatives, I have been officially connected with you. During this long period I hare been indebted to yon for your advice on many occasions, and I have had frequent opportunities of appreciating your invariable courtesy and your energy and ability. I am sure that members of tha Honse will agree with me in appreciation of your good . qualities, both personal and official, and they will, I feel certain, join with me in wishing you every Buccess in your new appointment. Yours sincerely, CHAS. MODONAI.D, Speaker. PROMOTION OF OFFICERS.",5

3,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister had his attention directed to a couple of articles in the Sydney Morning' Herald of 25th and 26th January, hy the Professor of Mathematics in the University of Sydney, criticising the Federal Income Tax Act 1916, and will he ask the Federal Statistician to report on the points in which Professor Carslaw contends that the Act is in error?",6
4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have glanced hurriedly through the articles with which the honourable member has furnished me, and rejoice that he does not suggest that I should arbitrate personally in this matter. I shall call on the Statistician, whom I have defended in this chamber many times, to prove that he is worthy of all that some of us have said of him, and undeserving of some of those things which we Have not said of him. DAYLIGHT SAVING ACT.",7
5,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In view of the widespread dissatisfaction, not only in the country, but in the towns also, with the operation of the Daylight Saving Act, does the Government propose to introduce a repealing Bill at an early date ? 1",7
6,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have no official knowledge of any reason why the Act should be repealed. ""When the measure was under consideration I adopted the lucid and beneficent suggestions made by the honourable member, and thought' that with those improvements it should be perfect. If , however, some persons are unable to see it in that light, I am prepared to look into the matter. STATE EMBARGO ON STOCK.",7
7,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Has the Government come to a decision as to what action can be taken in regard to the Queensland Government's embargo on the removal of stock from that State?,7
8,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It has been decided, upon the advice of the Attorney-General, that the Inter-State movement of stock, being intimately related to export, is a matter coming within the ambit of the legislative powers of the Commonwealth, and it is therefore proposed to legislate either directly, or by regulation under the War Precautions Acts, in such a way as will prevent the State of Queensland from taking action having for its object the prohibition of the movement of stock from that State to another. - OPPOSITION BENCHES: ACCOMMODATION.",7
9,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Will the Prime Minister tell us what action he intends to take to reduce the congestion on the Opposition benches?,7
10,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The licentiates of the Royal College of Physicians are now meeting for the purpose of preparing a blister which it is hoped will reduce that congestion. DEFENCE FINANCE.  - Treasurer been drawn to a statement made in Sydney last Monday, during the hearing of a court case, to the effect that there are 10,000 sovereigns lying about the Defence Department wanting an owner? Will the honourable gentleman put the croupier on them as soon as possible?  paragraph to which the honourable member refers I caused inquiries to be made, and found it had reference to a statement in the Auditor-General's report concerning an examination.'made in Sydney about April, 1915. The question was one, not of gold, but of cheques and cash which had been returned from the different places to which they had been sent, because the persons to whom the money was payable had not claimed it. There is no truth whatever in the statement as to the 10.000 sovereigns wanting an owner. PEACE TERMS.",7
11,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister state whether the Government have received from the Secretary of State for the Colonies a copy of the terms of the German or Central Powers' note having reference to peace proposals, and a copy of the Allies' reply thereto? If they have, will the right honourable gentleman have copies printed for. public information ?",7
12,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The answer to the first part of the question is '' No ' ' ; that, of course will answer the second part of it. CENTRAL WHEAT BOARD.  ister take into serious consideration the advisableness of appointing a farmers' representative on the Central Wheat Board,.as, I understand, he has been requested to do, by practically all the farmers of Australia?",7
13,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The constitution of the Central Wheat Board is not a matter wholly for this Parliament. It is a body extraneous to the Constitution, and arises out of an agreement between the wheat producing States and the Commonwealth. On the Board each State has a representative of its own, who is a Minister of the State, while the Commonwealth is represented by the Prime Minister or his appointee. The question of appointing a direct farmers' representative has been brought before the Board by myself. I have stated publicly that I am in favour of that representation ; but, unless, and u n t i l , the constitution of the Board is altered, no such' representation can be made. It is therefore clearly a matter for the Governments of the various wheat producing States to consider. I shall take an early opportunity of bringing the question before the Wheat Board, but can hold out no hope whatever of a reversal of their decision unless the respective State Governments change their views.",8
14,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"As the Prime Minister apparently finds it impossible to appoint a farmers' representative on the Central Wheat Board, can he assure the House that such a representative will be appointed on the Advisory Board, which advises respecting the sales, handling, and financing of the crop?",8
15,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"What the representatives of the various farmers' associations asked for at the Conference was representation on the Central Board, and that was the matter considered. The Advisory Board is a Board of experts; it does not decide anything. It is the Wheat Board that decides matters, and I take it that it is on that Board the farmers desire representation.",8
16,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The Advisory Board makes recommendations to the Central Board.,8
17,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It may make recommendations, but it does not make recommendations as to price.",8
18,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,As to everything.,8
19,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"No . The Board may make recommendations, but what I mean is that it has absolutely no power; its functions are purely advisory. I have said, the Advisory Board consists purely of experts, and I am very sure that representation on that body would not satisfy the farmer. I ' q u it e understand what the farmers desire, and, as I have said, I am in favour of it . SAFETY OF TROOPS AT SEA.",8
20,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Can the Prime Minister make a statement that will re assure the 7 families of the men who are going to the front as to ample precautions being taken to protect them from the submarine menace on their way oversea \ Has he made any special arrangements so that these men wil l be safeguarded until they reach their destination ?,8
21,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"If I could give such 4 an assurance it would not be these halls that would enclose me; my place would be in the Empyrean. I cannot give such an assurance - The whole forces of a great nation are arrayed against us for the purpose of destroying the commerce of the Empire; and with the formidable massed legions of Tuscany arrayed against me, I am asked to give a guarantee that we will carry safely through this cordon vessels conveying Australian soldiers to the front . When President Wilson, the leader of a great nation of 100,000,000 people, is unable to wrest from the foe anything like such a guarantee, I cannot give it .",8
22,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"F o l l o w in g on the question put by the honourable member for South Sydney, I would ask the Prime - Minister whether, in the case of transr ports bearing Australian troops to the front, our enemies have not in the past been ever ready ana willing to sink them without notice, and if the fact that they - have succeeded so little in the ,past is not the best comfort. that friends and relatives of Australian soldiers can have? Should it not comfort them in the belief that our arrangements in the futur e to prevent the sinking of Australian transports will be equally successful ?",8
23,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,We have enjoyed a most amazing and fortunate immunity from disaster. There has never been a war in which one-twentieth thousandth part of troops have been conveyed oversea where there has been so little loss. Of the many thousands that we have sent we have practically not lost at sea more than can be counted on the fingers of one hand. That is the best answer I can As give. The eternal vigilance of the British Navy is our only guarantee. GENERAL ELECTIONS. VOTES FOR SOLDIERS AT THE FRONT.,8
24,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Do the Government in tend to introduce a Bill to enable adult soldiers at the front to vote at the forthcoming Federal election ?,9
25,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I shall be glad to make whatever arrangements are necessary to enable our soldiers at the front to record their votes iat the forthcoming Federal elections. TASMANIANMAIL SERVICE. I SSUE OF RETURN PASSENGERS' TICKETS .,9
26,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Is the Postmasterf General aware that all the companies who participate in the mail contract between Tasmania and the mainland have ceased to issue return tickets to passengers on their vessels, and that only single tickets are now available ?",9
27,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I have heard something about the change, but under our contract with the companies I have no power to intervene in the matter referred to by the honourable member. Our"" contract does not extend to the conditions in question. E LECTION OF PRIMEMINISTER .",9
28,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister in view of the fact that there are only some thirteen members supporting him as Prime Minister, whether he will take the necessary steps to allow a census of the members of the House of Representatives to be taken, with a view to having the Prime Minister elected by the members of this House?",9
29,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I shall give a reply to the honourable member when the Ides of March have gone. M AILDELIVERYATTHE FRONT. shall consider it .,9
30,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,I desire to! know from the Postmaster-General' whether he has any reply to the inquiry I have previously made in regard to the delay in the delivery of letters to our boys the front- a delay which practically amounts to a breakdown ?,9
31,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Since the honourable member mentioned the matter communicated with the military authorities in charge of the postal service the front, and they report that arrangethat ments have been made other than those which prevailed when the honourable me member first drew - attention to matter. WOR KS ATFLINDERS .",9
32,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I desire to know from the Minister for the Navy whether an amended reference of certain works at Flinders to the Publio Works Committee may not be laid before the House, so that the whole scheme may be considered by Parliament with knowledge of the complete cost?",9
33,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I have no objection to that. POSTAL UNIFORMS.,9
34,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"I desire to know r o m the Postmaster-General whether, in the enormous profits which he has stated in the newspapers are made by his Department, he has included the amount withheld for the purchase of uniforms for the Queensland letter-carriers, who, during the recent hot weather, have been compelled to wear their heavy winter clothing ?",9
35,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The annual report of the Postal Service will be laid on the table in the course of a few days, when the honourable member may see all that has happened. I have no doubt that the information will be edifying to him .  Postmaster-General aware that instructions have been issued to deprive temporary letter-carriers of their uniforms? Will the honourable member take immediate steps to secure that such uniforms are provided? Mr Webster .^Whatever has been done in ' reference to temporary postmen is in conformity with the regulations governing those people. If the honourable member will specify any particular case in which he has any objection to offer, I POSTA LGUARANTEE S.",9
36,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Will the Postmaster-General, pending further consideraat tion, repeal the instruction issued, that where a mail service is not paying, the residents must guarantee 50 per cent, of the loss, or make arrangements for a conI have tinuation of the service ?",9
37,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I shall be quite willat ing to comply with the request provided the honourable member, and. those who think with him, are able to furnish with a tender for such services that is the within the bounds of reasonable possibility. INCO ME TAX .",9
38,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Is it a, fact that the Treasurer intends to introduce a Bill to amend the Income Tax Act at an early date owing to the difficulty there is in interpreting section 19?  consideration, but no determination bas yet been com© to - Mr HUGHES - So far as I know,",10
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is the Treasurer aware that - a great many income tax payers are being severely crippledquite crippled-by the enforcement of the large demands for the payment of this tax ? I should like to know whether, under the circumstances, the Treasurer will consider the advisability of affording some relief by allowing payment to be ynade in instalments. The matter is very serious in view of the increase, not only in the Federal tax, but in the State taxes. I ask the Treasurer to look into the whole question with a view of affording relief in the direction I have suggested.  pleased to look into the matter; but, if I am not mistaken, an arrangement has always been made by which taxpayers may be afforded relief in the way of deferred payments. NA REFERENDUM.",10
40,Mr HIGGS,MILITARYSERVI CE,When does the Minister for Home Affairs propose to lay on the table a copy of the statistical returns showing the voting within each sub-division on the M i l it a r y Service Referendum ?,10
41,Mr BAMFORD,MILITARYSERVI CE,The return will be ready to be laid on the table next Wednesday. SALE OF STAMPS.,10
42,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,MILITARYSERVI CE,"Has the Postmaster-General considered the representations made to him by certain stamp vendors, typists, and others in reference to the proposed reduction of the commission to be paid to them on the sale of stamps 1 If so, is he in a position to communicate the result of that consideration to the House?",10
43,Mr WEBSTER,MILITARYSERVI CE,"I have given the matter 'consideration, and upon one aspect of it I am calling for a report which will take a little time to prepare. When the report is available I will reply to the honourable member's question. SALE OF WOOLCLIP .",10
44,Mr RODGERS,MILITARYSERVI CE,"Will the Prime M in ister say whether there is any difference in respect of the basis of appraisement and mode of payment, between the wool supplied to Australian manufacturers and the wool supplied to the Imperial Government ? there is no difference. NA REFERENDUM.",10
45,Mr YATES,MILITARYSERVI CE,"Will the Prime Minister state whether the prosecution of Mr . Mclntyre and Mr Coombe, M . L . A . , of South Australia, under the War Precautions Act , for statements made at Tanunda during the Militar y Service Referendum campaign in October, has been authorized or approved by him ?",10
46,Mr HUGHES,MILITARYSERVI CE,I do not recollect having seen the name of Mclntyre in connection with any such prosecution. I will investigate the matter and give an answer tomorrow.,10
47,Mr YATES,MILITARYSERVI CE,"As Messrs. Mclntyre and Coombe were served with summonses for making utterances alleged to be pre- t judicial to recruiting during the conscription campaign in October, does the Prime Minister approve of three months having been allowed to elapse since the men were charged without their having been brought to trial ?",10
48,Mr HUGHES,MILITARYSERVI CE,"I have already stated that I know nothing whatever of the facts. The honourable member must not state a hypothetical case and ask me whether I approve or disapprove. I will make in quiries, and, on the facts, give an opinion. DALYRIVER COPPER MINE .",10
49,Dr MALONEY,MILITARYSERVI CE,"Will the Minister for Home Affairs and Territories lay upon the Library table all papers connected with the Daly River Copper Mine, including the letter and affidavit of Harold George Nelson?",10
50,Mr BAMFORD,MILITARYSERVI CE,The papers will be available on the Library table within an hour. REPATRIATION OF GERMANS .,10
51,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARYSERVI CE,"I should like, to ask the Prime Minister whether there is any foundation for the reports appearing in the press that negotiations are proceeding for the return to Germany of a number of Germans now in Australia ? If so, is there to be any reciprocal arrangement for the return to Australia of Australian prisoners now in Germany?",10
52,Mr HUGHES,MILITARYSERVI CE,"We have no direct communication with the enemy on this matter. So far as I know, the matter has not been raised either directly or through the channels of the Imperial Government. COASTAL STEAM - SH IP FARES .",11
53,Dr MALONEY,MILITARYSERVI CE,"In view of the advance made in fares by the coastal steamship companies by their refusal to issue return tickets, will the Minister for Trade and Customs ascertain whether, under the War Precautions Act, the companies cannot be compelled to pay the increases to the Treasury?",11
54,Mr ARCHIBALD,MILITARYSERVI CE,"I should ' think that it is within the right of steam-ship companies to issue either single or double tickets as they may think fit. As to the suggestion that we might put the War Precautions A ct into operation against the companies, I will have the matter looked into. NA ADMINISTRATION.",11
55,Mr FLEMING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,H as the Minister for Home Affairs and Territories yet been able to produce harmony in the official circles of the Northern Territory so that efficient work may be done?,11
56,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"D u r in g the short period I have been in office, I have found it difficult indeed to secure the harmony to which the honourable gentleman refers. But I am doing my level best, and if honourable members generally will give me an opportunity, I hope that later on such harmony may prevail. IMPERIAL CONFERENCE ",11
57,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In reference to the statement published in the press that the Prime Minister has received an invitation from the Imperial Government to attend a 'Conference at London, will the Prime Minister say whether that invitation is confined to himself, or is extended to himself and another member of the Government, or of this Parliament? Prime Minister any objection to laying upon the table of the House a copy of the invitation ?",11
58,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I aro unable to lay on the table of the House the correspondence to which the honourable member refers, because it is in the nature of secret despatches. I cannot disclose at this stage the contents of those despatches, beyond stating that they are, in effect, an invitation directed to me to visit England to take part in an Imperial Conference. I hope to be in a position in the course of a day or two to supply the honourable member and the House with the furthe r information which he desires. '",11
59,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Assumin g that the in v i tation is extended to more than one delegate, is it the opinion of the Prime M in ister that that body of public opinion which is represented by the Australian Labour Party should have representation at the Imperial Conference? Does he propose ""to invite the Australian Labour party to select a delegate to represent them at the Conference?",11
60,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There are many "" if s "" in the honourable member's question, but I will eliminate them, and say that I trust the Australian. Labour party will be represented at the Conference. If he is referring to the faction to which he belongs, I remind him that they had an opportunity of being represented at that Conference, but they deliberately turned their back on it . As for what the people of this country desire in this, matter, the honourable member will have an oppor^ tunit y of finding that out, perhaps sooner than he wishes.",11
61,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I object to the statement, of the Prime Minister that I belong to a faction. I belong to the great Australian Labour party, which is not a faction, and I ask that the Prime Minister be called upon to withdraw the term that he has used.",11
62,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I withdraw the word "" faction,"" and substitute "" fraction. "" PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE .",11
63,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Prime Minister has given notice that tomorrow he' will move to appoint Mr Sinclair to the Public Works Committee. I desire to nominate Mr J . F . Hannan in substitution for Mr Sinclair. Shall I have the Has the opportunity of moving in that direction when the Prime Minister submits his motion ?,11
64,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,When the question is before the Chair the honourable member will have an opportunity of moving the amendment he desires. POSTAL DEPARTMENT. HOLIDAY PAY : ANNUAL REPORT: CONVEYANCE OF MAIL S BY RAIL .,11
65,Mr HANNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"As a condition of clusion the letter carriers award provides for the payment of double time for holidays, will the Postmaster-General say why has not been complied 'with in relation to Eight Hours Day ? Mr Webster:-Because it was not in accord with a decision of the Cabinet concerning statutory holidays.",12
66,Mr HANNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the PostmasterMinister General contend that a decision of Cabiput net overrides an Arbitration Court award given strictly in accordance with the existing law ? .,12
67,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The contention that Fremantle ? the letter carriers were entitled to receive double pay for Eight Hours Day except in districts in which the day is proclaimed a holiday, is not in conformity with the Arbitration Court award.",12
68,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will the Postformed master-General say whether the annual report of his Department will be laid on the table immediately?,12
69,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The annual report of the Department will be laid on the table of the House at a later date.,12
70,Mr SAMPSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will the Postwill master-General state whether any agreecost ment has been arrived at between his Desame partment and the State railways conveyance of mails over the railways of Australia ?,12
71,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The matter has that been deferred on three occasions at the request of the State authorities, owing the fact that one of their representative men has been in England. That gentleconcerning man is now returning to Australia, arbitration on the matter of the charges notice. and rates will be commenced before the Inter-State Commission on the 19th instant. RETURNED SOLDIERS.",12
72,Mr STUMM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has the Prime Minisby ter agreed to give the State of Queenswool-grower's land pecuniary assistance towards the settlement of returned soldiers on the land? If so, will he state what form the proposed assistance will ta'ke? [368 ]",12
73,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The matter about which the honourable member has spoken occupied the attention of the Premiers* Conference for some days, and a conwas arrived at entirely to the satisfaction, so I understand, of the ' States, Queensland was invited to come in under this that arrangement, but I am not sure whether it has done so. It is still open for it to do so, and there the matter; stands, and will stand. WOOL CLIP.",12
74,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the 'Prime propose to accede to the request forward by the Pastoralists' Association of Western Australia that the appraisement of wool should be carried out at Geraldton and at Albany as well as at,12
75,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member has brought this matter before me on several occasions, and I have had many communications with the Central Wool Committee in reference to it. I am in that the committee held a meeting yesterday, at which it was decided to appoint wool and sheep-skin selling centres at Geraldton and Albany.",12
76,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not disagree with the decision arrived at, but I ask the Prime Minister why Newcastle, where there are thousands of bales of wool that have to be carried to Sydney at a of 4s. a bale, has been denied the privilege as has been extended to the for the Western Australian ports?",12
77,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There is a French problem which says, "" It is the first step counts."" I can only say, in reply to the honourable member, that I shall make to inquiries from the Central Wool Committee, without delay, as to their attitude the position at Newcastle and which he has already brought under my",12
78,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Unde r the wheat pool all farmers are practically treated"" alike, but under the wool pool it is impossible to treat all wool-growers alike. The central committee has created a fund retaining a certain proportion of each money, in order that adjustments may be made later, but early sellers got immediate payment, some even before the Board got its money, and they also got higher prices for their wool. ""Will the Prime Minister take into consideration the position of those wool-growers who . will be standing out of their money for many months, and make some provision for the payment of interest? '",12
79,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not propose to give an answer to a question I do not clearly understand. This is a very involved matter, and the honourable member has made it a practice to spring' on me these almost mathematical problems to which he cannot expect an immediate answer. The basis of the arrangement is recognised as good. I do not admit that under it any wool-grower will be kept waiting for his money longer than he would have had to wait for it had no interference with the ordinary course of business taken place. The "" appraisements will be made as rapidly as the wool sales occur, and the money will be paid within fourteen days after. It is per- aspects. fectly true that every wool-grower cannot be paid on the same day, but such a thing never yet happened. Precisely what can be done to put all the growers in exactly the same position I am unable to say, but it is the desire of the Government that all within the pool shall, so far as is humanly possible, be treated alike. I do not know what more can be done than is""* now being done to insure this, but I shall be glad to consider any suggestion that the honourable member may have to offer. OIL BORING IN PAPUA.",13
80,Mr LIVINGSTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has the attention of the Minister for Home Affairs been drawn to a recent statement in the Age that £58,000 has been spent on oilboring operations in Papua, bores having been put down to a depth of about 680 feet, and that the cost of boring down 100 feet in 1916 was £8,500 ?",13
81,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have read the article referred to; its statements are, in the main, correct. About £60,000 has been spent on boring for oil in Papua, and only about 2,000. gallons of oil have been obtained. This position is very unx satisfactory, but an effort is being made to do something more practical for the development of the oil-fields. NEW MINISTRY. Mr BOYP.^-A number of our friends in the Corner are desirous of knowing whether the forecast in today's* Age a correct statement of the personnel of the new Ministry?",13
82,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Was the forecast alluded to published in the meteorological column ? I have not seen it, but I have no doubt that it is quite wrong. SOLDIERS' REPATRIATION.",13
83,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Effort s are being made fbr the repatriation of the returned soldiers, for which sufficient funds are not available. Will the Prime Minister see that money is advanced from the Treasury to enable the officials to handle more men, and to deal with them more quickly ?",13
84,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The whole question of repatriation was thoroughly considered at the Premier's Conference in all its As regards the settlement of soldiers on the land it was agreed that the Commonwealth should assume the responsibility of finding the money needed, the State's to provide.the land. In regard! to repatriation other than land settlement, the Commonwealth has assumed the whole responsibility for the welfare of returned soldiers, has undertaken to find them employment, to teach them, where necessary, useful trades and callings, to assist them in setting up small businesses, and to help them directly during periods in which their labour must be unremunerative, and in cases of invalidity. The scheme, as outlined, was considered by the Repatriation Trustees and approved. The repatriation scheme is to be carried out under Commonwealth authority. The Repatriation Trustees accept the view that the work to be done is so vast, complex, and difficult as to demand the whole attention of the most capable man whose services can be obtained, and it has been decided to appoint a Commissioner and, possibly, two Assistant Commissioners, to take charge of it . The precise relations between the Repatriation Trustees and the Commissioner have not been finally determined, but it is thought that they should be analogous to those of company directors and their manager. It is proposed to connect the Commonwealth machinery with the States through the State War Councils. The permanent officers of the councils will be Commonwealth officials, but the State War Councils will represent the States, and will undertake towards the returned men the duties and responsibilities which the States are only too ready to recognise. These'are the broad outlines of the scheme which has been approved by the' Premiers' Conference, the Repatriation Trustees, and the Government. We are now considering what shall be the precise relations between the Repatriation Trustees and the proposed Commissioner or Commissioners and the appointments necessary to launch the scheme. The Treasurer informs me that in the meantime the War Councils are being supplied with all the money for which they ask, the Government thinking that it is better to make ten mistakes than to treat one soldier unjustly. Our desire is to abolish red-tape and delay, and to deal directly with the men in a sympathetic and effective fashion. WAR PENSIONS.",13
85,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I wish to know from the Treasurer whether the War Pension Branch of his Department is better organized than it was? If not, will the honourable gentleman endeavour to improve its organization so that returned soldiers and the dependants of soldiers may receive their pensions more quickly than has been the case in the past, and that irritating, and often painful, may be prevented ?  Department is much better organized than it was, and is now practically to deal with every application as it is received. Under a new arrangement which I have instituted, it can provide that a soldier, a widow, or any other dependant, shall get, within twenty-four hours, what he is entitled to. I have appointed addithis tional magistrates to deal with pension way deal with the war. claims, and having been in communication with the Returned Soldiers Association, I know that its members would admit not read them. that there is a vast improvement in the way in which pension business is now being dealt with. ELECTORAL ROLL.",14
86,Mr SHARPE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Seeing that we are on the eve of a general election,' and that the electoral roll is in a very unsatisfaccensor tory state, I ask the Minister for Home Affairs if he has arranged with the PostI master-General that the letter-carriers notice-paper. [368]- 2 shall assist in the compilation of a satisfactory roll by recording removals and chronicling arrivals in the districts which they serve.",14
87,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The roll at the present moment is not as perfect as it might be; but, having had in mind the possibility to which the honourable member has referred, I havej during the last month or six weeks, consulted with Mr Oldham on several occasions,, and have ascertained that, every thing which can be done to insure a complete roll is being done. Over a month ago I gave authority for obtaining assistance from the letter-carriers, . who are being supplied with what are termed habitation cards. They are in close touch with the residents of the districts in which they work, and with their help the roll, by the time the event to which the honourable member has alluded occurs, will probably be as perfect as it has ever been. Everything will be ready quite as soon as he would wish. IMPORTATION OF BOOKS.",14
88,Mr BURNS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is the Postmaster General aware that Colonel Newell, the censor in his Department, is prohibiting the importation into the Commonwealth of certain books which do not in any way delays deal with the war?",14
89,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The censor in question, whatever he may be doing, is not able under my authority.",14
90,Mr BURNS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence if he is aware that the military censor in the Post Office is preventing the delivery to booksellers in city of books which do not in any He says that these books are rubbish, and ought not to - come in, although he admits that he has",14
91,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The information which the honourable member has supplied is new to me.

99,Mr TUDOR,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I .am not anxious to kill the movement.,16
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Why make these improper statements ?,16
101,Mr TUDOR,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The subject was introduced by the Leader of the Liberal party, and but for his interjection I should not have referred to it. I now leave it. I trust that we shall have from the Prime Minister next Wednesday a definite statement concerning the suggested Fusion. I have no objection to the granting of a month's Supply, but I am hopeful, having regard to the hints that have been thrown out during question time today, that we shall have an early appeal to the people. I hope that both Houses of the Parliament will make an early appeal to the people, so that the electors may have an opportunity, to give their verdict on the questions that have been before us, and have also been brought prominently under their notice.  I move That there be granted to service of. the year ending the 30th day of June, 1917, a sum not exceeding £1,211,012. The proposed vote is to cover a month's Supply, and the schedule to the Bill tains nothing that is new.

In these circumstances, shall not further discuss the motion. v Mr HIGGS. (Capricornia) [4.16] - I regret that the Prime Minister has left the chamber, because I wished to refer the answers that he gave this afternoon to some questions addressed to him. As to the invitation to the Commonwealth to be represented at the Imperial Conferhis ence, I think there is a great deal much secrecy about the methods of the Prime Minister. I see no objection ever to the terms of the invitation'being submitted to the House. We are entitled the to know from the Prime Minister what the invitation to the Imperial Conference really comprises. Is it an invitation to the Prime Minister alone to attend, or an invitation to the Prime Minister and such other parliamentary representatives as he chooses to take with him ?",16
102,Mr FOWLER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,It is reported that the Prime Minister of Canada is to take three representatives of the Dominion with him. The invitation is probably the same in the case of Australia.,16
103,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,It is reported that the Prime Minister of Canada is to take at least two representatives with him.,16
104,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Will the honourable member go?,16
105,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I am not a candidate. I hold the view that the Prime Minister, who, in the opinion of some people, should be the sole representative of Australia at the Imperial Conference, really represents nobody in the Commonwealth. He has no political party behind him. He has referred to his Ministerial party, but that party consists of men who left the Australian Labour party, and they have as yet no political party to back them up. They may create a political party, but it will be at the expense of the .Liberal party.  His Majesty for the sure of that?",16
106,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I am. The Leader of the Liberal party himself has said that any party which the Prime Minister forms conin the Commonwealth will be created at the expense of the Liberal party.,16
107,Mr LYNCH,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Not wholly.,16
108,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"A few of those who forhave merly belonged to the Labour party may At join the Hughes party, but I venture to say that only a very small percentage of time the supporters of the Labour party in Australia will join his organization.",16
109,Dr CARTY SALMON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Then why should I . the honourable member complain?,16
110,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I do not.,16
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,It is his tender to solicitude for the Liberal party.,16
112,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Not at all. The Prime Minister is not in a position to represent public opinion in Australia until he forms political organization. We have in too the Commonwealth only two great political organizations-the Liberal party and what the Labour party-and Australia ought to be represented, if represented at all, at Imperial Conference by members of those two parties.  party a chance to come in . . Mr HIGGS - An invitation was extended to our party, at the. request of the Leader of the Liberal'party, to join in forming a Coalition Government. The Prime Minister would never have asked the Australian Labour party to joini n forming a National Government but for the insistence of the Liberal party. The Liberal party know very well they are taking upon themselves a very great responsibility in joining hands with the right honourable gentleman. would be let down very much more lightly in the opinion of the public if they could only induce the Australian Labour party to join them; but the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Liberal party know very well that the Australian Labour party do not believe in coalitions.  Empire!",16
113,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The honourable member knows that the Coalition Government formed by Mr Asquith, Mr Bonar Law, and others went to nieces simply because it was a coalition. It is difficult enough to get anything done by a Government representing solely one political party. There is always some member or Minister who points out that it is unwise to do certain things; and how much are we likely to get done when there is a Coalition Government? Let the Liberal party form a Ministry and undertake the government of the country; and, although I cannot speak for more than myself, I believe that such a Ministry would' get a fair deal.",17
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,That is the trouble; you insist on speaking individually when you make promises.,17
115,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,How can we speak otherwise? I say I believe that.such Government would get a fair deal. ',17
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,You had a party meeting the other day-wa s this matter bound to agree to the proposal. not considered?,17
117,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"If the Government. - which consists of members who left Australian Labour party, refuses to conhe chooses. cede to the honourable gentleman the number of portfolios that he is now deago. manding, let him turn the ' Government out. If that were done, I venture to say that the new Government would go for at least two or three months, at the expiration of which time we know the elections take place. Again I say that if the Prime Minister goes to the I m perial Conference he cannot undertake to represent Australian public opinion as voiced by Australian parliamentary representatives in this House. He can, of course, represent the conscriptionist view of Australia; and no doubt he will do so.",17
118,Mr SAMPSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Do you not think that the Prime Minister will represent this' Parliament if he goes with the concurrence of the Liberal party ?,17
119,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"He will not represent They Australia. He will represent,'possibly, a majority of the members of the House; but he will especially represent the Australian conscriptionist opinion. Knowing the Prime Minister as I do, I venture to say ' that he will inform the Conference that the public of Australia was misled into voting against conscription, though, as a matter of fact, the misrepresentation was all on the otherside. A dirtier,, filthier campaign was never conducted than was the campaign conducted by the Prime M in ister of Australia in favour of conscription. If we are to be represented at the Conference by more than one representative, there ought to be a representative from the Australian Labour party to give that Conference the Australian Labour party's point of view.",17
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Will you send one ?,17
121,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Giv e us a chance to say that.,17
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Again , this is only speculation.",17
123,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The practice that . has obtained in the Australian States of allowing a Minister to go to Imperial Conferences with a blank cheque is not conducive to the development of the country. I remember that when Sir a Edmund Barton went home as Prime Minister he committed this country to a certain course, and the country felt The Prime Minister, if he goes alone to the Conference, will go with a kind of blank the cheque which he may fill in for whatever ",17

126,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The honourable member for Wimmera knows very well that the Conference that was attended by the Prime Minister, some eight or ten months ago, was not of the character of the Conference proposed at the present time. What I desire to know is the views of the Prime Minister, or any other delegate, in regard to the whittling down, for in^ stance, of our local self-governing rights.

134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Especiall y on the Tariff question!,18
135,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I must really seek the as to my views. protection of the Chair.,18
136,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE," I must ask honourable members to refrain from these terjections, which are far too frequent. An interjection that is pertinent to remarks of a speaker may be permitted, but the constant cross-firing must cease.",18

138,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"In my opinion, - Australia will never make progress u n t i l we have a Tariff sufficiently high to protect the secondary industries of the country against the competition of cheap labour abroad.

139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,You have fought two elections on the Tariff!.,18
140,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,That is so; and I have always been returned as a Protectionist. My constituents have no doubt,18
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,But what have you,18
142,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The present Tariff is a in - very ' great improvement on previous Tariffs, in spite of the effort of the hon the orable member - for Parramatta, who on every occasion has tried to reduce protective duties to merely revenue-produc",18
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,That is not so; but,18
144,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I wish the honourable gentleman would not interrupt, because there are several subjects on which I desire to talk.",18
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,On e must interrupt in the face of incorrect statements.,19
146,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I refer the honourable gentleman to the Hansard reports of the Tariff discussions. These reports show that invariably he voted against protectionist duties.,19
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Because of you and your party, there has been no discussion on the Tariff for four years.",19
148,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I am referring to the discussions on the Tariff of 1902 and 1906-7. The Prime Minister talked about the. Australian Labour party being a "" faction,"" and later on substituted the word "" fraction."" This gave rise to much pumped-up amusement amongst honourable members on the Liberal side, who applauded and laughed at the remark as a very great joke. The Australian Labour party have about forty-six members out of 111 members in the Federal Parliament, while the Prime Minister and his followers number only twenty-four; and if we are a ""faction,"" or a ""fraction,"" what arithmetical expression will fitly describe the Prime Minister and his supporters ? We notice ' a great deal in the morning daily newspapers about the necessity of patriotic action on the part of honourable members of this House-of public-spirited action in the formation of a Fusion Government. What is holding up this consummation, so far as the Liberals and the Ministerialists are concerned ? The Prime Minister has suggested that the holding up is due to the Australian Labour party ' not having called a meeting earlier. That, however, has nothing whatever to do with the case. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Liberal party know very well that the policy of the Australian Labour party makes it impossible for the members of it to join any Coalition. But, perhaps merely for show, it was pretended to be necessary to wait until the Australian Labour party had considered the invitation. Let us get down to bedrock. What has prevented a fusion being brought about up to the present moment-and I ask Liberal members to correct me if I am wrong-is the fact that the Leader of the Liberal party and his colleagues have not. succeeded in making a bargain with the Prime Minister as to the number of portfolios they shall have.",19
149,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Oh , no! ' Mr HIGGS - The right honourable member's gesture of disdain does not describe the position at all. The plain fact is-and I ask Liberal members to deny it publicly if they dare-that they demand a certain number of portfolios, rightly, from the Prime Minister, and he cannot see his way clear to throw over as many of his friends as honourable members ask him to do. If the Liberals would reduce their demand fromsix portfolios to five portfolios the fusion arrangements would be 'fixed up in a few minutes. The "" Win-the-War party "" are quarrelling over the question as to whether they will . have six portfolios or five in a Fusion Government. Is not that the position ?",19
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Not so far as I am aware. - Mr HIGGS - I hope that the Argus ' and those other leading daily newspapers which will endeavour to make capital out of the fact that we cannot see our way clear to join a Fusion Government will note the"" attitude of the Liberal party.",19
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"You asked a question, and I tell you that your statement is not a fact.",19
152,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"That is a very belated denial. An opportunity was presented to the Australian Labour party to join the Prime Minister, and get three or four portfolios for its members, who would occupy very high and - dignified positions, which are not unremunerative; but the Australian Labour party 'does.not want office on those terms. We declined to take office. We prefer some other party to take office, or we are prepared ourselves to assume the responsibilities of government. We are ready to do as we did before. The Australian Labour party carried on the war, and the national government, from the 14th September, 1914, until ""the Prime Minister returned from Europe in August of last year, with general satisfaction and a minimum of irritation to the general public, and we raised by the voluntary system 300,000 troops to be sent abroad. We are willing to carry on the government of the country in the same way again if honourable members will permit us, or, as an alternative, if the right honourable member for Parramatta has the courage to turn. out the Prime Minister and his followers, and form a Liberal Government, as he has a right to do",19
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,May I tell the honourable member that I have not that sort of courage.,20
154,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Is the Leader of the Liberal party afraid that his Government - would be turned out of office, and that he would have to face the country? Is he afraid to face the electors? The Australian Labour party certainly is not. We are willing to go before the people in April, May, or June, or even earlier.  half of the other members of your party ?",20
155,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I am. Let the people of the country decide which party possesses the confidence of the country. That question must be decided at an early date unless the Liberal party is prepared to fuse with the Prime Minister and his friends.,20
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"When you talk about a general election it is a .case of "" Hold me back and let me at him.""",20
157,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The right honourable gentleman knows that it is within his power to bring about a general election within six weeks. He can turn out the Prime Minister, form a Government, be refused Supply, and go to the Governor-Genea-al and get a dissolution. But he is not sure that it would be a wise course to turn out the Prime Minister.",20
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Quite right.,20
159,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"When the, right honour the able member says that he has not the courage to turn out the Prime Minister, the inference is that he wishes to support the present Government. The Leader the Liberal party is not prepared to that. He knows that things cannot conport tinue as they are with a Ministry having only five supporters in a House of seventyMinister, five members. The right honourable gentleman knows that such a condition of .affairs is a travesty of representative vernment, and, as an old parliamentarian, he realizes that he must accept all responmuch sibility for the acts of the Prime Minister x and his followers, because they remain ofiice only with the consent of the party.  the Deakin Government in power in the - same way ?",20
160,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"We took responsibility for what the Deakin Government did, - the. Leader of the Liberal party knows ""that he must take responsibility for acts of the Prime Minister, although does not agree with many of those acts. . There is too much secrecy about the Prime Minister. No one has yet seen the invitation which the right honourable gentleman is supposed to have receivedto attend the previous Conference in England. Not even one of his colleagues knew the terms of that invitation, and some of us wonder whether it was not"" an alternative invitation to himself, and some other member of the Government, presuming that there was. an invitation. The right honourable member for Parramatta does not agree with the methods of the Prime Minister, and he knows that a certain amount of discredit attaches to him while he permits the government to be carried on in the present .manner, and allows the Prime Minister to utilize .the censorship in the way in which it is being abused today. His alternative to allowing the Prime Minister to do as he pleases is to fuse with the Ministerial party, or turn them out of office and form another Government - If he will undertake to turn the Prime Minister out of office, and shoulder the responsibilities of government, he will get a fair deal from the members of the Australian Labour party.",20
161,Mr WATKINS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Newcastle) [4.45] To-day I asked the Prime Minister a question in reference to his decision that whole of the wool clip must be examined and valued in the capital cities of the States, and he promised that the matter would be inquired into. When I of relate to honourable members what has do really happened in connection with the which I represent, they will realise the considerable harm which the Prime by his action in connection with the supply of Australian wool to Great Britain, is doing to certain portions of the gocommunity. Throughout its history the State of New South Wales has suffered from the policy of centralization, and from the* whole produce of the State in being dragged to the one port for shipLiberal ment. The conditions were bad enough prior to the outbreak of war, and the people of Newcastle bore them cheerfully, but owing to war exigencies the coal export trade from the port has practically come to an end. Now the Prime Minisand ter, by deciding that all wool must be brought 100 miles further south in order the to be examined and valued at Sydney, is he doing a further injustice to that port, and robbing it of a bunkering trade running into thousands of tons. It is most remarkable that although representations made in behalf of Newcastle were treated by the Prime Minister with a flippant promise to refer them to the sub-Committee dealing with the wool clip, the concession asked for has been readily granted to another port.",20
162,Sir JOHN FORREST,GERMAN SUBMARINE,We had a lot of trouble before we got the concession. We Government's ought to have obtained it easily.,21
163,Mr WATKINS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Then how much additional more easily ought Newcastle to have obimpossible. tained the same privilege.,21
164,Sir JOHN FORREST,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I see no reason why it should not have it .,21
165,Mr WATKINS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I shall figures to show the result of the decision which the Prime Minister has arrived The 'total quantity of wool shipped at Newcastle during the five years, 1912 to 1916, was 105,216 bales. In Inter-State boats 22,473 bales were transhipped to season. Sydney, but because of the fact that in future these boats will be obliged to go to Sydney to load this wool, they w i not call at Newcastle to take away other produce. What that means will be underduty stood when I state that during the five years I have mentioned, 665,086 carcasses of frozen meat, 11,337 tons of bullion, 1,543 tons of tallow, 755 tons of oleine, stearine, and glycerine, and 842 tons of sundries were shipped fro m New100 castle. During the same period, bunker coal taken by the vessels lift this cargo was 70,000 tons, while the i ward cargo discharged by these vessels was 20,849 tons. If the decision arrived at is not altered, the producers who have been shipping their produce _at Newcastle will be compelled to rail all these products that I have just quoted as having been shipped from Newcastle a further 100 miles, and my information is that this means that at least an additional £ 1 ton in extra railage and handling charges will be imposed on the squatters whose wool is taken past Newcastle for apthe praisement in Sydney, and' on the progiven ducers who have been in the habit of at Geraldton and Albany? shipping their products from Newcastle. The Prime Minister has said that he did not inquire into the matter, but sent all the letters from the Chamber of Comought merce, and other people in my electorate, to the Central Wool Committee, the standard of intelligence of which can be judged by the following letter forwarded by it to the Newcastle' Chamber of Commerce:I have the honour to reply to your favour of the 6th inst., and to thank you for the statistics contained therein. The question of making Newcastle an appraising centre for wool has had the earnest attention of the Central Wool Committee, who, after a thorough investigation, cannot-for this season's clip-suppor t the application. The appraisement of wool under the Imperial purchase is an operation requiring great skill and knowledge, and to install centres at the present time is almost Whilst the Committee recognises that your Chamber of Commerce is anxious to make Newcastle an appraising ' centre, it docs not follow that, even with warehouse accommodation and equipment, the wool-growers would quote a few support the proposal.

This cannot be effected in time for this season's clip, but the present .may be a suitable opportunity to begin negotiations for next Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) J. M.

It is a new the idea to me to place on a Chamber of in g Commerce the task of hunting up inforn - mation that the officers of the Treasurer should secure and take action upon. The - Central Wool Committee has either failed in carrying out the functions intrusted to it , or it favours the centralization policy that has been the curse of New South Wales up to the present time. It says, "" It does not follow that, even with warehouse accommodation and equipment, per the wool-growers would support theproposition."" Did the people in the electorate of Dampier have to get the consent of wool-growers before a decision was to establish appraisement centres I do not quarrel ' with the concession secured by those ports. The step taken was the correct one, but what is right in one case to be right in another similar case. The Prime Minister has not a sufficiently practical knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the different ports of Australia. I am sorely tempted to > move for the reduction of Supply for purpose of testing the question whether 'honourable members agree with decision to do injustice to a port that has already suffered-and suffered make a statement today. willingly-in connection with the war, placing this unnecessary burden upon i to its .detriment, and to the advantage of down.

But what has been done ? Although twelve months have elapsed since the pointment of this Commission, been obtained from it are a few reports. I am not satisfied with the present tion.

Perhaps he does not a young wish to do so. No doubt his new colmaleagues are not likely to give further proindustection to Australian industries. I agree for the with the honourable member for Capricornia that without a Tariff suited to our a industries this country, instead of going the ahead by leaps and bounds, will retrogress, and the people will suffer. While our energies to the prosecution of the war, let us not forget that it will be a sad day for the Commonwealth if be our industries are still unorganized when",22
170,Dr CABTY SALMON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,The honourable member for two years supported a Government which did not touch the Tariff.,23

Has there been any stimulation of Australian industry, or is any new industry to be created? So far as I can see, practically nothing has been done during the past twelve months.

179,Mr FENTON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I have tried to ascertain what is being done. The Minister does not give us much information regarding the doings of the Commission. A number of university professors, acting on theoretical lines, are not likely to do much. The Minister for Defence, when acting for the Prime Minister some six months ago, told a deputation he recognised that a body of this kind could not do much to stimulate industry, and that something more was needed, but nothing has yet been done. It is time that we awoke to our responsibilities in this matter. Parliament should be in session continuously, until there has been placed on the statute-book the legislation that is needed.",24

181,Mr FENTON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The whole Parliament would then be a Works Committee. I agree with much that was said by the honourable member for Capricornia concerning the proposed sending of a delegate to the Imperial Conference. In November, 1910, the Prime Minister, who was then acting for Mr Fisher, in his absence in South Africa , disclosed to the House the proposals that were to. be brought before the Imperial Conference of 1911. Conference now in view will be somewhat different from an ordinary Imperial Conference, and may have to discuss certain matters in regard to which the world at' large cannot be informed; but the Prime Minister should let us know the proposals that are to be discussed, so far as they can be communicated to us; and before any delegate is committed to leave Australia it should be made plain, by a resolution, of this House, or in some other way, that he could not commit Australia to anything without consulting the Parliament and people of this country, otherwise we may be misrepresented, and bound by agreements inimical to the best interests of the country. That must be guarded against.",24
182,Mr BAMFORD,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I look upon that as i m possible.,24
183,Mr FENTON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"It has occurred in the past. The honourable member for Capricornia has told us this afternoon'that Sir Edmund Barton, when in London, agreed to certain propositions that have not worked beneficially to Australia. Questions of vital importance will be dealt with at this Conference, and no one man should be permitted to settle them on behalf of Australia. Our representative should be in a position only to say that his consent is subject to the endorsement of the Parliament and people of Australia. We should not allow our representative to act like' a powerful potentate, saying, "" I speak for Australia, and what I say is l a w . "" There is no reason why Parliament should not be informed regarding nearly every matter that is to be dealt with by the Conference, and it should be understood by our representative that no determination can be come to regarding any one of them except by the consent of - the Parliament and people of Australia. On such an understanding there will be l it t l e harm in sending away a representative, but we should not-give any man, however able, a blank cheque, telling him to f ill it . in at his discretion in London. I hope that the Prime Minister will give to us regarding the proposed Conference a state.ment similar to that which he made regarding the Conference of 1 9 l l , which is to be found in Hansard. At the time Mr Deakin, the then Leader of the Opposition, intimated that he was of opinion that the subjects to be brought The forward should be discussed, and he expressed the hope that the decisions arrived at would benefit Australia. This Parliament should lose no time in dealing with the question of repatriation, war pensions, unemployment, and other matters which have to do with the war and post-war times. Why should we take no action in regard to the Tariff, which has a most important bearing on industry and employment? We hear much today concerning repatriation. The Prime M in ister told us thisafternoon that he was very well satisfied with the arrangements made by the Premiers' Conference to provide land for returned soldiers. while there is much talk of settling returned soldiers on the land, and of buying businesses for some of them, in actual practice we find that many of these men are not treated as they ought to be. In Victoria alone today there are 300 or 400 returned soldiers out of employment. that state of affairs likely to encourage recruiting? If the Government encourage men to volunteer, and if they are anxious to do their best for' Australia, they should pay careful attention to the 'needs of the dependants of those at the front, and particularly to the needs of those who come back so maimed that they cannot follow, their ordinary The neglect of the-Government is retarding the recruiting movement. was glad to hear the honourable for Franklin give notice of his intention to move for the appointment Committee to inquire into the administration of the Defence Department. are many hurtful ^things associated with that Department.

There Dr CARTYSALMON (Grampians) [5.26] - I had not intended to intervene in this debate, and should not have done so but for some remarks made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. I hope While he was most fervidly and, apinvestigation. parently, with sincerity, urging that the Tariff had been too long delayed, I ventured to remind him of what ought really to have been fresh in his memory: that the .Government for which he had If those such tender concern during the whole time he. was supporting j t had been returned with ^an express mandate from the country to deal with the Tariff in the first session. I reminded him, further, that it hardly became him as an aforetime ardent supporter of that Government to urge now that the Tariff should be dealt close its .with with almost indecent haste. In order to cover up his own failure to discharge his responsibilty, the honourable member then resorted to a personal attack upon me, and urged that I had for years supported a Government consisting of a number of Free Traders. I ventured to remind him that he was not in a posiParramatta tion tb judge; that he was not even a Conference. member of Parliament at the time to which he referred; but his answer was that he had other means of obtaining his information. I can only imagine that his statement was made either with a desire to mislead or from crass ignorance and stupidity. If he was such a student of political history as he would have us imagine, he surely ought to have known that the time. I supported "" a Government which comprised a number of Free Traders was when the Beid party joined the Deakin party.

To return to the honourable member for Maribyrnong, I would inform him that the Reid-MCLean Administration was put out of office with my assistance and with my hearty concurrence because it did not deal fairly with the Tariff. If the honourable member will consult Hansard, with which he professes such intimate familiarity, he will find recorded there the action which I took on that occasion. I hope he will make at least some amends hy withdrawing the erroneous, misleading, and somewhat injurious statement that he made- a statement which reflects upon my fiscal fidelity, and which might have some ill-effect upon .the influence wielded by the organization with whioh I am connected. Sir JOH N FORREST (Swan) [5.30]. - I desire to refer to the action of the Commonwealth Wool Board, which has under its control the appraising and shipping of wool from Australia to the Old Country. I have brought under the notice of that Board the position of the wool-growers on the north-west coast of Australia, but have received very little consideration from it . I regret to have to make such a statement, since 1 always desire to recognise the responsibilities of persons-in authority. I should not have complained if I could have found another way of securing reasonable consideration of my representations. It is very seldom that I bring a grievance before the Committee, but I cannot avoid doing so now, siice I am unable in any other way to obtain satisfaction. Western Australia is a wool-growing State, and a great deal of its last wool clip was shipped to England before .the Wool Board came into existence. Wool from the north-west is usually shipped to England - viA Singapore,' by vessels of 'the Holt line, which run from Fremantle to Singapore, where they tranship the wool, and on the return voyage bring goods and stock down the coast, to Fremantle. This is a regular trading concern, and arrangements are made by the wool growers on - the north-west coast to ship their wool by that line whichoffers the most economical, convenient, and speedy means of getting it to England. The Wool Board, however, has refused to allow the continuance of this practice, which has been going on ever since the north-west produced wool. They insist that the wool shall be brought to Fremantle to he appraised. That would not be so bad if there were any ships to bring it down; but, while there are ships going to Singapore, which could take wool for transhipment at Singapore to London, there are no vessels to bring the wool down to Fremantle, since .those steamers come back laden with stock and merchandise. The wool-growers, therefore, have their wool lying in sheds or on the jetties awaiting shipment. They are promised 1 ships some time in March, but that is not what they want. Their desire is to got their wool to market. They want their bills of lading and their money. When the Wool Board came into existence a great deal of the wool of the north-west coast, and of Western Australia generally, was en route to England, and it had to be appraised in London. Some of it has hardly yet reached there; and I have argued that what could be done in respect of wool which was en route - to England when this Board came into existence could be. done in regard to wool shipped from the north-west coast to Singapore for tran-. shipment to London. All my endeavours, however, have been without result. The last I heard was that there were about 13,000 bales on the beaches, jetties, and in the sheds on the north-west coast, north of Geraldton, awaiting transit to Fremantle, although, about a month ago, the Charon, capable of carrying 4,000 bales, was not allowed to take* the wool, and had to fill up for Singapore with sandalwood, or any other cargoit could get. "" Mr SAMPSON - What was the reason?",26
195,Sir JOHN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,-FORREST - Because i - was held that the wool could only be praised at Fremantle.,27
196,Mr SAMPSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Why ?,27
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Because the Wool Board regarded that as the only praising centre, forgetting that wool route has to be appraised in London.",27
198,Mr SAMPSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Has the Board no power,27
199,Sir JOHN FORREST,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The Board can do as it likes;. but, while the local Board in Western Australia, the Pastoralists Association, and the wool-growers are all anxious to have the wool sent away the only route available, their protestations, and requests have been ignored. So far aa I can learn, there were several millions of bags of wheat at Fremantle awaiting shipment some time ago, and a great deal of it is there now; some, I regret 'to say, rotting' on the ground; and, even in the face of such circumstances, the Charon was not allowed advice. to take away any wool from the North-west.",27
200,Mr SAMPSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Are there any freight disabilities ?,27
201,Sir JOHN FORREST,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"There are no disabilities at all, but only what one must describe as pure "" cussedness ""- a holdfast system that the Board will not vary or alter. It waa said to me that the preyear sent arrangement would be a good thing for Fremantle, because it would the centre for appraisement in the future. That might be all very well for dealers, far as it goes, but it does not appeal to wool-grower when there are no ships take his wool to Fremantle. written to the Board in strong language, but I have not been able to obtain a satisis factory answer. Only a little while ago I sent six or seven questions, and not one of these has been rethe plied to. Several days ago, I wrote to the Board informing - it that Parliament would meet today, and pointing out if matters could be arranged otherwise did not wish to raise the. question in-this Chamber; but I have had no more than a mere acknowledgment of my letter. The Wool Board, which has no personal knowledge, ought surely to act on the advice of the local body, supported, as that local body is, by the Pastoralists Association and the wool-growers; but, as this is not done, my only course is to lay the matter before the House, and see whether some Ministerial pressure cannot be brought to bear. We are told that it will be all right in the end, and that as good aprice will be got through Fret mantle as by direct shipments; but the apwool-growers wish .to get rid of their goods, and deal with the whole business as quickly as possible.. The honourable member for Dampier would, I have no apdoubt, bear out everything I have said; en and, personally, I have been bombarded with telegrams and other communications 1from the Pastoralists Association, and others concerned. I have done my best; but, although our requests were refused, only today, the Prime Minister was able to inform me that, after all, it will be by possible to have an appraisement at endeavours, Geraldton and. Albany-,  get if you are persistent enough.",27

I allude to the that pension payments fo old persons in I the benevolent institutions of the Commonwealth.

Many of the inmates of our charitable institutions have done the spade work in connection with our industries, and particularly does that remark apply to the pastoral industry. Many of them hail from country districts. The Queensland Government is scarcely treating these people in a satisfactory manner, seeing that recently they disallowed the issue of tea to them. The small pension for which I ask would, enable them to purchase little commodities of that description.",28
204,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,What they give them to drink?,28
205,Mr SHARPE,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"They are not given tea in the middle of the day. The State authorities are endeavouring to compel the Commonwealth to take over these in stitutions. They are refusing to admit to them persons who have not been granted pensions or who have not made a great - effort to secure them. I refer to this matter because it was the intention of the late Treasurer to give consideration to it , and I am under the impression that in the near future he would have granted my request. But the present Treasurer has not given me any such assurance, 'despite the fact that I have spoken to him about it on several occasions. will agree to it , I am satisfied that the - assent of Parliament will be readily obtained. When the pension was ""10s. per week, the Commonwealth Government was paying to the States 8s. weekly for - every pensioner who entered a benevolent institution, and the difference between the 8s. and the 10s. is being paid to the pensioner. Those old persons who now - enter these institutions should, I contend, 'be placed in an exactly similar position.  member wish the Commonwealth to pay Ss. per week to the"" institution and 2s. to - the individual?",28
206,Mr SHARPE,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I ask the Treasurer to pay to the whole of the inmates who are entitled to a pension the 2s. per week, irrespective of whether or not they enjoyed the pension prior to entering the institution. I am aware I that this concession will necessitate an amendment of the Act ; but it will be merely a slight amendment, and I hope that before Parliament adjourns for a n y considerable period we shall have something practicable from the Treasurer in connection with these pensions. Another matter to which I desire to direct his attion is the desirableness of paying the full pension to the blind people of the Commonwealth. At the present time-, many of them are receiving a pension, but on account of the Queensland Government having established a standard wage in the blind institutions of that State, probably some of those who were previously in receipt of the pension will have it taken away from them. The Queensland Government has fixed a standard wage of 30s. per week for blind workers. That is all that they are able to earn. Many of them are married men, and are do so incapable of finding their way about that they have to employ an attendant. I mention this matter for the purpose of showing what a meagre opportunity these people have of earning a decent living. As the Government are now paying a pension to half the blind people of the Commonwealth, the additional expenditure in volved in paying a pension to all the blind folks would not be very heavy.  there are over 3,500 blind people in the Commonwealth. The total number receiving pensions is only 500.",28
207,Mr SHARPE,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Many blind people are living in destitute circumstances beI f he cause of their inability to earn a livelihood. The honourable members for Yarra and Fawkner will confirm my statement that a deputation was being arranged to wait upon the ex-'l'reasurer to bring under his notice the"" importance of i m mediately providing a pension for the blind. I know that the present Treasurer does not think the blind people are entitled to pensions. Institutions are established throughout the Commonwealth into which they may go and learn basket and mat making, but as the majority of the inmates of such institutions are paid by piecework, they unfortunately do not earn very much money. The justice of this pension 'appeals to many throughout the Commonwealth, sure that Parliament would be. applauded if it established a pension. No greater infliction can, befall a man than the loss of his sight. Many deaf and dumb people are able to earn the full rate of wages, whereas blind people are not able to earn more than half wages. The of the pension might result in removing many of the blind beggars from our city streets. If the present Government are not sufficiently sympathetic ih regard 'to this proposal, the time is not far distant when another Government will come into office which will realise the justice of these people's claims. What I am advocating is that the blind people shall receive, the same pension as is paid at the present time to the aged and invalid people of the Commonwealth. If we can get that concession for them we will be satisfied; at any rate for a short period. I hope the Treasurer will decide to grant the pension in the near future. The Defence Department has been 'severely criticised by many honourable members, but having regard to the heavy administrative chinery connected with that probably some excuse can be offered for some of the maladministration. cuse can be offered, however, for the attitude of the Department in regard to rifle clubs. Two years ago the Minister for Defence became very active in the organization of rifle clubs, and in that work he sought the assistance of honourable bers. In Queensland, we were successful, and many new rifle clubs-were formed. Sites for ranges were, selected, and departmental engineers were sent to make reports and estimates. matter has ended. In and around Brisbane many rifle clubs have been established, and people have enrolled in order to learn how to shoot. If in no other direction, the rifle clubs have rendered a great service to the community by providing the opportunity for many people to become acquainted with some form of military drill. Unfortunately, the Defence Department has rejected every request for the construction of new ranges, and there is a danger of many rifle clubs being disbanded unless they are properly The Defence Department replies that it has not the money at its disposal for this work. In many other directions, we see evidence of lavish and having regard to the great value that Mr Sharpe. people rifle ranges will prove to the community, and I am and the slight expenditure involved in their construction, I ask the Defence authorities to take action in this matter without further delay.",28

Although they have repeatedly promised to make the improvement asked for, nothing has been done.

213,Mr SHARPE,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I am not nearly so much afraid of my position as the M in ister is of his. The only way by which the present Minister can be allowed to remain in charge of the Department for another five years is to appoint the board of management which he has so long advocated, but which I am confident the House will never agree to. It is an open secret that the Minister is very anxious to occupy the position of chairman of that board. If we are to have the same class of administration by the board as he has given us up to the present, I am confident that honourable members will never agree to the appointment of any such body. Quite recently, the trench-workers in Brisbane agreed to strike because they were not being paid the standard rate of wage..

The trenchworkers asked for that ruling rate of wage, to which they were justly entitled, in view of the conditions they had to work under in Brisbane during the sweltering summer months. They refused to conindirectly tinue the work; but I understand that, by some means, the Department have arranged to get - men from the Linemen's Union to carry out the duties. I mention this matter to show the seething discontent that exists in the Department, and what a hard task the Minister will have, probably if he continues to administer the ' Department in the futur e in the way he has done up to now. Correspondence appearsalmost daily in the press showing the sweating existing in the telephone branch, and the manner in I which the girls are speeded up.

"" Mr HIGGS - We did not have the » at Caucus meetings because df the contentious disposition of the honourable the member for Barrier. He was not always peaceful as he appears to be generally speaking, he was aggressive, and made reremarks which induced other men to be aggressive. On behalf of my constituents, n I make the demand that the terms of the t German note and the Allies' reply thereto I see no reason why the people of this country should not be acquainted with the exact terms of the so that they may be able to judge as to what extent the suggestions made by Germany are preposterous. My opinion is that the officials attached to the Go- vernment offices in Great Britai n have very little regard for any of the Dominion Parliaments. At present, there are three mints in Australia for minting coins, situated in Melbourne, Sydney, and Perth, and controlled by State Governments. They are run at considerable expense. I believe that there is a loss each year on their administration to the extent of several thousands of pounds. When I was Treasurer I asked, as a matter of courtesy, and with the consent of the Government, that the Commonwealth might be allowed to take them over. Honourable members seemed to agree , that the Commonwealth ought to own and control the mints, and our Australian sovereigns. not be the first time. Australian sovereigns were minted some years ago. It is part of my aspirations for Australia that we shall do everything we can in this country to build up the nation, and though the mintin g of our own sovereigns and our own silver coins may appear trivial to some people, still this work would have a sentimental and far-reaching effect on the general public. what was the reply of the Treasury officials in the Old Country? Their view was that the minting of Australian sovereigns involved ""tremendous constitutional aud administrative changes,'.' or words to that effect, and they suggested that this matter should be held over unt i l after the war. We ought to have been permitted to take over the mints immediately we asked for that permission, and there should be no objection whatever. But no! Those officials to whom I have referred evidently have a very poor opinion of Dominion Governments 'and Parliaments, and so we cannot get control of our mints because they object. I mention this by the way. In all probability, His Majesty the K in g and his Government would be quite w i l ling that we should get a copy of the German Note and a copy of the Allies' reply thereto, but probably the officials have such a poor opinion of Dominion parliamentary representatives _ that they would not take the trouble to send us copies. While I am on this question, let me refer again to the proposal to send a delegate to the Imperial Conference. It is possible that such delegate or delegates will be away from Australia for a long time, unless the war ends quickly. If , on the other hand, the war is about to end, they will be called upon to consider the question of ,peace terms, and I would like to hear their views on this subject. I would like to know what, in their opinion, the terms should be. Will they include, .for example, a demand that the Kaiser shall be elected by adult suffrage? To some people this may appear to be a very extreme proposal, but, in my opinion, if the Allies made such a demand, or if they demanded that the Kaiser should be deposed altogether, it would make a very great difference in the consideration of the question.",31
232,Unknown,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.J/.5 p.m. mint Mr HIGGS - The ' importance of It would my remarks prompts me to ask for a quorum. [Quorum formed.] I was commencing to think that this assembly, to use the words of the honourable member for Parkes, .had ceased to be a deliberative assembly. The honourable gentleman on one occasion used that term, and suggested that there were but 'few members, among whom he, no doubt, included himself, who were prepared to discuss public But questions, in a logical manner. The delegates whom we send to the Old Country, who may be called upon to take part in the Peace Conference, should have some ideas on the subjects with which they may have to deal, and I wish to know whether those ideas run along the same lines as my own. Among other things, would they propose, as one of the terms of. peace, the retention or deposition of the Kaiser according to a vote of the people possessing adult suffrage? In my opinion, if the crowned heads of Europe had to submit themselves to election by adult suffrage, there would be little talk of war. The honourable member for Parramatta is very desirous that this war should be the last.",32
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Hear , hear-'",32
234,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I share that desire. If we can put an end to the settlement of international disputes by war, I hope that it will be done. But there are certain fundamental reforms which must be arranged for at the Peace Conference with out which it would be impossible to put an end to warfare. The peoples of the world are becoming educated. I am glad to say that in British communities education is compulsory; it is indeed compulsory in Japan. Thus the people are getting ahead of their Governments, which, in many countries, do not realise their ability to decide pnblic questions. people do not wish to be governed as they have been governed in the past. I have not seen any mention of .proposals of the ' kind to which I have referred. But are we not going to ask, as part of the international agreement which will close the war, that an attempt shall be made in all the countries concerned to grant the suffrage to those people who do not now possess it , and to give the benefits of free and compulsory education to those who are without it ] I read the other day that, in Japan, only 5 per cent, of the people have a voice in the election. of parliamentary representatives. Even in the United Kingdom there is not adult suffrage. In my opinion, the people of the Old Country should have adult suffrage ; the women there should enjoy the same rights and privileges that our women enjoy. If we are to be permanently allied with Russia, in friendship and in trade, are we not going to ask that the benefits of education shall be extended to the Russian people, of whom I have read that 90 per cent, cannot read ? You may have war at any time in a country governed by a bureaucracy where a large percentage of the people cannot read. It is the educated peoples of the future who will put an end to warfare. Mr BAMFORD,-The honourable member's remarks do not apply to Germany. There the people are highly educated.",32
235,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,-Yes ; but their military system and their law-making institutions prevent the people from giving free expression to their views.,33
236,Mr ARCHIBALD,GERMAN SUBMARINE,The lesson of this war is the curse of intellectualism.,33
237,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The mass of the population of any country does not desire war, because it is the masses that suffer most when war comes. No one can challenge the courage of the sons of the aristocracy of a country when war come®. They are courageous because it is bad form among aristocrats to lack courage. Yet, notwithstanding the fact that the aristocracy makes a fair contribution of its sons, and loses a large number when a war breaks out, it is the people at large' who suffer most, and have to bear the cost of war. When a people becomes educated, it realizes that warfare does not benefit it . We should see that the whom we send to the Peace Conference possess advanced views, if we desire that this war shall be the last. If , for exThe ample, we enter into any arrangement with our Allies and any other countries after the war, we ought to have some understanding with regard to trade. Honourable members have heard me speak of the virtues of Protection-of a Customs Tariff designed to protect our manufacturers against cheap-labour manufacturers abroad. But I am prepared to take 1 a broad view, and say that if we can so arrange with any country we should have a preferential Tariff in favour of the products of that country which are manufactured by fair employers at a standard rate - of wages. We have at the present time a preferential Tariff for the United K in gdom. That Tariff was designed for the purpose of assisting manufacturers and encouraging trade between ourselves and the United Kingdom. But what is the effect of that 10 per cent, preference?",33
238,Mr CORSER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,In many cases it is only 5 per cent.,33
239,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"In some cases the preference is 5 per cent., but there is a very large number of items which come in under the 10 per cent, rate, as the. honourable member will recollect. We are givi n g a 10 per cent, preference to anybody whose goods are mainly manufactured in the Old Country. What happens under that Tariff? Those men who, before the war, were forming an organization - with £50,000,000 to crush trade unionism can get their goods into this country at the same rate of preference as a fair emplover, who wishes to do his duty by himself as a man, and by his employees, both male and female, I am satisfied that the people of the future will demand, if there is to be any preference at all anywhere, that the goods coming into the country shall bear a certificate that they were manufactured at a standard trade-union rate, and that if any goods do not bear that certificate, they shall pay the full rate. Are the delegates to the Imperial Conference going to advocate views of this kind ? Because if they are, they w i 1 1 not truly represent Australia. And I submit to you, sir, with all respect, that the views I am enunciating this evening are the views held by a very large major it y of the people of this continent, and delegates should find expression at the Conference when the peace terms are being discussed. As I was saying, if we are to have an enduring peace, the claims of the masses of the people of the world will haye to be represented, or expressed or A embodied in any agreement which is arrived at between the Allies and those countries which shall be united ""together, I hope, to put an end to war, .as far as they can. I would like the representative who goes to the Old Country from the Australian labour party, if ever he goes, to put this view-that we shall never be able to put an end to war until the civilized nations join together to police the earth and the seas, and to punish or suppress any Power that threatens or attempts to disturb the peace of the world. As honourable members will know from their reading, there was a time when the peace of the community was left to'private individuals to look after; but as civilization progressed, the State decided to employ police, regularly paid, to put an end to physical combats. Why should that not be extended throughout the earth? Why should not America, Britain, France, and other enlightened countries join together to say, ""We shall keep up an army and a navy to police the world, and any nation that desires to go to war shall furnish the reasons, and we shall demand of them, just as we demand of private individuals, if they want to fight that they shall submit their case to a Court of Arbitration, and we are satisfied that the Judges who will preside over the Court will give them fair play."" It has to come to that some day,' and the sooner it comes, in my opinion, the sooner war will end. I grieve to think that the representatives going from Australia to the Conference will have very little weight there, and that they will not put forward any of the ideas which I venture to say are held by a large majority of the people in Australia today. Will those representatives be considered of any importance whatever, in view of the fact that this country went into the war without having been consulted, and is apparently not to be consulted as to the end of the war? furnish as proof of that statement the fact that the reply to the German proposals of peace was made without any consultation with this country.",33
240,Mr CORSER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Wide Fay) [8.0] listened with some interest to the. marks which fell from the honourable member for Capricornia. It comes with very bad grace from one who occupied for so long the position of Treasurer in the late Government to refer as he did to the question of Protection. He said that he is a Protectionist, but I haye failed to find that in this House he has ever urged the Protection which his party was returned to power on the last occasion, if not on two occasions, to carry into effect. I defy any honourable member to say that the Labour party would have got into the position which they occupied if it had not been for a distinct pledge that they would adopt a live Protectionist policy. What have we seen of their live Protectionist policy? I know of many and many an. instance where anomalies have not been straightened out. I know that the people in my own electorate, which has a large manufacturing community, extracted a promise from the Labour party that if they were returned to power they .would insist upon the adoption of a strong Protectionist policy, but not one single attempt has been made to redeem that promise. I am convinced that those electors who placed their faith in the - Labour party will, to' a large extent, withdraw their support when the country is appealed to. The people are not so ignorant in these days that they will permit themselves to be hoodwinked in this way. If the Labour party got the votes of the people given to them for a certain object, and they fail to try to attaiu that object, I do not think that they will be trusted again.. There are some very vital questions which' will have to be discussed when we send one or more members to the Conference in Great Britainquestions which are going to be of vital importance to the future of this great Commonwealth. If we are to hold intact the Commonwealth and its lands for a White Australia we shall have to do something for the industries in our tropical areas. The Labour GovernmentsFederal and Queensland State-have , through their administration, killed the progress of, if not the sugar industry itI self, in Queensland, and are leaving millions of acres of most fertile agricultural land lying idle in the tropics simply because in the first instance our honourable friends will not assist in coming to some arrangement by which tropical products I can be grown in competition with Java reand other places, where such products are grown by almost solely black labour. We shall not be allowed to hold this continent as a White Australia unless we settle people on the rich' lands that we possess in the north. People can tinker with mere trivial things, and discuss questions which are not of vital importance, but wheu it comes to the point of trying to assist an industry like the sugar industry of Queensland, - it is to be allowed to sink, and with it the prospect of holding the northern count r y free from coloured labour. No attempt has been made by the late Government to protect the industry. I know of hundreds of men in the sugar industry, some of whom have devoted thirty-seven years of their lives to it , who today are practically ruined. B i it not a hand is held o""t to save them. If we are to retain this part of the country as a White Australia, those who represent the Commonwealth at the Imperial Conference must endeavour to arrive at an arrangement under which it would be possible to find a market for Australian sugar in other parts of the Empire, and, instead of Great Britain being, as in the past, a dumping ground for the surplus sugar produced by Germany and Austria, she should obtain her supplies from within the Empire. This question should be taken up most energetically by our representatives at the Imperial Conference. A definite understanding should be arrived at as between the Imperial and Commonwealth Governments that what we produce in the tropical and semi-tropical parts of Australia shall find a sale within the Empire, and. shall be granted a substantial preference over the produce of foreign countries. An end should be put to the policy under which Great Britain has been the dumping ground for the surplus products of our enemies.",34
241,Mr SHAKPE,GERMAN SUBMARINE,But the honourable member does not think that sort of thing is going to occur after the war ?,35
242,Mr CORSER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"What occurred before the war may happen again when the war is over unless an agreement such as I have suggested is made. Another point which our representatives at the Imperial Conference should emphasize is that no enemy nation shall be allowed to occupy islands adjacent to the Australian coast taken by us during the war, and that when we have beaten the enemy he shall be called upon to pay such an indemnity asw i ll compensate Australia for what she has suffered in consequence of Germany's violation of Belgium. But for Germany's action in .that regard we should never have been drawn into this bloody war, and thousands of our men who have lost their lives in fighting for the Empire-me n who have cheerfully laid down their lives rather than that we should be accused of disloyalty-woul d have been with us today. In these circumstances, therefore, the enemy should becalled upon to pay us such an indemnity as will assist us in compensating, as far as we can, the dependants of those brave soldiers of Australia who have lost their lives at the front . The loss should not f all upon us. I do not suggest that we should not subscribe, to the last penny, if necessary, to the relief of the dependants of those men. My point is that we should see that the enemy is compelled to compensate us for the losses we have sustained. At the earliest opportunity provision should also be made for a large influx of population. That larger population is impossible, however, unless we have a more equitable Tariff. I hope the day is not far distant when Australia will have granted by this Parliament such a meed of Protection as will enable people to come here from all parts of the British Empire to engage in industry, and to assist in converting our raw material into manufactured products,' which we can export, instead of the raw material itself being sent abroad to be made up. I have only to say in conclusion that I trust we shall impress j i p o n our representatives at the Imperial Conference the necessity of making such an arrangement as will safeguard t f l e industries of Australia, and more particularly those in the tropical parts of the Commonwealth.",35
243,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Adelaide) [8.12] - I should not have contributed to this debate but for the answer which I received to a question which I put this afternoon. Two honourable members who have preceded me have referred at length to our representation at the Imperial Conference. I , for one, am not too keen about our being represented there at all . I personally believe that Australia can do its own work at home, and do it effectively, in the in terests of the Commonwealth. .From my point of view, the less we are involved in Imperial complications the better.",35
244,Mr ATKINSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Is the honourable member satisfied with what our representatives are being called upon to discuss ?,36
245,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"If the honourable member will tell me what they are to discuss, I shall express an opinion on the subject. It is because we do not know what questions are to be discussed that I am rather anxious as to the representation of Australia at the Conference. questions which ought to be discussed first of all is the right of the belligerents who are fighting for the Empire to manage the countries in which they live. There should be adult suffrage in all countries, so that the people, and not the autocrats, may control the world. If the people of other nations had had the same measure of political freedom that we in Australia enjoy, there would have been no war. Working people do not want war; they have always opposed it . The ideal of those'who created our p a r t y was not the destruction of human life, but that the whole world should be made a better place to live in . Our ideals have been based on the good old prayer which so many say, but which so few understand - "" Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth."" But after uttering that prayer men will go f o the Imperial Conference and cackle, as they have cackled before, as to the necessity of secret diplomacy ruling the lives of the people. I am speaking on behalf of the workers who had no say in the shedding of blood which is going on today at the call of the autocracy of Europe. I did not intend to speak in this way, as I have a recruiting meeting to address to-night, but when I hear people prattling about what they are going to do at the Imperial Conference, I want to know, what they propose to say on behalf of the rank and file of the community. An honourable member has talked about the development of Australian industries to give employment to the'people, but he forgets that it was the Labour party who wrung the neck of the black labour business in his State. We know who it is that is crippling Australia today, and we know darned well that it is the autocracy of Australia that we must strangle before we can secure justice for the working men of Australia.",36
246,Mr CORSER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,The honourable member is absolutely wrong. It was not the Labour party but the Democratic party who settled the black labour question in Queensland.,36
247,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The Labour party might not have settled the question in the sense that it was they who passed the legislation that brought the settlement about, but honourable members should not forget that the Labour party always carried a good punch in both hands, and if the Liberals did not do what they desired, that was the end of them as a dominant One of the party. Of late years Liberal parties in Australia have held office only so long as they have been prepared to do what has been best in the interests of the general community. Though the flotsam and jetsam that are in power in the Commonwealth today may for a littl e while be able to work their sweet will , when the good sense of the electors returns, Australia will soon get rid of them, and the Labour party of today will stand just where it stood before the dictatorship of Australia came into being. The object of true Australians is to develop Australia and not talk about it , and to bring people to Australia, and not talk about it at Imperial Conferences. It is to keep Australia white, and make it safe. We do not wish to bring people here in shiploads to send them on to the streets to sell newspapers. Our purpose is to make the wages, hours, and conditions of life in Australia such that this will be a country to which people will gladly come, and to which there will be no need to drag them. I know that we have a hard row to hoe, and I know the people against whom we have to contend ; but time and education are always on the side of the Labour party. When it comes to talking war, do not let anybody say that the members of the Labour party talk war. No one should say that we ever desired to destroy any one. It is said that we want to level down. No fear; no one ever heard the Labour party contending for lower wages and longer hours of employment. No one ever heard a Labour member say anything which would prevent kiddies being properly 1 educated. The idea of the Labour .party is that there are in their ranks brains fit for the universities, and they want a university education to be open to their children. No one ever heard a working man say that his wife should not have a satin dress if he could get it for her. She would look just as well in it as would the wife of a member of any other party. One of the former leaders of the Labour party, who made a good name in Australia, and died full of honours, used to say that the party would have its ups and dpwns. We are at a time of change now, and whether the result is to be an up or a down the events Of the next few months will prove. I think that the good sense of Australians will give the few who are now taking advantage of circumstances a bad bump. I am reminded of the advertisement for Buchanan's whisky, and I say that there will be a good big drop lef t for them, and they will realise it when they get to the bottom. The honourable member for Hindmarsh laughs, and I am  b it t , one of the leading lawyers of South Australia, when irritated by a like circumstance in Court on one occasion, said that it was the loud. guffaw that proclaimed the vacant mind. Knowing the honourable member for Hindmarsh as well as I do, I should not like to say that of him, although it might be applicable. Today, I asked the Prime Minister a question with respect to the prosecution in South Australia of two persons who belonged to the Anti-conscription League, and the right lionorable gentleman said he had no knowledge of the matter. If my memory serves me correctly, when we permitted the War Precautions Act to pass, and some honourable members were fearfu l of the powers vested in the Government, we secured the assurance of the Prime Minister that - no action of a tyrannous character could take place under that legislation without his knowledge of it as Attorney-General. Y e t today the right honourable gentleman said that he did not recognise' the name of Mclntyre, that Mr E . H . Coombe, the member for Barossa in the South Australian Parliament, was unknown to him, that he had no knowledge of the prosecutions I refer to, and that they did not exist..  they did not exist.",36
248,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,What I mean is that they did not exist so far as he had any knowledge of them. Mr GROOM;-He said he was not aware of the facts. .,37
249,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Honourable members may, if they please, give the righ t honourable member's own words, but the point after all is that he had no knowledge of the prosecutions, although he was Attorney-General, and he could not recollect the name of Mclntyre coining up.",37
250,Mr LIVINGSTON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Perhaps the cases were not submitted to him.,37
251,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Perhaps he had more on his hands than he could handle, and some . one else was running that part of the show. That would not be a unique experience for the present Government. I find that the Adelaide Register of last Monday published the following paragraphProfound interest was caused in Adelaide by the announcement on Saturday that Messrs. Coombe, M.P., and F. Mclntyre, who were two prominent leaders in the anti-conscription campaign during October, had received .summonses under the War Precautions Act. When seen at his residence on Saturday morning in regard to the matter, Mr Coombe said he preferred not to make a. statement, and Mr. Mclntyre, who is assistant secretary of the South Australian branch of the Federated Carters' and Drivers' Union, was also uncommunicative. He said the incident arose in connection with a meeting at Tanunda on 26th October, and that the case was set down for liearing in that town on 12th February. The words contained in the information issued to him, he admitted, were : "" ' The Germans were being treated very unfairly, and they were as loyal as anybody else, and I would be pleased to shake them, by the hand,' or words to that effect."" ' "" The proclamation calling upon the men to enroll was invalid. We have had. that opinion from three of the leading lawyers of Melbourne, or words to that effect."" There was. a drag-net phrase which enabled the prosecution to say that if he did not say what was attributed to him he did say something to that effect. The Prime Minister says that he has no knowledge of this matter, but at least two of his Ministers must know of it , because there is very special reason at, the present time why they should very caref u l l y peruse the Adelaide newspapers. Who is using the Act in this manner? Here we have two prominent men in South Australia, one a politician and another belonging to the union, who have been summoned under a special Act ; and if it is not the Prime Minister who is doing this, it is a scheme on the part of those who are fighting for their political lives in South Australia, because they have been excommunicated - honourable members will see that I can use the word. I am endeavouring to show that even so far as the Federal arena is concerned there is more in this than meets the eye-that the Federal party is in collusion with the State party to do all that is possible to wreck the little band who fought conscription so successfully in our State. There are dismissals on the East-West railway; and, though I have not yet heard the honourable member for Wakefield say anything in this regard, I hope he will yet tell us what he thinks, because he knows Jack Elliott better than I do. No one better than the Minister for Works knows the qualities of Elliott.",37
252,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I am pressing the matter in order to give Elliott an opportunity.,38
253,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"But while the honourable member is doing that somebody is pressing the matter in South Australia, with the result that Elliott has been dismissed; this only shows that the people there have a bigger "" p u l l "" than has the honourable member. Mr RICHARD FOSTER. V - I have, not finished with the matter yet.",38
254,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Elliott , who has very nearly completed the line, has been dismissed, although, so far as my inquiries go, he is a thoroughly competent man, and originally came from Queensland. The only reason given for his dismissal is that he may cause disaffection. Elliott figures ou the' plebiscite for the Senate in South Australia.",38
255,Mr ARCHIBALD,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"That has nothing to do with the dismissal, and the honourable member knows it !",38
256,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Perhaps the fact that Harry Jackson has ""sacked"" Mr Kavanagh has nothing to do with the case either ? , Mr ARCHIBALD - On behalf of Harry Jackson, I say that he knows nothing about Kavanagh being dismissed.",38
257,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"It is in his Department, and he ought to know.",38
258,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I believe knows nothing about it, and has absolutely nothing to do with Elliott.",38
259,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I did not say that Jackson knew anything about Elliott. There is retrenchment in South Australia, and Kavanagh, who is an anti-conscriptionist, and has five, children, is dismissed, although he is a competent boilermaker. Three months, elapse before these men are prosecuted. Why was there not a ' prosecution at the time of the alleged offence, so as to give these men an opportunity to defend themselves? I do not see what good can be done to South Australia by the adoption of this attitude towards men who were told that criticism would be as free as air. Mclntyre may have been speaking of Germans who were interned; and if the proclamation was wrong, why were not the lawyers, who advised on the subject, proceeded against? All the circumstances show the weakness of the position taken up by the Federal authorities; and yet we are told that by the action of these men recruiting is prejudiced. How much has the Prime Minister done in the recruiting campaign?  ; done ?",38
260,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I looked for that interjection, and I shall tell the honourable gentleman.  leave, and you have been at three meetings.",38
261,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The honourable member - need not worry. When I got notice from Mr Mackinnon that I was ex officio chairman of the committee in my electorate, I accepted the position, and straight way made application for leave from the 27th December. I got leave only to the first of the month, and did not get any further word until the 5th January as to whether I had leave or not. I had the committee called together at the earliest opportunity, but found that nothing could be done until 1st February, or, as it turned out, until the 6th, to enable the Governor to be present. The next week the committee met in the different sections, and to-night I am going to a meeting at North Melbourne, and have made all my arrangements accordingly. What has the Treasurer or any member of the Government done ? What are they going to do? They are going to make a fiasco of the campaign, and then he blame honourable members on this side. I thought that when the scheme was set forth it would mean that Liberals and Labour men would work together with great zest-that the same zest would be shown that we saw when an effort was made to foist conscription on the people.  all on the last occasion.",38
262,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I admit I did not go out., and I said so in the House- I said I had not done anything to assist recruiting. If any fighting had to be done, as I said to the honourable member for Grampians, I would do my own fighting. I did not want it to be said that I spoke from an easy chair, or from the safe position of a member of Parliament, so I went into the uniform in which I now appear. I went to Adelaide from Melbourne in the latter end of September, and enlisted, but, as I told the officers, I merely gave my name in then, and, in order to show, that I did not desire to dodge conscription, I would return on the 30th October. That meant five weeks between the giving of my name and the attesting. Y e t 'the people were told that I had not enlisted.",38
263,Mr CARR,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Is this South Australia's ' "" washing day "" ? Mr YATES : - The . honourable member's washing day is to come, and if he can emerge from it with as clean clothes as I can, he will not go into oblivion. Mr RICHA HD FOSTER - Does orable member say that I made statements of the character to which he has referred ?",39
264,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I was informed that the honourable member had done so.,39
265,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"If I Committee what I did say, on the strength of an officer, it would not make the honourable member's position a very comfortable one. ' Mr YATES - If it has any reference to me, I care not what the honourable member may say. I do not fear it .",39
266,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I never once said it .,39
267,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I am glad to have the honourable member's repudiation, and I accept it .",39
268,Mr ARCHIBALD,GERMAN SUBMARINE,The honourable member has a great talent for abusing somebody.,39
269,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I am merely stating facts. Did the Minister of Trade and ' Customs say that I had not enlisted when he was at Crystal Brook?,39
270,Mr ARCHIBALD,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I treated the honourable member with the contempt he deserves. I never mentioned his name.,39
271,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Then the newspapers tell lies.,39
272,Mr CABR,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Giv e us some more washing.,39
273,Mr YATES,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The honourable member has quite enough to do in looking after his own affairs. I can do my own wash. in. But I must hurry my remarks to a close, as I have to go out and do a little recruiting instead of merely talking about it . I have placed on record my opinion with regard to the Imperial Conference, and I have brought under the notice of the Prime Minister the fact that the War Precautions Act is being used, if not by himself, by some one else, for political* purposes.",39
274,Mr CHARLTON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Hunter) [8.38] - I desire to endorse the remarks of the right honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Newcastle, and I hope that the Treasurer will look into the statements which they have made, because they are of considerable importance. I would point out that for some years past wool has been shipped at Newcastle. It is the natural port for' the north-west of' New South Wales. It has, however, been decided that wool shall no longer be shipped from this port, but must be shipped from Sydney. Centralization the honhas been the curse of the States, and to me it is astonishing that when we are in a state of - war, and when it is being urged that we should do our utmost to economize, the Wool Board is actually compelling persons to drag wool 105 told the miles past its natural 'port to Sydney at the cost of £ $ per bale to the grower That is not a fair position in which to put either the grower or the public, and it behoves the Government, to take' into consideration the action of the Board in this connection. In addition to the question of haulage, I would remind honourable members that the new departure must have a detrimental effect upon the coal trade. When the Daylight Saving Bill was before the House, we were assured that it was a necessary war measure, and that it had been adopted in England, where it had resulted in a considerable saving, and had proved a great success. The measure was consequently passed without discussion; but, as far as I can gather, it has been a failure in Australia, and is doing much to impair the health of the residents of this continent. I was told by the secretary of a miners' lodge that it has made a difference of from one to two skips per day in the output of the men, by reason of the fact that they cannot get their natural rest. Then, in connection with the Walsh Island Dock, where there are a large number of employees, I am informed that these men have to start work at the regular time, and that their womenfolk have consequently to rise at 4 a.m. In stead of saving daylight, they are compelled to use artificial light, and are loudly complaining i h consequence. The consensus of public opinion seems to be that the Act is a failure. While the in novation may have proved beneficial in England, ib haa conferred no advantage upon Australia. I therefore hope that it will be repealed as early as possible, or that it will not be revived after the Act expires in March next.. In regard to recruiting, I believe that we should accomplish much more if Parliament were to adjourn for a definite period, and thus allow honourable members to devote themselves more whole-heartedly to task. I know it will later on, that the voluntary system has been a failure; but, to my mind, it is not getting fair play. When we met last we understood that each honourable member was to be, ex officio, the chairman of the recruiting committee appointed in his own district. To my mind, it would be better if we could arrange that all honourable members should devote themselves to recruiting for a month. I believe that a f a ir can be obtained from the tary method if we will only go out and speak with a view to creating enthusiasm. In the absence of enthusiasm, we cannot hope to secure recruits. speak as a result of personal experience. For the last three weeks before returning to Melbourne, I was engaged in a re* cruiting campaign in my own electorate every night in . the week, and we obtained good results. If we can get good results in the Hunter electorate, we can get them in every other electorate. Of course, there is a l i m it to the number of men we can expect to enlist. We can get recruits only in proportion to the number of eligibles remaining in the community. No one will contend that we can get recruits at the, same rate, after having sent 300,000 men out of Australia, as in the. early stages of the war. But I do say that if we give fair attention to recruiting, the response will astonish many people. It will prove that the voluntary system is not a failure, and it will provide all the recruits necessary to maintain the strength of our divisions at the front. I hope honourable members will give consideration to the advisability of devising some scheme whereby we canal! engage in a real recruiting scheme. Let there be no sham about it . Let every honourable member go out in his own district and do his best, and I venture to say that we shall obtain good results.",39
275,Mr MAHONY,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Dalley) There are two or three matters in regard to whioh I would like to briefly express my views. The forthcoming Imperial IConsference is fraught wtith great consequences to Australia, and whoever represents the Commonwealth will need to be very careful in dealing with the problems that will be placed before delegates. Our representative will do well to bear in mind that it is the desire of the Australian people to build up within the the Empire . a healthy and virile Ausbe said, tralian sentiment. As I understand it , the Australian sentiment is that the Empire shall be held together by the slenderest ties of fellowship and kinship - which , after all, are the strongest-and - not by' any agreement of a more formal and binding nature. I believe that if there is any attempt at the Conference to make Australia part of a great I m perial Federation, with a supreme I m perial Parliament, the Commonwealth response will find itself confronted by a serious volun- menace to its democratic ideals. Other portions of the Empire have a more restricted franchise than that which we enjoy, and there is a possibility that we I ""may be compelled to surrender our adult suffrage. ,  does not think that there will be interference with local autonomy?",40
276,Mr MAHONY,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"We must not shut our eyes to facts. There is today a school of thought which holds strongly that there should be a drawing closer of the units of the Empire, with a view to creating a greater Imperial Parliament. I wish to warn the Commonwealth's delegate to be careful of any such proposal, because in it there is a p it f all which may r u in all chances of giving effect to any scheme for bringing into closer harmonythe outstanding parts of the Empire. In my opinion, the most effective scheme to develop the Empire, and bring about its greater unity, strength, and consolidation, will be one based entirely upon considerations of race and sentiment. If our delegate keeps such a view clearly before his mind, the Conference may result in some good to Australia. It is necessary that he should realise that, whilst Australians are prepared . to do everything possible to maintain the Empire in its entirety, we, at the same time, claim for ourselves the right to develop along our own lines, and to work out those ideals of [8.47] - Democracy which we hold dear. Another matter which will probably be dealt with by that Conference is that of trade within the Empire and with the allied nations. Here, again, is a path that may be strewn with pitfalls, and along which our representative will do well to walk warily. Australia is a young with all the potentialities ness lying dormant within it; and we need to be careful that any of preferential trade to which - we subscribe shall hot place a upon our industries - I , like . most other Australians, am prepared - to have some system of preferential firstly within the Empire, and secondly between ourselves and our Allies; but such ' preference will have to be based on adequate protection to the industries of the Commonwealth. Without such protection, preference would be to us a hollow sham and a mockery. It would be delivering this young country into the hands of the exploiters of the older world - That is something to which I will not agree. But I am prepared to advocate a system of preference and interchange, within the Empire, and secondly with our Allies, which, while assisting their trade, will maintain and develop on a proper basis the industries of Australia. third matter to which I wish to refer is that of naval defence. That is a subject which should engage the serious of all thinkers in Australia. are agreed that our primary defence must be upon the water; and I honourable members whether doing anything to give effect to a sound system of naval We made a fairly good start by providing the nucleus of a fleet, but after beginning so admirably ,.by bringing into. being a mosquito fleet which rendered signal service to the Comm'onwealth. at the outbreak of hostilities, showing the people that the safety of Australia lies in its defence upon the water, we stopped. That is a suicidal policy for Australia' to follow. We took two essential steps, and then stopped short, allowing Australia to live in a fool's paradise, from which she will have a rude awakening before very long. Australia's demands the speeding up of the naval construction policy to its utmost limit. our naval dockyard the keel of a vessel of the cruiser type, which has rendered the very best service in our defence, has been lying for months past, and nothing further is being done to it. It is allowed Mr Mahony. to lie there just as if we were in the days of peace and unity again. We must awake to the danger lurking ahead, and realise that if we are to hold Australia we must take adequate steps to defend it . country, While I readily admit that we are not in of great- a position today to defend ourselves against the navies of some of the old system countries of the world, we could place our naval defence on such a firm basis that strangle-hold we could ward off the hostile attacks of any raiders that might cross' the Pacific. We have been told of the escape of certreatment, tain raiders from German ports, and of the construction of super-submarines. These have, apparently, been able to elude the vigilance of the British Fleet, pass through the Channel, cross the Atlantic to America, and return to German ports. If that is possible, it is possible for the same boats to cross the Pacific. That is where our danger lies, and we ought to be doing everything possible to bring into being more ships to defend Australia in v Australian waters. The submarine menfirstly ace has played such havoc among the mercantile marine of the world that the great problem that will confront the nations, Australia included, will be the The scarcity of merchant vessels at the conclusion of the war. We have a great opportunity in our Government yards to begin attention to build merchantmen. We have the best Experts skilled workmen in the world, and some pf the best machinery. What, then, is to ask stop us making a start ? If we had a prowe are per Government, whose ideal was to benefit Australia, it' could, and would, be done. defence ? I read only the other day that in Great Britain arrangements are being made at the' big shipbuilding yards to turn out merchant vessels of medium tonnage, all on the one pattern. These can be turned out like shelling peas. If our Government, instead of buying the rotten-bottomed old things that were bought a few suddenly months ago, had adopted the policy of building merchant vessels of. 9,000 or 10,000 tons at Cockatoo, they would have turned them out like hot cakes.",40
277,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,The cakes would be pretty cold by the time they safety ' turned them out at Cockatoo Island,41
278,Mr MAHONY,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"They ' could all be In built on the one pattern, and it is all clean work. It is most peculiar that the moment one advocates anything for the advancement of Australia, a howl of derision is raised by certain honourable members on the opposite side. I stand for the advancement of Australia and - Australian industries. The construction of merchantmen will help Australia materially at the conclusion of the war, and any Government which initiates that policy will earn the undying gratitude of the people of this country. ",41
279,Mr MAHONY,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I am not surprised the Treasurer sneering at any proposal to advance Australia, but he will find that at the conclusion of the war the cry will go up, "" Where is the shipping to take away our wheat and wool ? "" If we do not make provision for that time, the whole of our sea-borne trade will be captured by foreign merchantmen. body who has the interests of Australia at heart must see that the case is clear and plain. If we are the men whose duty it is to rule the destinies of Australia, we ought to be right up to our necks in the work of providing the means of carrying on the commerce of the country at the conclusion of the war. I make these remarks, not in a party spirit, but as one actuated by the sole desire to benefit Australia. If we do things that harm Australia, we harm ourselves. I represent the working class, to whom the prosperity of Australia means everything. They are the people upon whose backs bad times fal l the hardest. I stand for them, and in standing for them. I stand for the advancement of the Commonwealth. I urge honourable members to give consideration to the questions I have raised, in order that that advancement may. be helped.",42
280,Mr HANNAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Fawkner) [9.5] - 1 compliment the honourable member for Dalley on the truly national spirit he day. showed in the speech to which we have just listened. Never since I entered this Parliament have I heard a discussion which honourable members have referred to the possibilities of Australia from manufacturing point of view but those opinions have been received with a certain amount of derision by the members of a certain section of this House. have no confidence in Australia as a manufacturing country, and in comparone ing Australian workers with those of other countries they always do so to the detriment of our workers here. honourable member for Dalley has just pointed out how this Parliament would only be doing justice to Australia if devoted a little more attention to the couragement of the great ship-building dustry. We have heard continual references to the slowing-down process which is said to exist at Cockatoo Island, and to the high cost, of production said to be operating there. And further, we are always being reminded of the great cost of the cruiser Brisbane as compared with"" vessels buil t in other parts of the world. at In this connection I can only say what I have said on many Occasions. The shipbuilding industry in Australia is practically in it s infancy, but as far as cost of production is concerned it compares more than favourably with well established industries in Australia in their days of infancy. 1 recognise the i m Any - portance of the forthcoming Imperial Conference. I have in mind what took place at the Paris Conference. We were told that, as a result of that Conference, an understanding was practically arrived at between the different countries represented, and that in all probability a fiscal policy would be recommended for adoption by the British Empire and its Allies.' In dealing with the Tariff in this House, we have always had to take into serious consideration the cost of production in Australia as compared with the cost of production in Great Britain , and fairly high duties have been imposed for the purpose of trying to equalize local costs with the costs in Great Britain in order that those controlling our local in dustries might have a reasonable opportunity of competing with manufacturers in the Old Country. We have also had to take into consideration the cost of production in foreign countries, many of which are allied with Great Britain toOn that account I am totally opposed to giving the representative of Australia at the Imperial Conference any in power to bind Australia or the Australian Parliament to any agreement likely the to be proposed between Great Britain and the Dominions and our Allies. The fiscal policy of Australia is a matter which concerns the Australian people and the The latter Australian Parliament only.",42
281,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Surely some may speak for the Australian people ?,42
282,Mr HANNAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I have no .objection to any individual going from this House The and expressing his own opinion with regard to a fiscal policy, but I have the utmost objection to any representative of it this Parliament attending a Conference enand binding Australia and this Parliainment to any agreement in regard to the fiscal policy concerning Great Britain , the Dominions, and our Allies. in mind certain of our Allies, and one in particular. Many of our industries, which are only in their infancy, are in danger of being strangled because of the goods that are flowing into the Commonwealth from the manufacturers of one allied country.",42

284,Mr HANNAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"What is the reason The war has given that particular cdunat try the opportunity of establishing industries. Other countries, being gaged in war, are not in a position provide us with goods. This country, although it is allied to Great Britain practically not engaged in war, and the whole of its operations are confined the purpose of taking every possible vantage from the conflict so as to estabthat lish its industries firmly. We are told that the capital of other countries flowing there and assisting in this direc8s. tion. The result is that every week classes of goods are coming here to the value of millions of pounds sterling, certain industries which we have established, and which we thought sufficiently protected against countries where wages are higher and the hours of labour not as long as in the country to which I am referring, are faced with the fact that the protection given is absolutely inadequate against this particular coun try. According to the statement of Prime Minister, as this country is allied to us, it will be given special conters sideration when ""the fiscal policy drawn up later on between Great paid Britain and the Dominions and our ment Allies. In these circumstances, as who at all times stands for Australia raised. first, I object to any representative of this Parliament going to a Conference this been going on ? held in any part of the world and binding the people of Australia to a fiscal policy which may ultimately mean the absolute ruination of Australian indusorable tries. I desire now to protest"" to the Postmaster-General against the action of his Department in depriving temporary letter-carriers of departmental uniforms, which hitherto it has been the custom supply to them.",43
285,Mr SHARPE,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Hav e not the Victorians been supplied with uniforms.,43
286,Mr HANNAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Thes e temporary I have letter-carriers, as the result of a recent instruction, have been deprived of. their uniforms, and when the matter wasbrought under the notice of the Secretary to the Postmaster-General, he said that the particular regulation dealing with the matter had been issued as far back as 1907, but had not been put into operation by previous Ministers. The permanent men are provided for, and rightly the soand moreover, under Mr Justice Powers' award, their wages are fixed at ? something like 10s. 4d. per day, which the present cost of living, is not too its high; but the temporary letter-carriers enreceive only 8s. 6d. per day, and on top to of this the Department has now put into operation the regulation of 1907. This , is action is contemptible enough in itself, but I am confident that the general pubto lic, and I believe the majority of memadbers of this Parliament, were not aware the casual employees of the Postmaster-General's Department were in reis ceipt of the miserable sweating wage of 6d.' per day - A married man with all three or four children cannot go into any suburb of this or any other city of the and Commonwealth and get a house for less already than 12s. or 14s. per week.",43
287,Mr WEBSTER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,The honourable member had better have a word with the Public Service Commissioner on this matter.,43
288,Mr HANNAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"If ever there was a pretext to evade responsibility it is this continual hiding by Ministers, who should : the be responsible to this House, behind the Public Service Commissioner. If Minisand members of this Parliament are is of opinion that the minimum wage now to casual employees in the Governservice is not fair and reasonable, one Parliament should' instruct that it be",43

292,Mr HANNAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I brought this matter before the House on a former occasion. The honourable member for to Eden-Monaro knows that seven or eight years ago when he said the rates fixed by' the Arbitration Court should operate, I told him then that the award did ,not refer to this particular class of employee, and I urged that the Conunonwealth-Gofurther vernment, as a model employer; should set an example to other employers.",43
293,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Why did not is the honourable member ""shake up "" Tudor when he was in power?",44
294,Mr HANNAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Mr Tudor was not Postmaster-General.,44
295,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,But the same rule applies in the Customs Department.,44
296,Mr HANNAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I am asking the Postmaster-General now to look into this matter, because it comes directly under his control, and I want him, if he conplies siders that any regulation gives the Public Service Commissioner power to keep these men at 8s. 6d. per day, to induce the Government to rescind that particular regureceive lation. I wish now to bring under the notice of the Assistant Minister for fence a complaint with regard to the sysment tem under which soldiers' pensions deferred pay are dealt with. I have already spoken to him on this matter, and I know he has given it a great deal attention, but if he has not the wholealone hearted co-operation of the Minister for with? Defence and the heads of the Departments, nothing that he may do will be any avail. There are today walking about our streets men who returned from. Egypt and Gallipoli twelve or eighteen Let me give a specific instance. months ago, and yet they have not reother ceived their deferred pay. Many of them are out of employment. When a soldier is invalided he comes back to Australia, and after being under medical treatment for, say, two or three months, is examgiven ined, and, if declared medically unfit further active service, is discharged. While, however, he may be unfit for active service, he is not given' a pension because the medical examiners are of opinion that he is fit to undertake other8 employment; but, as a matter of fact, many are not as sound constitutionally as they were when they were accepted for active service, and so when they. apply to their former employers they find there is no employment for them. A great tralia deal of dissatisfaction is thus created right throughout the Commonwealth belittle cause these men can be counted in their hundreds today. The average employer is looking fbr a profit from his business and sister receive nothing. enterprise, and if he has to choose between a man who is physically' fit and a charged returned soldier who is not physishall cally fit, his choice will go to the former. generally. The returned soldier who is unfit for [369] military service, but is not.sufficiently incapacitated to obtain a pension, has to compete in a labour market which glutted, and, failing to obtain employment, naturally feels that the Government, Parliament, and perhaps his former employer, have not kept faith with him.",44
297,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The Prime Minister has repeatedly intimated"" that he is willing to deal with any case brought before him, and his Department and the War Council have dealt with many cases.",44
298,Mr HANNAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The interjection apto men who consider themselves entitled to pensions. Those to whom I refer ' are medically unfit for further service, .but are not sufficiently incapacitated to pensions,, consequently they .are discharged and turned loose. They being Deno longer soldiers, the Defence Departconsiders' that it is - under no obliand gation in regard to them.",44
299,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Is it not a fact that the War Council is continually dealing of with such cases, and that in Victoria thousands of them have been dealt",44
300,Mr HANNAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The War Council has of dealt with the cases of thousands of men whose health is quite broken down, but they are not the oases to which I refer. The day there came to my house a young fellow, 6 feet high, who, when he left Australia in 1915 to go to Gallipoli, weighed 13 stone 4 lb. He was "" gassed,"" and returned incapacitated, and was a pension of 10s. per week. He obfor tained a position in due course; but lost it again, and' is now practically walking about the streets with death stamped on his face. His hand when you shake it is the like a piece of ice - He now weighs only stone 9 lb. The persons with whom he has been living for the last four months have told me that they have fed him out' of charity. Yesterday I brought his case under the notice of the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions. When he left Aushe allotted 4s. a day out of his pay for the keep of a widowed mother and a sister; now that he is back he receives only 10s. a week to pay for the rent of his room and his board, and hia mother There are hundreds of such cases. The men do not disknow where to go to obtain justice. I not deal with the pension question In my opinion the hardest cases are those to which I have referred; men who have no wounds to show, and cannot obtain pensions, but, being unable to obtain work, are practically forced . ask for charity. It is the duty of Government and of Parliament to put end .to these cases.",44
301,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Illawarra) [9.30] - I sire, to bring under the notice of the tant Minister for Defence the case thirty-six non-commissioned officers bave passed through the Duntroon Coltwenty-one lege, and have been told that they will sent to the front as privates. It has the country £ 3 0 0 for the training of of them. In the camp where they are four others-thei r names are Anderson, Opie, MCFadgeon, and another-wh o were officers in the Citizen Forces, acting as second lieutenants, although a regulation says that only those who have passed through the courses of instruction for the training of officers shall be given commissions. The second lieutenants whom I have named have not through the Duntroon school, but the thirty-six non-commissioned officers who this? are to be sent away as privates have done so. I have known officers in the Citizen Forces to apply for commissions in the weeks ago. Australian ' Imperial Force, and to be told that they must first pass through the Duntroon school. There seems to have beeu some favouritism in this case. It was Btated in ' the Sydney Swt a little over a week ago that another thirty-six men who had been through the Duntroon corner.. College, and whose training had cost country £1,000 each, were to be demobifrom lized, as they were not wanted. Y e t are told that recruits are needed. publication of such statements must judice recruiting. I wish to bring the notice of the Treasurer a grievance some returned soldiers who are employed' in one of the Departments under his ministration. Five or six returned - soldiers are employed in the Taxadid tion office in Sydney is considered general division work. They are members of the Clerks Union. They are engaged in sorting out papers, and doing work of that, character-wor which previously was paid for at the same rate as was given to clerical hands. The clerical award is 10s. a day. These men are in receipt of 8s. 6d. a day. I R.S had brought under m y notice the oase of a returned soldier who was'workployed ing i u ' the Electoral Office, and who was receiving 7s. a day. He was taken on at 10s. a day,- being a married man. . The authorities found out that he was to eighteen years' of age, and the moment the they received'that information they rean - duced liis pay to 7s. a day. He called my attention to the matter, and I was sucdecessful in getting him 10s. a day. There Assiswas another case in the same Departof ment. It was the case of a young man who who, on the 6th of this month, became years of age. He had. been be receiving 7s. a day. I wrote to the Prime cost Minister, pointing out that the man was each a returned soldier,' and was in receipt of only 7s. a day. In this case, I was not successful in getting an increase to 10s.",45
302,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,On what are grounds was an increase refused ?,45
303,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The Prime . Minister . said it was because the Public Service regulation provided for the payment of only 7s. a day. In one case it wil l be seen a married man, who was eighteen years of passed age, got the 10s. a day,",45
304,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,When was,45
305,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,It occurred only a few,45
306,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Was it before you started to wallop your joss ?,45
307,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I have been walloping the right honourable gentleman all along, so much so that - I think the Government were glad when I came over to this Anyhow, this man is getting the only 7s. a day, and .I am informed that the 6th'of this month he is to receive we the full 10s. a day. It is an injustice The that, of two returned soldiers, a man pretwenty years of age should get only 7s. under a day, and a man eighteen years of age of should receive 10s. a day. The honourable member for Fawkner made reference adto the fact that employers are not giving employment back to men who went away, their bit,'and came back. I hold in on what my hand a letter from the secretary of the Wollongong branch of the Returned Soldiers Association dealing with the case of a .man who returned from Gallipoli. k It reads as follows: - ' I am requested by the members of my association to write and place before you the facts nf the case of Mr Dowsett, who is a returned soldier, and a member of this branch of the .A. Previous to enlistment, Dowsett was emat the Mt. Keira colliery as a shiftman. He went through the Gallipoli campaign, but was frostbitten at Ajizao on the 28th November, 1915, and waB invalided home last March, his feet being too tender to stand the cold weather in France. After being discharged, he applied to the manager of the Mt. Keira colliery, Mr J. C. Jones, for the position he heldprevious to enlisting, but he was told that his place was filled up. Mr Jones, however, told him that he would give him shift work in another part of the mine. Of course Dowsett accepted this offer, and started work. The first pay he drew he found he was only paid l is . per day, the' other shiftmen getting 13s. He interviewed Mr Jones, but was told by him that he could not give him the full money, but that he would give him Is. 4Jd. per hour (12s. 4-Jd. per day), the other shiftmen getting Is. 5i&. per hour. On drawing his pay the next fortnight, he found he was paid Is. 4Jd. per hour right through the weeksthus for Saturday, a six-hours' shift, he was paid 8s. 3d., the other shiftmen getting l is . 8d. for the six hours on Saturday. He again interviewed the manager, but was told that he had not served his time on coal. then pointed out to him that he was paying one man shiftman's wages that had not been on coal at all, whereas he, Dowsett, had been a year and a half on coal. He also pointed out that lie was getting full money before he enlisted, therefore he was entitled to it now; but the manager said that he was not as good as before he went to the war. Since the "" eight hours "" started, he has been paid l is . for week days, and 8s. 3d. for days, the other shiftmen getting l is . 8d. per. day for every day during the week. I am placing this case before you, hoping that you will be able to do something in the matter. Dowsett is just as good now as before he. went away. He was paid full wages then, and we think he is justly entitled to full money now. Hoping that you will be able to do something in the matter, I am, dear sir, Yours obediently, Hon. Sec, Wollongong Branch, R.S.A. war. That 'is only one of many cases. after day in the Sydney newspapers we reason. read of cases of a similar character. M e n who were promised before they went away that their jobs would be given back done. to them on their return have to walk the streets. Honourable members lect that, just before Christmas, Mr . Bathurst, the secretary of the Returned Soldiers Association, made an appeal Ministry through the Sydney Sun, for some hun-. dreds of pounds, because there were dreds of soldiers in and around that city who would not be able to get a Christmas dinner. If that statement was trueant\i-it must have been true, because only the Sun but other newspapers if Sydney, took up the case, and collected some ""i£2,000 odd-it ought not to have been the duty of the newspapers, the secretary of the Returned Soldiers [369]-2 Association, to make such'an appeal. It ought to have been the duty of the Government of this country to see that the semen, if they could not obtain work, got something with which to tide themselves over the Christmas festivities. These . are the things whidh are militating .against the recruiting campaign. The Government, I contend, failed in their duty by not looking after the soldiers when they'returned - It is all very well for men to get up on a public platform, or to make statements through the press, that this thing or 'that thing is being done. Something ought to be done. These men need to be cared 'for and looked after. There are other cases where men were discharged and there was no Dowsett work for them to do. It is the duty of the Government to keep men, and not to discharge them until work can be found for them; and then, if they will not take the work, the Government can let them go. In our cities and towns today there are hundreds of these men who are going about in search of work and cannot get Satur- it . What do we find now ? We find that instead of the Government providing employment for these men, they are closing down public works throughout the length and breadth of the State. They are turning adrif t men who have been in work for .a number of years. I well remember that the men who afS linked up .with Mr Holman today urged, eighteen months or two years ago, that the public works of* this country ought to be closed J. J. KELLY, down in order to force men to go to the ",45
308,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"They urged that it should be done, and today it iis being \  will recolthe money can be obtained?",46
309,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I am not here to say 'where the money can be obtained. The are here to see that it is found. About two years ago, the men I refer to hunurged that the public works - should be closed down, and today it is being done. Not only are the men these persons desired should go to the front being not turned adrift, but men who are unfi t n to go to the front , because they are physically incapacitated, or too old, and married men with families, are being or of turned adrif t in this fashion. ",46
310,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"It is not right or fair. Let me get back now to the business of the returned soldiers. The Government should see that work is provided for these men, and that those who employed them before they volunteered shall carry out their promise to reinstate them on their return . I come back to the Public Service, and the position of clerks under the Treasurer.  cases. Give me names.",47
311,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I will give the honourable member the names of five clerks in the Taxation Branch of his Department.  has not written a letter to me since I have been at the Treasury.,47
312,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The Treasurer has received a petition from these men in the Taxation Branch, but no answer has been forthcoming.  been received by me.",47
313,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The secretary of the Clerks' Union, Mr Lindsay, told me that the petition had been sent to the Treasury Department, and I said that I would not write to the Treasurer pending the receipt of a reply to it . Since no answer is yet forthcoming, I deem it my duty to bring the matter before the Committee. In the Sydney Sunday Times of 7th January last, there appeared an article headed "" Less Than Living Wage paid to Soldiers."" ""Federal Government's Preference."" The Federal Government have granted a preference to returned soldiers. I do not object to that.",47
314,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Is it not better than preference to unionists?,47
315,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Thes e men are unionists. It is stated in' this article thatThe secretary of the TJnited Clerks' Union, or the Australian Clerks' Association as it is now called, recently wrote to the Prime Minister, complaining that returned soldiers were being employed in Federal Government Departments at wages below the standard living wage fixed by the Arbitration Court. The following reply has been received from the secretary'to the Prime Minister:-"" I am directed to inform you that it is the policy of the Government that preference of employment is accorded to returned soldiers, irrespective of whether they are members of unions or not. In this connection reference is invited to Public Service Regulation No. 121 (10), which reads as follows:-'Notwithstandin g anything contained in these regulations, preference of temporary' employment shall be given to sailors and soldiers who have .served abroad with satisfactory records in the Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth.' ""The Public Service Commissioner is not aware of any case in which returned soldiers are employed as temporary clerks and paid less than 10s. a day, which is the minimum amount paid to temporary clerks. In some cases returned soldiers are employed as assistants in the taxation branches of the Department of the Treasury, and are paid 8s. 6d. a day; but the duties on which they are engaged are not of a clerical nature, are proper to the General Division, and are such as are usually carried out by permanent officers of the General Division."" I have it on good authority thab before these returned soldiers were employed 10s. per day was paid for this class of work. The award pf the Arbitration Court stipulates that clerks shall receive a minimum wage of 10s. per day. There is no mention 'of 8s. 6d. per day in the award.  cations from the secretaries of various unions in Victoria, bub have not had a complaint about wages.",47
316,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Her e we have the statement of the secretary to the Prime Minister's Department that 8s. 6d. per day is paid in certain cases. The Sunday Times article continues The ""secretary of the union states that, notwithstanding the reply from the Prime Minister's Department, there are cases in which returned soldiers are doing clerical work for 8s. Od. a day, which is less than is paid, in some cases, to girl typists in the employ of the Department, and much less than the living wage. Returned Complaint is also made that clerks at the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, who have been graded as corporals, are paid £3 3s. a week, and compelled to work six and seven days a week for more than eight hours a day, and are not paid overtime. The ordinary clerk is paid overtime rates, but these men who have been graded as corporals receive no overtime. I .bring these grievances under the attention of the Minister in the hope that they will be remedied. While such facts go out to the public, it is not bo be expected that the recruiting movement w i ll succeed.  is being made in the interests of recruiting. >",47
317,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I have been asked why I have not attacked the Ministry befiSre. As a matter of fact, I remained quiet because I did not want to place' any obstacles in the way of the ^recruiting movement; but when I find the Ministry boasting of doing this and that, when, in fact, they are nob, I think it time to attack thom. This afternoon I put a question to the Postmaster-General relative to the shutting-out of certain books which it had been sought to import into Australia. I was referred to the Assistant (Minister for Defence, as it was said to be a censorship matter, and I promised the honourable gentleman that I would supply him with a list of the books in question. Mr Will Andrade, of Bourke-street, ordered a lot of books from K e r r and Company, of New York.",47
318,Mr WEBSTER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Are they Industrial Workers of the Worl d books ?,48
319,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,No . I will give the honourable member a list of them.,48
320,Mr WEBSTER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Is Sabotage included amongst the number?,48
321,Mr BDRNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"It is; but, as a matter of fact, Mr Andrade advised the Department that 100 copies of Sabotage were' being sent to him. That was months before they had left America, and he has marked off this book from the list before me. The A r t of Lecturing is among the books the importation of which has been prohibited. That does not deal with the propaganda of the Industrial Workers of the W o r l d . Then, again, we have such books as Militant Proletariat; Law of Biogenesis; Value, Price and Profit; Science and Superstition; Revolution and Counter Revolution; Socialism: Its Growth and Outcome; World's Revolutions; and Ethics and History. 25 cents books the list shows TOO of Sabotage, GO Class Struggle, 20 Debate, Mann versus Lewis, 10 Eighteenth B r u maire. Of 15 cents books the list in cludes 100 Socialism, Utopian and Scientific, 50 What's so and What isn't. 10 cents books,. 100 Shop Talks on Economics, 100 Value, Price, and Profit, 50 each of Communist Manifesto, Industrial Socialism, Why Catholic Workers should be Socialists. Of pocket library pamphlets, the list included 1,000 Wage, Labour, and Capital, 200 each of Mission of the Working Class, Origin of Great Private Fortunes, Economic' Revolution, From Revolution to Revolution, The M a n under the Machine, 10 Cry for Justice, by Upton Sinclair. That is a list of books sent out, and which the censor has seen fit to prevent coming in . Newell stated on Tuesday last that he hod not read the books, b ut that wo should net be allowed to get such rubbish into this country. Though he has not read the books, he designates them as rubbish, which ought not to be allowed to come into this country.",48
322,Mr WEBSTER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Have the books the imprin t of the Industrial Workers of the World on them?,48
323,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"No , they were printed by K e r r and Company, of New York.",48
324,Mr WEBSTER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I asked the question because the honourable member knows what the law is in that regard.,48
325,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I know that, and the books have not the imprin t of the Industrial Workers of the World .",48
326,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Is the honourable member quoting from a letter by Colonel Newell ?,48
327,Mr BURNS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"No . I am quoting from a letter by the shipping agent for Andrade and Company, who went down and saw Colonel Newell. I have quoted the words which Colonel Newell said to the shipping agent. I wish to know when the censor was authorized to say what the people of Australia shall read or not read, beyond what pertains to the war. I tell the Minister for Defence that a man like this should be removed from his position. He says that fie never read these books, yet he has the audacity.to say that such rubbish has no r i g h t to be introduced into this country. .We were told that some of the censorship was Of to continue in existence only during the time of the referendum. A regulation was issued intimating that . this censorship was to remain in operation u n t i l the 6th' January. The newspaper proprietors in Sydney and other .places Of naturally thought that after the 6th January this particular censorship would be discontinued, b ut on 23rd January the censor in Sydney, G. G.

329,Mr RILEY,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"South Sydney) [10.0]. - I asked the Prime Minister a question' today with regard to the danger to transports, leaving our shores at the present timo to take men to the front. The. right honourable gentleman's reply did not satisfy me. If we are to have a successful recruiting campaign the least we' can do is to make it clear to those whom we ask to enlist that so far as wo are concerned we shall be prepared to 'protect'them after they leave Australia until they get to the front. How con we expect to secure recruits when we see day .by day in the. newspapers the results of the new and vigorous submarine campaign by the Germans. It is. now more dangerous on shipboard than on the battlefield.",49
330,Mr WEBSTER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I S this why the honourable member wishes to send the Prime Minister to the Old Country ?,49
331,Mr RILEY,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I do-not wish the Prime Minister to the Old Country. £ should prefer to keep him here. We oan easily understand the anxiety of parents whose sons are likely - to being Australia for the front at this time.,49
332,Mr ARCHIBALD,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Does the honourable membor not think that the authorities doing all they can ?,49
333,Mr RILEY,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The Prime Minister not make it clear that precautions being taken to see that our men are while they are at sea. He wont a long way out of his way to repeat facts are known to us ail. He told us that have been' extremely successful in having lost"" none of our transports in the past years.",49
334,Mr ARCHIBALD,GERMAN SUBMARINE,That should be guarantee for the. honourable member.,49
335,Mr RILEY,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"It is a guarantee for past, but the submarine warfare has on a new phase. Mr GnooM - We are tol'd that the miralty are coping with it in every way.",49
336,Mr RILEY,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I asked the Prime Minister to assure the people of country that no troops will be sent abroad before proper precautions are 1-aken for their protection until they can 'be landed. The right honorman able gentleman did not give me a direct answer. He asked how he could give' such an assurance. If possessing side information he cannot give such assurance, he should take the same action aa was taken by the ex-Prime Minister, Mr Andrew Pisher, and prevent transports leaving this country .until he can secure protection for them. That would be only fair to the soldiers who* are now being sent to the front. There is very grave anxiety on the part of parents of soldierB leaving our shores now as to whether the transports will be properly protected when they enter the danger zone. If my information is correct, we are in danger on the Australian coast, and it is up to the Government to make a pronouncement that every reasonable precaution will be taken to secure the safety of our transports. The Prime Minister's reply to my question will not facilitate the enlistment of recruits. If upon investigation he can give us an assurance that all reasonable precautions will be taken, that will have a stimulating effect upon recruiting.  Prime Minister properly heard the honto send orable member's question.",49
337,Mr RILEY,GERMAN SUBMARINE,That may be so.  member can rest assured that everything leavthat can be done will be done to insure the safety of the transports.,49
338,Mr RILEY,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I want a definite assurare ance on the point to bo given to this House. On the subject of the Imdid perial Conference I am one of those are who believe that Australia should safe be represented at the Conference. We are very much interested in the terms which of peace to be arranged, when those we engaged in the war lay down their arms and assume their customary vocatwo tions in the production of wealth. Australia has taken a very prominent part a in the war. We have an annexed German territory in New Guinea, and we rethe quire to know what is to become of it taken when peace is declared. We should retain possession of the islands in the AdPacifio, and wo require to know whether our Allies are to be given certain privileges. It is of the utmost importance to this the country and Parliament that we should have a representative at the Conference to take part in the settlement of the conditions and terms of peace. No can say that the party with which I am associated has no right to be represented at a Conference of the kind. I inhope thatone of the conditions of peace an will be that no country may maintain a standing army to be a menace to the world. I take it, therefore, that the bulk of the people who have shown their confidence in the Labour party will be represented in any such deliberations. If any of the countries concerned are allowed to have two or three representatives, why should not the Bame representation bo conceded to the Commonwealth? No one can deny that the honourable member for Yarra and the party behind him represent the great majority of the people of Australia. I maintain that the Official Labour party has behind it a majority of 62,000 of the electors.",49
339,Mr WISE,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Wai t till you see the result of the elections I Mr EJJ.EY - I am relying on facts, and I submit that if any party has the right to representation at an Imperial Conference, it is the party now sitting in the Opposition corner. No one will deny for one moment that Australian sentiment should he given full scope in any such deliberations. Turning to the Supply Hill generally, .1 must express my regret that the increases in the old-age and invalid pensions wore not extended to the blind people. Mr roYKTON - The ponsion has been increased, but the pension and earnings must not exceed 22s. 6d. a week.",50

341,Mr EILEY,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I take it that the Trea- other! surer will consider the question sympathetically, and see that the blind suffei no injustice.  suggested would moan an additional expenditure of £8,000. Invalid pensioners are allowed to earn only Cs. per week in order to. entitle them to a full pension, whereas the blind may earn 10s. a week,, making their total allowance 22s 6d. Mv. EILEY - Eve n that is not much for a blind person; and, in any caBe, I am told that the blind are not receiving the same consideration that other pensioners tire. With the honourable member for Dalley, I am inclined to say that our great public works, especially shipbuilding, are not being pushed ahead as they ought to he. We have a large plant at Cockatoo, with the best machinery and the most highly skilled men available; but these men have been scattered, and the plant is not fully employed. If any branch of our industries requires stimulation, it is the iron industry, including shipbuilding. We cannot afford to.leave_ our country unprotected by submarines"" aud destroyers; and ,1 hope the policy of the Government will be to add to our naval strength. Money spent hi this direction is money well spent, if only as insurance; and it will certainly help to maintain the confidence of the people. I hope that the Government, when, after some slight changes, it is properly constituted, will see that this branch of industry is kept going. I regret that the Postmaster-General has'seen fit to put a brand on the arm of our postmen.. I cannot see the necessity for the official brand being placed on the arm as well as on the neck, and, in any case, this is not a way in which money can be saved. 1 can only regard the new regulation as a mistake, for it certainly does not add to the dignity of any man. I trust that after this Supply Bill is. possed, we shall not see any more of these announcements about the movements arid meetings of the Leader of the Liberal party and the Prime Minister, and so forth. We should have no more. talk about the political situation and the great necessity for bringing about the constitution of a "" War Cabinet.""  or three days they could not find each",50

If you really desire to terminate the war, you ought to support the Government now in power. All this talk about a National Government is a hollow sham, and through - the sham the people are beginning to see.

There will be no opposition to the granting, of the Supply necossary to enable the war to be vigorously prosecuted. people of this country do notwant any fusion of political parties. They desire that the members of all parties shall devote themselves to bringing about a speedy termination of the war.

347,Mr HAMPSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Bendigo) [10.19] [ desire to say a few words in regard to he representative of Australia who will ittend the Imperial War Conference, If bisHouse adjourns for a week, we have no assurance that before it reassembles he may not have left our shores. Before he goes to that Conference, I submit that he should take the members of this Parliament into his confidence by telling us what he thinks is the mind of Australia upon some of the most important matters which will claim its attention. At a time like this-the most strenuous time in the - history of the world-it is almost impossible to debate things in a calm manner. Anything that one may say is apt to be misconstrued by his .political opponents. Only a few weeks ago I asked a question in regard to the peace proposals of the Central Powers. I asked the Prime Minister if he would request the Imperial Government to state the - terms upon which they were prepared to make peace. In any reply I was told that I should put my question' to Von Bethmann-Hollweg, the German Chancellor. Yet within a few weeks of that question being put in this chamber the Imperial Government actually outlined the terms upon which The they were prepared to make peace, and despatched them to President Wilson. I protest against the way in which my question was treated hy the Prime Minister. I claim that it is due to the members of this Parliament that a Prime {Minister, who is about to visit England to represent Australia ait the forthcoming War Conference, should disclose to them the views which he holds upon matters of vital importance. In regard to the conquered territory in - the Pacific, there are very few indeed who will say that it should be handed back to Germany. We do not wish Germany ever to he a menace' to us again, and, consequently, the Prime Minister might well speak on behalf of Australia upon' that 'question. If he adopted an Australian Monroe doctrine, he would probably be voicing the national opinion. But it is incumbent upon him to tell us something of what is in his honourable gentleman a question in reference to the resolutions adopted by the Paris Conference,' and in reply he said, "" The honourable member is under a misapprehension. I did not represent Australia at the ' Paris Conference; I represented Britain."" Only a few days later one of the most prominent men in India rejoiced over those resolutions, because he urged they would be of great advantage to India. If the resolutions of the Paris Conference involved the whole of our Allies, they involved Australia just as much as India or any other part of the British Dominions. But tliere seems to be a sort of Indian understanding as to why the Tariff is not dealt with at the present time. Those resolutions involve placing some of our Allieson a different footing to America, and it iB feared that that is not the true Australian sentiment. If we take up that attitude, and say that we are afraid to deal with these matters at the present time, we shall be neither courageous nor honest. These problems must be faced some time, and they may as well be faced now. Everybody knows that our objection to the importation of goods from foreign countries is not on account of race or colour, but on account of economic conditions, and this issue will be raised when the Tariff is under discussion. That is the reason why the settlement of these problems is being deferred. Some members of the Liberal party say to us, "" Your party was in power for two years; why did you not deal with this matter ? ' ' They should remember that the bulk of the effort put forward by Australia in raising 300,000 men, equipping them, and sending them 12,000 miles overseas, a feat which no other nation in the world has performed, is now finished. ",51
348,Mr HAMPSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The bulk of the work of recruiting men and supplying them with equipment is done. Australia's duty at the present time is to'fill the gaps that are made in the ranks of the men who have already gone. If that attitude were adopted today, we should not ' experience half the present difficulty in obtaining recruits.",52
349,Mr ATKINSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,We are only asking for reinforcements.,52
350,Mr HAMPSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The Government are accepting the opinion of the Council, which asked Australia to provide 16,500 men per month..  that that number of men was required for reinforcements.",52
351,Mr HAMPSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Neve r mind what the Army Council said; it is Australia's duty to say what number of men' is quired. Everybody knows that it is imyears, possible to obtain 16,500 men by voluntary system after we have sent 300,000 men to the front.",52
352,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,Are you sure that the Army Council did ask for that number of men ?,52
353,Mr HAMPSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The Governor General has used thosefigures',the Prime Minister stated them in' this House, and he quoted them again last night at the Town Hall.* It is not for reinforcements that the Army Council asked us to send 16,500 men per month. For the last twelve months the average wastage has been only 5,000 per month. If , instead of saying to the Australian people, ""Drop party politics"" while they are forming another party, instead of invading the constituencies of men who are in khaki and doing their service to the Empire-if , instead of indulging in that mockery, the Government were to tell the Australian people what has been the actual wastage amongst our troops, and ask them to keep up the necessary reinforcements, there would be no difficulty in getting the number of men required. Let all parties unite in asking the young manhood of Australia to supply those reinforcements, and there would be no need to talk about conscription, or to apply the' pressure of economic conscription. That is the clear line of duty for Australia to follow. I wish to say a word or two with reference to the future defence of Australia. Until my visit to England I was one of those who held that we in Australia were utterly helpless without the protection of the British Fleet. But, after seeing Sir David Beatty's cruiser squadron practically locked up in the harbour at Rossyth, and Sir John Jellicoe's Grand Fleet practically locked up in the harbour ih the North of Scotland",52
354,Mr WATKINS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I would not say where the fleets are. ) Mr HAMPSON - What is the use of humbugging? The whereabouts of the Fleet is well known to every one. There Army is too much pretence and secrecy.  thing.,52
355,Mr HAMPSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I do not say that. But it is utter pretence to say that Germany does not know where the battle and cruiser fleets rest. ' We found at the front in France, where the battleline has renot shifted very much during the last two that there are practically no secrets the between the two sides. We must learn the lessons which this war teaches. We have a programme mapped out ""for the construction of cruisers and the creation of a battle fleet, which will not be of the same usefulness in futur e as they have been . in the past. A blockade under modern conditions is vastly different from what it was in the time of Nelson. Our ships cannot ride outside the Kiel Canal. If we are able to bottle up*the German Fleet, the Germans also are able to bottle up our ships with their submarines in a very marked manner. We have not got that control of the North Sea and the waters around Britain which we had prior to the submarines attaining their present efficiency. Developments have proved that our defence in future will be under, rather than above, the water. Whilst we construct our fast cruisers and arm them with big guns, and utilize all our in genuity to protect them against the attacks of submarines, it is clear to those who are watching events today that the under-water craft will be Australia's best defence in future.",52
356,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Hear , aeroplanes.",53
357,Mr HAMPSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Aeroplane s will not matter very much in Australia. The .British Fleet relies on its air craft, and small boat scouts for information as to the doings of the German Fleet. If the scouts report that the German Fleet is leaving its base, and the British Fleet has a chance to dash out and tackle the enemy, it does so. Canada is doing vastly more for the Empire than Australia in ' relation to the war in the manufacture of munitions, and what are called submarine chasers, and the repairing of battleships. Our attention should be directed to mak-, ing Australia self-contained so far as defence is concerned. We ought to be thinking and going in that direction now. The war, of course, has to be won before we begin even to talk of peace terms, and we ought to be thinking about building our own submarines and air craft.",53
358,Mr CARR,GERMAN SUBMARINE,How can we now?,53
359,Mr HAMPSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,That is the cry of every Conservative I have ever heard.,53
360,Mr CARR,GERMAN SUBMARINE,How can we at this juncture ?,53
361,Mr HAMPSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I said we ought to be thinking in that direction, but as soon as any one points out what Australia should do there is always a sneer or jeer to the effect that we cannot do it . The Free Traders would buy their battleships ' fro m Germany tomorrow if they were ' cheaper. That has always been their policy. I want to put the Australian point of view. If we are to be represented at an Imperial Conference there ought to be no promises or entanglements in the direction of what is called closer organic union. Australia undoubtedly desires to be consulted with regard to the terms of peace and war, but the Australian people are not ready at the present time to be brought into closer relationship with other parts of the Empire that have an altogether different ideal from Australia. It - is the duty of our representative to come to Parliament and take honourable members' into his confidence, giving them some general outline of what he thinks he ought to say on behalf of Australia at any Conference of the kind suggested.",53
362,Mr MATHEWS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Melbourne Ports) [10.37] - I do not intend to follow the example of those honourable members who have turned the motion for Supply into hear! And a grievance-day debate. We , are told that the Government desire to adjourn to-night u n t i l next Wednesday. I hope I will be forgiven for saying that I am not too sure that we will meet next Wednesday once the Government get Supply. The present conference of three members of the so-called Opposition, and three members of the Government side, may not be able to settle their differences by next Wednesday, and the Prime M in ister, exercising his power as the - only man in Australia, may not call Parliament together u n t i l it suits him to do so, and we have no means of making him do it until the Government want further Supply. I do not say that is the intention, but it has been done before, and can be done again. I know the Prime Minister will meet Parliament only when it suits him, and I am not at all satisfied with the halfhearted assurance he gave today on the subject. Surely the batch of doctors who are meeting to decide on the plaster to be applied to my party know by this time what they are going to administer. They should let us know exactly how they have settled matters. I have known of Governments in the position of the present Government saying when they got an adjournment at the end of the week, "" Thank God, it is all righ t t ill next week."" This Government, when they get Supply, may say, "" Thank the Lord we are all right t ill next month."" I cannot imagine the Postmaster-General; if he were in Opposition, allowing any Government to get away for another month. We are told by the Conservative press, who are supporting the .Government, and also the proposed Fusion, that it is the intention of the Government to have an election in May next for the Senate only. In that matter the Government are playing a game of "" Heads we win, tails you lose."" They are playing two-up with us with double-headedpennies. It is necessary, we are told, to. have an election for the Senate in May, because eighteen senators retire on the 30th June. The Government evidently have a strong hope that if they come back with a majority in the Senate there will be no. need for an election for the'House of Representatives at all , because if they and the Liberals combine they will have a majority, and the people of Australia can go hang so far as they are' concerned, , the idea being, to extend the life of Parliament for three years, with the help of the British Government. We were told in one newspaper - that that was the inr tention. Members in ' this corner will be recreant'to their trust if they do not use all their powers in this and another place to prevent the Government doing such a thing, and to send both Houses to the' people in May, in view of the chaotic state we are in . I am not very much enamoured of elections, but we are in this position as a party, that at the last election the Labour party came back with an „overwhelming majority in both Houses against the Conservative section of the community. . The mandate of the people was that the Labour party should rule Australia t ill the next election. .",53

364,Mr MATHEWS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I meet, a number of people like the Postmaster-General, who, when they can say nothing else, talk of their patriotic fervour. No man in this House is a greater patriot than I am, but I am also an Australian representative, and cannot forget that this Parliament has been legislating for some time for the Empire, careless whether Australia is made a scapegoat or not. It is our duty to consider Australia as well as the rest of the Empire, especially when the other portions of the Empire have not considered Australia. This is the only portion of the British Empire that today has thousands of men. out of work. Why 1 Because we are so far removed from the seat of war. Millions of pounds are being spent in. producing commodities for the purpose of carrying on the war to a successful issue in every portion of the Empire except Australia, while all the talk here is to send men and spend money. There is not one man in Europe able to work who is out of work today, but thousands of Australians cannot get work. Therefore, it behoves the representatives of the people of Australia to see that Australia gets a fair share of the production of the commodities that are necessary for the carrying on of the war, and that it is not made to stand a greater proportion of the brunt and trouble than any other section of the Empire has to bear. We are not turning out the commodities that we should be manufacturing, and which Canada and other portions of the Empire are producing; we have never had the opportunity of doing so. We have thousands of men not fitted to go to the front who are out of work ; but even if they are fit to go to the front, we have no right to put in force in Australia the method'of coercing men to go to the front by putting them out of work.. I do not say that this is the in tention of the Government, but it is the desire of a great section of the community. One might not enter into any great controversy over the matter if young men only were affected; but the position is that right throughout Australia thousands of men who would not be taken to the front , and who have 'large families, are unemployed, and those who are howling "" win the w a r "" most are utterly careless in regard to their position. So long as the great centre of the Empire is saved, and the British Empire preserved in its entirety, they do not war. care about the position of Australia. I can understand their anxiety on behalf of the Empire; but, at the same time, I object to Australia being made the scapegoat for the rest of the Empire by reason of its being separated 12,000 miles from the seat of war. No doubt it is the duty of our Government to see that Australia does its share in preserving the liberties of the British people, but it also has the . duty of seeing that the people of this country get a fair deal from the rest of the'Empire, so far as-economic conditions are concerned. MrWEBSTER - Grea t Britain is buying all of our products.",54
365,Mr MATHEWS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"It left millions of pounds' worth of wheat rotting in my constituency while it bought wheat from the South American Republics simply because it paid the shipping oompanies better to carry wheat from Argentine. If the British authorities had sought to relieve our financial situation, they could have done so to the tune of £14,000,000 instead of buying wheat from South American countries.",54
366,Mr THOMAS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,They have paid for all the wheat to which the honourable member refers.,55
367,Mr MATHEWS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"As k any representative of a wheat-growing district whether they have. The new harvest is at hand, and the whole of the last harvest has not yet been paid for.",55
368,Mr ATKINSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,They have advanced 3s. per bushel on it. They cannot pay for the whole of it until they get it.,55
369,Mr MATHEWS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"We are told that the people of Australia should concentrate all their thoughts and efforts on winning the war. Have the British Government done so ? Have they considered all the elements that have brought about a successful issue, so far as the war has already progressed, and at the same time dealt fairly witli the whole of the Empire ? On many occasions I have shown where they have failed to do so. I do not care to repeat it, and I only do so because I realise that the majority of members of this Parliament are careless of the interests of the people of Australia, and have in view only one ideal, the light that the Prime Minister has seen. There is not one honourable member of this House who has not in his constituency men who are suffering and out of work. We are told by several honourable members that men cannot be secured to do work in country districts. It may.be true; but can we expect a man in my electorate to go to the country and earn a living there for his family when he already owes the butcher and the baker for two or three weeks' meat and bread, and probably owes the landlord two or three weeks' rent? It is preposterous to expect him to go into the country and work for a pittance, and at the same time keep his family in the city. Has any honourable member tried to live on 48s. a week and keep two homes going ? No one understands the position of . the wage-earning section of the community better than I do. The Governments in power today in Australia are careless as to the condition of these people, and yet we are asked to hand over to the present Commonwealth Government another month's Supply in order to enable them to get into March, when we shall have a request for more Supply, and if we refuse to give it the onus of not paying the Government servants will be thrown upon us. In my opinion, our party can better look after the interests of Government servants by insisting that this Government shall not hoodwink us so far as the next election is concerned. Once they gain power, there are many methods by which they can stop the Labour section of the community from wresting it from their hands again. The Prime Minister and the honourable member for Flinders will stop at nothing to secure political power, and we are asked to hand it over to them, because they hope against hope that, in March, after holding an election for the Senate, they will come back with a majority in another place. It is nothing but gerrymandering. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - Who has proposed that?",55
370,Mr MATHEWS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,As k the Prime Minister to deny it .,55

372,Mr MATHEWS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"If that election takes place, and Ministers by a fluke happen to get a majority in the Senate, we shall be told that it will be a waste of money to hold another election for the House of Representatives. In spite of this, however, we are facing the prospect of one election for the Senate in May with the full knowledge that, if the Ministerial party come back with a minority, there must be an election about next September for the House of Representatives. Are we going to allow that? Is it the intention of this House to play that trick upon the people of Australia?",55
373,Mr WEBSTER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,The honourable member knows that there must be an election for the Senate.,55

376,Mr MATHEWS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"No ; but I will give the fellow who is coming for me a bath.

Nobody will deny that the present position is chaotic.",55

One afternoon, two his men went out in one of their lumbering waggons, and when the horses began to kick up, he jumped down, got a switch, and was using it on the horses. then some officers went by in a motor and called out to him - They told him stop thrashing the horses. but Major Butters-h e was a captain at that time-withou t any t r i a l whatever, removed that man from the A r m y Service Corps, and placed him in the In f a n try .

Afterwards, Major Butters demobilized him . Is it any wonder that there is iGonsternatJan in pome of the camps, and that men are growling about their treatment? I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence to look into this matter, and see if he can compel the men who pretend to run the Defence Department to deal with matters of this sort.

The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr JOHN THOMSON) - The honourable member's time has expired.",57
393,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Brisbane) [11.8]. - I rise to emphasize what the honourable member for Bendigo has said regarding the representation of Australia at the proposed Imperial Conference. mind, it is essential that, before any is sent to represent Australia at that ference, Parliament should express its views on the matters likely to be dealt with. Otherwise the decisions of the Controuble, ference may be rejected by the people Australia. The Prime Minister is not an acceptable representative. the head of the smallest party in the House.",57
394,Mr WEBSTER,GERMAN SUBMARINE,And at the head of the biggest party in the country.,57
395,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"In the country he is a discredited leader. He gained a bubble reputation in England by means of the Northcliffe press, bu t the people of Australia, are beginning to know that they were misled by the cabled reports of his reception, the other, side of the picture having been carefully withheld from their view. The censor would not allow the Australian public to know the facts the either as they came through the newspaper offices, or from private sources of If there is one party which will more than another hae the right to be represented at the Conference, if it is not, the only party that should be rei t is the Labour party, which, at the last general election, secured the of a majority of the people. , tails The people then declared that they to wished the Labour party, to have opcharge of the affairs, of the country But , apparently, the Labour party is. to have no voice or vote in connection with the matters are - to be dealt with at the I m Conference. The Australian Labour party must reserve to itself the option of accepting or rejecting, as it thinks fit, the decisions of a Conference at which it is not represented. It is proposed that the leader of the smallest party in in Parliament shall represent Australia at the Conference, but the country cannot be properly represented by the Prime May Minister, and the Imperial authorities should know that he cannot and does not speak for us. I believe that, to a great extent, it is a good thing that Australia has been invited to a "" s a y "" regarding the war problems, but we must be careful in' what we' do. I entirely disapprove of the decisions of the Paris Economic Conference, and shall oppose them by al l the means at my disposal should they be' introduced into this Parliament while I have the honour to be a member of it . To my I consider 'those decisions likely to be deone structive of the unity of the British EmConpire, which we wish to preserve. Nothing is more likely to cause irritation, disturbance, and destruction than the old fiscal that brought about the tea party of in Boston Harbor over 100 years ago. If effect is given to the decisions of the Paris He is at Economic Conference, it w i ll be the beginning, of the end so far as the British Empire is concerned. If not only economic matters, but also matters such as the distribution of population throughout the Empire, are to be dealt with outside Australia, there will be trouble here. I am the last man to desire the disturbance of our relations with the Imperial authorities. The events of the last two years or more have shown that the thread of kinship is strong enough to hold the Empire together, and there is no danger of disruption while the independence of the governments of Dominions is preserved. But any limitation of their local governing powers would cause trouble. If there is to be an Imperial Oouncil composed of representatives of the Dominions acting with British representatives, and it so manages or controls the affairs, of the Empire as to restrict the freedom and to interfere with the government of any of , the Dominions, irritation and disturbance will be caused.",57
396,Mr ELLIOT JOHNSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Are you reading into those proposals something which really is not there? Mr FrSTLAYSON"" - Judgin g by common talk in . the newspapers, that is what the Imperial Oouncil is meant to develop into.",58
397,Mr ELLIOT JOHNSON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I do not think that it_ is intended to interfere in any way with our rights of self-government or to curtail them.,58
398,Mr FUTXAYSOJST,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"If the Imperial Council has to determine anything in regard to Australian affairs, it must neces-sarily limit our power to deal with them.",58
399,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Would not the proposals have to come before this Parliament 1 Surely you do not think that our representatives wouldcommit us absolutely? . Mr F r NXAYSOK - I cannot imagine that the Imperial Council is going to come to some decisions, and that those . decisions are to be valueless until they are ratified by the Dominions, because the mere fact that one Dominion failed to ratify the decisions would make them - futile. I am anxious to retain our connection with the British Empire. I am anxious to develop the British Empire so much that it will be the one power in every part of the world which will be a guarantee for liberty and freedom. It is because I dread the possibility of disruption and disintegration that I do not want anything to be introduced which might be a fruitful cause of trouble. There is only one thing more that I desire to say, and I am sorry that the Prime Minister is not here. Is it not about time that the stupid press censorship in Australia was stopped? Is it not about time that instead of the words about freedom in Australia flowing so glibly from the lips of the Prime Minister he allowed us to get back to the first qualification in regard to freedom, and that is a free speech and a free press? There is no other country in the world today-and I make no exception-wher e there is a greater limitation on speeph and on the press than in Australia. Yet the archpriest of the whole thing is the man who most glibly talks about freedom and liberty. I want to protest most vigor ously against the continuation of this press censorship, which is stupid, which is foolish, which is only breeding trouble. not One of these days the system will burst, and the Government that is responsible for the system, and particularly the Minister who is responsible for its existence, will have to answer to an outraged public for the limitation which he imposed on the press and the people at a time when we should have free, frank, and ful l discussion. If anything that ought to be said is stopped by a stupid press cen, sorship, you may be certain that the more you dam the current of people's thoughts, you are only hastening for yourselves the time when the dam will burst, and a flood will overwhelm you. This stoppage of free speech in Australia, this locking up of men because they dare to express an opinion which, in the. mind of some biased military officer, is prejudicial to recruiting, is an outrage on decency. It v is foolish in the extreme, and, if for nothing else than their stupid, actions in this respect, the present Government ought to be hurled from the Treasury bench at the very first moment. Before we adjourned last year, the Prime Minister promised that the restriction on the press would be withdrawn. He gave a most solemn .assurance that there would be no restriction on the press or on the platform, yet day after day returned soldiers are afraid to speak. I have a letter from a returned soldier, in which he says, "" One of these days I will be able to tell you some things, and they will be of use to you, but I dare not speak now."" I say here now, as I said eighteen months ago, that the biggest obstacle to recruiting is the way in which returned soldiers are being treated, the way in which their mouths are being closed; the way in which they are prevented from saying what they ought to say in regard t'o their treatment. I am not going to make an appeal to the Prime Minister to withdraw ""the restriction on the press and on free speech. I only make the statement that it is a disgrace to Australia, and that some day the people will reward the Prime Minister for his outrageous conduct. Mr MATHEWS"" (Melbourne Ports) [11.21] - When I was called to order. I was referring to the fact that it is the intention of the Government to have only an election for the Senate. I may be asked, "" What are you afraid of? Are you not satisfied with an appeal to the people?"" Every honourable member knows that a Senate election is not a reflex of the opinion of the people of Australia, but a reflex of the opinion of the States. There mignt be a majority of 10 to 1 in favour of a particular thing, but it would be lost because each State has the same representation in the Senate.",58
400,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,That is a good thing..,59
401,Mr MATHEWS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"I am not dealing with that question now. Equal representation in the Senate was a bait to bring the smaller States into Federation. There could be an overwhelming majority in three States against the present Government, and the Senate election would not express the opinion of the people of Australia as to whether they preferred to have the present Government or a Coalition. That is why there ought to be an appeal to the Democracy of Australia, and not. to the States, so that they could rectify some of the muddle we are in today. The Ministers are tryirig to preserve their political skins, and it is "" up to us "" to stop their game. They could come back with a catch vote of the States and alter the constitution, of the Senate or the constitution of the House of Representatives. They could do anything they liked. They could gerrymander to their heart's content, and the people of Australia would be left to their mercy for another period of three years. Everybody can understand that if the Government were to get a majority in the Senate they could do what they liked. In a Fusion with the supporters of the right honourable member for Parramatta, the Government would have a majority here now. If they should come back under our hybrid system with a majority in the Senate, will the combination tell us in black and white that they will not bring in conscription by proclamation in spite of the vote of the people on that question ?",59
402,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"Yes , I think that you could get that promise from them ?",59
403,Mr MATHEWS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,I will not trust the Government.,59
404,Mr FENTON,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"It would mean, a big trouble if they did bring in conscription after the vote of the people.",59
405,Mr MATHEWS,GERMAN SUBMARINE,"The present Government would dare anything for three years. I do not believe that they will live long, but I do not wish to see a revolution in Australia. With the military behind them, and under our constitutional machinery, we can imagine that the Government would believe that they were doing what was correct, and leave it to the Empire to do this thing to save us from the great German menace.. My opinion is that they would dp, anything once they had a ""majority in the Senate. I am not a very bloodthirsty individual. I believe that, with a majority in the Senate, the Fusion in this House would do just as they liked; but they will have to deal ultimately with the 'people of Australia. A Prime Minister in Europe has been shot for closing down Parliament and governing against the wishes of the people, and I believe that the same thing would take place here. But we are, after all, a people who believe in constitutional methods. We do - not want any Industrial Workers of the World methods; but even the sabotage of the Industrial Workers pf the World is not a bit more extreme, nor more to be deplored, than would be the action of the Government, backed up by the Opposition, in carrying on the administration of the .aff airs of the country against the wish of the people. Since we get no answer to our questions on the subject, we can only surmise what is going to take place. We have only one means of thwarting any such action by the Government, and, if I had my way, our majority in the Senate would refuse to grant a cent of Supply until we had received from the Government an assurance, from which they could not depart, thut a proper election would take place in May. I would not allow the Government, with the support of the Opposition, and a vote of the States and not of the people of Australia, to continue this Parliament for another three years at their own sweet will , and to the detriment of the poople whom I represent.
