12,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPORT OF AUSTRALIA N METAL,"The question is obviously within the purview of the Prime Minister's Department, and I therefore suggest to my honourable friend that he should give notice of it .

18,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACCUMULATION OF PRIMAR Y,"An answer to that question, even if I were in a position to. give it , would occupy quite an hour.

36,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AN D," It is not clear from the honourable member's I question what 13 the scope of the amendment which he suggests. Under section 27 of the Act, no party on the hearing of an industrial dispute can be represented by counsel or solicitor, except by consent of all parties; but, if the honourable member means that neither party should be allowed legal representation in any proceedings under the Act, I do not think that that would conduce to better or more upon noticespeedy administration. EXPORT OF FLOUR.  Trade ancl Customs, upon notice I. Has ho noticed the statement made by. Mr G. W.

Sydney, to a British firm at a price which would have yielded 7s. 6d. net to the Wheat Pool (as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 20th ultimo, page 17) ? 2.

37,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AN D,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. The State of New South Wales had no authority whatever to make arrangements for the export of flour to Egypt, which it is understood 'was the destination of the flour referred, to. The Australian Wheat. Board recognised that, the best results for wheat-growers . could be obtained from such destinations only if the Board were the sole seller, and if freight were chartered through the chartering agents only. The sales from New South Wales conformed to neither of these conditions. Flour business with Egypt was done by the Wiheat Board on much more favourable terms for wheat-growers than the unauthorized business referred to. When. in England, the Prime Minister found that the legitimate business of .the Australian Wheat Board was - hampered by unauthorized offers of Australian flour. It is quite incorrect to say that the Advisory Board refused its sanction to the sale. DEPARTMENTAL ECONOMIES. ROYAL COMMISSION'S REPORT.",24

RIFLE CLUBS: IMPORTED AMMUNITION.",29
70,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"On the 2nd October the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) asked the following question:We have been told that only a limited quantity of a certain class of ammunition is being used by our Eifle Clubs and Citizen Forces. We have evidence, however, that the Department of Defence has a large quantity of foreign made cartridges marked W15, in which black powder is used. Will the Assistant Minister for Defence take action to see that, as far as possible, these cartridges are not distributed among the Forces? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :The total stock of .303-inch ball ammunition in Ordnance Magazine, Melbourne, other than that made in Australia, is 1,154 rounds. These will be expended for purposes other than musketry by Citizen Forces and Rifle Clubs.

In Committee of Supply:  surer) [ 3 . 2 ] - I have the honour to submit for the information of honourable members the Financial Statement for the year. The purpose of the Budget Speech being to set out as clearly as possible what the financial position is, it is necessary to make many comparisons, one year with another, and naturally a retrospect claims first attention. Estimated and Actual Revenue, 1918-19. On 25th September of last year, Treasurer estimated that he would receive during the then current financial year a total revenue of ... Â£41,470,500 ... 44,768,468 An excess of ... ... Â£3,297,968 PAPERS. The Customs and Excise Revenue yielded Â£3,387,022 more than was expected. This occurred in consequence of the signing of the armistice'and the larger amount of shipping which became available. Revenue in the War Period. In the year 1913-14, the last year before the war, the Federal revenue amounted in all to ... Â£21,741,775 .As already stated, in 191819 the receipts were ... 44,768,468 An increase of no less than Â£23,026,693 That is to say, in the year just closed more than twice as much revenue was raised as in the year before the war. Here it may be stated that, omitting cost of working ex-enemy vessels, such cost having been met out of earnings, the total payments from revenue on account of the war amounted to Â£43,527,763 up to 30th June last, and the direct taxation imposed specially for the purpose of meeting war expenditure yielded in the same period a total of ... Â£36,277,349 Adding the Land Tax derived from rates existing at the outbreak of war, namely ... ... Â£8,065,585 we find that direct taxation provided ... Â£44,342,934 or slightly more than the total war burden upon the revenue. The details are Income Tax ... ... Â£27,317,071 Land Tax at old rates .... Land Tax, increased rates Succession Duties --Entertainments Tax ... War-time Profits Tax ... Postage War Tax ... Total Â£44,342,934 The income tax results have been attained after allowing, in the case of married persons, for an exemption up to Â£156 per annum, plus Â£ 2 6 in respect of each child. As showing what a small proportion is paid by wage-earners, it may be stated that, in 1917-18, taxable incomes of Â£ 2 0 0 and under contributed only 4.4 per cent, of the total revenue from this tax. A taxable income of Â£200 means much more than that sum in actual income, because the former is what remains after all exemptions have been allowed for. It will be seen that the wage earner has not contributed very largely towards the total income tax. The small farmer has not paid land tax, there being an exemption of Â£5,000 on unimproved land values. Few persons pay succession duties or war-time profits tax, and the small business man has not been levied upon in respect of the latter. The only new sources of direct taxation to which the wage-earners have contributed to any considerable extent are the entertainments tax and the postage war tax. The revenue under these heads amounts, approximately, to Â£1,100,000, and the wage-earner's share is very much less than the total. The figures are important in view of the oft-repeated suggestions for the conscription of wealth. It may be said that wealth really has been conscripted, and has met practically the whole of the war charges to date. Actual and Estimated Expenditure, 1918-19. The estimated expenditure out of revenue for the year which ended on 30th June last was ... Â£45,344,595 The actual expenditure amounted to ... ...

Increase of Expenditure since War Commonwealth out of revenue in 1913-14, the year before the war, was In the financial year just closed the expenditure had grown to This is explained byIncrease in Old-age and Invalid Pensions Payments to the States increased by Interest paid on behalf of States was War expenditure in the latter year amounted to The decrease of Â£1,555,817 in ordinary expenditure was due to large reduction of new works, and the decrease will probably astonish many critics who claim that the Commonwealth is lavish in disbursements. - Revenue and Expenditure-1918-19 Brought Together. In 1918-19 the Commonwealth had a revenue of ..' . . Â£44,768,468 and the-expenditure on ac-""TjoTifit of revenue was . . 45,135,876 disclosing .a deficiency on - - the. year's transactions of Â£367,408 As a surplus of . .

As a general rule, a large surplus is to be avoided, if possible, because a Government with funds in hand is usually beset with proposals for expenditure. Then there is the consideration that taxation reduces the funds available for nroportant private enterprises, and money should not be drawn from the people before it is needed. ' The present series of surpluses may said to have begum on 1st July, 1915, because the year 1914-15 ended  began - The total expenditure of the Â£23,160,733 .. .. 45,135,876 The increase being .. .. .. ..

Â£367,408 In this way is ascertained the surplus which was in the Treasury on 30th June last, amounting to .. Â£3,558,412 It will be seen that at the commencement of the present year, the Treasury still had a large portion of the surplus of four years ago. This, has arisen accidentally, and may be ascribed chiefly to the disturbance of war and the consequent be difficulty of making close estimates. Loan Works, 1918-19.

Showing a reduced expenditure in 1918-19 of Honourable members are probably aware that the Commonwealth has never floated a loan for public works.

Primary Products. In view of the heavy financial burdens placed upon us Â£46,120 by the war and the fact that Australia has a large over-seas debt, bearing inter116,604 est, it is fitting that at the beginning of 152,835 the period of reconstruction following upon the war, some particulars should be given of the great primary industries ol 532,835 Australia. 55,760 Pastoral. The pastoral industry was 48,623 one of the earliest to be established, and, 18,438 despite fluctuations, continues to grow. The most important branch of the in 50,500 dustry js the growing of wool, though 63,649 the production of mutton, beef, tallow, hides, skins, & c , adds considerably to our Â£1,085,364 wealth. The results of the 1917-18 season were 1,803,447 highly satisfactory, as the value of pastoral production amounted to Â£93,700,000, the highest sum on record, while all round in Â£718,083 creases occurred in the live stock' figures throughout Australia. In all States of the Commonwealth, cattle raising is carried out on a more or less large scale, the main object in certain u re districts being the production of stock suitable for slaughtering and in Others the raising of dairying herds. The cattle in the Commonwealth in 1901 numbered In 1917, there were 11,956,024. The highprices ruling have encouraged 1 The land settlers to rebuild, their herds, their efforts have been attended with so. much success that the nunir ber of cattle in Australia during 1917 41,201,946 approaches close to the record, of 1894, 61,541,566 when 12,311,617 were pastured in Aus66,958,360 tralia. It may be interesting to honor83,457,567 able members to know that Australian herds are greater than those of aay other 37,139,000 Dominion, the total in Canada being 5,968,000, and in South A f r i ca 5,797,000, 5,500,000 Australia has for many years occupied a leading position among the sheep-breed542,474 ing countries of the world, and for half a century has been the source of the world's Â£311,452,248 chief supply of fine merino wool. Tbere were 72.040,000 sheep in the Common45,958,'514 wealth in 1901, as compared with 84,965,000 in 1917. Theflocks of the Commonwealth increased by 7,411,000 and 8,962,000 respectively in the two sea sons 1916 and 1917. If this rate of in crease were maintained in 19T8, the numthe ber of sheep then in Australia must have Reveexceeded the 1911 total of 93,000,000, which is the highest number recorded for the past twenty-three years. The number of sheep in Australia obtained its maximum as far back as 1891, with a total of 106,000,000. Prom estima-tes published in the Tear Book of the United States Department of Agriculture, it would appear that the approximate number of sheep in the world is in the neighbourhood of 614.000.000, of which total Australia has about 15 per cent. The following comparison, taken mainly from the same source, gives the latest available figures relative to the number of sheep in the principal countries :Australia, in 1918 (estimate) 93,000,000 Russian Empire, in 1914 72,200,000 United States, in 1916 48,400,000 Argentine 43,200,000 South America 31,400,000 United Kingdom 27,800,000 Ottoman Empire Uruguay 26,200,000 New Zealand The bulk of the wool produced in the Commonwealth is exported, but with the increased activity of the local woollen mills; there has in recent years been an increase in the quantity used in Australia, althqugh even now the wool used in local manufacture represents only a small proportion of the whole clip. The total value of pastoral production during the last five years for which we have figures is:1913 .. . . Â£57,800,000 1914 .. .. 60,200,000 1915 .. .. 65,600,000 1916 .. .. 89,900,000 1917 .. .. 93,700,000 It will be seen that the value has increased by Â£35,900,000, or over 62 per cent., during the five seasons. The principal items in the value of pastoral production during 1917 were:Wool .. Â£37,300,000 Home consumption of beef, mutton, and lamb 30,000,00 0 Net exports, with adjustments of all pastoral products other than wool 11,100,000 - Increase in live stock 10,700,000 Pastoral products other than wool used in manufactories 4,600,000 Afr. Poynton. Agricultural. Wheat. The area under wheat in Australia far exceeds that devoted to any other crop. It generally represents about 70 per cent, of the total acreage under crop. The area and yield of wheat reached their highest point in 1915-16, when the farmers sowed 12,400,000 acres and reaped 179,000,000 bushels. The area devoted to wheat decreased from 12,400,000 acres in 1915-16 to 7,900,000 acres in 1918-19, while the yield decreased by about 103,800,000 bushels in the same period. While admitting that 1915-16 was a recordyear, and the estimated yield per acre for 1918-19 was generally below the average, the seriousness of the position brought about by the decreases in the acreage and yield of Australia's chief agricultural product in the short space 27,000,000 of three seasons cannot be overstated, and every means should be utilized to en25,270,000 courage wheat-growing. The following ar,e some particulars of the production and yield per acre of wheat in the leading wheat-growing sountries during' 1916:United States, 620,000,000 bushels; average yield, .11.7 bushels. Russia in Europe (in 1914), 561,000,000 bushels; average yield, 9 bushels. India, 308,000,000 bushels; average yield, 10.2 bushels. Canada, 213,000,000 bushels; average yield, 21.1 bushels. Erance, 206,000,000 bushels; average yield, 16 bushels. Italy, 171,000,000 bushels; average yield, 14.6 bushels. Argentine, 167,000,000 bushels; average yield, 10.1 bushels'. Russia in Asia (in 1914), 167,000,000 bushels; average yield, 12.4 bushels. Australia, 152,000,000 bushels; average, yield, 13.2 bushels. Hungary, 148,000,000 bushels; average yield, 17.8 bushels Spain, 147,000,000 bushels; average yield, 14.6 bushels. Germany (in 1915), 137,000,000 bushels; average yield, 27.7 bushels. The average world's production per annum for the ten years ended 1916 was 3,641,000,000 bushels, according to the estimate of the International Institute of Agriculture, Borne. Australia's annual average for the same ten years. was 91,600,000 bushels, or 2.5 per cent, of the world's wheat production. That the Australian yield per acre is capable of considerable expansion is suggested by the very high yields obtained in some other parts of the world. Other Grain Crops. The principal grain crops cultivated in Australia other than wieat are barley, maize, oats, and rye. Sugar Cane. Sugar cane is grown in only two of the States-Queenslan d and Njew South Wales. In 1913-14, 2,271,000 tons of cane were grown, producing 265,000 tons of sugar. In 1918-19 the yield was 1,674,000 tons of cane, which produced 190,000 tons of sugar. The annual consumption of sugar in Australia is at present about 280,000 tons. Orchards and Fruit-growing. Fruitgrowing has made rapid progress during recent years, the area devoted thereto having increased in the past ten years by 92,835 acres. The increase is mainly due to extensive plantings with a view to the London market, for fresh fruit. Boot Crops. Boot crops, apart from potatoes, are not extensively grown in the Commonwealth. In 1917-18 the yield of potatoes was 347,000 tons, or about 2 i tons per acre under cultivation. Wine. The wine industry has made little progress in Australia during the last sixteen years. The slow development is extraordinary in view of the fact that South Australia, Victoria,- and New South Wales are richly endowed by nature for wine producing. The great advantages of climate and soil are assisted by high protective duties of Customs. The world demand for the class of wine that Australia can produce is practically unlimited. Baisins and Currants. In addition to grapes.for wine-making, large quantities are grown for the manufacture of raisins and currants. In this industry substantial progress has been made. In 1901-2 the quantity produced in Victoria and South Australia, where these products are chiefly grown, was 34,873 cwt. of raisins and 5,959 cwt. of currants. In 1917-18, 147,103 cwt. of raisins and 105,723 cwt. of currants were marketed. The highly satisfactory increase was largely due to irrigation and improved methods of cultivation, while the introduction of ringing the vines was also responsible for an increased yield of currants. In 1917-18 the total Australian production amounted to 151,000 cwt. of raisins and 109,000 cwt. of currants. Farmyard and Dairy. Dairying. The dairying industry is a very important factor in the wealth and prosperity of Australia. The dairy cattle, in the Commonwealth in 1917 numbered 1,900,000. This industry carries in its train the allied industries of raising calves, pigs, and poultry. The exports of. butter have brought into the country Â£34,300,000 within the last ten years. The geographical position of Australia gives her first call on the Eastern trade, for which purpose the dairy production of the Commonwealth can be increased indefinitely. One of the most significant developments of the past few seasons has been the increased activity among dairy farmers in securing valuable stock. The higher prices obtained by them have enabled them to invest in a better class of sire. Herd-testing associations are becoming more numerous, and farmers are learning that it is profitable to keep milk records and to cut out the cows that do not give payable yields. The application of up-todate methods is becoming general. The total production of milk was 588,000,000 gallons in 1917. The production per cow has increased from. 285 gallons in 1913 to 322 gallons in 1917, or nearly 13 per cent. In 1917 there were produced 200,000,000 lbs. of butter, 27,000,000 lbs. of cheese, and 56,000,000 lbs. of condensed and concentrated milk. The total value of these commodities is set down at Â£16,900,000. Pigs. Not least among the rural industries awaiting wider development in Australia is that of pig raising. The rate of progress is' quite unequal to the requirements of local demand, and there is an opportunity to build up a large export trade, as the countries of Europe are short of animal foods. During 1917, Great Britain paid Â£37,000,000 to foreign countries for pig products. Considerable attention bas been paid of late, both privately and by the various State Governments, to improving the breed of pigs. In 1914, Australia had imported. 862,000 of these useful animals, while in 1917 the number was 1,169,000. Poultry. Poultry stocks are largely maintained by farmers, and furnish a siderable addition to the annual agricultion tural or dairying returns. During recent years, however, poultry keeping has sumed an independent position, and it also carried on in conjunction with farming. Special poultry farms have been, instituted for scientific breeding, try experts engaged by the State Governments give lectures and instruction. The value of poultry and egg production 1913-14 was Â£4,500,000. This had inshowing creased to Â£6,000,000 in 1917-18. Minerals. The discovery of gold in able quantities attracted population Australia, and thus laid the foundation of its nationhood. Our 'total mineral wealth cannot yet be regarded as well ascertained, and the mineral exploration of the country is still in its infancy. The large 83,200 production of gold, silver, copper, and tin, the extent' of the coal deposits, the presence of large quantities of iron ore, and the great variety of other: minerals 1 found in appreciablequantities, suggest 1 that the future of mining will be even more remarkable than the past. The total value of the mineral production in 1914 was Â£22,200,000; in 1917 it was which Â£25,600,000. The total production in tralia to date has reached the large-sum Â£931,000,000. In 1917, coal produced was valued at Â£5,600,000; copper, Â£4,900,000; gold, Â£6,200,000; silver, lead, and' lead ore and concentrates Â£5,500,000; zinc conoentrates, Â£1,750,000; and tin, Â£1,000,000. The other minerals produced are alunite, antimony, bismuth, wolfram, diamonds, gems, gypsum, iron, iron ore and flux, limestone flux, manganese, .molybdenite, opal, osmiridium, platinum, salt, scheelite, shale, and zinc. Manufacture. The development Australian manufacture has been greatly  influenced by the war, and' the consequent decline in shipping facilities. Some industries have decreased on account of the difficulty of securing essential constituents, while others have greatly advanced from the necessity of supplying locally-manufactured articles in place of those formerly The number of factories was 15,179 in 1917, as compared with 15,536 in 1913. conThis is a decrease of 357, but the condiof manufacture cannot be gauged from a mere statement of the number of asfactories. Some of them were practically is in their infancy in 1913, employing but pig few bands. Amalgamations have in some instances also accounted for a reduction and poulir. the numbers. The average number of hands employed . in 1917 was 321,000, representing an inin crease of 4,700 on the 1916 figure, but a decrease of 15,400 on the total number in 1913. This decrease was due payto the withdrawal of large numbers of to young males for military purposes, the number of males having decreased by 20,100, while females increased by 4,700'> The largest number employed in any particular class of industry was in clothing and textile fabrics, in which there were employeesj or 25.87 per cent, of the whole number. Metal works, engineering, &c, came next with 62,100 employees! while the class of industry connected with the manufacture of food, drink, &c, occupied third place with 52,700 employees. As an indication of the permanent character and stability of the industries have been established, it may be Ausnoted that the values of land and buildof ings and of plant and machinery used in the factories are rapidly increasing. Thus for the whole Commonwealth the - total value has increased from 1913 to 1917 by Â£16,000,000, that is, from Â£74,000,000 to Â£90,000,000, or at the rate of Â£4,000,000 . per annum. Of the total capital so invested for 1917, the sum of Â£43,000,000 represented land and buildings occupied as factories, the remaining Â£47,000,000 being the value of the plant and machinery. - The salaries and wages paid to employees in 1917 amounted to Â£36,600,000. of Male workers received Â£31,800,000, 'or Â£143 10s. per head, and female workers Â£4,800,000, or Â£54 9s. per head. In 1913 the males received Â£29,700,000, or Â£123 6s. per head, while the females received Â£3,900,000, or Â£47 14s. per head. The amount expended on fuel and light in factories is of .considerable importance. In 1913 it amounted to Â£3,200,000, and in 1917 to Â£4,000,000, an increase of about 25 per cent. The additional cost of fuel has materially assisted in bringing about this increase, but the main contributing factor has been the greater use of machinery, the driving force of which expressed in units of horse-power has increased by 120,000 since 1913. The total value of raw material used or worked up in factories during 1917 was Â£132,000,000, or 64 per cent, of the total value of the finished product. Since 1913 the value of materials used has increased from Â£96,000,000 to Â£132,000,000, or 37 per cent. The large increase is mainly due to the rise in the price of these materials,, but. in some cases, such as those relating to cheese, condensed milk, jam, sugar, woollens and. tweeds, boots and shoes, gas and coke, and electric light and power, greatly increased quantities are also in evidence. The importance of the manufacturing industries is indicated by the fact that the total value of the output for 1917 was Â£206,000,000. This represents an increase of over 27 per cent, since 1933. The output value, per employee continues to show a substantial upward tendency, having risen from Â£479 in 1913 to Â£642 in 1917. This is attributable to the great assistance received from the increased use of machinery, as well as to the higher cost of raw materials. Of the total output of Â£206,000,000, the sum of Â£132,000,000 represents the value of the raw materials. The difference between these amounts, namely, Â£74,000,000, theWool-growers is the real value of nroduction from factories. The corresponding amount for 3913 was Â£65,000,000. Room for Expansion. There, is room for great expansion of Australian manu1 facture, and the woollen industry may be cited as an example. We produce immense quantities of wool. It is anomalous that so much is exported as raw material and brought back in the form of manufactured goods. Total Value pf Production. The total value of primary production .in Australia in the year 1917 is as follows: Pastoral ... Â£93,700,000 Agriculture ... 57,967,000 Dairy, poultry, and bee farming ... 31,326,000 Forestry and fisheries 5,523,000 Mining ... ... 25,591,000 Total primary production ... Â£214,107,000 Then there is the value added by manufacture, representing... 74,000,000 So that the total primary and secondary production of Australia may be set down at ... . Â£288,107,000 Government Control of Primary Products. Having completed a survey of the producing interests of Australia, I now desire to make reference to those products which have been handled by the Government during the war Wool. The sale of the Australian wool clip to the Imperial Government was carried through for N the seasons 1916-17, 1917 18, and 1918-19, and will be con: tinued to the 30th June, 1920, on which date the present contract terminates. The purchase price is 15^d. per pound greasy wool, plus handling charges at the rate of f d . per pound. In respect of the wool sold for purposes other than the military and naval requirements of Great Britain and the Allies, 50 per cent, of the profits, if any, will be dis-tributed to Australian wool-growers. have been paid, to date, following amounts : For the season 1916-17 Â£25,447,010 For the season 1917-18 42,661,903 For the season 1918-19 45,519,522 Total . Â£113,628,435 Appraisements for the season 1919-20 have already commenced, and it is anticipated that by the 31st December this year, 952,000 bales will have been valued, with payments to growers aggregating approximately Â£22.,500,000, subject to the retention of 10 per cent. The balance of the clip, about 1,038,000 bales, with an approximate value of Â£24,500,000, will be appraised as early as possible in 1920, with a final clearing up appraisement in June. The total value of the 1919-1920 clip is estimated at Â£47,000,000. The Commonwealth Public Account has been credited with the sum of - Â£216,034, representing licence-fees payments by the wool tops manufacturing companies. The sale of the wool to the Imperial Government has been of enormous value to the pastoral industry and to the Commonwealth generally. It has been of great assistance, in the stabilization of finance. Wheat. The deliveries to the Wheat Pools have been: 191516 ... 162,224.000 1916-17 ... 138,275,000 191718 ... 103,344,000 1918-19 ... 64,964,000 A total of ... 468,807,000 Of this quantity the Australian Wheat . Board has shipped as wheat ... ... 173,853,000 And as flour ... 46,110,000 Local sales have amounted to ... ... 134,279,000 Flour stocks held-ac count for ... ... 3,858,000 And other stocks, as shown in the books of the States are ... 108,476,000 Making a total of ... 466,576,000 This includes a gain in weight on the 1915-16 Pool of 1,150,000 bushels, and makes provision for losses in New South Wales on the 1916-17 and 1917-18 Pools to the extent of 3,247,000 bushels, and of 134,000 bushels in Western Australia on the 1916-17 Pool. Extensive losses have occurred in other States, a close  of mate of which will soon be available, surveys of stocks being now in progress. The overdraft of the Wheat Board at a recent date was ... Â£9,619,000 And further advances are beingmade to growers to the extent of ... ... 4,000,000 Making a total liability of Â£13,619,000 On the other hand, we have yet to receive from the Imperial Government on account of the sale of 1,500,000 tons ... Â£10,400,000 and the anticipated proceeds of other sales to various countries, including France, Norway, Egypt, Greece, Japan, South Africa, New Zealand, and Callao, amount to ... 2,394,000 and payments still to Bushels. be received for shipments already made will be about ... 800,000 so that we may expect payment of a total of Â£13,594,000 A considerable proportion of this amount will'not be paid for some time. Tinder the contract with the New Zealand Government, the balance is not due till August, 1920, and shipment of the 1,500,000 tons sold to Great Britain is not likely to be completed earlier than June, 1920. The sale of 1,500,000 tons by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has been a very great help to wheat-growers. It afforded the first indication of the clearance of the accumulation of stocks since the inauguration of the pooling system. The wheat grower, now has a sense of independence which was completely lacking at the close of the last financial year. In all, the Wheat Pools have to datÂ© paid to growers a total of Â£88,500,000. Sugar. Prior to 1915, the price of raw sugar was less than Â£14 per ton, but, when the Government fixed the price at Â£18, such increases were made in the estiwages of the field workers that the farmers did not reap as much benefit was expected. In 1917, the Government increased the price to Â£ 2 1 per ton, and Pool. this was followed by further increases in wages. Over 50,000 tons of foreign sugar imported in 1918, and during the present season some 100,000 tons of foreign sugar will be required. Owing to the Government control, sugar has been retailed, since January, 1916, the low rate of 3^d. per lb. for IA white granulated. The prices in all other parts of the world have been much higher. For example, consumers in the United States of America have been compelled to pay not less than 4Â£d. per l b . , though very large production of Cuba, amounttrappers ing to some 4,000,000 tons, was available, also the sugar, produced' from beet in the States. In other countries the cost about Â£400,000. to the people has been more than double that paid by Australians. In addition the advantage of low price, Australia has enjoyed abundance of this commodity, while in other countries there has been scarcity or famine. Liberal concessions have been made manufacturers of jam and other goods f export, the sugar having been supplied at Â£ 2 4, and recently at Â£ 2 6 , price in Java is Â£ 4 5 per ton f.o.b. The total paid by the Government Australian growers for raw sugar, in the last four years, is over Â£17,000,000. Butter and Cheese. Beginning with the 1917-18 season, the Commonwealth took over the control of butter and cheese> through the Commonwealth Dairy Promanufacturers. duce Pool Committee. Up to the 6th Sepember, 1919, 2,074,926 cases of butter were purchased for Â£8,334,727, and 80,860 crates cheese at a price of Â£484,373. The average price given by the Pool for butter during it s operations up to the present has amounted to almost 160s. per cwt., whilst the export price for the three years immediately preceding the war, when there was no Government control, averaged only about 106s. per cwt. price for the current contract, which tends to 31st August, 1920, is cwt. for butter grading 90 points, with ls. per cwt. up or down for each point over or under 90. The price obtained by producers for cheese, during the period of the Pool's operations, has likewise increased from about 60s. per cwt. (export price) i as vious years to 84s. per cwt., which has been the average price obtained from the Rabbit Skins. The rabbit skins scheme was introduced in A p r i l , 1917, and conwere tinued until March, 1918. Authorized agents were appointed in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania. They were the only persons allowed to sell skins, and trappers were at invited to send their skins to them. The skins were classed by Government experts, and the trappers paidaccording to fixed schedule. The prices were net to the trapper, and it is quite safe to say that they were from 25 per cent, to 50 the per cent, above the prices realized by during the four preceding years. The total number of skins dealt with was approximately 50,000,000, valued at Jam. In the early part of 1918, the to Commonwealth Government was - instrumental in securing contracts for the supply of large quantities of jam to the British and United States Governments. Since that time 72,000,000 lbs., valued at to Â£1,631,250, have been supplied at from or 5Â£d. to 6d. per l b . Those prices are almost unparalleled in the history of the per ton. The industry in Australia. The striking effect of the Commonto wealth Government's operations can be seen by a glance at the statistics of jam exports. The exports rose steadily from less than 2,000,000 lbs. in 1913 to 79,000,000 in 1918-19. This has been a great boon to both fruit-growers and jam The Government also made special arrangements to secure freight to carry the jams overseas, and thus - avoided serious of complications at a time when shipping was much disorganized. Meats. Since the beginning of the war, Australia has been filling orders from the British Government for the supply of meats for the British and Indian Annies. The State Governments have been arranging for the supply of frozen meats, The while the Commonwealth Government has exhad the. supervision of the orders re175s. per ceived for canned mÂ«as. During the period of its operations the Government dealt with canned meats to the value of Â£1,746,840. Bacon. Among the foodstuffs that have been supplied to the British Government through the agency of the Commonn prewealth Government is bacon. Contracts were secured in the early part the war, and in all, nearly 2,500,000 lbs. in weight, valued a.t about Â£145,000, clining, to operate. have been supplied. The orders received through the Government were a factor i u causing the ports of bacon to rise from less than 2,000,000 lbs. in 1913 to over 5,000,000 lbs. in 1917-18. Flax. The Federal Government obother country. tained orders from Great Britain for the 1918 and 1919 crops, and gave a guaranall tee of Â£ 5 and Â£ 6 per ton respectively green flax to the growers. The growers have been guaranteed Â£ 6 per ton for 1920. Any profits the Government derives from locally. the scheme will be given to the growers in the form of a bonus. Cornsacks. As the wheat harvest of 1917-18 approached, it became evident that the supply of cornsacks would not be sufficient. The Government averted the shortage by commandeering the stocks on hand orto arrive, and by prohibiting re-established, sales to Calcutta. By this means, and the purchase of sacks in Calcutta, requirements of the early harvest were registered by it . met. In this way, serious loss to the farmers was avoided. For the 1918-19 season, the Governnew ment purchased in Calcutta about 130,000 bales at a price which enabled the sacks to be sold to the farmers at practically tralian output of. zinc the price of the previous year. It is safe to say that a saving to the farmers of at least Â£650,000 was made on the transactions for 1918-19, during which about 150,000 bales were handled, valued at Â£1,598,432. ' The Government was compelled to continue thÂ© purchase of cornsacks because, in reply to representations by the Government, the Viceroy of India notiand fied that the mills refused tb quote a Creek. price, the opinion being held that - the business should go through the usual channels. Rabbits. The Commonwealth Government acted as agent for the Imperial Government for the purchase of the 1917 pack. All rabbits for export were purper annum. chased, the quantity being approximately 1,674,000 crates, of Â£1,260,000. Metals. The signing of the Armistice threw the metal industries throughout the world into chaos. Prices fell rapidly, and the Allies found themselves huge accumulation of stocksThe delay in the settlement of Peace also affected  of the market, users working upon the barest requirements, and speculators deThe situation is gradually improving. It is safe to say that, owing to the exefforts of the Commonwealth Government during the war, the position of the Australian producers was as good as, if not better than, that of producers in any The policy of the Government to have ores. treated in Australia has been for maintained; and now practically the whole Australian output of metallic ores, with the exception of zinc, is treated Already the capital invested in new industries established as a result of the Government's policy amounts to over Â£7,000,000, and f u l ly Â£1,500,000 is paid in wages every year. The Metal Exchange has been firmly and since its inception contracts for the sale of metals andminerals the to the value of Â£35,000,000 have been Zinc. Owing to the sale of zinc concentrates to the Imperial Government, life has been given to the Broken Hill mines, which are assured of a satisfactory price for ten years. The Ausconcentrates amounts to 400,000 tons annually. Copper. During the war the Imperial Government purchased practically the whole Australian output of copper. Sales of copper by the Copper Producers' Association to the Imperial Government disduring 1918 amounted to Â£3,850,000. Lead. At Port Pirie is now the' largest silver-lead refinery in the world, there is also a refinery at Cockle The output of lead by both refineries, with certain reservations, was sold to the Imperial Government during the war. and under the contract Â£4,523,000 was paid to the suppliers. The Port Pirie refinery produces approximately 6,000,000 ounces of silver Though the demand for lead has been dull, the price of silver has a value of never be n so high. Iron and Steel. Australia until lately neglected her iron and steel industries, and was dependent on importations. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has with now embarked unon iron and steel production on a large scale at Newcastle, and has invested Â£4,288,000. The wages and salaries paid amount to about Â£750.,000 per annum. Wolfram , Scheelite, and Molybdenite. In Sept-ember, 1915, the Commonwealth Government, acting as' agents for the I m perial Government, acquired the Australian production of these minerals. The requisition was for the period of the war and six months afterwards. Since then the Imperial Government has purchased tungsten ores to the value of Â£1,141,000, and molybdenite to the value of Â£372,500. Total Value of Primary Products Handled by Government. The following is a summary of the moneys paid to primary producers in respect of their commodities sold during the war by or under the control of the Commonwealth Government: Wool ... 113,628,000 Wheat 88,500,000 Metals ... 35,000,000 Sugar ... 17,000,000 Butter and cheese 8,819,000 Babbit skins 400,000 Jam 1,631,000 Canned meats and 1,992,000 bacon Rabbits 1,260,000 Total 268,230,000 These are the figures to dateMany more .millions will be paid to primary producers in the next few months. - Banking. The total deposits in Australian banks in June quarter, 1914, amounted to Â£157,000,000; in December quarter, 1918, the. figure was Â£178,000,000. These figures do not include those of the Commonwealth Bank, which had deposits of Â£6,700,000 in 1914, and Â£66,000,000 in 1918, including the very large balances of war loan moneys lying at the credit of the Commonwealth Treasury. The Australian banks have been of greatest assistance to the Treasury during 1917. the war, and it is satisfactory that period of. sucb great financial disturbance has been passed through without in any way impairing the stability or the usefulincreasedf ness of the banks. The present banking position is sound, and the outlook for the future distinctly good. Australian-Savings Banks call for tention, because of the gratifying increase both in the number of accounts and in the amount of credit. As a set off to the well justified complaints which are made as to the increased - cost of living, it must' be pointed out that, notwithstanding all disadvantages, the people have during the war saved large sums of money. At 30th June, 1914, tliere were 2,108,000 Savings Bank accounts; these had increased to 2,S31,000 in 1918. In 1914, the amount at credit was Â£83,500,000, and had grown in 1918 to the very fine total of Â£116,874,000. The increase in the number of depositors is somewhat misleading, because, since the opening of the Cormnoiiwealth Bank, many persons have more than one account. Even when allowance is made for this, however, it may be said that at Â£ least one-half of the population now have accounts with Savings Banks. The actual average deposit was Â£42 l s . l i d . in 1918 as compared with Â£39 12s. 4d. in 1914. Theincrease in the amount at credit is no less than Â£33,000,000, and this is the more remarkable seeing that large sums, have been withdrawn for investment in various loan issues, and amounts which would have been placed in the (Savings Banks have been directly invested in war loans and war saving certificates. The' large amount deposited and the increase in the practice of l if e assurance show that the Australian citizen is more provident than is usually believed. L if e Assurance. The last year unaffected by the war was 1914. In the first two years after that, the addition to l if e assurance funds was about Â£6,000,000 per annum, an amount which suddenly fell to Â£2,500,000 in 1917. This was, of course,' the result of the great increase in death claims owing to the war. The claims by death were, approximately, Â£1,500,000 in the 1914, and were double that amount in They are likely to remain Tather a above the normal for some years owing to the impaired lives of returned soldiers. Notwithstanding this handicap, the funds r o m Â£55,000,000 in 1914 to Â£63,000,000 in 1917, or about 15 per cent. Commonwealth Government Ship Construction. The Government's shipbuildating programme is for six steel steamers, each with a dead-weight capacity of 5,500 tons, and fourteen steel steamers with a dead-weight capacity of 6,000 tons each. Of these twenty vessels, three have alreadly been launched, one is actually in commission, and the second almost ready for commission. The others will he completed and ready for service at reasonably short intervals. The cost of twelve of these vessels will be, approximately, Â£2S per ton, whilst the cost of the other eight will""be between Â£28 and Â£33 per ton, according to a sliding scale which takes into account the actual cost, plus profit. The cost at which these steamers are being built in the Gommonwealth compares favourably with the cost of steamers in the United Kingdom, America, and other parts. Provision has also been made for building four vessels, each of 12,S00 tons capacity, two at the Government Dockthe yard, Walsh Island, and two at the Naval Dockyard, Cockatoo Island. Each of these vessels will be provided with 250,000 cubic feet of refrigerated space for the carriage of perishable goods. The ships the highest class of cargo boat, and will compare well with any similar class gaged in the Australian trade. Contracts have been let with two firms in England to build five vessels, each 12,180 tons dead-weight capacity and each with 370,000 cubic feet of insulated space. Work on these vessels has been started. The first is due for delivery early in 1921, and the whole of them before the end of that year. Contracts for sixteen of the eighteen wooden ships which were to be built 'Australia have been cancelled. Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers. In 1916, fifteen steamers were purchased by the Commonwealth Govern- Â£2,105,000. ment. Since then the Line has grown considerably, and has filled a useful purpose in the commercial life of Australia. Two of the steamers referred to were lost as the result of enemy action, and, since the armistice, two of the older vessels have been sold-the Australstream for Â£113,355, and the Australfield for Â£169,290. Their respective costs were Â£80,000 and Â£109,215.  During the war period, three sailing vessels were acquired, and arrangements were made for the building of nine wooden motor vessels and five wooden steamers in America. Eight of these vessels have been completed, and are in commission. Wbile the war lasted they performed good service. Had the fourteen vessels been completed within the specified time, the Commonwealth would have benefited materially. Unfortunately, however, prolonged strikes and difficulties in obtaining materials resulted in serious delays. With the cessation of hostilities, it was recognised that the commercial value of the wooden vessels ordered in America was not very great, and an opportunity presenting itself for disposing of them, it was taken. In addition to handling the vessels of Commonwealth Government Line, a fleet of twenty-one ex-enemy vessels has been run and managed by the same organization. Of these latter vessels, two were sunk by enemy action, and three are will be of on hire under charter. The Commonwealth Government Line enhas carried to and from Australia 682,576 tons of cargo, including 3,366,686 bags of wheat and flour, 146,472 bales of wool, and 43,321'tons of cornsacks. In of addition to the foregoing, the ex-enemy fleet has carried 337,496 tons of cargo, making a total of 1,020,072 tons. The gross earnings of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers (exclusive of ex-enemy vessels) during the financial years ending June, 1917, and June, 1918, were Â£1,390,457 and Â£2,095,978, while in the net earnings for the same periods were Â£426,394 and Â£905,879 respectively. The capital cost of the fifteen Austral vessels, up to 30th September, 1918, was The receipts and working expenses of the Line from its inception to 30th September, 1918, were:Receipts, including insurance on lost vessels Â£4,455,000 Working expenses . . 2,334,000 Surplus receipts . . Â£2,121,000 It will thus he seen lhat in approximately two years the net receipts of the Line exceeded the capital cost of the vessels. Since their purchase the vessels have considerably appreciated in value. Until June, 1917, ex-enemy vessels were run by the Navy Department, and as each voyage was completed after that date, they were put under the management of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. The gross .and net earnings of tbese vessels are as follow:Gross Earnings. Net Earnings. 191415 145,503 (loss) 8,470 191518 646,209 327,924 191G-17 1,272,621 585,921 1917lS 2,292,354 1,223,350 191819 3,327,912 1,448,176 Â£7,684,599 Freights charged by the Commonwealth Line, although in excess of those of pre-war times, have always been much below those charged by the shipping companies. There has necessarily been fluctuation, but, at the time when the ruling rates to the United Kingdom for wheat were 125s. and 130s. per ton, the rate charged by the Commonwealth Government Line was 120s. At a later date the Line found it necessary to increase its rate to 150s. Then the ruling rate was 235s., while 275s. was offered to neutral vessels for wheat to Europe. One of the new steel vessels built by the Commonwealth Government in Australia has recently been taken over by the Line, and is now on her maiden voyage. She will return with a cargo of phosphate rock. One of the results of Commonwealth ownershipof vessels has been that large sums of money have been spent in Australia for docking, repairs, purchase of stores, &c. The Line runs a sailing vessel which, as well as carrying cargo, is used for training cndets for the mercantile marine. Sixteen boys are in training, and it is expected that they will become useful officers. Control of Inter-State Shipping. Inter-State shipping during the year has presented many difficult problems. At the close of 1918, although the shortage of tonnage was very acute owing to war requirements, the Inter-State Central Committee, by organization under one management, was able to use the available ships so that the requirements were almost satisfied. Early in the present year, however, the influenza epidemic and the quarantine restrictions resulted in accumulations of cargoes, and after the quarantine restrictions were relaxed the seamen ceased work. Â£ Â£ The strike having now ended, the congestion is being; cleared up. It is hoped that in the course of a few weeks conditions will again become normal, but the reserves of coal in the various ports will be much below a safe margin for some Â£3,576,901 time to come. The difficulty in obtaining despatch for colliers, owing to the lack of facilities for discharge, prevents the best use being made of this class of tonnage. The position with regard to Inter' State shipping after the lapse of the War Precautions Regulations, when the ships will revert to their owners, is receiving the consideration of the Government. In order to obtain efficiency with depleted tonnage, it would appear necessary that the ships should be run in combination as at present. During the war, Australian coastal trade has been in an exceptionally favoured position with regard to freights, which have practically remained at pre-war rates. This cannot be said with regard to any other country. It is evident, however, that the position cannot be maintained much longer- Bunker coal, repairs, stores, wages, and cargo handling have all become more expensive. Apar t from other increases of various kinds, it may be stated that, to give effect to the recent seamen's agreement, to raise other wages, and to meet the extra cost of bunker coal, as authorized by Statutory Rules passed in May last, an additional charge of Â£535,000 per annum was entailed. A substantial in crease in fares and freights was therefore inevitable. Demobilization. The number of soldiers abroad on 11th November, 1918the date of the Armistice-wa s 175,076. The number returned to Australia between that date and 27th September last was 152,494. These figures show that apparently 22,582 men were still members of the Forces abroad, but many have been discharged abroad and some are missing. The personnel overseas on 20th September numbered 18,374. Repatriation. For the current financial year it is expected that the repatriaceed tion of our soldiers, exclusive of the vision of homes, will involve an expenditure of Â£2,500,000. This sum will be applied principally in connection with vocational training, payment of sustenance, and assistance of soldiers, all of which are expected to absorb Â£2,326,352. Administrative expenditure is estimated at Â£173,648. In addition, it is necessary to provide establishments for vocational training and hostels for totally incapacitated men, at a cost of Â£455,000. Advances to the various State Governwealth ments for the purpose of assisting soldier Â£66,700. settlers to obtain stock, implements, seed, &c-, and to make necessary' improvements on their holdings, are .expected approximate Â£6,085,000. State Forestry Departments may require Â£70,000 to carry on the work of reafforestation, which - will afford employment for .discharged soldiers. Grants to local government bodies for the purpose of undertaking additional works ,to open up avenues of employment for discharged men .amount to Â£250,000. - In addition, a sum of Â£1,500,000 is being provided by way of loans to State Governments for other reserve employgress ment through local government bodies. It is expected that 8,000 applicants will be provided with homes under the housing scheme at a cost of Â£4,000,000. Administrative expenses therewith are estimated on a basis of 3J per cent, to total Â£140,000. Provision to the extent of. Â£4,885 is made to assist ex-Imperial soldiers others. War Pensions. At 30th June, 1919, there were 181,529 war pensions, an crease of 71,355 during the financial on the weir. year. Incapacitated members of the Forces in receipt of war pensions numbered 71,512, and. dependants 110,017.  The expenditure during the twelve months was Â£4,828,072, an increase of Â£2,055,995 over the preceding year. The expenditure for 1919-20 is estimated at Â£5,450,000. This is a large bill, but one which Australia will honourably meetIndeed, our obligations to the widows, the dependants, and the incapacitated fighting men must be held sacred. Federal Capital. It is intended to prowith the construction of the Federal proCapital, and the Government proposes to appoint a competent Committee to report as to the steps necessary to provide at an early date the accommodation for Parliament, the administrative offices, and the residences for officers. The Committee will also report upon the cost necessary to effect occupation. River Murray Scheme. The River Murray Commission's estimate of the amount required for expenditure in 1919-1920 is Â£311,000, the CommonGovernment's quota being The works authorized by the Commisto sion include the following : Upper Murray storage at the junction of l i e Mitta and. Murray Rivers. Weir and lock at Torrumbarry, near Echuca. Lake Victoria storage. Locks 2, 3, and 9 (South Australia). A commencement has been made with "" preliminary works of the Upper Murray storage, and arrangements are in profor the assembling of the plant required, and the acquisition of the necessary lands. Good progress has been made with the weir and lock at Torrumbarry. A contract has been let for portion of the work at the Lake Victoria storage, and it is anticipated that shortly a further contract will be entered into. Arrangements are being made for the supply and of plant to enable an early commencement with work at locks 3 and. 9. The lock at Blanchetown is now practiincally completed, and work has commenced Progress is being made with surveys and investigations on the river between Echuca and Wentworth, and it is expected that at an early date the sites for further weirs and locks on that sectionparticularly in the vicinity of Mildura , Merbein, and Curlwaa--wil l be decided upon. The total estimated cost of the River Murray scheme, which was based on conditions ruling before the war, is Â£4,663,000. Towards this the Commonwealth has agreed to Â£1,000,000. The works authorized by the Commission to date involve an expenditure of about Â£2,600,000. Primary production will be greatly increased as a result of the expenditure, and a large prosperous population will be settled in these fertile localities. Regulation' of Capital Issues. The amount of share and ether capital authorized to be raised by companies from January, 1916 (when Treasury control commenced), to the end of September last was Â£94,287,470. This consisted of Â£51,748,122 for subscription in cash by shareholders, Â£10,287,554 from the capitalization of existing reserves and undivided profits, and Â£32,251,794 by the transfer of assets such as buildings, machinery, and patent and otlier rights. For mining purposes the capitalization allowed was Â£11,803,312; for manufacture and production, Â£44,301,903 ; for public utilities, Â£4,644,304; for trade and finance, Â£24,317,246; and for other, purposes, Â£9,220,705 . In all, 5,626 applications have been dealt with by the Treasury. All requests for consent to register new companies, or for the raising of capital by existing com1 panies, have been readily granted where the immediate object was trade, finance, production, or manufacture, andwhere thÂ© proposals were-framed on lines which were, found to be in a general way satisfactory. Consent was refused to the raising of capital, amounting in all to Â£12,632,194, because the proposed issues were regarded as unnecessary. This does not disclose the full effect of the Treasury control. It has been made clear that many posals for companies and syndicates have 1914, and December, 1915. not been placed before theTreasury cause the persons interested' knew their schemes would not be approved. On the 23rd A p r i l last, the Regulations controlling expenditure en buildings for amusement and other public purposes were repealed. Loans Made to States by Commonwealth: Loans Made from Notes Fund, Beforethe War. Prio r to the war, the Commonwealth lent various sums to the States out of the Notes Fund. The loans thus made and outstanding on 30th advance June last amounted to Â£2,634,000. These are repayable at different dates between 1919 and 1926. The amount maturing in 1919, namely, Â£800,000, has already been repaid, leaving Â£1,834,000, which matures between 1921 and 1926. Agreements between - Commonwealth and States. . Shortly after the outbreak of the war, the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) and the Premiers met in Conference to consider the financial situation. At this Conference, the Commonwealth and the States (except Queensland) entered into an agreement in relation to borrowings for State public works for a period of twelve months from 5th November, 1914. A year later, on 6th November, 1915, an agreement was made in regard to borrowing for State public works t ill one year after'the end of the war. New South Wales did not join in this agreement. The agreement of 5th November, 1914, provided: (1) The Commonwealth to lend Â£18,000,000 to the States (except Queensland). (2) The rate of interest on these loans to be that which; including allcharges, it costs the Commonwealth to raise moneys for its own purposes. (3) The States not toborrow otherwise during the period of twelve - months, except for renewals. The States could, however, sell Treasury Bonds over the counter, up to the amount of sales in a. normal year. The Â£18,000,000 was lent to the States profrom the Notes Fund between November, It was at befirst' agreed that the money should be repaid two years a f t e r ' it was advanced. The term, was afterwards extended for twelve months, and subsequently the Â£18,000,000 was made repayable five years after the war, but not later than 1925. The rate of interest payable by the States on the Â£18,000,000 was fixed at 4J per cent., subject to adjustment. The agreement entered into with the States (except New South Wales) on 6th November, 1915, includes the following:(a) Commonwealth to borrower overseas; (b) Commonwealth undertakes to borrow for State requirements stated sums till one year the end of thÂ© war; (c) States to have the right to borrow in Australia stated sums; (d) States to have certain freedom, subject to the previous clause, in relation to borrowing from Savings Banks, &c. The arrangements do not apply to renewals by the States of their existing loans. The moneys' referred to in the agreement are for the ordinary public works, &c, of the States, and are not for the settlement of returned soldiers on the land or for other repatriation purposes. The operations under the agreement of 6th November, 1915, are:Loans raised by the Commonwealth for the States (except New South Wales) in London ... Â£16,750,000 Advanced out of the Notes Fund up to 30th. June, 1919 ... ... Balance to be found by the Commonwealth for the year 1919 . . .. Total loaned or to be loaned Â£19,740,000 The Commonwealth is directly responturned sible to the British creditors for moneys borrowed for the States. ThÂ© Commonwealth collects the interest from the States, which must also pay the principal to the Commonwealth when due. Co-ordination of Australian Borrowing. These agreements in relation to borrowing for State public works, and difficulties arising out of the war, brought the Commonwealth and States into closer connection than before. The position,  however, still remained unsatisfactory, and the Government therefore made a proposal that the State Governments should give to the Commonwealth full control of all State and local government borrowing for thÂ© three years ending 31st December, 1921. A temporary arrangement of this nature could have been at once entered into, and would have afforded time for bÂ© sole consideration of a permanent scheme based upon experience in the three years. The proposals were considered at a Conference of Commonwealth and State Minafter ' isters in January last, but the New South Wales and Victorian Governments would not accept the scheme. The Commonwealth Government thereupon decided it would not be wise to proceed only on behalf of the smaller States. Loans for Settlement of Returned Soldiers on the Land. The Government has undertaken to provide funds by way of loans to the States for the following phases of soldier land settlement:1. Advances to soldier settlers for the purpose of effecting improvements or purchasing implements, stock, &c. 2. Purchase of land. 3. Works incidental to opening up fresh holdings. Loans to the States for these purposes are made at a rate of interest corresponding to the cost of the money to the Commonwealth. The rate of any advance is to be reduced, however, during the first 950,000 five years of its currency by 1 \ per cent., in order partially to recoup the States for losses which will necessarily be incurred in 2,040,000 connection with land repatriation. It is not possible at present to estimate the ultimate cost of land .settlement of resoldiers, but it is clear that a. very the large sum will be required. The loans to date and the estimated requirements for the present financial year are as follows:191617 .. .. Â£20,000 191718 .. .. 20,000 Public 1918- 19 . . . . 1,047,963 Estimate 1919-20 . . 6,085,000 Total up to 30th June, 1920 Â£7,172,963 Loans to States for Municipalities and for Forestry. The Government underOctober, took to advance money through to the local governing bodies to finance such works as the local authorities mightUndertake. No moneys have yet been loaned for this purpose, but it is estimated that Â£1,500,000 will have been advanced by the 30th June, 1920. The Commonwealth has also arranged to lend moneys to the States for forestry work, which will give employment to returned soldiers - It is anticipated that Â£70,000 will be required for this purpose during the current financial year. Loans to States for Silos. In order to facilitate the construction of silos for wheat storage, the Commonwealth in 1917 agreed to lend the States a sum not exceeding in all Â£2,850,000. The advances are:191718 . . . Â£33,109 191819 . . "" . Estimate 1919-20 Summary of Loans to the States. The following is a summary of loans to the States:Out of Notes Fund (repayable between 1919 and 1926) . . Out of Notes Fund (repayable five years after the war, but not later than 1925) ..

Â£2,634,000 The Australian banks undertook that, during the war, they would not present 1S,000,000 Australian Notes at the Treasury for redemption in gold. By this agreement, 16,750,000 which is still in operation, the Treasury has been able to create the large circulation which exists. On the 3rd August, 950,000 1914, just before the outbreak of war, notes were held by the banks and the 2,040,000 public respectively as follows:. Banks ., .. .. Â£5,032,149 Publio ..

That expansion has frequently been the subject of criticism, but the Commonwealth Government, fully recognising that an excessive issue of notes should be avoided, has kept the circulation to an amount which, having regard to war conditions, was not likely to be harmful. Artificial finance is not the only reason for high prices, but, if it were, the of the increase in Australian notes would tax. be relatively small, because there have been inflated credits all over the world, resulting in a world-wide increase in prices. Had the Australian Note Issue not been increased beyond its pre-war amount, we should nevertheless have had the Department the prices of today. About the time the armistice w,as signed, the Australian note circulation reached its highest point, namely, Â£59,670,000. The issue has since reduced by Â£5,000,000. Estimated' Revenue, 1919-20.

A Bill will be submitted providing for the abolition tax on 3d. tickets, except tickets for mission of adults to continuous picture shows, which will be taxed at - Jd. The tax on 6d. tickets will be reduced from ld. to |d. The tax on other tickets will remain as before. The Government believes this relief can legitimately be granted now that the war is over and the resulting  commitments have been more definitely ascertained. - Taxation of Leasehold Estates in Crown Lands. Prior to 1914, the Federal land tax did not apply to Crown lands held under lease, except perpetual leases without revaluation and leases with the right of purchase. In 1914 the law was amended so that leases of Crown land to be used for pastoral, grazing, cultivation, homestead, mining, or timber effect purposes came within the scope of the Only a small portion of the tax due upon Crown leaseholds has been collected, because disputes arose as to the operation of the law, and some startling discrepancies existed between valuations of and values alleged by the owners. The matter wa3 so much clouded that a Royal Commission was appointed in December last to make inquiries. The Commission's report was recently placed been in the hands of the Government, and will be laid on the table tomorrow. The Government have decided to give effect to the following recommendations the Commission as soon as practicable, namely:(1) That the interest in the leasehold should be ascertained by capitalizing the difference between the full economic rent and the rent reserved to the Crown on a basis of about 8 per cent, instead of 4$ per cent.' as heretofore. (2) That a Valuation Appeal Board be constituted. The other ' recommendations of the Commission are still under consideration and the attitude of the Government into them will be announced at a Estimated Expenditure out of Revenue, 1919-20. The estimate of the expenditure of out of revenue for the year which will adend on 30th June, 1920, 'is Â£49,570,203 In the previous financial year the expenditure actually made was . . 45,135,876 an increase of . . . . .

Total That is to say, if the estimated expenditure had not necessarily been increased in the directions referred to, the efforts of - Â£3,649,707 the Treasury would have resulted in a reduction of estimated ordinary expenditure amounting to nearly Â£700,000 per annum. 30S,167 The task of revising the Estimates was .. 420,760 long and difficult, but by patient and resolute work, the Treasury was able to cut .. 100.93S more than Â£4,000,000 out of the Estimates submitted by the Departments. What Â£4,479,572 has been done is not to be taken as a spasmodic effort; the .Government is determined that value shall be obtained for all its expenditure, and intends continuously to exercise the closest supervision over expenditure. Royal Commission on Economies. In 45,245 November of last year a Royal Commission was appointed to consider and report . . Â£4,434,327 upon the public expenditure of the Commonwealth, with a view to effecting economies. The Commission has been inquiring closely into the working of DeÂ£37,230 partments, and has furnished its first 8,015 progress report. The Government will give effect to the recommendations of the Commission wherever possible. The reÂ£45,245 port has been referred to the Departments concerned for consideration, and the Government proposes to place it upon the table, with the departmental replies, as soon as the latter are to band. War Expenditure .out of Revenue. The war expenditure out of revenue in 1918to 19 may be compared with the estimate for 1919-20.in the following way:Actual, Estimate, ..

Postmaster-General's Department .. Deduct decreases .. With regard to the increases in the Military and Naval estimate, it is to be explained that, notwithstanding the urgent necessity of curtailing expenditure, the Treasury has found itself obliged to provide for large sums to be expended in this year, partly because considerable amounts have already been spent in the first' months of the financial year, and partly owing to the fact that barm might have been done to future efficiency by discontinuing services not immediately required, but certain to be useful later. During the war it was not possible to provide the Postmaster-General's Department with funds sufficient to carry out important and revenue-producing work. A commencement has, therefore, been made to supply the Department with moneys required to meet the legitimate demands of the public for telephones and buildings. War Expenditure.

Many expenses of direct warfare have yet to be paid, and large repatriation expenditure must be met. It is estimated that during the present financial year a total of Â£52,334,579 will be expended out of war loan. Old-age and Invalid Pensions. The Government has had under consideration the difficulties imposed on old-age and invalid pensioners by the increased cost of living, and will introduce a Bill to raise the weekly rate from 12s. 6d. to 15s., to take effect on and after 1st January next. Repurchase of War Loan Securities. Under the War Loan Securities Act 1918, the Treasurer is required to pay monthly from war loan moneys, into a Trust account, a sum equal to one-eighth per cent, of the total war loans subscribed by the public. The moneys so provided are used in repurchasing war loan securities. Since the Act was passed, on the 11th June, 1918, war loan bonds and stock representing a face value of Â£2,650,000 have been bought at market prices. An additional Â£200,000 of the bonds and stock bas been purchased from the public out of the Loans Sinking Fund, into which the Treasurer annually pays revenue moneys equal to 10s. for every Â£100 of the public debt, except a small portion thereof. The purchases have a useful effect in assisting to maintain prices in the market. Public Debt of the Commonwealth. The public debt was Â£325,783,566 at 30th June, 1919, made up of the following items:War loans raised in Commonwealth .. .. Â£194,086,462 Deduct repurchases and securities surrendered in payment of succession duties .. .. Outstanding debt in Australia . .

The principal of these are the States railways, waterworks, and other public works, which produced in 1917-18 a net income of Â£9,959,083. This amount is available for the payment of interest. The States have Sinking Funds of Â£11,447,107, and Commonwealth Sinking Funds amount to Â£2,104,202, the total being Â£13,551,309. The public debt of Australia is being added to from time to time by State borrowing, and will be increased by about Â£40,000,000 to be raised by the Commonwealth in 1919-20 for. war and repatriation purposes. On the other hand, the Commonwealth borrowings this year will clear off the deferred pay of Â£5,500,000, and will enable Â£4,000,000 of debt to British Government to be discharged. The net Commonwealth increase of debt will , therefore, be about Â£30,500,000. In considering the debt to be added in this financial year, it is important to remember that the increase will be set off largely by interest-earning or reproductive assets. In the case of the States, this set-off will represent practically the whole addition to the debt, while the advances to ex-soldiers for homes and land settlement will be wholly repaid to the Commonwealth, with interest, and some of the other Commonwealth loan expenditure will also be reproductive. ' The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has informed the - House that even at the best only a comparatively small sum is likely to be received by Australia as a war in demnity from Germany. He saidWe cannothope to get relief to the extent of more ' Â£100,000,000. . . . Probablyor possibly-w e may receive between now aud the end of A p r i l , 1921, anything from Â£5,000,000 Â£8,000,000. T say, we may. How much' we shall get afterwards, I do not know. The rest of the payment is spread over thirty years. Clearly, Australia must-rely on her own resources and on the industry of her people for the ultimate discharge of the debt. Conclusion. The greatest war the world ever saw has left the nations with staggering debts, disturbed finances, and labour unrest. Of these Australia has a share, but I am happy in the consciousness that Australia's troubles than those of other countries, and that there is every reason to expect our future will be bright. We faced four years of terrible war with courage, and the virility  of our population was made perfectly clear by hundreds of thousands of Australians upon the battle-fronts. Among the peoples of the world there is no finer stock than that from which our fighting men sprang. Australian character is such that our people can be depended upon to overcome the difficulties of reconstruction and to face the problems of peace with stout hearts and determination to build a proud and prosperous nation in these southern seas. Looking into the f u t u r e , I see countless flocks and herds, ripening grain covering many landscapes, mines and factories without number, and fleets of great shi'ips carrying produce to the nations. I see, too, multitudes of people, happy, rejoicing in liberty, and accomplished in all the arts which mark a highly civilized nation. "" I conclude by movingThat the first item in the Estimates under Division 1, The Parliament, namely, ""The President, Â£1,100,"" be agreed to. Progress reported.",29

72,Mr HIGGS,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Capricornia) [5.2] - So far as I can see the Opposition are not likely to object to this measure. Sometimes I wonder why Parliament has not made the income tax a permanency, because it will doubtless be so, at least during our time. Eor Parliament to be required to pas3 a measure each year for the renewal of income taxation seems a waste of time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported, Standing Orders suspended, and report adopted. Ordered :  pare and bring in a Bill to carry out the going resolution.  read a first and second time. In Committee : Clause 1 (Short Title.)",53
73,Mr HIGGS,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Capricornia) [ 5 . 5 ] understand ' that this measure is similar to the Act of last year, but, after all, that is no reason why the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), who has used such violent language concerning the profiteer should not be here. He said he would-well , I do not like to use the expletive he used"" d - "" the profiteer, and shoot him if he could. It was an invitation to the Bolsheviks in this country, if there are any, to take action. If the Prime Minister desires to deal with those people who been availing themselves of the opporcertain tunity of exploiting the public, here chance. He could have submitted an amendment to the Income Tax Act which would have compelled those people who have been robbing widows, the soldiers who have returned, and their dependants, of their hard earnings, to contribute wards the Commonwealth revenue.",53
74,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL, Order ! I would point out to the honourable member that the clause de*ls only with the short title. His marks would be more appropriate on the next clause. Clause agreed to. Clause 2The Income Tax Assessment Aet 1915-1918 shall be incorporated and read as one with this Act.,53
75,Mr HIGGS,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Capricornia) [ 5 . 7 ] - At the present time. I should b'e addressing my constituents and not occupying my time in this way. In spite of the fact that the Prime Minister will not tell the general public that a general election is to take place-doubtles s he is keeping that information for his own supporters-it is generally known that an election is pending. I am between two opposing forces, and although I feel it my duty to go to the country, at the same time. I owe a duty to the public. The Prime Minister is fallin g upon the necks of the returned soldiers and asking them to kiss him.",53
76,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,I am afraid the honourable member is departing from the Bill.,53
77,Mr HIGGS,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"That may be, but the Prime Minister is wasting his time in trying to get votes when he should be here fore- dealing with the profiteer by means of the Income Tax Bill . We have nine and months before us in which the Prime Minister could carry out his promise to protect the people. What better way could he find of dealing with gentlemen - I who are charging excessive prices than by way of the Income Tax Bill ? If their income tax were increased, profiteers would realise that it was hardly worthwhile charging excessive prices, as they would only have to return to the Treasury a correspondingly largeamount in the form of income tax. We hear now that boots are actually up to Â£ 1 0 10s. per pair.",53
78,Mr GROOM,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,What ?,53
79,Mr HIGGS,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I understand that Â£ 1 0 have 10s. is now the price charged for a class of boot, but honourable memis his bers opposite pretend they do not know this is so. In yesterday's press I saw a report to the effect that Â£ 1 0 10s. was being charged for a pair of boots. WÂ© know also that the price of a suit of clothes has more than doubled in recent years, toand I say that by means of the Income Tax Bill we could deal with those gentle. men who are unfairly taxing the public by charging excessive prices for their goods. If these profiteers felt that they rewere being unfairly treated they could go before the Commissioner and state their case. A man might be able to show that he was paying 18s. 6d. or 25s. per.yard for material used in a. suit of clothes, or if he were a wholesale distributor that the price at which he obtained his material from the woollen mills allowed him only a certain percentage of profit. Only the other day there came under my notice an instance of 12s. 6d. being charged the general public for a hat which was distributed' by the wholesaler to the retailer at 5a. That is profiteering.",53
80,Mr MAX WELL,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,Was that price charged in various retail establishments or in one only ?,54
81,Mr HIGGS,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,I heard of only one in - dustries ? stance.,54
82,Mr MAXAVELL,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,Is the honourable member sure of his facts ?,54
83,Mr HIGGS,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"The honourable member for Fawkner appears suddenly to have awakened to a sense of his duty. pointed out to him before that his silence in this House will be his undoing. He is au able man, with plenty of brains and intelligence, but for the last two years he has) been a dumb follower of the Government. Now he finds his tongue and asks me an objectionable question, suggesting that I am making a statement not based upon facts.",54
84,Mr MAXWELL,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,I am doing nothing of the kind.,54
85,Mr HIGGS,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"The honourable member asked me if I am sure of my facts, and in reply I tell him I would not mention the matter unless I were sure. But let us get back to the main point; and that is, that this so-called National Government, since they cannot shoot the profiteer, as the Prime Minister suggested, can only condemn him to perdition. They are asking for certain legislation, because they pretend that they have no power to deal with these commercial pirates, who, if they had not already hoisted the black flag, ought to do so instead of flying the Australian flag over their business establishments. Honourable members opposite declare that they want power to deal with the profiteers, and I reply that, in the measure now before the Committee, there is ample scope for action in this direction/ But the Government have no in tention of doing that at all, because too many of their supporters are really representatives of the profiteers, of that class represented by the coal mine owner, who, in order to,be able to pay the mine workers an extra 2s. per ton was permitted recently to charge an extra 5s. 9d. per ton to the public. And these are the gentlemen who are going to deal with the profiteers! The honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Groom) is going to his electorate shortly to tell the people there that the Government intend to deal with the profiteers; but is there any reason to believe that thÂ© Government will do so, when .we know that at a secret conference - they allowed the coal mine owners to impose an additional burden upon the general community, and thus cause a serious financial disturbance among our secondary in ",54
86,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL," This discussion may be in order at another stage, but it is decidedly out of order on this clause.",54
87,Mr HIGGS,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I am showing, by way of I have illustration, Mr Chairman, that here is an opportunity for the Government to deal with the profiteer. Clause 3 saysIncome tax is imposed at the rates and amounts declared in this Act. By reference to the Act , I find that the rates are as set out, and I am urging that the Government have an opportunity of increasing the rates so as to deal with those business people who treat the public unfairly.",54
88,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"The honourable member will be in order in doing that at the proper stage of the Bill , but not now.",54
89,Mr HIGGS,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"If I am out of order, you will pardon me if I say that you in vited me to make these remarks on this clause.",54
90,Mr FENTON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,Maribyrnong) [5.20] It is about time the Government introduced a method of imposing taxation which would prevent thÂ© impost from being passed on.,54
91,Mr GROOM,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,How would you do that?,54
92,Mr FENTON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"There should be some means of seeing that the person taxed paid the tax. The sources, or authors, of taxation in the Commonwealth are not the Parliaments which pass taxation measures, but the people who avoid paying by passing it on Under this measure we propose to impose taxes to the extent of some Â£8,000,000 or Â£9,000,000. That sum will be secured, in the last resort, from the pockets of the poor.",54
93,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,It will be taken from the pockets of thÂ© people.,54
94,Mr FENTON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,Fro m the poor people. ,54
95,Mr FENTON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"There are two classesin tliecommunity who cannot pass* on the burden of taxation. One'of these-is the land-owner. During' the' war thei price of his wool was fixed, with considerable advantage to himself;. the price of his wheat was. fixed, with rather less advantage; the prices of other productswere fixed, with considerable benefit, generally, to the land-owner. In normal times-, however, he - cannot pass on the amount of his taxes, and, therefore, must pay. The second class-of individual whocannot pass on the burden of taxation is the person receiving a fixed income. He and the land-owner comprise the bulk of the community. They cannot avoid theirresponsibilities in the direction of payment of taxation; and, besides, they are fleeced by the profiteer right and left.",55
96,Mr HIGGS,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Capricornia) [ 5 . 2 5 ] move That-the following words be added :- "" With a super tax of 100 per cent, on all persons found guilty of profiteering."" I admit that I am modest in asking for the imposition of so light a penalty.",55
97,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL," I point out that the amendment is not in order. No private, or non-official, member m)ay move to increase the burdens of the people.  sorry that the honourable member for Capricornia may not move his amendment; but I . hope that the Minister for Works and. Railways (Mr Groom) will do so. He will , if the Government be in in dealing with profiteers - I desire to ask whether I . would be in order in moving, by way of amendment, for the granting of a. deduction of Â£50 per head to all taxpayers with families of five or more children.",55
98,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,The - honourable member will have an opportunity of moving in that direction when the Committee is considering the schedules.,55
99,Dr MALONEY,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Melbourne) [5.28] I regret that action cannot be taken here and now in the direction of putting down profiteers. The income tax commences with persons in receipt of less than Â£ 2 per week. The incidence of its progress ceases with persons receiving Â£6,500 per annum.. That is indefensible. per cent, of the eligible men of the Commonwealth offered their services to the country, and over 60,000 of them paid the supreme penalty. No one can say that money taken by taxation can be regarded as a sacrifice equivalent to the offer of human, life. If the Government are honestly anxiousto put down profiteering, why should they not continuethe incidence of this taxation so that persons in receipt of these largerincomes would pay. more than they have to pay today ? We 1 should then be able at least to say that the - wealthy people of this country are being taxed just as the wealthy peopleof the United Kingdom have been called upon, as the result of the war, to submit to increaseddirect taxation. This is a mere, bagatelle compared with the taxation which the wealthy people of Great Britain have to pay. The Government are not taking advantage of the qppor- I tunity to bring in a more up-to-date In come Tax Bill . This, I think, is but a replica of the existing Act .",55
100,Mr GROOM,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,It is a repetition of the terms of the present Act .,55
101,Dr MALONEY,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I enter my protest against it . Persons in receipt of large incomes ought not to object to. increased taxation. I have before mea report issued by the Inter-State Commission in December last, showing the largely in creased prices which the people have to, pay for their commodities, and I protest against the failure of the Government toattempt, by meansof the 'War PrecautionsA c t or otherwise,- to lighten theburdens of the people-, who, as every honearnest orable member must know, are being, robbedat the present time. Clause agreed, to. Clause 3 (Imposition of income tax).",55
102,Mr CHARLTON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Hunter ) [5.32] I regret that the Government areagain imposing this measure of taxation without making certain very; necessary amendments of the existing Act . The-position, is that, notwithstanding the great in crease in.the cost of living, the working people of this country are again to beasked to pay income tax subject to an. exemption of Â£ 1 0 0 in the case-of unmarried persons, and of Â£156 in. the case of married persons. Such an exemption is altogethertoo low. The Acting Trea statement this afternoon, said that thoseEighty in receipt of an income of less than Â£20 0 per annum contribute ouly about 4 per cent, of the direct taxation of the Commonwealth. I venture to-' assert, how-ever that many who really are not in a l position to pay income tax are being called upon to do so. The purchasing power of the sovereign, compared with what it was when the original Act was passed, has been reduced to the extent of at least 7s. 6d., yet the Government propose to continue the imposition of direct - taxation upon the great body ai the people who are struggling to exist. This Parliament will not be warranted in going to the country - without increasing - the income tax exemption. There should be no distinction. The lowest exemption under this Act should be Â£250. W it h such an exemption we ought to be able to obtain the revenue required by imposing a higher rate upon persons in receipt of more than Â£250 per annum. It is idle to say that our - direct taxation has reached the breaking point. The banking returns show that a section of the community is wealthier than it was,when the original Act was passed. / These ipeople have been able to add to their wealth during the war, largely by reason of the fact that in many cases they have - compelled the public to pay considerably more than they should have to pay for groceries and clothing. . It has been pointed out again and again in this House .that many people have been doing - exceedingly well at the expense of the great - mass of the community. On behalf of those in receipt of small incomes,* I make ;this'plea, and urge that the Government ;are not justified in proposing to go to the country without amending the existing Act by increasing the exemption. Then, again, a deduction of only Â£26 per-annum is allowed in respect of every child. That means that a married man - with one child to support is called upon to pay this tax if he is in receipt of Â£180 per annum, although on such an income, particularly if he has to pay rent, he can barely exist. I have a vivid recollection of the position I took up when the original Bill was - before us. I then pointed out that it - would be impossible to administer it without causing a good deal of friction. The Minister in charge of the measure, after making inquiries from his responsible officers, replied that there was no ground for my fears. Experience, however, has - shown that . I had every justification for the statement. I made. In my own electorate hundreds have been prosecuted under the Aet for fail in g to furnish returns. The Government speak of .large additions to the revenue as the result of fines imposed for non-observance of the Income Tax Act. The .Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Ewing, is a capable officer and a very fair man. When I brought before the House the action of his Department in prosecuting a number .of working people in my electorate who had failed to furnish returns because they did not know that they were obliged to do so, Mr Ewing, at great personal in convenience, visited my electorate, and found that my statement was correct. He discovered that an office had been established there by the Deputy Commissioner, that ,all round prosecutions were taking place, and that large sums by way of 'fines were being collected from many of my constituents. These people did not furnish returns, because they did not know that they had to do so. They had been accustomed to an income tax exemption of Â£250, and did not expect that they would be called upon to pay this tax. They were prosecuted, not because they - would not send in returns, but because they failed to furnish them within a certain date. As <soon as they learned that - returns were expected of them, theytsent them in , and I was promised in this House that in such cases no further prosecutions would take place. I hold that people so 'circumstanced should not be>exposed to the risk of prosecution. Surely we are not going to say that the interest bill in respect of our war loan expenditure must be met by the poorer sections of the community. Some time ago I asked whether the Government were prepared to exemp* returned soldiers from income tax in respect of their earnings from personal exertion. I was told that the matter would be considered. Nothing, however, has been done to exempt them. Our returned soldiers will come under this Bill . I have in my electorate at least 3,000 returned soldiers, and those who are able to work are following their usual avocations. Those who were miners have gone back to their work without troubling the Eepatriation Department or asking for any assistance from it. The Government are now calling on these men, who went abroad to fight for us. while we remained at - home, to contribute out of their small earnings to the Houidation of the interest bill in respect of money borrowed to prosecute the war. Nothing in this Bill will afford them lief. Notwithstanding all the protestapapers tions of the Government, the fact remains that, under this measure, our returned soldiers will be compelled to pay taxation upon their future earnings for the purYet pose of defraying interest charges upon money borrowed in connection with the war. Our Income Tax Act should entirely remodelled, and proper exempthe whole of it . tions should be made in the case of our soldiers who have fought abroad. Further, we are not justified in attemptTax Assessment Act . ing to extort froni the poorer classes of the community the cost of the war. It is the wealthy people of Australia who should be obliged to foot the bill. have been building up big bank balances during the war have not done their duty either to this country or to the men who imposed. fought for it. We ought to insist upon them doing their duty. To this end, emptions under the Bill should be creased, and the rich should be obliged to contribute more than contributing today. Instead additional taxation which will tionably be imposed after election being placed upon the shoulders of those who are best able to bear it, II am convinced that the present will endeavour to place it upon shoulders of the workers of this The measure which, is now before us will not afford the working classes any cause for satisfaction. In the district which have the honour to represent, the miners do not keep a record of their and consequently experience great culty in filling in their income schedules. Later on, if it be found the figures in their schedules do not correspond with the figures in schedules furnished by their the Taxation Department institutes secutions against them. The under the Bill should be not Â£250. I am satisfied that the men who fought for us overseas will never consent to pay income tax on money for the purpose of liquidating indebtedness. Seeing that that was borrowed to keep them in the field, surely we are not going to tax them in after order that we may insure its - repayment. Â£26 I am not at all satisfied with this meaa sure. We ought certainly to impose stiff income tax,, and we ought, as far as Mr Charlton. (No. 3). possible, to prevent it being passed on. reOnly this week we read in the local newsthat one big boot manufacturer had been including his income tax in his profits, and thus passing it on to the consumer. That is what invariably happens. the Acting Treasurer tells us that the wage-earners pay only 4 per cent, of the total revenue derived from this form be of taxation. I maintain that they pay It is time we did something to remedy the blemishes upon our Income During war tim9 we are, to a very large extent, carried away by our feelings and by the imperative necessity to raise as much revenue as Those who possible. As a result, we frequently impose upon the poorer section of the community taxation - which ought not to be But now that things are returning to normal, and we can see the exmistakes which have been made, we ought innot to, repeat those mistakes. The Government will be acting wisely if they inthey are crease the general exemptions under this of the Bill and provide the requisite safeguards unquesagainst the tax being passed on to the the general masses bf the people.",55
103,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Brisbane) [5.47] n this Bill it is proposed to perpetuate Ministry the injustices inflicted under our present the Income Tax Act. It provides that the country. tax now to b'e imposed shall be at the rates and amounts declared in the Bill , which are the same rates and amounts I that have operated hitherto. I am one of those who believe that an income tax earnings, is a perfectly legitimate method of taxadiffition, and I had hoped that the Governtax ment would have submitted some different that proposals from those contained in this measure in order that we might more the equitably distribute the burden amongst employers, the income-earning section of the people. pro- The papers presented by the Acting  less-than in connection with his Budget have not yet been sufficiently long in our possession to enable us to get a real grip of the borrowed financial position. But in the course of our war his remarks the honourable gentleman money saidThe income tax results have been attained allowing, in the case of married persons, for an exemption up to Â£156 per annum, plus in respect of each child. As showing what small proportion is paid by wage-earners, it a may be stated that, in 1917-18, taxable incomes of Â£200 and' under contributed only 4.4 per cent, of the total revenue from this tax. Then after, a few illustrations of a somewhat similar character, the Acting Treasurer addedTlie figures are important in view of the oft-repeatcil suggestions for the conscription of wealth. It may be said that wealth really has been conscripted, and has met practically the whole of the war charges to date. That statement is in absolute contradiction to the facts of the case and to the experience of the people. If the honourable gentleman had desired to be absolutely fair to the wage-earners, he might have placed before the Committee further figures, because I find in the Budgetpapers that the taxpayers with taxable incomes of under Â£ 2 0 0 223,429, and all other taxpayers only 88,511. (In those papers the Acting Treasurer further points out that those in receipt of taxable incomes of under Â£200 pay 4.4 per cent, of the total tax assessed; those receiving Â£200 to Â£ 5 0 0 , 5.4 per cent.; those receiving Â£500 to Â£1,000, 7.5 per cent.; those receiving Â£1,000 to Â£10,000, 45.4 per cent.; those receiving Â£10,000 to Â£100,000, 33.4 .per cent.; and those receiving over Â£100,000, 3.9 per cent.  taxpayers who receive over Â£100,000 per annum.",57
104,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"There are only seventeen, and the honourable gentleman overlooks the fact that they are only assessed to an amount of Â£273,682, and the percentage they pay of the total tax assessed is only 3.9, which is altogether out of reasonable proportion to their in comes. Most of the trouble in this country is due to the fact that all taxation is passed on in some way, with the result that the wage-earners, although not paying the income tax directly, practically carry thÂ© whole burden indirectly. To say that wealth has been conscripted, and is bearing practically the whole of the war charges, is to beg the question; no person who has an intelligent knowledge of the facts would corroborate that statement. The honourable member for Hume (Mr . Falkiner) put the position concisely a few days ago when he said that most of our financial troubles, particularly in connection with income tax ' assessment, is due to the imposition of a war-time profits tax. I notice that, although the income from that tax to the 30th June last amounted to Â£1,206,647, the estimate for the current financial year is Â£2,200,000. For the purposes of comparison, I call attention to the inqome tax returns for the last four years1915-16, Â£3,932,775 ; 1916-17, Â£5,621,950; 1917-18, Â£7,385,514; 1.918-19, Â£10,376,832; 1919-20 (estimate), Â£10,500,000. Therefore, the Government do not anticipate a greatly increased return from the income tax. I have always contended that it would be to the advantage of the business of the country if the war-time profits tax were abolished  numbered orable member.",58
105,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"And if .the Â£2,200,000 which the Government propose to raise from that source this year were raised through the Income Tax Office. When the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) was suggesting an increase in the income tax, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) asked whether that would satisfy him. It is not so much the amount to be earned by the tax that is the consideration as it is the effect that the increased income tax would have. There is no denying that today there are people in the community who are making extraordinarily large profits. It is admitted that profits are being made today at rates liigher than were obtained in past years. That may not be true of the whole of the commercial community, but it is a notorious fact that to a large extent commercial operations are conducted on a higher percentage of profit than was the case a few years ago. The problem which this Parliament has to face is, how best to reach the men who make those large profits. They are not reached through the war-time profits tax, and I know of no better method than through the medium of the income tax. I believe that under the taxation powers contained in the Constitution this Parliament has almost unlimited scope for interfering with profiteering. I am not at all impressed by the' argument that the Commonwealth must have the in creased constitutional powers that are to be the subject of a referendum within the next few months in order to be able to deal with profiteering. By a re-arrangement of the income tax assessment this Parliament could reach to an effective extent those who are engaged ini profiteering.",58

111,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"A r e we not always trying to improve human nature? In order to get r i d of profiteering we must make men realise that it is not worth their while to make exorbitant profits. The war-time profits tax prevents people from engaging in industries ber cause they say, "" What is the good of going into an industry when, if we make a profit, the Government will come forward and.claim 75 per cent.""? So, too, we can, by means of the income tax, discourage people from making enormous in comes by profiteering.

122,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL, Will the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) continue his speech?,59
123,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"The financial position of the Commonwealth was outlined this afternoon by the Acting Treasurer, and . it is a financial position of a most serious character. We are faced with a public debt of' Â£32-5,783,566, and we are told that during the present financial year Â£52,334,579 will have to be expended, and that the interest bill is Â£15,202,728, while the public debt of the country is being added to from time to . time, and about Â£40,000,000 has to be raised for war and repatriation purposes during the year 1919-20. In view of these figures, how can we contemplate the f u t u r e financial position, of the country without some perturbation, in qur minds as to how to arrange the incidence of taxation so that theburden will f all on the backs of those most able to bear it . The notorious fact is that,, whoever else in the country may be finding difficulty, ini financing their affairs,, there is only one classthat knows anystress from, actual experience, and that class is made up of the wage-earners who are earning less than Â£200 a year. Their income is so uncertain and-so narrow that they are walking on the margin of actual want every day of their lives. Their too, is uncertain; and yet they have to bear a burden while the divicorporations, and theincome-producing power in other sections r t y of the community, continue unabated: Income Tax The .balance-sheets that appear from time to time show that, whatever may be .fluctuating in regard to the finances of the country} the dividends come with persistent regularity, and suffer >no reduction. It is all a matter of how to arrange the incidence of taxation, and I agree with the-honourable member'for'Hunter (Mr . Charlton) that the exemption should be - raised in.the interests-of the'wage-earning classes, and that the returned soldiers should the free from -.income >tax assess.ment-under.the'Federal Income Tax The Acting Treasurer has told usithat:the - workers pay only 4.4 per cent, of this taxation, and, if that be ^so, it is so-much ""the easier to relieve them.a little, for it would mean a loss.of only Â£400,000. If we take the two extremes of the income tax paying sections-of the community .the - wagerearners pay a 'bigger proportion than those with the highest-incomes ; i and if it is true that - the - wage-earners pay only 4.4 per cent., the Government can well ; afford to - raise the exemption. Tliose earning less than 'Â£250, which is the minimum exemption, would still be paying from 3 .per cent, to 3.5 per cent., and I think that that is too big a share of direct taxation. Then there is the point in regard to the returned soldiers. I took the liberty two or three years ago of telling the returned soldiers that after they came back they would find that their service had not been ended, because they would have to work their finger-nails off to pay the ' in terest on the money borrowed for the prosecution of the war - The soldiers are how finding out how true that is, and I am prepared to go the full length in regard to relieving the returned soldiers from the payment of income tax. I know that we did relieve them from such taxation while they were at the war.",59
124,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,Does the honourable member mean to relieve them from taxation on incomes from property as well?,60
125,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"No ; only from taxation-on incomes from personal exert i o n ; incomes from property may reasonably be subject to taxation.

139,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I refuse to make any discrimination. If some of them have had harder burdens imposed on them than others it is unfortunate. Serious things are to be said about the military control of affairs, which kept men in comfortable, soft, snug positions while others had to take all the risks. The fact that a man offers his services is to his credit. If the Department discriminated, and gave 3ome men better positions than others, human nature is such that it would grasp at the opportunity, and perhaps the men are not so much to blame as the Department that did it , if there was anything wrong in the doing of it . I hope the Acting Treasurer will allow us later on to insert a new clause. I shall prepare it , and submit it later, hoping that by that time the honourable gentleman will be able to give it such favourable consideration that he will be prepared, to accept it .",61
140,Mr TUDOR,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Y a r r a ) [ 6 . 1 3 ] other honourable members, you, sir, and the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd), have complained that the Â£156 exemption today is not what it was three or four years ago, when the income tax was introduced. If wages have gone up, as they have in some cases, the cost of living has increased much more rapidly. If a man who received Â£3 per week then is receiving Â£4 per week now, he is worse off, on account of the increased cost of living, and has to pay income tax in addition. I know that this is not the machinery Bill , in which we can alter that condition; but we - can use this Bill to let the  the exact position. This is practically the only opportunity we shall have to place our views before him regarding alterations in the machinery measure. We are not likely to have the opporB ill (No. 3). tunity to amend the machinery Bill in this Parliament, because, apparently, we are hurrying on to an election. We on this side do not know anything definitely yet, and are not aware of the extent of the knowledge of honourable members on the other side on the subject; but if a lot of the statements in the papers are correct, and an election is pending, we you in- are not likely to have the opportunity toalter that Bill . It is quite possible that it will f all to the lot of other persons to deal with this matter.  next year.",61
141,Mr TUDOR,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"It is hard to say. I am not tipping today. My point is, that the exemption now allowed is not nearly equal to the amount allowed when the Income Tax Bill was first introduced. It is not as good for the working man as it was then. The Acting Treasurer said, in his Budget speech, that only about 4 per cent, of the income tax is paid by people receiving Â£200 per year and under. I am surprised that they pay so much as that. At the outside only Â£44 of the in come of a man receiving Â£200 a year is taxable, and the average will be a lot less. The Customs Department finds it does not pay to collect amounts under 2s. 6d., and, probably, the Income Tax Department has a similar rule. Taking all things into consideration, 4 per cent. is a good deal to be contributed by incomes of that - I and class, particularly as the people with the including smallest incomes have the largest families. In all probability, a large number of those who earn between Â£156 and Â£200 are granted deductions for children, and a deduction for two children would relieve them of the necessity of paying the tax. However, 4 per cent, of the total income tax receipts is not by any means all that those people pay. If any one thinks the workers earning Â£200 a year and under are paying only 4 per cent, of the taxation of this community, he is making a great mistake. They have to pay a larger amount of the indirect taxation than other persons do.  Customs, which you want to increase.",61
142,Mr TUDOR,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"The honourable member ' for Calare will find from the Budgetpapers that, speaking from memory, about 55 per cent, of the Customs and Excise revenue is derived from beer, spirits, and tobacco, which includes cigars and cigarettes. It is well known that the workers in the community, who, according to the Acting Treasurer, are earning under Â£200 a year, are the largest taxpayers in that direction. They pay a larger proportion of that 55 per cent, than any other portion of the community does.",61
143,Mr JOWETT,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,Do you say the workers drink more than other members of the community ?,62
144,Mr TUDOR,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"^No ; but there are more of them. To judge by the Budget-papers, it does not appear as if the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) thinks that we are getting any nearer prohibition. At page 12, it is shown that out of the total estimated Customs and Excise revenue of Â£17,750,000, Customs duties on stimulants will bring in Â£1,595,500, and on narcotics Â£1,577,650, while the Excise duty on beer will produce Â£3,048,000, on spirits Â£1,089,850, and on tobacco and snuff Â£1,894,580, and Excise licences are expected to return Â£13,020. So that of the total revenue of Â£17,750,000 derived from Customs and Excise no less than Â£9,218,600 is paid on stimulants and narcotics.  would like us to go in for prohibition.",62
145,Mr TUDOR,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I am not discussing that aspect of the question. When it is stated that only ""4 per cent, of our revenue from taxation is derived from persons in receipt of Â£200 and under, perhaps it might be assumed that that is all that persons in receipt of small comes have to pay in taxation, and I am therefore concerned to remind honourable members that such persons pay most of the taxation on stimulants and narcotics through the Customs and Excise Departments, and they have, in addition, to pay increased prices for almost every commodity they use. I heard one honourable member say that a boot manufacturer deducted the amount he paid in income tax from his estimate of his profits. The reports of the Inter-State Commissioners confirm this, and go to show that every charge upon industry is passed on, and eventually the workers in the community have to pay it . I believe that 80 per cent, of our population is composed of workers, and that they pay 80 per cent, of all indirect taxation, whilst a considerable amount of direct taxation is passed on to them in the prices whioh they are called upon to pay for the goods which they use. The point I desire to make is that those who get the benefit of the Â£15 6 exemption are today financially worse off than they were when that exemption was decided upon. I understand that the honourable mem submit an amendment to increase the amount of deduction in respect of children. Under the law, .as it at present stands, a deduction of Â£ 2 6 is allowed for each child under sixteen years of age. The honourable member for Maranoa in tends to propose that the deduction shall remain as at present in respect of the first three children of a family under the statutory age, but be increased in respect of all children over that number in a family.",62
146,Dr MALONEY,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,The exemption should be increased to Â£ 5 0 for each child.,62
147,Mr JOWETT,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I moved in that direction twelve months ago, but I . did ' not get much support.",62
148,Mr TUDOR,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,I will guarantee that I voted with the honourable member.,62
149,Mr JOWETT,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,I believe the honourable gentleman did.,62
150,Mr TUDOR,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Some further deductions should be provided for. There are some married people who, in addition to having to support their own families, have relatives dependent upon them, but they get no allowance under the Income in- Tax Act for amounts which they pay to these dependants, whilst if a single person makes an allowance to such relatives he is allowed a deduction in respect to it. It is probably more difficult for married persons to contribute to dependants in this way than it is for single persons to do so. I am aware that it is the vjew of the Income Tax Commissioner that it is difficult to estimate the amount to be allowed where married persons contribute to the support of relatives, but it should not be more difficult in their case than in the case of similar contributions by single persons. I hope that the Acting Treasurer, in any review of the machinery measure for the imposition of income tax, will make provision for some deduction in respect of these contributions by married persons. I have said that the honourable member  pose au increased deduction in respect of children umder sixteen years of age where there are more than three in a family. I - undertake to say that no one will'contend that it is possible to keep a child in these times for 10s. per week.

During the time that has elapsed since then the Government, I think, might have given this matter careful consideration, and been prepared to make some concession to those taxpayers who are carrying the burden of raising families as compared with those who are not so fortunate as to have children to rear. One of the most serious problems confronting this country is the disadvantage we are suffering from on account of our exceedingly small population and the low rate of increase. Menaced, as the Commonwealth is, by dangers which I need not particularize, it is evident that our safety necessarily depends upon the satisfactory settlement and growth of a large white population. Unfortunately, the natural rate of increase in Australia is so low that unless every encouragement is given there is very Httle prospect of there being anything - like a sufficient population to withstand the onslaught of any enemy during the next twenty years. It may be that, by the creation of the League of Nations, the safety of Australia will be assured for the next decade or two j . but the history of the world teaches us that the time may come when Australia will be put to the test by being called upon to resist invasion, and in that hour of danger she must depend upon her manhood for safety. It is, I think, advisable to investigate more closely the forces that are operating to diminish the rate of natural increase, and it is incontestable that one cause is the excessively heavy cost of rearing families at the present time. The people on whom the increased cost of living has been chiefly thrust are those who are endeavouring to rear families. My proposal suggests merely one method of lightening their burden. I do not believe in the limitation of sixteen years. There are few children between the ages of sixteen and eighteen who are capable of f u l ly earning their own-living.",65
163,Mr CHAHLTON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,If children are earning anything at all their parents cannot claim exemption in respect of them.,65
164,Mr JOWETT,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I am glad to have had the point brought under my notice. W it h the permission of the Committee, I shall eliminate the words, "" wholly maintained by him . "" Proposed new clause amended accordingly",65
165,Mr JOWETT,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"The clause, if adopted, would not involve a serious loss of revenue. If there were any fear that it would do so, I take it that the Government would be prepared to furnish an estimate of the probable loss.",65
166,Mr GROOM,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [8.19] - I desire to raise a point of order. The honourable member is seeking, by way of a Bill which purports only to fix the rates of taxation, to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act . Section 55 """"of the Constitution readsLaws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect. In the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915, a deduction of Â£13 wa3 allowed in respect of each child under the age of sixteen who, at the beginning of the financial year in which the income was received, was wholly maintained by any taxpayer who was not an absentee. Parliament desired to liberalize that provision, and the exemption was raised to Â£26. Endeavours are now being made to harmonize Federal and State taxation. I am informed that only last night the Victorian Legislature passed a Bill providing for the same amount of exemption as is conceded under the Commonwealth Statute. We are all anxious to be generous. It is easy to propose to give away revenue, but we should not overlook the necessity for providing taxation to meet the country's purposes. In the annual report of the Commissioner for Taxation for the year 191516, it is shown that the deductions from taxable income by reason of the existing provision making a concession as to chil-. dren amounted to Â£5,756,584. That is the amount of taxable income deducted in respect of the allowance of Â£26 for every child under sixteen years of age wholly maintained by the taxpayer. It is now proposed by this amendment to increase the deduction in respect of each child from Â£ 2 6 to Â£ 5 0 , and to raise the age from sixteen years to eighteen years. I am informed that the result of the amendment would be to increase these deductions from taxable income to the extent of about Â£12,000,000, and, taking the average rate of taxation at ls. 6d., this would mean a loss of revenue amounting to Â£500,000. But there is also the proposal to eliminate the words "" w h o l l y maintained by him , "" so that the deduction would apply to all children of eighteen instead of to those "" w h o l l y maintained "" by the taxpayer. That would mean a still further loss of revenue. The Oommittee is asked to agree to remit taxat i o n to the extent of Â£500,000.",65
167,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,In addition to the amount now remitted in respect of the allowance of Â£ 2 6 per child ?,66
168,Mr GROOM,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,I am so informed by the Treasury officials. I would remind honourable members that the deduction is not limited to any one section of the communityI t applies to the rich as well as to the poor.,66
169,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,And of revenue would bave to be made good by an increased land taxThat is what the supporters of this amendment want.,66
170,Mr GROOM,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Yes . This loss of revenue would have to be made good by other forms of taxation, since the Treasurer must make ends meet. Honourable members are asking for an increase of the old-age pension, increased grants for repatriation, and additional assistance to soldiers, and the money for all these purposes must be found. The Acting Trea ment this afternoon showed how lightly our taxation is falling relatively upon the industrial classes of Australia.",66
171,Mr JOWETT,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,Excep t in the case of those with families.,66
172,Mr GROOM,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,Libera l deductions are allowed in respect of such .taxpayers. The honourable member is asking for this concession for the rich as well as the poor.,66
173,Mr JOWETT,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,For all who have children.,66
174,Mr GROOM,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Quite so. In the circumstances the Acting Treasurer cannot see his way to accept this amendment. We are all anxious that our taxation s'hould be as light as possible, but money must be found for the various purposes set fort h in the Budget statement. I therefore ask the honourable member not to press his amendment. Finally, on the point of order, I submit that this is really an attempt to amend a section in the Income Tax Assessment Act, and that the amendment is not relevant to the Bill .",66
175,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL," Havin g examined the Bill I have come to the conclusion that the amendment is quite in order. The Bill seeks to impose taxation upon incomes, and it necessarily follows that exemptions may be moved in it . The honourable member for Grampians (Mr . Jowett) bas moved the insertion of an exemption, and I think that his amendment is quite in order.  no desire to steal the thunder of the honourable member for Grampians, but I had intimated my intention to move an amendment upon somewhat similar lines to those on which he has moved. My proposal, however, was not as liberal as is hia, and that is one reason why I gave the loss way to him. Another reason was that I desired, if possible, to get another vote from the other side of the chamber to assist in securing a larger exemption in the case of fathers with big families. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) has pointed out that, if the amendment be carried, the loss of revenue that will ' be involved will have to be made up in some other way. The present Government, I would remind him, are noted for raising revenue from children. Only last year they imposed a tax of 33Jf per cent, upon children's tickets for entertainments throughout the Commonwealth.",66
176,Mr LAIRD SMITH,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"A land tax would be much higher.  extra taxation on the land. In his closing remarks this afternoon, the Acting Treasurer statedWe faced four years of terrible war with courage, and the virility of our population was made perfectly clear by hundreds of thousands of Australians upon the battle fronts. The truth expressed in that sentence was also a factor in inducing me to bring this matter forward. What better asset could we have than 200,000 young. Australians ? Would, it not be better to have an additional 200,000 young Australians than 200,000 imported men in this country? We cannot do enough for the men and women in our midst who are rearing large families. The tendency today is for people to have small families, and very small ones at that. But nobody can accuse you, sir, of practising that doctrine. Every working man and woman in Australia today knows the trouble which is involved, not merely in feeding and clothing, but also in maintaining and educating a large family. There are many persons in my constituency with families of thirteen, fourteen, and even fifteen children. When one has to buy only two pairs of boots, he knows what the expense means, but when one has to buy fifteen pairs he cannot fail to recognise that some exemption from taxation should be granted, and that something should be done to relieve the pains and penalties to which parents with families numbering more than three are subjected. In the Arbitration Court only the other day, Mr Justice Powers laid it down that - there should be a living wage of over Â£3 per week in the case of a family of three. Fancy having thirteen' mouths to feed with oatmeal at l i d . per lb.! I appeal to honourable members opposite, who are flag-waggers and. professed patriots, to show their patriotism by lightening the load upon these men and women, who are bearing the heat and burden of the day. It is a most peculiar thing, but it is an economic fact, that the poorer the people the larger are the families that they bave.",66
177,Mr EATJYINER,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"That used to be the case.  in Western Queensland. There they have not learned the tricks of Melbourne and Sydney, though perhaps in time, i something be not done to help them, may emulatethe example of the inhave habitants of our cities, and' say, "" the boss beget his own wage-earners. are not going to beget them for him."" them. The Government should d6 everything - possible to encourage the birth Tate. no use beating about the bush. We must call a spade a spade, not a scientific plement for moving the soil. These are the facts that we are up against. Even if the amendment would involve taxation in another direction; it behoves every one to assist the men and women of this country who are rearing large families. It is idle for the Minister for Works and Railways to say that, if we adopt the proposal of the honourable member for Grampians, we shall have to make up the revenue which we shall lose by some other means. According to the Budget presented by the Acting Treasurer this afternoon, the Government propose to remit the entertainments tax in the case of children, although we were told last year that any such action would mean a loss of revenue amounting to Â£200,000 or Â£300,000. Notwithstanding this dismal prophesy, however, the revenue during the past twelve months has been most buoyant. A general election is looming in the near future and the Government are consequently about to introduce a Bill to modify the entertainments tax. and to increase the old-age pension. Mr Webster.T-Does the honorabl'e member oppose that, increase? ral will put. that question upon the notice-paper, I will answer him as he answersme. He must' think that I am a young bird to be caught with chaff. I will tell himall about it when I . go into his electorate. Very nearly every honourable member opposite is a family man, and knows whatit is to maintain a family. I am not in a similar position, because I have reared my family, and there is no possible hope of me starting again. I am too old. I am like the Chairman- I am not looking for marriage now, but for a comfortable place in which to sit. But, if honourable members opposite believe what the Treasurer has said about the virility of the Australian nation, they will most certainly vote for the amendment.

Therefore I - estimate .that the - amendment involves a - revenue loss of Â£750,000 per annum, which is equivalent a 30 per cent, increase in the laud tax. The revenue thus lost would require to I ask - per honourable members to compare the income taxation in Australia - with that in loss Great Britain.

In Great Britain , the rate is 2s. 3d. in the Â£ 1 in each case. There is no country that I know of in the world Â£ 1 today where taxation is easier than in the Commonwealth. If the suggested alteration were made it ought to be in Bill , and, in any case, it means loss of Â£750,000 in revenue. Of this to fact I am assured by the departmental who have gone into the matter. moneMoreover, the exemption applies now only life to children to the age of sixteen years, it is proposed to extend it to those of the eighteen.

185,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"That estimate is - based on every child in the country, but this exemption applies only to the children of taxpayers.",68

188,Mr GROOM,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"What I said was that, on the 1916-17 assessment, the reduction of taxable incoine is Â£5,756,000, and that if the amendment were carried that would be increased to something like Â£12,000,000.",69
189,Mr CHARLTON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"But the honourable gentleman went further, and said it would mean a, loss of revenue of Â£5,000.000.",69
190,Mr GROOM,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"No , I said it would mean a loss of Â£500,000; but the Acting Treasurer now tells us that it will mean a loss of Â£750,000.",69
191,Mr CHARLTON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I thought that the Attorney-General insisted' that the amendment would mean a loss of Â£5,000,000 in revenue. However, my figures agree with those which have just been given by the Acting Treasurer (Mr . Poynton). I worked the figures out, and made the. difference Â£ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0; but, even if that be so, it is revenue that we should be prepared to give up without hesitation, because it is derived from people who, generally speaking, are unable to pay it . Those who have large families in this country are, on the whole,' working people.",69
192,Mr GREGORY,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,How would you make the revenue up ?.,69
193,Mr CHARLTON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"B y imposing a higher tax on those who are possessed of wealth over a certain sum; I would increase the incidence of taxation on them. The amendment, if adopted, would encourage people to have families; and if Australia is to be the country that it should be, we must have population. It is undoubted that we cannot have population if the people are on the brink of starvation all the time; and that is what we are finding today. The Acting Treasurer said that it was on the average rate of ls. 6d. in the Â£ 1 that he arrived at Â£750,000; but The that, to my mind, is a wrong conclusion. The working people, who have the large families, have incomes of less than Â£500, and the rate on such incomes is 4 | d . , and - I not Is6d. To arrive at a proper conclusion we must know what percentage of the people who will gain by the exemption earn less than Â£500 per annum, and then a higher rate could be charged on higher incomes. If that were done the loss would be not Â£750,000, but, I venture, to say, not half that amount, and this could be made up by increasing the incidence of taxation on salaries over Â£ 5 0 0 . Just contrast what this Bill seeks to do with what is being attempted in New South Wales. There an inquiry into the cost of living was held, and it was found that a man and wife with two children, in order to live in decent comfort, must spend Â£ 3 17s. 6d. per week. The Acting Treasurer said just now that under the Act as it is today, with an exemption of Â£26, a man and wife and two children are exempted up to Â£ 2 0 8 ; but on the New South Wales figures we see that it requires Â£ 2 0 1 10s. to keep a family of that size. The New South Wales Government have already announced their intention to pay the mother of every child over the number of two so much per week; but here we are proposing to tax such parents. The policy of < New South Wales has been adopted after full in quiry into the cost of living-indeed , the State Government allows Â£ 5 0 for each child today, and there is a Â£ 2 50 exemption.",69
194,Mr GREGORY,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,What about the single man? Would you increase his taxation?,69
195,Mr CHARLTON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I would not. A working man should not be taxed unless he makes over Â£ 2 5 0 per annum. With an exemption of that kind people are encouraged to marry, because they feel that the wolf will not be continually at the door. We ought not to extort the last farthing, as it were, from the workers in this country, but should realise the necessity, of placing the load on the shoulders best able to bear it . If people can add to their banking accounts in spite of the cost of living, they can bear more taxation; and the amendment is one which should commend itself to honourable members and to the Government- It is a paltry view that, because there may be a loss of Â£200,000 or Â£300,000, parents with large families should be taxed. ' That, I am sure, was never contemplated - when this special taxation was imposed for war purposes. We intended that the people who were making the wealth should pay the taxation, but now it appears that it is to come from the poorer people, who have to toil week in and week out in order to keep the wolf from the door, thus making their case much harder.",69
196,Mr WEST,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"The returned soldier and his f a m i l y will have to pay it . Mr CHAELTON "" - I shall move an amendment later to deal with the returned soldiers, who will not be compelled to pay if my voice and vote can stop it . The honourable member for Grampians is doing good service in moving this amendment, and I hope the Committee will see the wisdom of accepting it , in justice to all those people who have families in this country.  always held that some consideration should be given, so far as taxation is concerned, to married people and their families. On l o t h May, 1918, I moved a similar amendment, and pointed out that, owing to the great increase in the cost of living, something should be done to relieve parents of families from the heavy burden of income tax. ' much greater reason now to support this amendment, seeing that since then the cost of living has increased by at least another 10 per cent. We are not asking, as some honourable' members seem to imagine, that parents .of families shall be exempted from income tax to the extent of Â£50'. We are dealing only with the taxable amount of income. At present, an exemption of Â£26 is allowed for each child, and we ask merely that that exemption shall be increased to Â£ 5 0 , or an increase of . Â£ 2 4 . Assuming for a moment that the average tax is 'as the Minister stated it to be, that is, l s . 6d. in the Â£ 1 , we, are simply asking for a decrease in taxation of 36s. per year. It is not much to ask the Government to give a man with a family of seven or eight children that small concession. I . have gone into the Minister's figures. He was perfectly right in giving the total exemption of income as about Â£5,500,000. Assuming an average tax of ls. 6d. in the Â£ 1 , this means a total remission of taxation of about Â£412,500. The exemption we are asking for will not amount to ,so much.",70
197,Mr GROOM,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"You are basing your figures on the age of sixteen years. The Acting Treasurer based his estimate on the increase of the age to eighteen years, and the striking out of the words "" wholly maintained.""   revenue by this amendment would be Â£750,000. In May, 1918, I gave notice of my amendment, and the Treasurer (Mr W at t ) knew of it for full y two days before it was moved. He had all the facts and figures before him, and they were not "" h u r r i e d l y brought up,"" as the Acting Treasurer says they have been on this occasion.

198,Mr GROOM,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"On what age was that based?  and an increase of Â£24 in the exemption, just as is now proposed. The honourable member for Balaclava was then Treasurer. The honourable member for Grey is now Acting Treasurer. The Treasurer then said, after working the figures out I have carefully, that the amendment, would make a difference of Â£400,000 to the revenue, while the Acting Treasurer now says it will make a difference of Â£750,000, but that he has had to get his figures together hurriedly. I would rather accept the Treasurer's figures as correct.",70
199,Mr CHARLTON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"The estimate is based on an average of ls. 6d. in the Â£ 1 , which does not obtain at all.  on that occasion wereIf that allowance be increased by 100 per cent., as is proposed by this amendment, I am assured by the Commissioner for Taxation that it will probably mean a minimum loss of Â£400,000. The Treasurer, therefore, had consulted the Commissioner for Taxation, and his estimate is more likely to be correct than the one now before us.",70
200,Mr GROOM,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"The Acting Treasurer has worked the figures out carefully, and his advisers are satisfied that the amendment will make a difference of Â£750,000 to the revenue if the allowance is in creased to Â£50, the age raised from sixteen to eighteeu, and the words "" wholly maintained "" left out.  practically the same last year, because 1 proposed that the age should.be increased to eighteen. We have.all the more reason to ask the Government to agree to increase this exemption, because, when my proposal was before the House, the Customs duties returned about Â£12,000,000. To-day they are returning Â£17,500,000. '.The Government .have there an increased revenue of Â£5,600,000.  apply to everybody, or only to .people with incomes of under Â£500 a year?  - sacred duty of the Government to look after all the children, and encourage them in every way they can.

Wle have .paid .hundreds of thousands of pounds in the past to bring immigrants here, but what better immigrant could we wish for than the little Australian child in the Australian cradle? are the immigrants we want, and it is the people with children that I desire to assist. Many .people-with incomes of Â£400 or Â£500 have the - very laudable desire to p ut their children through the secondary schools and the universi y. As those young people grow up, they cost as much to clothe and feed as an adult, and, perhaps, a little more. All the time they are at their studies, their parents have to maintain them, because they are earning nothing: Every consideration, therefore, should be given to parents in those circumstances. The Acting Treasurer has quoted the case of Great B r it a in . The cost of livin g there has gone up by 110 per cent., according to cables which I read in the Sydney press the other day relating to the recent railway strike.",70
201,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"The increase is much more than that. There is a prothe vision in the settlement that certain things are to be done when the increase the cost of livin g comes down to 110 cent.  cellor of the Exchequer has given people in the United Kingdom an increase in the exemption from taxation to the extent of 150 per cent. The cost of livin in Australia has gone up by about 50 per ture also? cent., and we ought to increase the allowance for children, at least, to cover rise, so that parents of families may not - be in a worse iposition than - they were before the war. New South Wales allows an exemption of Â£50 per child under the age of eighteen years, and grants also to married people an exemption of Â£250 ibefore they are taxed at all. We have an exemption of Â£156, .andian allowance of only Â£26 per child under the age of:sixteen years. O.ur Government should, at all events, come into .line with that of New South Wales.",71

205,Mr CORBOY,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I quite realise that; but, despite the arguments of Ministers, I consider it necessary to increase the exemption in respect of children. We have been told by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) that it is necessary to secure money from some source for the payment or old-age pensions, and to meet the requirements of the repatriation of our soldiers. The honourable gentleman practically says that the Government intend to get this money at the expense of the people in Australia who are trying to rear large families. I am satisfied that our soldiers would be the last to desire to receive money at the exrjense of such people. The present exemption of Â£ 2 6 for each child under the age of sixteen years is an exemption of 10s. per week, but honourable members will agree that that amount is not nearly suflicient to cover the cost of the maintenance of a child today.",72

I put the reverse of that statement, and it clearly is that the parents of large families in Australia are at the present time being taxed upon Â£6,000,000, which pro-perly should carry no taxation at all. It is unjust to impose taxation upon that money, which should be.left free of taxation to be expended for the benefit of the children. We are assured that money required by the Government will have to be raised, but honourable members will agree that there should be some better way of raising it than at the expense of the coming manhood and womanhood of Australia. Mr MATHEWS. - This is not one of the "" has beens."" This is a chap with hopes.",72
208,Mr CORBOY,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I should like to remind myhonorable friend, who is one of the "" has beens,"" that I am trying to do what', perhaps, 'with the 6ame opportunity, he would have done in hie youth, and that' is to pave the way before I start, and have good prospects. We heard a good deal recently, and during the period of the war, of thewonderful physical vigour, the bravery, aud astonishing strength in battle of the Australians, the glorious ANZACs. We were told what a fine race physically the Australians proved themselves to be on the field of battle. I say that we should do everything possible to maintain the splendid physical standard which our soldiers have set the world, and one of the best ways in which to do that is to leave people rearing large families as much money as possible to properly clothe and feed them.",72
209,Mr GREGORY,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Dampier) [ 9 . 2 2 ] - I have been somewhat surprised at this debate, because it discloses an apparent irresponsibility on the part of honourable members in dealing with the finances of the country. I was surprised that such au amendment was received. Had I thought it was permissible to amend this Bill in such a manner, I - should have1 1 asked' for some review of the anomalies which are possible under the present In come Tax Assessment Act . I know of cases-of persons-who-have been compelled by heavy taxation on book profits to borrow money to pay that taxation. It would be wise if the Government, when dealing with the Income Tax Assessment. Act, introduced some provision permittingpeople to pay income tax on their average incoine. It is monstrous to think that men may be compelled to go heavily into debt to enable them to pay income tax or war-time profits tax when probably in the next year they may lose, through drought, fire, or flood, every b it of the assets on which their taxation was based. As the amendment has been accepted by the CEair, we must discuss it . In the last three or four years there has been a demand made by members of this House to discuss the financial position of Australia. We cannot do that in dealing with a Bill of thiskind, but honourable members cannot help realizing the enormous financial obligations which are imposed upou this country, and the demand made upon the public puree. Undoubtedly, there has been a good deal of extravagance, but I am satisfied that many honourable members will do their best to prevent such extravagance in the future. At the present time, we are making special demands on the Treasury in connection with our returned soldiers, and even in the Budget statement, we find that the Government have contracted for nearly Â£500,000 extra for old-age pensions. In connection with housing returned soldiers and repatriation work generally, nothing less than Â£100,000,000 will be required. It will be a very heavy impost upon the people. Again, there are incessant demands for more consideration for the requirements of people in country districts. Day after day we are told by the Postmaster-General that the Government call upon him to economize, and, although a letter can be sent to any person in the city for lÂ£d., it cannot be sent to many people in the outlying parts of Australia unless they specially contribute to the cost of getting their mails. We know that the Treasurer cannot afford to lose a Tevenue of Â£500,000, let alone the Â£750,000 which it is estimated will be lost if the amendment be agreed to. The proposition is not a fair one. Every person who is entitled to vote for a member of this House should be compelled to pay income tax in some proportion. It would make him exercise more care in the election of his parliamentary representatives, and pay more regard to the manner in which public funds are expended. The honourable member for  deal to say about this amendment; but when his party were in power they did not bring forward a proposal of this description. Evidently there was in those days more responsibility on their part in regard to public expenditure. We cannot evade the distinct promises we have made in connection with the repatriation of our soldiers and the housing scheme propounded by Senator Millen. No such scheme has been put forward in any other part of the world. It is a magnificent project, but we must pay for it ; and surely those who stayed behind should be called upon to pay a small contribution towards the cost. A man with two children and an income of Â£208 is not called upon to pay income tax; a man with .four children and an income of Â£260 is likewise exempt; and a man with six children and an income of Â£312 is exempt.",72

214,Mr GREGORY,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"That is true. There is too much pandering to the cities. At any rate, we are pledged to this big expenditure, and all persons in the community should contribute to it. This amendment is to be followed by another to exempt those who fought at the Front. I have a great deal of sympathy with those who fought at the Front, but I have no sympathy for the men who stayed behind. Although I know I am doing an unpopular thing, I must oppose the amendment of the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), and-express the hope that the Committee will not agree to it. I am always making demands on the Treasury to improve the conditions of people who settle in the bush, to enable them to get their produce to market, and to provide them with mail services and telephones, so that they may have some of the advantages of civilization; but I have not been able to get my requests acceded to. The Government say that they have not the necessary funds. This being the case, and in view of the fact that enormous demands must be made on the. Treasury to keep the promises to our returned soldiers, I hope honourable members will give the matter very serious consideration before agreeing to any proposal which has for its purpose the reduction of the funds which will be at the disposal of the Treasurer.",73
215,Dr MALONEY,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Melbourne) [9.33] Whenever the question of children is raised, there flashes across my mind statement of the great Napoleon, when in his Code he prevented any child from being disinherited by its parents. Briefly it was t h is - "" No child asks to come into the world. No child can come into the world unless the pence parents meet. Every child is future unit of the State, with a right that neither parent nor State should deyear prive it of ; and that is the prima l right and chance of growing up to be a healthy adult."" No one will gainsay the that the Australian babe is our best imaremigrant, or deny to it the right to grow up to be a healthy adult; but, under our unfortunate laws, when men and women follow the call of nature and obey their God-implanted passions, they find that the more children they have, the harder is their fight. In the constituency of Melbourne there was a woman who was the mother of thirty-three children. The father earned Â£ 2 15s. a week, and I endeavoured to the Premier to give him employment Â£ 3 10s. a week, but I was not successful. Is it any wonder that more than half such children die from lack of proper shelter, and clothing ? Out of .those thirty-three children only thirteen surparticulars vived. If we go through the annals vital statistics, we find that wherties. ever the people are living near to the poverty line tine death rate proportionately increases. I value the figures given the Acting Treasurer, especially when realise that they have been prepared by expert officers; but I remind honourable members that no one can arrive at his incoine tax without the aid of a ready reckoner. My experience in connection with the Department is that the officials are always ready to amend any wrong is that may have been done. The calculation of the loss of revenue would be caused by the amendment was than in rent. Â£500,000; that was altered to Â£750,000. I questioned the Acting Treasurer, he courteously informed me that the calculation was based upon a rate of ls. 6d. in the Â£ 1 . I want honormately, able members to realise that 18.2d. rates totalled Â£ 7 5 a year. is charged only on incomes of Â£899 10s. and Â£900 10s. The average income is below that. Abraham Lincoln said, "" God must love the common people be- 'taxed municipality in the world. cause he made so many of them."" How the many of them receive Â£900 a year? The rate of Is. 6d. in the Â£ 1 does not apply to incomes of Â£5 or Â£6 a week; the calculations should have been made on a far lower average because our tax commences at about three pence, and goes up to 60 in the Â£ 1 . The Acting Treasurer  peruse his figures*. An income of Â£100 a is taxed at 5.5 per cent in Australia, - whereas in England the tax is 2s. 3d. in the Â£1. I would like the Minister to have fact continued quoting his figures. They Australia. England. d. d.

It was not through any desire to hide those details, and I hope the Min isted w-11 see his way clear to have the figures published in Hansard. The municipal taxation in England is 100 per cent, higher than in Australia. The municipal taxation in the City of Melbourne ls. 3d. in the Â£ 1 . But in a house in first which I lived in London, my landthat lady had to pay more in taxes Her rent was Â£50 a year, but her taxes amounted to and Â£52 a year.

Compared with those rates, Melbourne is the lowestMr. Fisher promised, and repeated it after the .declaration of war, that tliere would be - a child pension; we must be prepared to face that. The deluge of murder men call war has changed the system of finance. Every man and woman in England now has a vote. When I was in England, and even up to the period of the war, men in England, Ireland, and Scotland had not the right to vote by reason of their manhood, but only if rented or owned property. recognised that kings and rich people cannot win wars. Wars are won by human beings. Many of the rich people of England and of Australia are grateful to those who gave their lives in their cause. Sixty thousand Australians all they had to offer. Have 60,000 men of wealth in our community their money, or even half of their wealth, to the Government, free of I believe a present of Â£50,000 has been made to the Government, and I would like to see the donors honoured by having their names placed on an honour roll in this Parliament. If we go back to the Napoleonic wars and remember what Pitt took, in the way of taxation, from those who possessed wealth, we must that what is being taken now is a mere bagatelle. When .the honourable for Dampier (Mr Gregory) was speaking I interjected that we had not yet touched, in the way of taxation, the first penny:of the last shilling, and I do not think it likely that we shall. .JSut one of the .keenest .intellects that . England ever produced - suggested a way. We have only - to go-back to the time of William the Conqueror and the Domesday Booh, in which - was shown the name of every owner of property, together Will its valuation. - institutionof this system would help to - solve our problems, for if a owner felt that the valuation of his land for taxation purposes was unfair, could have it re-valued, providing could be purchased at such valuation by the State upon payment, of a certain percentage for The value of the property been fixed in a Domesday further increase in value should accrue to the State. In this way we would be able to get rid of our terrible debt of Â£400,000,000. Before the war the wealth of Australia was estimated Â£1,200,000,000, and during the war it increased by Â£400,000,000, making the total Dr Maloney. Â£1,600,000,000. In view of this increase, is it a wild dream to imagine that,- with in that the next ten years, having in mind the remarkable productive capacity of the Commonwealth, there w i ll . be a further increase of over Â£400,000,000, sufficient to cover every penny of our war debt, which has been forced upon us by German brutality? This debt will bave to be they paid. I shall never favour repudiation. Nations have But we must find a way to meet it . If the Government do not accept the amendment they must face the responsibility when they go before the electors. The Repatriation Department has also set a country's bad example in respect of its disregard of gave the claims of children. I honour Senator Guthrie for pointing out to Senaoffered all tor Mille n that the Repatriation Department was not making any. allowance for interest? a soldier's f if t h , sixth, or seventh, or eighth child. How often have I asked honourable members opposite how they would like to have any child of theirs brought up on 3s. 6d. a week, the amount allowed by the Repatriation 'Department in respect of soldiers' dependants. I honour the women of this country who are realise endeavouring to rear families, for every time a woman bears a child she risks her member life. I am not questioning the figures quoted by the Acting Treasurer (Mr . Poynton) , based upon Is. 6d. in the Â£ 1 , but honourable members must know that the majority of the people receive less than Â£500 a, year, and it is for these people.that I am pleading. Some of them are not getting even Â£2 a week. I know that as soon as the whip cracks. Government supporters will rally andÂ»vote - for .the Bill . In the same way they voted The to increase the amusement tax, which was an infamy.

It was recognised that they could afford to pay close on half-a-million sterling without much trouble.

Thus, before being called upon to pay any amount of taxation at all, he must have an income of Â£286! many working men are earning incomes of Â£286 ? I wish that very many more were doing so. What is the good of trying to fool the working man? The honourable meinber for Grampians (Mr . Jowett) now proposes that the exemption for each child shall be Â£ 5 0 . A man having five children would be able to claim in respect of them, an exemption amounting to Â£250, and would enjoy, in addition, the original exemption of Â£ 1 5 6 ; so that"" lie .would require to earn an income of Â£406 per annum' before being called upon to pay anything by way of taxation.

I desire to see the working man relieved to the greatest possible extent from the burden of taxation. That can only be done, however, by taxing the in - man. withi an income of Â£406 per annum. It is r i g h t . that he should pay. I . hope that the honourable member for Grampians realizes the logical outcome of his proposition. The man on. the land will have to pay a little more taxation.

How many honourable members have been to college? How many of them have had more than a third-class or fourth-class education ? The men who have made good here certainly did not attend college up to the age of eighteen. It would have been a good thing for many young fellows if they had never been sent to college.

They will probably go on the public platform and say of us, "" Look at these men who VGted to tax the poor working man with his starving - children in his fireless home."" And there they will stop. They will not go qn to say that, under this amendment, '.'the poor working m a n "" with a family of five children would have to be in receipt of an income of Â£406 per annum before he would be liable to pay income tax.

If the mover of this amendment can secure sufficient support to a proposal to shift taxation of this kind to the land I shall be with him ; but I am not going to j o in in any effort to reduce the revenue of the Commonwealth in our present financial circumstances. It is our duty to maintain the credit of the country and to provide for payment of interest on our enormous public debt.",77
227,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Brisbane) [10.10]. At that ;-The arguments submitted by honourable members opposite who oppose this amendment seem to follow two lines. Com- They suggest, first of all, that the ability of the Government to re-adjust ""systems of taxation is so limited, and their : capacity to finance the affairs of the Commonwealth so feeble, that if this particular source of revenue is lost to us we shall be undone. I refuse to believe that the financial affairs of Australia are going to be thrown into chaos merely because we choose to allow an increased exemption from income tax to the fathers and mothers of families. It is, after all, merely a inatter of re-adjusting the system of taxation. According to all the laws of life, a Government, like an individual, deserves to live only to the extent that it can adjust it3elf to its changing environment. If this Parliament chooses to say that the system of collecting revenue and the expenditure of public money shall follow lines different from tliose proposed by the Government, it is the business of the Government either to accept that decision, and give effect to it , or to make way for some other party that will do so. I , therefore, think that the argument that the Treasurer will be placed in a hopeless position if we deprive him of this small source of revenue is futile. It is particularly weak in view fact that the Treasurer himself feels so confident regarding the financial position that he proposes toÂ« remit' part of the entertainments tax and to increase the old-age pensions. On the one hand he proposes a decrease of revenue and on the other an increase of expenditure, so that the financial position cannot be so very hopeless. Is it to be said that these two proposals are made because they will be very useful during the election campaign?",77
228,Mr BOYD,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,What an awful suggestion.,78
229,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"The question is quite a propos, because those who have spoken from the Government side in opposition to the amendment have declared it to bo an electioneering proposal.",78
230,Mr BOYD,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,Is that not said of every measure introduced shortly before a general election?,78
231,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,No doubt it is. Honourable members opposite who urge that this is merely an electioneering proposal forget that they are open to a similar charge if we choose to discuss the question on that basis..,78
232,Mr JOWETT,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"We brought forward a similar amendment in May, 1918.",78
233,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Exactly. In May, 1918, before there was any thought of a general election, this very proposal received my support, and was advocated in this House by those who are supporting it to-night. It is no new thing. The Labour party have beenf o r years asking for an increase in the old-age pensions. It has come at last. I am sorry it is only 2s. 6d.; I wish it were 5s. We have been asking also for a reduction of the entertainments tax. It has come now. I regret that 6d. tickets are.still to be liable to the tax. Mr OHARI.TON - The people w i ll be desiring an election every few months if in anticipation of one they are to secure concessions of this kind.",78
234,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Yes ; if they are to bring about such reforms, then the more frequently we have them the better. 1 approach this question, however, from a more solid stand-point. We have to ask ourselves is it right to make this increased exemption? Will it enable the people to combat the position they are in today? If it is right, then we should take action of the at once, regardless of whether or not there is an impending general election. If it is not right, then it should not be made now or at any other time. Let us discuss it from that point of view. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) sought to establish the argument that because a Labour Government some six years ago had ' an overflowing Treasury and did not provide for such an exemption, those of us' who belonged to the Labour party are in consistent in supporting this amendment today. He overlooks the salient fact that the cost of living and other circumstances are entirely different from what they were six years ago. The honourable member for Denison (Mr L a i r d S m it h ) , who was then a member of the Oflicial Labour party, would have enthusiastically supported such a proposal had it been then made. If he thinks that the Labour party sbould have presented the proposal then, there is a very strong reason why he should support it now, because of the very much more difficult circumstances of the people who will be affected by it .",78

239,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"If I were in the Treasurer's place, I would announce m y policy straight way. When the honor quoted with such approval the closing remarks of the Acting Treasurer's Budget this afternoon I thought that he might very properly have cited the final sentences of the honourable gentleman's speech. The Treasurer saidlooking into the future, I see countless flocks and herds, ripening grain covering many landscapes, mines and factories without number, and fleets of great ships carrying produce to the nations. I sec, too, multitudes of people, happy, rejoicing in liberty, and accomplished in all the arts which mark a highly civilized nation. The closing sentence of the Budget is the necessary concomitant of the previous one> because all the beautiful vistas which open before the Acting Treasurercan be realized onl y through the efforts of multitudes of people. All our possibilities of development' are quite impossible in the absence of population. I approach this question, therefore, from the standpoint of whether the proposed exemption will assist us to develop a larger population,', or even to attract population from overseas. There is no doubt that if we could proclaim to other countries that in Australia there is a recognition of the services rendered by the parents of large families, who receive an exemption of Â£50 j n respect of each child, it would be a big factor in encouraging immigration. While this debate has been in progress I have taken the trouble to extract a few figures from the papers presented by the Treasurer today, and also from the latest Tear-Booh of Australia, No. 11, compiled by the Commonwealth Statistician. From these official sources I have obtained the following table:Year. Population. Marriages. Births. 1913.. 4,872,059. 41,594 135,714 1914.. 4,940,952 43,311 137,983 1915.. 4,931,988 45,224 134,871 1916.. 4,875,325 40,289 131,426 1917.. 4,935,311 33,600 129,965 1918.. 5,030,479 33,141 125,739 1919.. 5,281,000 The foregoing figures show that, population h.ae increased very there has been a sad and' serious decrease in the marriages and births. Mr Finlayson. the objection that, during the war, it was inevitable that marriages and births would be affected to a very considerable extent. But I find that, during the past ten years, there has been a gradual declension in the marriages in proportion to population, and what is still worse, in the b i r t h rate of this country. The decline of the birth rate is not peculiar to Australia- - unfor tunately it is world-wide.",78

241,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I believe that that is so. But whatever may be the cause of it , it is a matter of the gravest possible concern. Mri. BOYD - Does i the honourable member think that the adoption of the amendment would lead to an increase in the birth rate?",79
242,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I support the amendment, because I honestly believe that every assistance we can give, in the way of relief from taxation, to large families, will mark the removal of one barrier to an increase in the birth rate.",79
243,Mr BOYD,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,Does the honourable member think that a man who is going to be married takes into consideration whether he will receive an exemptionfro m taxation on account of his children?,79
244,Mr FINLAYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I believe that the question does not enter into his mind when he is first married. But after a few years of married life, it becomes a matter of immediate concern to him . To-day, the question is freely and frankl y discussed whether, under the conditions of life which obtain, with the continual worry and care to which people are subjected, it is not a riglit thing Birth to deliberately commit race suicide.

Because I believe that we should adopt any and whilst every pretext, specific, and inducement slowly, that can be offered to the people to increase population, I am prepared to support the I anticipate amendment.",79
245,Mr MATHEWS,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,The honourable member must admit that the fact of a large number of young men being at the war has contributed to the decrease of the birth rate.,80
246,Mr FINX AYSON,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"It is inevitable that the ordinary domestic affairs of a country shall be seriously and sadly disturbed while a war is in progress. But, apart from the war period, what I have stated is too obvious and too common to pass unnoticed. If the vista conjured up by  regard to the future development of this country-it s fleets of ships, its great areas of wheat waving in the sunshine, and so forth-is to be realized, it is our duty to utilize whatever ways and means are at our disposal to encourage an increase in the population. And if the exemption proposed under this Bill will assist in .any degree to that end, we shall do well to support it. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) has referred to our huge load of debt^Â£707,000,000 to be repaid by 5,000,000 people. The burden is altogether too great. quote again what the Acting Treasurer said in the concluding paragraph of his Budget speechThe greatest war the world ever saw has left the nations with staggering debts, disturbed finances, and labour-unrest. That, it - seems to me, is all that Australia or any other country has got - out of the >war. Mr ""RICHARD FOSTER - I do not agree with the honourable member. There is no person - with British blood in him that ought not to be ashamed to 'make that Statement.  possibility there is for ns, with our limited population, to develop the great production that is necessary in order to help us to pay our way and meet our financial obligations. If we had not un-bounded faith in the virility of the Australian people, and the potentialities of our country, we might well be appalled by the problem before us. The question we have to consider, in the distribution of the burdens we have to carry, is how we can adjust our systems of taxation and the work of the country as to make the burden easier for those who are weak, and harder ""for those who are strong. There is an old saying that ""the rich will have to be a bit poorer, that the poor may be a bit richer."" The sooner that change comes in this and every other country, the better it will be for all. Certainly we can never hope to meet our great interest bill, and carry on the development of this country as we desire, unless we can bring to our aid some statesmanlike proposals which will encourage the natural increase of population and attract others to our shores in such numbers as will give us a people who will put their heart and soul and muscle into the work of development, and who will help Australia to bear its burdens manfully and courageously. I have no fear as to the future of Australia. I believe that the Commonwealth will emerge from its troubles more easily than will most countries of the world. But in the internal industrial relations of our country we should seek to put the burdens on the backs of those who are most able to bear tbem, and ease them off to the fullest possible extent from the shoulders of the weak. There are people who can bear May I more taxation than they are carrying now. Let us lift the burdens from the people who are having a struggle every day to make ends meet, and place them upon those people whose life is a perpetual round of pleasure, and whose main trouble is to fill in time. When the honourable member for .Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) was referring to the prices of ifootwear, the honourable member .for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) interjected that we need - not worry .about, people who can afford to pay ten guineas for shoes. I agree with him that those people do not deserve consideration and sympathy. Let us, then, put the burdens of taxation on those who can afford all the luxuries and enjoyments of life, in such measure as will enable us to relieve of taxation those less fortunate folk whose load is already so heavy to bear.",80
247,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Wakefield) [10.32] - I bave listened carefully to the debate, at times with a great deal of pain. There have been two phases of the argument-the first expediency and popularity, and the second, principle. There has been little of the latter. By interjection, I disapproved of a statement by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) that the only thing Australia got out of this war was a staggering debt. We got out of the war something more precious than the cost-and the cost has been great in blood and treasure. These staggering burdens we have to shoulder; we must be true to the men who won for this country freedom. We should aim to uphold the standard they raised, and be as true and devoted in sacrifice and service as they were, in order to shoulder our burdens and discharge our obligations. We cannot better honour them than by following in their footsteps. As members of Parliament we receive Â£600 per annum from the taxpayers, not to do the popular thing, but to do the right thing; not to play to the gallery, but to conserve the best interests of the country and be honest in the discharge of our responsibilities. The first principle of perience. honesty is to face our obligations, and try to pay our debts. I know very well that it would be a popular thing to exempt every child, particularly of the poor, means a fool. even to the limit that has been mentioned today; but we have to be just before we talk about being generous. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) has done nobly, like a brave man, in following the dictates of his conscience and in giving utterance to what are unpopular sentiments in crowded city areas such as he represents. It has been stated and admitted that the generosity of this Parliament in the concession made twelve months ago is equal to, if not greater than, any suggested or submitted by any Labour Government in the Commonwealth of Australia. I have no doubt that many honourable members would like to double that generosity i were in the position to do so; but the orable member for Brisbane, while saying that our burdens are almost beyond our resources, at the same time suggests making further concessions, and leaving the finances of this country still more on the wrong side of the ledger. I remind honourable members, and ticularly those on this side, of their per duty in regard to the Governheard ment's financial proposals. In the Budget which has just been delivered, there are many things with which I disdo agree, and at the proper time. I sball give utterance to my disagreement; but, so far as this particular question is concerned, I say to the honourable member for Gramtion. Mr Richard Foster. pians (Mr Jowett) that he, sitting behind and a follower of the Government, ought to recognise his duty in this regard. It is a well recognised and very old principle that if you attack a Government on its financial proposals, and you upset the conclusions of a Budget, you take upon yourself a mighty big responsibility. During the quarter of a century I have been in Parliament, I have - ever known a Government supporter who did not recognise the position in which he is placed in interfering with financial proposals, particularly at a most critical time like this, right at the close of the session. The honourable member for Grampians, with all his experience",80

251,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,Then I despise any man who would assume such a position from that motive.,81
252,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"You have no right to say that. . Mr RICHARD FOSTER - I say it as a matter of duty. I am paid to say it , and I say it without hesitation, though I am sorry to have to do so.",81
253,Mr BOYD,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,Every man in this House is here because he did look for votes; otherwise he would not be here.,81
254,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I do not f we agree with the honourable member, though honI generally do so. It would be a good thing,for the country if there were a little less of that kind of business. I do say, however, that any honourable member, sitting behind a Government, who deliberately disputes the financial arrangements of that Government, as this proposal would, ought to be in para position to make a suggestion that prowould adjust the finances. I have not from any honourable member on either side any such proposal or suggestion. If there is one thing we ought to in this country, it is to pay our way, and not to drift into further difficulties. This Government told the country that it was not going to impose any fresh taxaEvery honourable member must realise that there' has had to be a sever' straining, and a critical tightening up here and there, in order to avoid fresh taxation. I say deliberately that I am going to resist this amendment, not that I would not like to be generous if we were in a position to be so. Even if we were in that position, I would not give the proposed concession to rich people who do not need it. In regard to the poor struggling man, it has been pointed out tonight over and over again that the concession provided last year put the wage earner quite out of consideration.",81
255,Mr BILEY,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,Not altogether. .,82
256,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"I say that it did, and I challenge my honourable friend to dispute it.",82

258,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"The honourable member will not prove his statement. I appeal to honourable members to "" play the. game."" Can any honourable memher name,a singlo Parliament in the British Empire which, in its proposals to meet war responsibilities, has relieved the worker from taxation burdens in the way this Parliament has? I do not believe there is such a Parliament to be found anywhere. I hope that .the proposal before us will be defeated. If we desire .to. be generous there is another way, which is more appealing to me, and which ought to be more appealing to every honourable member, and that is, the giving .of greater concessions to the maimed and wounded from the war. This country is doing splendidly up to the limit of our resources; better, I believe, than any other country; but, if' we wish to do more, I would rather do it in : the direction I have indicated than in the direction suggested by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett).
