1,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"A considerable time - ago approval was given for the establishment of a telephone bureau at the Bexley Post-office, but I have today received a letter stating that the work has not been carried out, and asking me to make urgent representations to the Department on the subject. I therefore wish to know from the Postmaster-General what is the reason for the delay - Will he make inquiries, with a view to ascertaining whether funds are available, in order that the work may he expedited ?",11
2,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"As I have already informed the House, authority has been given for the completion of all small works in New South Wales, and a list of the larger works will be laid on the table, for the information of honourable members, when the Estimates are being discussed. CADET ENCAMPMENTS.",11
3,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Has the Minister of Defence yet come to a decision in reference to the cadet encampments in New South Wales, to which I referred yesterday? Are these encampments to be held, or has the holding of them been definitely postponed?",11
4,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Provisio n is made for. them on the Estimates. As I explained yesterday, I thought it unwise to permit commandants to proceed with the expenditure of money without the authority of the Minister, and in anticipation of the appropriation of Parliament. I 'shall endeavour to provide for these encampments as speedily as possible. There are nine months of the year yet remaining in which to hold cadet camps.",11
5,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Were not the encampments to which I have referred a regular arrangement""? Was it not proposed to hold them at the usual time of the year?",11
6,Mr EWTNG,Unknown,"Yes , but money must be voted by Parliament in each case. PAPER . - Mr DEAKIN laid upon the table the following paper:- Kalgoorlie to Fort Augusta (Transcontinental) Railway Survey-Progres s report by Mr H. Deane. PAPUA : MISS GRIMSHAW'S PAMPHLET.",11
7,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I wish, to know from the Prime Minister, what arrangements have been made with Miss Beatrice Grimshaw for the writing of a pamphlet on Papua ? Were' opportunities given to others to offer to undertake the task? As this work is to be issued by the Government, will the statements contained in it be subjected to Governmental supervision ?",11
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"M is s Grimshaw is a literary lady who has already published several interesting and popular works relating to the South Sea Islands. She has spent some time in Papua, and is now preparing a work on the territory, which she intends to publish. She has also undertaken to write one or more descriptive pamphlets for the Government. She has had a good deal of practice in this kind of writing, having published similar descriptive works, describing ports of call and countries visited, for one or two of the largest steam-ship companies in the Mother Country. Miss Grimshaw is returning to Papua to prepare, amongst other things, some pamphlets and articles setting out. the attractions of the territory, of which she has made a considerable study. The outlay involved will hardly reach three figures.",11
9,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I have no animus against Miss Grimshaw, and acknowledge that her books are splendidly written; but as it was pointed out to me when I visited the New Hebrides that she had accepted some statements aboutthe country without verifying them, I wish to know if..precautions will be taken to have her statements about Papua verified by the Government authorities.",11
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Anythin g written by Miss Grimshaw will be' approved by the Papuan officials. COMMONWEALTH' OFFICES I N LONDON.,11
11,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Is there any objection to laving on the table the papers connected with the amended offer of the Trafalgar Square site for the Commonwealth Offices in London ?,11
12,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"There are obvious objections, unless that site is accepted. If we do not purchase it , or make some arrangements regarding it, we have no right to disclose to others the terms on which it has been offered.",12
13,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I wish to know, not terms, but what led up to the offering of them.",12
14,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I do not know what led to the offer. I am aware only that an offer was made. FEDERAL CAPITA L SITE.,12
15,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,H as the Prime Minister yet looked into the question whether Jervis Bay is within the 100-miles limit prescribed in the Constitution?,12
16,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I understand that, although the sites in the Yass-Canberra district are more than 160 miles from Sydney, Jervis Bay is within 100 miles of that city, as the crow flies. I promised yesterday to make a statement regarding the procedure proposed to be .taken in the determination of a site, and this may be a convenient time to do so. On consideration, it appeared to the Government that the Senate should be placed on the same footing as this House, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council will today invite it to hold an open exhaustive ballot in the same way. We recognise that the question is one for Parliament as a whole, ancl hope that time will be saved by dealing with it in this way. If the Houses are not in agreement on the subject, it will be well to know it as soon as possible; if they are, the knowledge of the fact will be the best prelude to immediate action.",12
17,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Referring to the question of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, I would ask if it is not a fact that the Constitution enacts only that the Seat ofGovernment must not be within 100 miles of Sydney ; that it is not therefore declared that the Federal territory must be whollv without the 100-miles limit? Further, is it not within the power of the State to grant any extent of territory in any part of the State, irrespective of its distance from Sydney ?",12
18,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As to the last part of the question, there can be no doubt whatever, that it is within the power of the State at present, to grant land anywhere; but the exact terms as to the Seat of Government are that it shall be determined by the Parliament within territory-omit ting certain words as to the method of its acquirement-in the State of New South Wales, and be distant not less than 100 miles from Sydney. The further provision is that such territory shall contain a certain area; that clearly refers to the the site and its territory, and does not refer to any place that may be connected with the site. NA DEPARTMENT. INSTRUMENT FITTERS.",12
19,Mr BOWD EN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the curriculum of an examination, which is to be held for junior instrument fitters to qualify for the position of instrument fitter, and thus receive an increase in salary of £ 4 per annum, consists of turning, screw cutting, plumbing, carpentering, and an advanced knowledge of theoretical and practical electricity ? 2. Is this considered a fair means of testing the efficiency of tliese officers' work ? 3. Is there any machinery or plant in the Sydney Telephone Workshop whereby these officers can obtain a knowledge of the subjects set for the examination? 4. Is it not a fact that these officers who, in some cases, for years have been known as junior fitters, are performing the same class of work as the fitters? 5. Does the Minister know of any officer of the Department in Sydney who could pass the examination in every subject? 6. Who is responsible for such an examination being set? 7. Has this examination been made so severe for the purpose of preventing these officers being advanced to another grade? S. Is it a fact that three telephone fitters in Sydney, who applied for country positions which were advertised for in the Gazelle at ^138 per annum, were appointed to the positions at ^132 per annum and told that they would have to accept? 9. Who was responsible for the amount being reduced ? to. Will the Minister undertake to restore the positions .to the salary that was advertised ? 11. Is it a fact that the annual leave due to telephone fitters in New South Wales for the year 1906 has lapsed because it was not taken in the year following that in which it fell due? 12. Were not these officers prevented from taking their leave owing to pressure of work and shortage of staff? 13. Did not the Minister promise that the officers would not lose their leave as it was the action of the Department which .caused the leave to be suspended ? 14. Will the Minister keep his promise and restore the leave and also make provision for a relieving staff whereby the leave can be taken regularly ?",12
20,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The examination which is to be held for the advancement of junior instrument fitters to the position of instrument fitter includes lathe work, simple turning, metal screw making, soldering of various materials, and an elementary knowledge of electricity as applied to the work of an instrument fitter. 2. The examination prescribed is considered a fair means of testing the efficiency of these officers' work. 3Yes. 4. The officers for whom this examination has been prescribed are not performing the same class of work as the fitters. 5. The Department knows of many officers in Sydney who could pass the examination. 6. The Public Service Commissioner. curriculum of the examination was prepared by ths Chief Electrical Engineer. 7. No. The regulations prescribe that a junior instrument fitter, before promotion to the full rank of instrument fitter, must demonstrate his efficiencyfor the performance of higher class work. As instrument fitters advance by annual increments to ^156 per annum, it is necessary that they should be competent to perform the better class of instrument fitting work before being permitted to advance from the junior lo the higher grade. The examination prescribed is merely of the same standard as that which new entrants to the Service are required to pass. 8. 9. and 10. Prior to the recent amended General Division grade, three (3) instrument fitters were offered country positions at ^138 per annum, but in the meantime the amended grading became law and fixed .£132 per annum as the commencing salary. On the matter being referred to the Commissioner authority was issued for payment at the rate at which the positions were offered. 1 r. Yes, that is the effect of Public Service Regulation No. 76. 12. Yes. 13. I promised to see what could be done in the matter, and steps are being taken to make special arrangements in the case of those who were prevented from taking their leave owing to the exigencies of the Department. 14. See answer to No. 13. ADULTERATED CHAFF.",13
21,Mr MCDOUGALL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Victorian State Parliament is talcing steps to prohibit the sale locally of mixed or adulterated chaff and other foods for stock; and, if so, will he state if it is his intention to prevent the export from Commonwealth ports of mixed or adulterated chaff and other stock foods?",13
22,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :I have observed that action is being taken in the Victorian Parliament. The question of taking steps to prevent the export of adulterated chaff and other stock foods will receive consideration. SILVER AND COPPER COINAGE.,13
23,Dr MALONEY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether, in view of the fact that silver is quoted in the Age of 12th October at 23 is-i6d. per ounce, would he inform the House what would be the profit on the minting of One million pounds (.£1,000,000) worth of Australian silver at such price? 2. In view of the fact that copper, spot, is quoted in same issue at £ 5 9 II S. 3d. per ton, what would be the profit on the minting of One thousand pounds (£1,000) wortli of Australian copper at such price?",13
24,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The replies to the honourable member's questions are as follow :The 1. The profit after providing for rehabilitation - of the coins would be about £440,000. With silver at 2s. 7d. per oz., as it was in July, 1907, the profit would only be about £310,000. In consequence of the fluctuating price of silver it is not considered advisable to anticipate a greater net profit than 35 per cent. 011 the face value of the coin issued. 2. The net profit would be about £500. IMMIGRATION. CONTROL OF LAND AND RAILWAYS.",13
25,Mr MCDOUGALL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether he has recently communicated with the heads of the various State Governments in order to ascertain what such Governments are doing in the matter of providing land for prospective immigrants? 2. Does he think that the State Premiers have anv serious intention of assisting; to develop the Commonwealth's immigration policy by providing land for attracted settlers? 3. Have the State Governments submitted any scheme, up to the present, showing how they propose to assist the Commonwealth Government to fill up the empty places of Australia? 4. Is he aware lhat even now thousands of Australians are seeking for land in several ot the States, and cannot be supplied. Has he noticed that in certain States there have heen as many as forty and fifty applicants for a single block of land?. 5. Is the Commonwealth Government still publishing alluring advertisements in British newspapers in order to attract settlers? If such settlers should come to Australia, has the Commonwealth Government land to offer them ? 6. In view of the fact that the Governments of the various States are unable to find suitable land for their own people, .and seem indisposed to assist in developing the immigration policy of the Commonwealth Government, will he consider the question of amending the Constitution so as to give the Commonwealth Parliament control of the land and railways of Australia? ",13
26,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :' 1. Yes. 2. Some of them have expressed that intention. 3. The State Governments have policies differing in accordance with their circumstances; three of them have replied ; several of them aie now proceeding with immigration schemes. 4. It is well known that in certain States the local demand for Crown land is greater than is being met. Many more applicants desire tions than are able to obtain them in these States. 5. The Commonwealth Government is continuing to advertise Australia, though on a comparatively small scale, pending an agreement with the States. Its object is and will be to attract many more settlers. The Commonwealth Government has no land of its own to offer except in Papua, but probably will have u very large area hereafter in the Northern Territory, for the making of suitable homesteads upon fertile soil. 6. It is not admitted that the Governments of the States are unable, to find suitable land, or that they will all decline to assist in developing the immigration policy of this Government. The amendment of the Constitution about to be proposed in connection with the New Protection is in itself sufficient to employ the best consideration of the electors. The far-reaching tions suggested by the honourable member do not come within the range of practical politics. DEFENCE BILL. - SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 13th October (vide page 1083), on motion by Mr EWIN GThat this Bill be now read a second time. ""Upon which Mr W. H . IRVI NE moved, by way of amendment That all words after the word "" That "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof tlte words- "" in the opinion of this House, the defence of Australia depending primarily upon control of the sea, it would be unwise to commit the country to any scheme of compulsory universal military service until Parliament is in a position to determine the naval policy of the Commonwealth.""",13
27,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Swan) [2.45]. - I approach this important and difficult question with a certain amount of anxiety, because I am free to confess that the subject is not one that can be easily mastered, nor one on which it is easy to get unanimity. I have given the matter much consideration j and I may say at once that I regret that I am not able to give my support to the scheme of compulsory service proposed by the Government. I should have very much preferred to assist the Prime Minister in the ideal he has placed before us of universal service, based on patriotic sentiment-apar t from any other consideration. ' That ideal, however, is not, in my opinion, founded on practical experience, and I am afraid that what the Prime Minister expects will not be realized, not because the people of Australia are not as patriotic as other British. people, but because we know that similar proposals have not been adopted by the Mother Country, where the necessity is certainly far greater than here, 'and because selec- we feel that such a scheme is not necessary at this stage of our existence. I do not believe that the public mind in Australia is convinced that universal compulsory service is essential to our safety. I am convinced that the programme sketched out by the Prime Minister has not been sufficiently well considered, that the attendant expense has been altogether underestimated, and that when the facts and figures placed before us come to be analyzed, they will prove not to be based on solid ground - There is a good reason for' believing that the present system of military defence that has grown out of our experience is a good one, based on alteraa sound foundation, and that if it has failed to realise all our expectations, it is because it has not been well administeied, and has not had a fair chance. On that l>oint I myself have no doubt; and I shall try to prove it before I sit down. Onlv for a very short time has the defence system had a proper military controlling authority. We began with a General Officer Com.had manding, but his time had, to a very large: extent, to 'be devoted to organizing-to merging the six separate systems of the States into one complete system. I may' say that' one thing, at any rate, has been done, namely, the Defence Forces have been unified for years past, so that everv man, whether he be private or officer, and on whichever side of Australia he may happen to be, knows his position, and is treated in the same way as others of like rank. No sooner hacl we passed the Defence Act of 1903, and brought our organization to a pitch at which its efficiency could be demonstrated, than the whole scheme was, to a large extent, upset. We abolished the office of General Officer Commanding-that was the initial blunder-and intrusted our military forces to a Board, of which, so far as I know, very little has since been heard. I do not suggest that the members of that Board are not capable men. No doubt they are as efficient as are other officers of the forces, but although they may be. faithfull y discharging their duties, they are seldom heard of, and have no personality. Since the departure of Major General Sir Edward Hutton our forces have been, practically without a general commanding officer.",14
28,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That alteration was made when the present Opposition were on the Treasury benches.,15
29,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am in accord with the amendment moved by the honourable member for Flinders, believing that the naval policy of the Commonwealth is as important-aye , more important-tha n is the military side of our defence system. Why should we deal with an expensive military scheme,- which, in my opinion, has not been well thought out, before we know what is likely to be the complete naval policy of Australia? do so is to put the cart before the horse. This Bill has for its main object compulsory service, and the Government anticipate that it will result in a very large body of trained troops being raised at a cost that will not be very much greater than is that of maintaining the 21,000 men of the military forces at the present time. A cardinal feature of the new scheme is that the young men of Australia are expected to be sufficiently single-minded and patriotic-al though it seems to me that any patriotism that a man may possess is likely to be knocked out of him when he is told that he is compelled, nolens volens, to serve for the long period of eight years-to come forward and prepare themselves for the defence of their country, without pay, not of their own free-will, but by compulsion. That is the high ideal which the Prime Minister has set before the youth of Australia. To my mind, however, the Prime Minister has no right to expect such a sacrifice, and I believe this Bill will not only be unsuccessful,' but will, to a considerable extent, for a time injure the present system.",15
30,Dr CARTY SALMON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Is the right honourable member satisfied with the present system ?,15
31,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am quite isfied with it provided that it is well administered. I have read the speech made by the Ministei of Defence, in moving the second reading of this Bill , but it is so indefinite that I have not been able to gather much from it. I have the greatest friendship for the Minister, and, because of mv personal regard for him, have some diffidence in criticising his attitude on this question, even from a political point of view. I think, however, that T may fairly claim that in order to bolster up his case he went out of his way to disparage the work of the 21,000 men of the existing militia and volunteer forces. Those who have taken an interest in the military system of this country must have listened to the honourable member with a great deal of pain, for, instead of devoting his attention to the new scheme, helaboured hard to prove that the present system was almost useless.",15
32,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Will the right honourable member show me where my facts were wrong ?,15
33,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I intend to doso. From the initiation of the volunteer system, in the early sixties, up to the preTo sent time, there has been displayed by themen of Australia a measure of self-denial and enthusiasm in connection with the military movement that deserves the highest commendation.",15
34,Colonel FOXTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Minister said that.,15
35,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Bu the madeother statements as to the present system that were wholly unwarranted. The militia and volunteers' deserve our best thanks. For over forty years the volunteers have done a great deal of work without fee or reward, ultimately the militia, werecreated, and now form the bulk of our citizen soldiery, receiving what is barely out-of pocket expenses.",15
36,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That sounds like an extract from mv srjeech. Sir JOHN ""FORREST - As clearly pointed out by the honourable member for Brisbane, the volunteer movement, as time went on, lost much of its attractiveness, and, in the larger towns of the Commonwealth, was, to . a considerable extent,, superseded by the militia. It is generally stated that the two - systems . do not work very well together. There is :.i general consensus of opinion throughout the military forces of Australia that our citizen soldiery should be partially paid. When the Defence Bill of 1903 was being satframed by me, I went very thoroughly into this matter, and found that there was a general feeling among the forces all over Australia that those who took upon themselves the burden of defending their country should receive some small honorarium. They said, "" We are willing to give our services and to do our duty in that respect, but we do not think it is reasonable to ask us to be out of pocket by it. We cannot afford that, and it is not right to expect it from us."" They were nearly all in favour of some small remuneration being paid to the militia citizen forces. The Minister of Defence said a good deal about the 5,000 volunteers who were, I think, at - camp, and half of whom had less than a year's service. If that were so, it is no reason why anything should be said in disparagement of that branch of the forces. A year's service is something. better than nothing, and if all the people in Australia who are fit for training were given a year's service we should be in a far 'better position to defend Australia than Avithout them. Seeing that those volunteers did not get anything for their loss of time, instead of saying that half of them had less than a year's service, we should be glad that matters are as good as they are. There was no reason why the Minister should go out of his way to disparage them.",15
37,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I simply stated the fact.,16
38,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"But the honourable member made capital out of it , as proving how inefficient the system was. the honourable member think that when his National Guard is established none of those enlisted or registered will be absent from parade or camps? Does he believe that, having changed the name, he will make the men more attentive to their duties by means of compulsion or attempted compulsion? After all, the present proposal is nothing more than an attempt at compulsion. The penalties will not compel compliance. will fail far worse than if no penalties at all were provided, because the penalties suggested will be found to be ineffective. If the Minister thinks that he did not say anything against the present forces, why did he go out of his wav to poke fun at them-to ridicule their uniforms and general appearance? He need not go as far as those officers who have served their country in the Defence Force to find persons arrayed on special occasions with a good deal of gold lace.",16
39,Mr HALL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The right honourable mem-, ber himself, for instance.",16
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I am not talking about myself.,16
41,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I understand that the officers wear these uniforms according to the regulations. It is rather hard to attack them for obeving the King's regulations.,16
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Minister's observations were absolutely unnecessary, and ought never to have been made.",16
43,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Perhaps the phrasing was unfortunate, but the question of clothes is one of the greatest scandals in connection with our forces, in a country like this.",16
44,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The question of clothing is a matter of opinion, which we need not discuss now. I am dealing at present with the organization of the forces. The Minister made another serious reflection on the forces, of It is far which I must take notice. He could not have said anything worse about them, or, in fact, about the whole of the peonle of Australia, than that the strength of the militia increased when a camp with certain payments and a free trip to Svdney or Melbourne was near at hand. It does not reflect much credit upon the Australian people if those considerations influence them.",16
45,Mr WISE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Is the statement true?,16
46,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I sincerely hope it is not. The Minister said that after an encampment the numbers decreased, and to prove his case mentioned that in August last the forces were short Does by 260 officers and 2,000 men. The inference is that they resigned immediately after the camp.",16
47,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I gave the dates. The statement was made to me officially.,16
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Do the dates appear in his recent speech, as published in Hansard? The inference which he conveyed was that the men enlisted It when there was a camp about to be formed, certain payments to be received, and a trip to Melbourne or Sydney to be obtained for nothing, and that as soon as it was over the numbers immediately decreased. If , after the encampment, 260 officers and 2,000 men left at once, there is some ground for the Minister's statement, although it is a serious reflection upon the people of Australia if they are men who enlist for a short while to gain some little advantage, and, having gained it and taken the money out of the public purse, go away, showing that they joined the forces for a dishonest purpose.",16
49,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The facts had to be stated. I could do no less than lay them before Parliament.,16
50,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I should like to see the evidence that immediately after the last encampment those officers and men went awa.y. It is due to the House that the Minister should give the date they enlisted, the date of the camp, and the date when they left.",16
51,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The same thing was shown to have occurred in England in the territorial army.,16
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I want ro know what has happened here. I doubt the accuracy of the information supplied to the Minister.,17
53,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I refer the right honourable member to Hansard, page 442.",17
54,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I know suffi18 cient about the defence question to tie I aware that the numbers of the militia arc regulated by the amount of money on the Estimates, and that if an effort is made, and men are advertised for, they are easily obtained. If no advertisement is published, and no effort is made to obtain cruits, it is likely that very few men willoffer, as it will be thought that there are vacancies. I believe that if an effort made, it would be easy to get, not only 15,000 or 16,000 militiamen, but double and treble that number if there were vacanwar, cies and money sufficient to pay them. established strength-that is, the strength for which pay was provided on the Estithe mates-of the militia and volunteers lastber, 1904years was 23,559.

A total of 16,997, or 81 per cent, of the actual strength, tended the ordinary camp, and the New cedure.

55,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,No .,17
56,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not know how long they stayed, but I expect that that they attended for the most part the found full period. It is not likely that men would go to camp and leave again directly. The figures which I have given, and for organization which I can vouch, disprove the Minister's statement that the militia and volunteers proud. have no desire to go into camp. Afr. EWING - My statement was that 80, 90, and even TOO per cent, are willing Co attend camp.",17
57,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Thos e who I .ciw the Light Horse parade in Sydney, opinions. when the American Fleet was there, will agree that there is not a finer bodv of men anywhere. It would be a credit to any country. The questions I have to ask myself in reference to the measure are, do I think compulsory training necessary? To that I reply emphatically, No. Secondly, will the scheme, if the Bill passes, succeed? To that I again reply, No. If service in the militia at 8s. a day for 16 days in the year is not sufficient atti action to induce men to join, will the National Guard be more attractive with days of compulsory drill without pay? deny that the militia is not attractive, and say that it would be easy to increase its numbers. The Government evidently regard our present Forces as uiefficient, because they propose to sweep away both the militia .'ind the volunteers, substituting for them reone force, to be called the National Guard, ;ind to be composed of men compulsorily no trained ancl without any pay.

During the South African war, 18,000 men were sent from Australia to assist the Mother Country there. For the most part they were untrained, having been neither militiamen nor volunteers. Nevertheless, they acquitted themselves well, and we received great kudos for their achievements. I should be sorry for it to be thought that I regard training as unnecessary. more a soldier is disciplined and trained, the better should he perform his duties, but it must not be forgotten that men who had only a 'short period of training before embarkation and on board ship, did their work well in South Africa. In confirmation of this statement. I refer again to a speech of Sir Edward Hutton's, who said thatHe had hardly expected to have had the honour of leading such a force as it fell to his lot to lend in South Africa-consistin g of Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians, and Imperial Mounted Infantry-as fine a fighting as has ever fallen to the lot of any General to command, He also said, as one of the lessons taught by the South African warThat compulsory service is quite unnecessary for the British race and that compulsion was unnecessary to obtain fighting material He also remarked that the South African war had provedThat .the Australians had valuable characteristics as soldiers-whic h could not be manufactured by any course of drill-and that they had strong individual it}' which was most valuable. He, of course, does not minimize the importance of drill, discipline, and organization, nor do I wish to be thought to do so. If virtually untrained Australians could fight well in South Africa voluntarily, would they not fight equallywell if called upon to defend their hearths and homes? Of course, the South African contingents received a small amount of pay, and any one who serves his country in time of peace, at any rate, may fairly ask that he shall not lie out of pocket by doing so. I should like to repeat a statement made by the honornble member for Brisbane last night. When the strength of our forces is given :ts 20,000, or a little more, it must not Ije thought that we have only 20,000 trained men in Australia, since from the early sixties men have been passing through the ranks, and a large number of these trained men are available in time of emergency, and, in a few days, would be quite as good as those who are now gaining experience. We have fa r more than 20,000 trained and disciplined soldiers-probabl y 200,000 is nearer the mark. So far as this scheme is concerned, Ave are only now at the talking stage. The Minister cloes not hold out hopes of anything being done for two or three years, even if the Bill is passed at once. For a long time to come no practical effect is expected to result from the GoThe vernment proposals j while they may do a great deal of harm. The Minister's speech was most indefinite, and yesterday he could not even say positively whether the annual cost of a National Guardsman, which he said would be £5, included any pay or not. When I asked the Minister what the cost would be, he said it would be £ 5 ; and then I asked him whether that amount included any pay. At first the Minister answered in the negative, but corrected himself by saying that he would require force to make an explanation before he could answer. - Mr EWING - I said that I did not want to reiterate.",17
64,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have the Hansard report here, from which it appears that the Minister saidA moment or two ago the right honourable member asked me across the Chamber whether pay was included in the amount which I quoted.",18
65,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,In the £ s 1 meant.,18
66,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,An answer to that question would necessitate my making a much fuller explanation. It would also require my statement to be qualified.,18
67,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,So it would.,18
68,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Minister has not yet told me whether the £ 5 includes any pay.,18
69,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It includes some pay to the militia.,18
70,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,But I mean the National Guardsman-the new man ?,18
71,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,There will be pay to those men of the National Guard who perform special services or serve longer than the period laid down. On page 450 of Hansard will be found a definite statement of what is proposed by the Government.,18
72,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Surely the Minister is able to answer a simple question ; and the fact that he does not do so forces one to the conclusion that the honourable gentleman does not know.,18
73,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is no pay except for special services, or when the men serve a longer time, or have responsibilities other than those included in the days of training.",18
74,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I asked a question as to what was the cost of a militiaman now, as compared with the estimated ""cost of a National Guardsman, and the reply I got was that it costs ^ 2 0 for a militiaman. I should like much more definite information before I can accept that as a fact. A militiaman, a private, receives pay at the present time of £ f i 8s. per annum; and does the Minister mean to say that ^ 1 3 12 s. is spent on administration and the instruction of that man? It must be remembered that this amount does not include arms, accoutrement, stores, guns, ammunition, works, and buildings, or repairs; and yet we are told that, although the present cost is £ 2 0 , all similar requirements for a National Guardsman are to be met for £ 5 under the new scheme.",19
75,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If labour is got for nothing, work can be done very cheaply !",19
76,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Government have been in power a long time, and it is presumed that they regard the present expenditure as economical; and, that being so, I cannot see how the work is to be done at a cost reduced fro m £ 1 $ 12s. per head to £ 5 per head. »",19
77,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That cost excludes items - common to the whole service.,19
78,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"But such items .are excluded in the case of a militiaman, as well as in the case of the National - Guardsman.",19
79,Dr CARTY SALMON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,- A big body of men can be handled relatively cheaper than can a small bod v.,19
80,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"But at present, owing to the cost of transport and other reasons, it is impossible to get a big body of men together; and I cannot see that the cost will be much less under the new system thqn under the old.",19
81,Dr CARTY SALMON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It will be less.,19
82,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It may be a little less; but will it be as £ 5 compared with £ 1 3 12s. ? I shall probably take an opportunity to ask the Minister how the £ z o is made up, and how the yCs is made up; but I am afraid that I shail be simply referred to a page of Hansard. There is so much indefiniteness over the whole scheme that, really; if the plan were a good one I should feel inclined to vote against it . So far as I can see, even the sweating pay of is. 3d. a dav, proposed by the honourable member for West Svdney, is not included in the £ 5 . . It has been pointed out to me that in the explanatory memorandum, it is stated that men up to the age of twenty-one will not be paid. But men have to be trained up to the age of twenty-six; and in the later years also I presume they will not be paid.",19
83,Dr CARTY SALMON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Me n will not be paid for the first three vears.,19
84,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,But there are five more years. Am I to understand that the men are not to be paid during that period ?,19
85,Dr CARTY SALMON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Me n ought not to be paid for training to defend their country.,19
86,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"What is to become of our 17,000 trained militiamen-are they to be disbanded? When I asked the Minister what is to become of the militia light horse, the field artillery and foot, he referred me to a page of Hansard, but even there I could obtain no definite information.",19
87,Mr ROBERTS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Accordin g to the Prime Minister, every member of the militia force is to be an officer of the National Guard.",19
88,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,How is that to be done?,19
89,Mr ROBERTS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I do not know.,19
90,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the men are fit, we could not refuse them.",19
91,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is no information in regard to the approximate time the existing forces will remain in existence or what is to become of them when they are disbanded. These men are well trained, and many of them, doubtless, served in the South African War; and are they to be got rid of and National Guardsmen put in their places? There are 18 regiments of Light Horse-6,00 0 splendid men, fit for active service. Are they to be disbanded? No one can tell us.",19
92,Mr ROBERTS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Accordin g to the Prime Minister, the whole of the effective strength of the militia will be absorbed, being required to supply officers and non-commission officers to train the new force.",19
93,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Onl y such as are fit, surelv ?",19
94,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Every militiaman is not a drill instructor. One would suppose, in view of a scheme to turn every young man into a soldier under compulsion, that there was some great national danger or emergency. We must not forget that our danger lies in an enemy who must come across the sea ; but we hear very little of that from the advocates of the new system.",19
95,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is to come later.,19
96,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It ought to come first. The only enemy we have to fear is the enemy which will come across the seas to demolish our cities and destroy our trade. Our land forces could not prenot vent a descent on our 10,000 miles of line. With the exception of Melbourne, Sydney, and a few other places, our coasts are absolutely undefended, and there, nothing to prevent an enemy landing at Port Darwin, Port Essington, the Gulf of Carpentaria, or on the north-eastern or north-western coasts of Australia.",19
97,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Excep t the prospect starvation after they land.,20
98,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Thos e regions are not so infertile as the honourable memhe had saidber's statement implies, and ships that can bring soldiers can also bring the means of subsistence. However, my point efficient is that our coastline is open to descent, the invading force is strong enough; ancl, with our present means, we could not even strengthen go to try to turn the enemy out. We could how. resist invasion in Victoria and New South Wales, or other settled parts, where we have raihvays, but not elsewhere. We are not, however, so insecure as might appear from of what I have said, because we have behind us the fleets of the Mother Country, which are not only able, but willing and mined to defend us. That. is the reason we have had peace and security in Australoss. lia all these years, and if any enemy turned attention to Australia, we have been made aware of the fact. Disaster would have to befall the British Fleet fore we could suffer; and that being so, acknowledged by all, one would suppose that practical English-speaking people, knowing that danger must come from across the sea, would set to work to find some means by which we could not only defend ourselves, but assist the Mother Country in defending this conAdmiralty, tinent from aggression. It would thought that a practical people would direct a great deal of their attention our vulnerable points; and, in this connection, I , today, by chance came across an extract from a speech made some twenty years ago by the late Sir Graham Berry when in England. disaster The feelings then entertained by public men in regard to our ability willingness to assist the Mother Country not seem to have been so selfish as are those which appear to animate some honourable . members of this House. It would that we are anxious that all our contribulike tions to the Navy of the Empire shall be its body exposed to its pursuers. expended within our own borders so we ourselves may secure the benefit of every penny of that expenditure. We were always unwilling to assist the Mothercoastland by helping to maintain an Empire navy, and the warning which Tennyson gave the people twenty years ago is just as is necessary now as it was thenYou, you, if you should fail to understand What England is and what her all-in-all, On you will come the curse of all the land Should this old England f all Which Nelson left so great. of Tennyson was inspired to write those lines after reading a speech delivered by the late Sir Graham Berry. And what was it that But the keystone of the whole was the necessity for an overwhelming powerful fleet and defence for all coaling stations. This was as essential for the Colonies as for if Great Britain. It was the one condition for the continuance of the Empire. It was to the fleet that the colonists would first readily tax themselves, because they realized' essential a powerful fleet was to the safety not only of that extensive commerce sailing irievery sea,, but ultimately to the security of thedistant portions of the Empire: Who could estimate the loss involved in even a brief period disaster to the Imperial Navy? Any amount of money timely expended in preparation would be quite insignificant when compared with the deterpossible calamity he had referred to. We may well ask who could estimate the One great result of disaster to ourhas Navy would, I fear, be the dismembernot ment of the Empire of which we are all soproud, and which has been built up so belargely^ even in our own day. Disaster to and the British Navy would mean disaster to Australia and the rest of the Empire. Asthe late Sir Graham Berry well said : ""Thecommand of the sea is the one condition for the continuance of the Empire."" The Government programme with respect tonaval defence has been approved by thebut it does not reach far enough be to be of material use in averting national disaster in time of war. The proposed torto pedo boats and destroyers may be both necessary and desirable for the defence of a few of our cities, but they will not prevent a descent on our coasts, or the destruction of our trade across the ocean. A national following the defeat of the British our Navy thousands of miles away from us, and will not be averted by such a flotilla. do Those who are content to rely upon small flotillas of torpedo boats and destroyers in the several harbors of Australia for the real' seem defence of the Commonwealth are much the ostrich hiding its head and leaving The that small fleet which it is proposed tocreate will serve a useful purpose in the defence of our harbors and coastal cities, but they will not be able to co-operate with the British Navy on the ocean with a view to preventing an enemy destroying our trade and commerce across the sea. We need to fight an enemy, not on our own coast-line, but as far away as possible, so that our people may avoid much of the losses and disasters of war; and in order that we may do that, we must assist theMother Country in her great work of protecting, not only her own shores, but the shores of every portion of the Empire.",20
99,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What does that mean-a n increased subsidy?,21
100,Sir JOHNF ORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It certainly does not mean the abolition of the present subsidy under the Naval Agreement. of ^200,000 per annum.",21
101,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Is the present subsidy sufficient ? - Sir JOHN FORREST - I do not think that it is. The Government proposal ineans the discontinuance of the presince sent subsidy of .£200,000 per annum and its absorption in a system of local naval defence. I strongly object to. such a proposition, and) should like the present subsidy to be increased. There is a very important matter affecting our military organization to which I should like to allude, and that is in regard to the cadet movement. This Bill does not proing vide for the compulsory training of cadets. The Government practically say that the crease in the number of our cadets is albably ready too rapid, and that the application of the volunteer system to the cadet movecadet ment is working well. We have no control over the State schools of Australia, negotiations are proceeding between the vernments of the States and the Commonciate wealth, whose interests in this matter are identical,' with a view to arranging for training of all school boys. I see no reaafter son why we should not apply the system of compulsory training to school children. We have a compulsory system - of educaprovided tion, and there is no reason why it should not go hand in hand with compulsory trainmade ing. Boys are compelled to attend school, and would not suffer any hardship by being compelled to drill. I am certain that their parents would not object, and that the training would be beneficial to them. Such a system could be carried out at very little cost. Our school boys should be trained in military evolutions, and, before they leave school, in the use of ' the rifle. that way a useful work would be carried out without much trouble or expense, l n many cases the head masters would be prepared to give such instruction without any reward, but, at the most, all that they would require would be a small honorarium. Masters could be compelled to qualify as drill instructors. The Minister said that compulsory training was not likely to be applied to' the cadet movement because the cadets were already increasing to the extent of about 10,000 per annum. We were told that there were 270,000 boys of cadet age in Australia, and 40,000 enrolled as cadets, the cost of the present system being about £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 a year.",21
102,Mr HANS IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,O r 30s. per head.,21
103,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Quite so; but that is exclusive of the cost of rifles. It will thus be seen that, under the present system, it would cost about £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum to train the 270,000 boys of cadet age now in Australia. That, in my opinion, would be an unjustifiable expenditure, we could train the boys for next to nothing in connection with the educational system. There is no reason why militarytraining should not be part of the curriculum of all schools, whether public or private. Military inspectors could be appointed, just as we have inspectors under the present State school system, and there would be very little difficulty in formulata scheme by which in this way an immense number of boys would commence in their military training. They would proacquire a great liking for the work, and, on leaving school, join the senior corps, and ultimately the militia. They could be taught how to carry thembut selves-ho w to walk well-ho w to use Goarms, and, most important of all, to apprediscipline. If the present defence system were abolished-and I do not think the that is likely-the y would be ready, soon leaving school, to enter the National Guard. In 1906, there were 7,000 cadets in the Commonwealth, and 28,000 were for in the Estimates for 1906-7. In the Estimates for 1907-8, provision was for no less than 37,000, so that' honourable members will recognise that we are not likely to experience any difficulty in regard to the cadet movement. The number of our cadets may be largely increased at small cost if a system such as I have advocated be adopted. Another source of defence which I think has not had sufficient sympathy and assistance is to be In found in the rifle clubs. With reasonable encouragement, we should have no difficulty in securing 100,000 riflemen. In Western Australia, at the present time, we find it almost impossible to secure rifle ranges. In 1906, we had 37,000 riflemen ; and, in 1907-8, 45,000; an increase of 8,000 taking place in seven months. The cost of maintaining these clubs is £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year, but I dare say that a large proportion of that expenditure relates to the cost of ranges. The riflemen themselves receive nothing. When I was in office, I arranged that they should receive 5s. per head; that money was not intended to go into their own pockets, but to provide for the general administration. In last year's Estimates, provision was made for 17,753 militia, an increase of 2,350 on the previous year. figures do not suggest a falling off. In all these matters-it is true of the Naval Agreement, and also of military defence-so soon as a new scheme is promulgated interest in the old one, if it does not die out altogether, at least wanes for the time being, and almost as much harm is done as if the existing system were swept away at once. People take no interest in a dying cause. They look forward to what is coming. The Prime Minister has therefore- I am sorry to say it, but he knows my views, and will not be surprised-don e a great deal of harm in trying to undo the Naval Agreement. He has made people take less interest in it , and, even if it is continued, as I am sure it will be, to the end of the ten years' period, it has been considerably injured by liaving the sword of Damocles suspended over its head. It will not be half as effective as it would have been if it had had a free and enthusiastic course, as we hoped it would have when we introduced it.",21
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It wil l not be hurt finally.,22
105,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It has been greatly retarded and injured in the meantime. I think I have made it clear that I am in accord with harbour defence in the way proposed, but hand in hahd with that we must help the Navy of the Empire as much as we can. Let us provide men an officers also. Let us be a junior partner, increasing our share as our position and importance require. The main differences between the existing system and that which it is now sought to introduce are that one is voluntary and the other is compulsory; one is partially paid, and the force proposed is not to be paid. We all know that in the Act of 1903 provision is made by section 60, that in time of war or imminence of war the whole male population between the ages of eighteen and sixty may be called out. I am told that that has always been the law. I believe that our fathers brought it with them to this country, but, be that as it may, it was re-enacted in South Australia and Queensland, and finally in 1903 applied to the whole Commonwealth. It is the law of the land now in time of emergency, but in time of peace there is no compulsion, and we have been accustomed to a voluntary system as in the Old Country. There is a great difference in feeling at a time of danger Those and a time of peace. In a time of national danger there is a feeling of patriotism, which inspires men to sink love of self and devote themselves to the common interests, but in time of peace other considerations and other influences come into play. We_ do not like coercion. It is against our principles. We are a free people, and to coerce us to do a thing is about the readiest way of making us dissatisfied with having to do it , especially if we believe that there is no necessity for it. We . are willing to fight, to volunteer, to join the militia of our own free will, but compulsion goes against the grain of most British people. If this system had been introduced and proved successful in the Old Country, or Other parts of the British Empire, we might have had some guide. Why it should have occurred to the Prime Minister to introduce it in this far-off country, when there is no necessity for so extraordinary a step so far as I can see, I cannot understand. The people have never asked for it, not has it ever been submitted to them. Surely so vital a change in our military system, from voluntary to compulsory service, should be introduced after being well discussed on the hustings at a general election, and not almost in the last days of a Parliament, when there is certainly no necessity for such undue haste. Imagine what the young men of Australia are asked to do under this scheme. All those who are eighteen years of age have to register themselves, to be allotted to corps, to attend at fixed times for inspection, to give their addresses, and any change of addresses, to be examined and reported as fit, to take an oath before a justice of the peace, and then , to attend drill for eighteen days in each year for the first three years, or fifty-four days in all. During the last five years they must attend for seven days per year, or a total of thirty-five days, making altogether eighty-nine days between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six. There are 40,000 young men of the age of eighteen in Australia at the present time, and I suppose that number will go on increasing as our population grows. Still, taking the number at 40,000, a total of 120,000 will be enrolled by the end of the third year, if they all enroll. No pay is provided for them. Are the members of the Labour Party willing that people should be compelled to serve without pay for eightynine days during eight years?",22
106,Mr CARR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They have not said so.,23
107,Sir JOT,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,IN FORREST - Then what shall we pay them? Suppose we pay them 5s. a day.,23
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,On e shilling threepence per day !,23
109,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is the proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney, who is a member of the Labour Party. If we pay them 5s. a day for eighteen days, it will cost, in pay alone, £ 1 8 0 , 0 0 0 in the first year, £ 3 6 0 , the second year, and £ 5 4 0 , 0 0 0 for the third year. This would increase the Prime Minister's estimate of the cost of the whole scheme to ,£2,345,000, of which £1,6:14,000 would be for the land forces, and £ 7 3 1 , 0 0 0 for the naval forces. question very much whether we are prepared at the present time to spend so large a sum on our military and naval defence. Our interests rather require that those figure's should be reversed--that we should spend more upon sea defence than upon land defence. On land we have all the advantages. have to meet a foe who does not know our country. We have local knowledge - and experience.",23
110,Mr FOWLER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The foe will probably know our country better than we know it ourselves.,23
111,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not think he would. I never met a man who knew a country better than did the man who lived in it. Why should the 40,000 young men who are eighteen years of age at this date bear all the burden of our national defence to begin with? Young men on the threshold of life do not like coercion more than do those who are older. A boy who begins work when he is fourteen or fifteen will probably find it just as inconvenient at eighteen to give up his employment and go into training as would an older man. At any rate, he will not like it, for he will have reached a very important period in his industrial life. According to my. figures, in eight years 320,000 would be enrolled, of whom 12,000 would be doing eighteen days', and 200,000 seven days', drill a year, and the annual cost would amount to ' millions of pounds. When I spoke of an expenditure of £ 5 4 0 , 0 0 0 at the end of the third year at the rate of 5s. per man per day, I was calculating only the actual pay. The annual cost of 320,000 men upon anything like the basis of the present expenditure-and we are told that it costs £ 2 0 per year to teach a man to be a militiaman under the present system-woul d be enormous. Accoutrements, rifles, stores, ammunition, and other things would have to be provided, and the expense would run and into millions. But the Prime Minister says that 800,000 men can be obtained, drilled, and made effective for £ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0, although it costs £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year now for 20,000 men! The Minister of Defence admitted that it would cost ^""5 per head for members of the National Guard, for in0 0 0 for struction and the central administration only. Even that would amount to £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 for the 120,000 men at the end of the third year. I asked him the difference between the cost of a militiaman ancl a National Guardsman, and he said that while I the one cost £ 2 0 , the other would cost £5 per annum for administration and instruction only. But assuming that there would never be more than 320,000 men at any one time uncler training, at £ 5 a head for instruction and administration only, with no provision for rifles, accoutrements, stores, ammunition, and all the We other paraphernalia, the cost would be £ t , 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum on the Minister's own showing! Yet the Prime Minister savsUltimately we may see .a time arriye when, reckoning men under forty, we shall have 800,000 who are either in or have passed through the ranks. We estimate that 800,000 men can be obtained, disciplined, drilled, and made effective for £1,200,000 a year, as against the present defence expenditure of £800,000 a year.",23
112,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member is calculating on the whole 800,000 men being under training at once, whereas, as a matter of fact, there would never be more than 80,000 under training at one time.",23
113,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"At any rate, 40,000 per year for eight years makes a total of 320,000 men. How 80,000 is arrived at I cannot understand, seeing that there are 40,000 of eighteen years, and the compulsory training is for eighteen days during the first three years, and seven days' training during the remaining five years. Mr 'DEAKIN - There is not the same expenditure on the others, while on many there would be no expenditure.",23
114,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I should like to know how the honourable member brings the cost down to £1,200,000, seeing that it costs £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 now for 20,000 men. After looking into it, although I have not lseen able to go into the details, I am convinced that the scheme, so far as I have been able to understand it, will come to nothing. It will break down of its own weight. It makes one smile to readthe penalties for non-attendance. The first is the loss of the right to vote. That, on theface of it , appears a great disability. Will the Labour Party support that?",24
115,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Certainl y not; but it should not be forgotten that youths of eighteen have not the right to vote.,24
116,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"A youth of eighteen is not far from the age when he will have the right to vote, but as he has not a vote until he is twenty-one years of age, it must mean that he will bq permanently disqualified from voting.",24
117,Mr ROBERTS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Fift y per cent, of those who have the right to vote do not exercise it.",24
118,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That may be so; but there would be a great clamour if we attempted to take that right from them. What would happen if the Act were passed, and the honourable member for Hume, or any member of the Labour Party, for example, found in his electorate, just prior to an election, a large number of persons disfranchised because they had not enrolled, in the National Guard? How long would it be, with a House constituted as it is now, before the Act would be repealed? The threat that the youth who refuses to enroll will not be eligible for an old-age pension is the most amusing of all. If anv one said to a young man of eighteen, "" If you do not enroll, you will lose your right to an old-age pension,"" his reply would be, "" Do not insult me; I do not think of qualifying for an old age pension. My intention is to win a position in the world, and to make myself independent of such assistance."" Furthermore, those who do not enroll are not to be eligible for positions in the Public Service. I do not know whether that threat would force persons to enroll; certainly the other two would be ineffective. I have investigated the financial side of the scheme, and I find that last year the cost of paying the existing militia was only £115,000. Yet, any one listening to the speeches of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, would have thought that a great saving would have been effected by not paying these men. Although the National Guard is not to be paid, the expenditure upon clothing, ammunition, rifles, and encampments, would be at the same rate as now, unless some change of administration results in greater economy, for which, no doubt, there is some room. The Prime Minister told us that a National Guard of 80,000 men would cost £ 8 1 9 , 0 0 0 , while the cost of our present force, of about 20,000 men, is £ 6 9 6 , 0 0 0 . The Prime Minister's estimate of the total military expenditure-includin g special defence provision-for the third year of the new arrangement, is £ 1 , 0 7 4 , 0 0 0 , and, in addition, £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 is set down as the contribution under the Naval Agreement, £ 6 0 , 5 2 4 for local Naval Forces, and £ 4 7 1 , 2 0 0 for the new naval flotilla, making a total expenditure of £1,805,724 . I notice with pleasure that the Prime Minister has not yet decided to terminate the Naval Agreement. The new scheme of a Nations I Guard, the Minister of Defence informs us, cannot be brought into, working order for two or three years to come, and the decade for which the Naval Agreement has force will be almost at an end then. I should like to know how the great difference between an expenditure of £1,805,72 4 for 80,000 men, and an expenditure of £ 6 9 6 , 0 0 0 for 20,000 men has been arrived at. The cost of maintaining the Central Administration, the Head-Quarters, Military Districts, the Ordnance Department, the Instructional Staff, the Accounts and Pay Department, and the Rifle Range Staff, is to be the same under the new system as now, although twice as many men will have to be dealt with during the first year and six times as many at the end of the third vear.",24
119,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,There is to be an alteration of system.,24
120,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is proposed to reduce the expenditure on the permanent men employed at the forts and in instructional work from £ 1 0 6 , 0 0 0 to £ 5 ° > o o c > When I was Minister of Defence, I found it very difficult to reduce this branch to its present limits. The reduction was made against the wishes of the General Officer Commanding; but was necessitated by want of funds. I question if it is possible to make a further reduction combined with efficiency. We have no information as to how it is to be made, and, indeed, no one seems to be responsible for the figures which have been given. TBe present cost of camps and schools of instruction is, at a low estimate, 5s. per man per day, not including any pay, though the actual cost is nearer 6s. or 7s. The penditure last year was about £29,000, .and at the end of the third year for 120,000 men for eighteen days would come to £540,000. But the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence allow only ,£85,000.",24
121,Colonel FOXTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is without providing for pay.,25
122,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes . figures cover merely travelling expenses, rations, and other outgoings in connection with encampments. The honourable and learned member for Flinders in his amendment asks us to affirm the truism that "" the defence of Australia depends primarily upon the control of the seai."" None will deny that. It is a proud thing for us to be able to say that our country has had command of the sea for centuries. Under the Naval Agreement we are a shareholder in the British Navy, holding a i-i5oth share. Therefore, when we speak of it as "" our Navy,"" we are, if not telling the whole truth, telling some of it. We have an interest in every British warship afloat.",25
123,Mr FOWLER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,But what control have we in their management ?,25
124,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"None ; just as we have no control in the management of the mail steamers. When we agree for the performance; of a. mail or any other service, we do not stipulate for the internal management of the steamers. The British Government have undertaken to perform certain services, and so long as they are performed, the contract into which we have entered is being fulfilled. I am surprised that my honourable; friend, who has himself come from that grand Old Country whence my father came, which we are accustomed to think of as Home, should make such an observation. We are not receiving from the Mother Country assistance to which we are not entitled. We are rather like a son in his father's house, who does not regard his dependence as humiliating, but is proud of it, and glad to be of service to his parent and to his home.",25
125,Mr FOWLER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I wish to relieve the weary Titan of part of his load.,25
126,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That could be done in a way of which the Home authorities will approve, and not only in the way favoured by the honourable member's party, independently of whether satisfaction is given or not.",25
127,Mr FOWLER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,But agreement was signified.,25
128,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes ; that is exso, and is satisfactory as far as it goes. However, that is not the point with which I am dealing. My views on naval defence were expressed six years or more ago, when Minister of Defence; in a. minute, addressed by me to the then Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, dated 15th March, 1902, and I have seen no reason to change them. That, of course, is not The put forward as a virtue, because, in a new country, we very often have reason to change our mind. In the present case, hTvevei, I remain practically of the same opinion; and if I see any reason to change it, I shall do so, and give the reason. Probably some honourable members have read these words of mine before, but still 1 think that they should be placed on record, even though they are not in accordance with Ihe opinions of some honourable members on the question. Of the permanent naval defence of the Empire, I saidIn regard to Defence, we must altogether get rid of the idea that we have different interests to those of the rest of the Empire, and we must look at the matter from a broad common standpoint. If the British nation is at war, so are we; if it gains victories or suffers disasters, so do we, and, therefore, it is of the same vital interest to us as to the rest of the Empire that our supremacy on the ocean shall be maintained. There is only one sea to be supreme over, and we want one' fleet to be mistress pver that sea. We are bound also to consider and to full y realise that we belong to a nation which for centuries has been mistress of the sea, and that the position we occupy in Australia today in being all British territory, and having always enjoyed peace and security, is absolutely attributable to the protection given to us by the British flag.",25
129,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I hope that bound the Ministrv at the time !,25
130,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It was not submitted to Ministers, as far as I knowWe are accustomed to travel about the world for the purpose of trade or in pursuit of pleasure, and to feel when we visit foreign countries that our lives and property are secure and in specially safe keeping. We then realise f u l ly the great privilege and advantage of being a British subject, and feel proud when we see the flag of our Motherland everywhere in evidence, ready, willing, and able to protect us. Of course, the retort to such sentiments these, from a section of this House, is they seem to infer that we should pay others to defend us. I do not at all agree with that view. As I said just now, we are a young nation, somewhat like the in the house of his parent, dependent to a large extent, but helping wherever we can. On the same occasion I saidIt is, I think, our plain duty to take a part in the additional obligations cast upon the £ 3 0 8 , 0 0 0 ; or, a total of £1,277,500. Mother Country by the expansion of the pire, ancl the extra burdens cast upon her maintaining our naval supremacy. It would be advisable that means should provided for training boys in Canada, Australia, :ind other places, and for the drafting into ture of £ 3 4 6 , 0 0 0 . the Navy of a certain numbeT annually, greater facilities might possibly be given for omcers entering the Navy. By these means personnel of the Navy would consist to some stroyer extent of British subjects from different of the Empire, and this might in time have bourne, the effect of a greater personal interest in the Navy being taken by people living outside the for each of the other States. British Isles than has hitherto been the case when all have been recruited from the Mother Country. As to the harbour defence scheme proposed by the Prime Minister, and approved by Admiralty, I regard it as workable; and, so far as it goes, I can give it general proval. It overcomes one great difficulty, which was foreseen by every one who has looked into the matter, namely, the officerI ing and manning of the ships. memorandum of 15th March, 1902, above coasts; referred to, I used almost the identical words which were used by the Prime ister. I said I am not prepared to recommend under existprotection. ing conditions the establishment of an tralian Navy. Even if it were established, urn afraid it would not be very efficient, for besides the enormous cost of replacing the from time to time with more modern ships, a little secunty. there would be no change for the officers crews, who would go on year after year in same ships, subject to the same influences, and, I fear, with deteriorating effects. The Prime Minister, on page 9 of pamphlet containing his speech, used wordsI think that the more honourable members reflect upon it the more they will see how difficult must be the condition of a little locked navy,"" if one may so call it, of a""small defence flotilla cut off by itself, 'its officers removed from the pc ssibilities of promotion the idea that the or advancement, except by the slow and often unsatisfactory process of seniority, and few opportunities to keep themselves abreast of the rapid advances made in their branches of the service. It will be seen that the Prune Minister reaas lized the same difficulty that I have rethat ferred to, namely, that the officers would, as it were, "" g o to seed,"" in a. little land-locked navy. This difficulty has been got over by the proposals of the son Admiralty, which have now been submitted to the Government. The flotilla is intended to consist of six destroyers, costing £473)5°° j nine submarines, costing £ 4 9 6 , 0 0 0 ; and two depot ships, costing I Emsuppose that is the cost in England, where, in doubtless, the vessels could be built more cheaply than in Australia; and, therefore, be we may put the cost down at the round sum of £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0, with an annual expendiFor this expenditure and we shall have fifteen fighting ships for the harbour protection, giving, say, one defor each capital city, two parts submarines for Sydney, two for Meltwo for Brisbane, and one I suppose that the estimate is l o w ; but, though the cost may prove larger, it is certainly a step in the right direction. This force, of course, will be of no use except for the the purpose of local harbour defence; it will be useless to protect our floating trade apthroughout the world, and can only be relied on in time of attack to prevent invasion, and the raiding of our' ports. What mean is that, with such a force, we canIn my not strike anywhere except on our own but, for all that, such a flotilla will be a valuable asset in time of war, Minbecause the more important cities of the Commonwealth will have some Of course, no one can Aussay exactly how effective such a force I will be, but, together with the land fleet forces, it will do good service in affording But, after all, the deand struction of the enemy wherever he may be the found is what we have to aim at in national defence. What would be the use of our being able to repel a cruiser or two for a the while, if disaster had fallen on the these British Navy, and, with the destruction of our commerce, we were isolated from the world, and liable to invasion? I am "" land willing to help in promoting the local of the principal cities of and men Australia; but I have no sympathy with present . proposals with mean the national defence of our commerce from the only enemy we have to fear-th enemy from over the ocean. I notice that the Imperial Government do not wish be understood as encouraging any idea they desire the existing Naval Agreement to not gained in a day. be broken; and I hope they will never tertain such a thought. This engagement was entered into by both Houses of this Parliament, after an agreement been made in London; and should have been no whisper of any undoing by the Prime Minister, unless approval of Parliament was first obtained. As a matter of fact, this Naval Agreement has never had a fair chance from the ginning ; and its usefulness has been paired to a large extent by the suggestion that it' was to be annulled. I am sure that, the Prime Minister is actuated by patriotic desire .to do what he thinks best, but I very much regret that he ever had anything to do with a suggestion to abandon the Naval Agreement of his own notion, without consulting Parliament, because he might have proposed additional defence without interfering with the scheme already agreed on, and approved of by both Parliament and the people Speaking generally, I think the changes proposed the Government have not been well thought Act, out, and that they are not suited to our conditions. In my opinion, the Government ought to have left the foundations alone, and .taken their stand on the Act of 1903, as amended. We should have restored the General Officer Commanding, and enthuthat siastically set ourselves to improve the ganization, by the exchange of officers and by visits of inspection from those accustomed to war Had this plan been pursued, I think a great deal of good would have been done; at any rate, we to the enemy. should have been going forward on lines to which we have been accustomed, and which we well understand. As it is, all do. is uncertainty; my own belief is that the proposed system will never come into force. Even if we carry it now, two or'three years and reasonable judgment. must elapse before it is consummated; I am quite sure that it will be undone becalled fore then. In the meantime, however, we shall have uncertainty-chao s will vail, as it has prevailed for the past two years, in our Defence Forces. I regret very much the continued desire to tinker with things that are going on well. We had a good Naval Agreement} and a good Defence Act ; and all that was reas quired was good administration. I hope Sir John Forrest. e the Minister does not think I am trying to unduly blame him, because, although he is to responsible for a good deal of what has that occurred, we all know perfection is If , however, enthose responsible are always turning their eyes in other directions than the direction before them, they cannot attain success. If had the Minister had devoted himself to the there organization in existence, and had given as much enthusiasm and work to the building the up of the organization on the lines he found already prepared, he would not have said what I think he was very unwise and benot justified in saying the other day. I imam afraid that the Prime Minister has that turn of mind that cannot leave matters as they are. Reformers are always desiring a something different from that which exists, is and, though that may be something good in its way, the action taken often leads to unsatisfactory results. The Prime Minister, with all his abilities, and many estimable qualities. does not seem to know how to ""let well alone."" He had bequeathed to. him a good Naval Agreement, built on a solid foundation, which, at its termination ' in 1903 could have been altered and. imby proved, and - he had a good Defence suited to our requirements and conditions. As I have already said, ill that was required was good administration. I do not believe in hysterical or panic legislation. One would think that we were on the eve of a great national calamitysomething terrible was coming upon us. orand that every man must be at once armed to the teeth. That is what the Government proposal means, although, whil'o all this is going on on land, the coasts of Australia are to be left practically - open I hope that we shall have none of this hysterical legislation. We have plenty of practical work to Let us go on as self-reliant, practical people-, trying not to please one party or another, but to work on the basis of a firm Why should and we, in this off-hand and hurried way, be upon to subscribe to the principle of compulsory service or training as put foj'T preward by the Prime Minister? Who has asked for its application to Australia? The Prime Minister has evolved this scheme in his own mind, ancl, having got his fidus Achates, the Minister of Defence, to help him, and to swallow all his former opinions to naval defence, he appeals to us to approve of it at a time when we shoulcl Bedealing with more practical and more pressing matters. Why should the honourable member for West Sydney be a guide to us - on this subject? Is he a great military authority, or one with any special military knowledge and experience? Is he going to revolutionize Australia,.,arid to place it on the highway to prosperity and to an adequate system of defence, by paying the men of the National Guard the sweater's pittance of is. 3d. per day ? We are told that we are not to follow the lines on which we have worked for nearly half a century. We are to abandon all we have done, and build on a new foundation. Notwithstanding all his ability, I do not think that the Prime Minister has any right to coerce us into this action. He has not consulted the people of Australia. Before he - calls upon us to proceed further with this measure, let him consult the people, and if he comes back with a verdict in favour of it , he will then have some justification for the course he is asking us to pursue. At present he has no mandate from the people for compulsory service), and no right to ask us to approve of it.",25
131,Mr WISE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Were the people consulted with regard to the Naval Agreement?,28
132,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That was merely the continuance of an agreement, made at the termination of one that had been in existence for fi f teem years. The Prime Minister has no right to expect us to consider or adopt his ideas with regard to compulsory service until he has a mandate from the people. Let us stand firm and self-reliant, following the well-trodden paths of experience and knowledge, and always ""hands across the sea"" with our kinsmen in the Old Land.",28
133,Mr JOHNS ON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Lang) [4.45] - The Minister of Defence, in moving the second - reading of this Bill , said that the Defence Forces were in a much better condition under State control than they are today.",28
134,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,No ; I said that they are better now than they were then.,28
135,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the Minister will turn to the report of the opening sentences of his speech, I think he will find that he partially admitted that our defence system was more satisfactory under State administration than it has been since. whole of his speech was directed to an effort to show that the forces were in a most unsatisfactory condition, and that it was because that state of affairs was growing worse year after year that the Government had found it' necessary to bring down a Bill providing for a complete reorganization. The whole aim of the Minister was to show that the psychological moment had arrived for stepping in and preventing the process of deterioration continuing indefinitely. I think, therefore, that I was correct in saying that the Minister in the course of his speech admitted that the defence system was better under State control than it has been since.",28
136,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"My statement was absolutely the reverse, but I said that the system today was hopeless.",28
137,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The gist of the honourable member's remarks was in the direction of showing that our defence system was becoming hopelessly worse year after year, and that the time had arrived for its reorganization on a new basis.",28
138,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Would the honourable member undertake the work of reorganization?,28
139,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There may be need for a slight alteration of the present system, but certainly not for a revolution. I do not think that there is any real necessity for a large citizen army in Australia. As long as the British Navy exists a force of from 40,000 to 50,000 will be ample to meet the most extreme emergency.",28
140,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That would be the war establishment ?,28
141,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Certainly . It is admitted by all recognised authorities that as long as Great Britain has command of the seas the largest force that an enemy could land here would be 1,000 men, and that that force could be landed only with the assistance of, possibly, four cruisers that might manage to evade the vigilance of the scouts of the British Fleet. Even if we were to arm every man, woman and child in Australia we could not hope to resist a real invasion without the protection of the British Fleet. To resist a serious invasion the whole of the troops that we could put into the field would be absolutely inadequate whilst we have so much unoccupied territory and such a sparse population as we have at present. We have close at hand little Java with a population of 30,000,000; Japan, with a population of over Biit the 46,000,000, and other contiguous nations with their teeming millions, whilst on our vast continent we have a population below that of London- a population of a little over 4,000,000. We could not, with any land force that we could put in the field,. possibly hold this - country for twenty-four hours against hostile invasion. But would any nation that is likely to be engaged in war with 'Great Britain be able to spare the vessels ancl the naval force necessary to bring an invading army to our shores? To imagine such a thing we have to presuppose the destruction of the whole British Fleet. That is unthinkable, and therefore it is simply a waste of time to attempt to deal seriously with the Ministerial proposal. The Minister of Defence has said that it is the duty of every man who has interests in the country to prepare to defend "" his hearth and his home."" That, after all, is a mere platitude. Every man recognises that he has such a duty. The same duty applies to the protection of property, but would any one suggest that it is the duty of every citizen to enlist in the police force? It is the duty of every citizen to defend his hearth and his home from burglars, but we have a police force trained specially for the service, and Ave should haA'e a military force trained to protect the lives and the property of the people against outside aggression. There is no necessity for a compulsory system of training under which eA'ery man in the community up to sixty years of age will be enrolled in either the National Guard or the Reserve. If it is necessary for every citizen to enroll in the defence forces to protect his hearth and his home from foreign invasion, then it is equally necessary that e\'ery citizen should enroll in the police force to protect his household from thieA'es and robbers. Yet, even the present GoA'ernment are hardlv likely to table such a proposal. Although they claim this precious scheme as their own, the credit or discredit for originating it really belongs to the honourable member for West Sydney, Avho propounded it 'in 1901. At that time, the present Minister of Defence Avas absolutely against it, ancl his speeches then are a complete ansAver to his arguments now. It Avill be interesting to read quotations from his criticisms of the scheme then put fonvard. According to Hansard, he said, on 5th August, 1903The honourable member for Bland made reference to New Zealand, but I find that the-Premier of New Zealand, in a memorandum which he wrote for submission to the Conference of Prime Ministers, pointed out that the want of capital has prevented him from dealing with rifle clubs and similar institutions as he desired to do. . . . Manv of the 23,000 men provided for on the Estimates might as well be armed Will blunderbusses as with the rifles they have. Mr Johnson. The Minister's object was to shoAv that the existing system was all right, but that the real trouble Avas one of equipment.",28
142,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It Avas very bad at that time.,29
143,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The complaint was, not that the system Avas Avrong, or rhat the Militia or Volunteer systems should be altered-the men were anxious and willing to enrol-bu t that the administration Avas Avrong, just as it is at - present, and the men could not get the rifles. The Minister Avent on to sayWhv therefore do not honourable gentlemen do the right thing, and assist the Minister to obtain a sufficient sum for the purchase of the necessary rifles?",29
144,Mr WATSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,We will assist him if he proposes to provide for their purchase.,29
145,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Will the honourable member vote money for the purchase of more rifles?,29
146,Mr WATSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Certainly .,29
147,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that the honourable member for Bland and other honourable members believe that it is wiser to arm those who are prepared to train themselves for the defence of the State with modern rifles, and to furnish them with ammunition, than to adopt the method of conscription proposed by the honourable member for West Sydney. The Minister applied the term "" conscription "" to this very proposal Avhen it Avas put foiAvard by the honourable member for West Sydney, although he noAv says that it is not conscription, and that that term could not properly be applied to it. I haA-e made those quotations to show that the Minister at that time condemned the very system which he noAV attempts to father, and that the present proposals are not his OAvn, but that the credit for them belongs to the honourable member for West Sydney. The Prime Minister is also a convert to the new scheme. Not long ago, he Avas diametrically opposed to it. In September, 1906, AA'hen the military estimates Avere being considered, he saidWe have had a policy which, though it has varied, has gradually been taking a fixed shape. The present Estimates represent a continuation and the broadening of the policy which had previously been followed, whilst the report of our Military Committee adopts that system as the basis of any recommendation AA'hich it makes. In that speech, made three months before the last general election, so far from proposing an alteration in the system that then obtained, he advocated a "" continuation "" of it. In face of that, he noAv puts fonvard proposals which are an entire reversal of the attitude and view that he then took. If he changed his A'ieAvs, as expressed in September, 1906, before the general election, he had an opportunity on the hustings of notifying the electors of the fact. If he did alter his views during that time, it was his duty to make the fact known to the electors, and to ask their endorsement of the new policy which he now springs upon Parliament. He pointed out in the same speech that the various recommendations of the Australian experts involved an outlay for military and naval defence of £1,652,0 0 0 per year - At that time, he thought the scheme absolutely impracticable from the stand-point of its nnancial magnitude alone, and considered that the Government were not justified in involving the country in any such large expenditure. He declared that such a scheme was beyond our means. The report of his speech then continues:Mr KING O'MALLEY - It would spell bankruptcy.",29
148,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It would mean the diversion The right honourable member for Swan of a large sum of money from reproductive uses. . . Such an inroad upon the public shown clearly this afternoon that, if finances would meet with the disapproval of the new forces are to be paid at all, an great majority of the people of the country.",30
149,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,No doubt about that.,30
150,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What is the use of a day for the services of the men who reading that?,30
151,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It s use is to show that the Prime Minister put that statement to the country just previous to the last general election, when he, and all the members of his Government, including the Treasurer and the Minister of Defence, had an opportunity of laying before the people the policy which' they now table. So far, however, from putting before the electors a policy of enforced training or conscription as their military policy, they went in the opposite direction and condemned it as too costly, involving too great an inroad upon the pockets of the great majority of the taxpayers.",30
152,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I did not mention the subject at all.,30
153,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have quoted the Prime Minister's announcement, and the Treasurer is a member of the Government who now bring forward a policy diametrically opposed to it.",30
154,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That was not the Prime Minister's policy.,30
155,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The quotation is from the Prime Minister's speech on the military Estimates, as reported in Hansard.",30
156,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They were only a few casual remarks.,30
157,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They were a declaration of unqualified antagonism to the very [44] policy which the Prime Minister now advocates.,30
158,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What did the Prime Minister say at Ballarat?,30
159,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"He said nothing before the elections in approval of the new policy. He said also in 1906We must also consider whether we should not encourage a purely volunteer force, with a view of advancing by steady strides, in connection also with the cadet and similar movements, towards the ideal of universal service. The Postmaster-General will observe that the Prime Minister spoke not . of compulsory service, but of a purelv voluntary serviceWe cannot look forward to an extension of the numbers of our defenders on shore except by curtailment of the expenditure now incurred in connection with some of the paid branches of the Forces. has the expenditure of over £2,250,00 0 will be involved in payment alone, at the rate of 5s. are to be dragooned into military training, without making allowance for the cost of equipment, ammunition, arms, and other warlike paraphernalia. It is well that the contradictory attitudes assumed by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence towards this question, as compared with their previously expressed convictions;, should, at this juncture, be emphasized, because there must be some powerful influence, not apparent on the surface, to account for so violent a transformation in their views. I do not know whether a certain Conference held in Brisbane a little while ago has had anything to do with the new-born military zeal of the present Government, who have sprung these conscription proposals of the honourable member for West Sydney upon the House as an original scheme of their own. I do not know whether the whole of the members of the Labour Party are in agreement with the proposals of the Government or favour the principle of conscription ; but I venture to assert that the majority of working men are against it, and I venture to predict that we shall never see it in operation. I do not believe that it will ever pass into law. I am certain that if an appeal were made to the people on the question, the great majority of them would be found to be absolutely against it. I do not think that either our young or old men desire compulsory military training. There is certainly no evidence of it, and I feel sure that a referendum would show that the vast majority is opposed to a system which is antagonistic to every instinct of the British race. In the past, spontaneous offers of service dn aid of the Mother Country have come from Australians, who have not had military training, but who, from an inborn sense of patriotism, offered themselves for military services, in many instances at considerable personal sacrifice; ancl, if a real necessity were to arise, every Australian would willingly enroll in defence, not merely of this country, but of the Empire. The Minister of Defence has spoken of the inefficiency of our forces, and their deplorable condition, painting a dolorific picture as a plea for his scheme. But the Inspector-General's last report does not justify this pessimistic outlook. It is dated 28th February, 1908, and i'n it Major-General Hoad saysDuring the year the total attendance at inspections was 45,905, and pressed by the evident desire on the part of all ranks to, as far as possible, ensure satisfactory attendances. That does not agree with what the Minister told us.",30
160,Mr ROBERTS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Major-Genera l Hoad refers to his own special inspections; the Minister referred to the general parades of the year.,31
161,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Thos e who witnessed the recent reviews in Sydney and Melbourne must have felt proud of the appearance of the men who took part in them. Even the military and rtaval men who were present expressed themselves in the most flattering terms concerning the appearance, deportment, and marching of our troops. - To continue my quotationMore specially is this pleasing from the fact that at certain periods of the year there were many reasons such as drought, shearing, harvesting, which ordinarily militate against ance. Major-General Hoad speaks of the satisfactory attendance, notwithstanding the combination of circumstances which militated against that state of things. He continuesAs showing also the great interest taken, occasionally men rode distances of fifty , and even up to ninety miles, to attend inspection parades. Those statements are not evidence of want of interest in military matters on die part of our militia and volunteers, but point rather to an ""eagerness to become proficient in military duties. The report continuesI am of opinion that war and the preparation of training for war should, like other business propositions, be carried out ou practical lines, and I have, as far as possible, kept this view in holding inspections. The Defence of Australia must primarily be the citizen soldier, and, in time of peace, responsibility for command and administration should, as far as practicable, be placed in the hands of officers of the Citizen Forces, who, without doubt, would be charged with such responsibilities in time of war. Later on, Major-General Hoad saidDuring the past twelve months I have, with few exceptions, inspected the whole of the units of the Commonwealth Military Forces. I was present during the whole of the period of the annual camp of training in New South Wales. I also attended the Light Horse camps in Victoria and South Australia, and towards the end of the year visited - Port Darwin. When the extent 'of the Commonwealth and the distances between units are taken into consideration, it will be easily understood that the work of inspection has necessitated almost uninterrupted my travelling, the distance covered having been I was greatly imabout 50,000 miles. The Minister says that it is because of the unwillingness of our young men to undergo military training that he proposes to substitute for voluntary service the conscription system, or, as he does not like that term-notwithstandin g that he was the first to apply it to the system here-compulsor y military training. But Major-General Hoad saysDuring the tours of inspection throughout the several States I met with the greatest cordiality. This I recognise as evidence of the desire on the part of the people of Australia to co-operate with their Military Forces. The Inspector-General has had opportunities of observation which have been denied to the Minister, and, having met all sorts and conditions of persons, in every part of Australia, he says that he was received with the greatest cordiality, and looks upon that as evidence of the desire of the public attendto co-operate with the Military Forces.",31
162,Mr ROBERTS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is only an expression of opinion by Major-General Hoad. I think that he has mistaken merely characteristic hospitality.,31
163,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I shall, later, show that there is ground for believing that his view is the correct one. Unfortunately, the Department has no authority to recruit. It is all very well to say that our young men will not offer themselves for military training, but how can they do so when there is no authority for recruiting? On this point let me quote the report againThe following shows the establishment authorized for 1906-7, and strength on the 31st December, 19074 of the Permanent, Militia, and Volunteer Forces :- ment. Permanent Forces ... 1,387 Militia Forces ... 16,635 ... 15,321 Volunteer Forces ... 5,919 --- 4,926 Total ... ... 23)94' --- >575 2I It will be seen that the Permanent and Militia Forces were 5 and 8 per cent, respectively short of the establishment, and the Volunteer Forces 17 per cent. The establishment provided on the Estimates for this year, 1907-8, is :Permanent Forces ... Militia Forces ... ... Volunteer Forces ... ...",31
164,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member have says that 50,000 men are necessary.",32
165,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I say that' the utspeaking, most total necessary to meet any possible emergency would not exceed 50,000. The standard Major-General addsBut authority to recruit to this establishment has not yet been given. Therefore it is ' hardly fair to blame the public for lack of interest in military matters.",32
166,Mr ROBERTS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That part of the report is a severe indictment of the administration,32
167,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The whole trouble is due largely to the parsimony of the Government in not providing sufficient funds to keep the forces up to the proper strength, and in not properly equipping 'and arming men. There' have been most alarming reports from responsible officers as to the condition of some of the vital equipment of the forces. The Prime Minister, amongst others, has pointed out that the condition of the fixed defences was, for a long time, most deplorable; in fact, the honourable gentleman, on one occasion, said that they were in such a state as to'be more dangerous to the defenders than to the enemy. I do not know whether any practical steps have been taken to improve matters; and we ought to have some information on the subject. Certainly only two or three years ago, the Prime Minister painted a most alarming picture, and the present Minister of Defence has himself more than once complained of the lack of rifles, while members of rifle clubs are calling out for ranges and tubes. How can it be expected that men, who are willing to equip themselves for military service [44]- 2 by proficiency in rifle shooting, and in other ways,' can carry out theix desire when the wherewithal, which rests on a hard cash basis, is not forthcoming? The Minister of Defence, instead of railing at the want of patriotism on the part of the men EstablishStrength. of the country, should really blame his own --- 1,328 administration. I do not place the whole of the responsibility on the present Minister individually, because his predecessors were no less culpable ancl negligent than are. the present Government in the matter of providing sufficient arms and equipment and facilities for training and instruction. We find that the Inspector-General is not ... 1,419 in agreement with the Minister as to the ... 17.777 failure of the existing system, because, in ... 5,928 his report, in speaking of the training and 25,124 efficiency of the troops, he saysMy inspections and the associated manoeuvres satisfied me that the troops have done and are doing much good work, and that, generally they are very well up in their duties. Much, however, remains to be done before the of proficiency which may reasonably be expected can be attained. If the work be continued with the same untiring perseverance as is generally shown, and greater facilities given foT practical instruction, the result will be to make the Citizen Forces still more efficient. That is a very optimistic picture, and a'uite a contrast to that drawn by the Minister of Defence in his second-reading speech; indeed, the words of the Inspector-General are a practical condemnation of the proposed change of policy; because it appears that all that is necessary is financial assistance to enable the existing forces to be brought up to their proper strength and made more efficient for the effective defence of Australia. Every word of the Inspector-General's report confirms the idea that the present system is the right system, and that all that is required is money to extend it, . and make it more effective. Speaking of the Australian Light Horse, the Inspector-General says The personnel of the Light Horse is good, and generally the men are well mounted. The new bandolier equipment has now been issued, and appears to be well suited to requirements. The Light Horse do not as a rule, bearing in mind the number of days' training and the instruction available, leave much room for adverse criticism, and all ranks are keen to improve their efficiency. Here we have a similar statement in connection .with another arm of the service; and the opinions expressed are diametrically opposed to those put forward by the Minister. In regard to the infantry, the Inspector-General says The personnel is good. There has been a distinct advance in practical training, and moie attention has been given to manoeuvres, outposts, marches, &c. It is evident that all ranks take great interest in their work. Here we have the same 'emphasis on the interest that men of all ranks take in their work. In regard to rifle cl'ubs, the Inspector-General saysI attended the Annual Rifle Association ings held at Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane,. Adelaide, and Launceston, and was pleased to note the satisfactory manner in which these meetings were conducted The visit of sentative Rifle Team from Great Britain gave a decided impetus to rifle shooting throughout the Commonwealth. Surprise was expressed by members of the British Team that rifle shooting was so far advanced and so universal throughout Australia. In another paragraph, he saysThere has been a manifest desire on the part of the Rifle Club members to attend; and at the daylight parades, when asked to do so, they have always taken part with the other troops in field operations and manoeuvres. This has often provided opportunities for demonstrating their usefulness. In addition to the ordinary infantry field work, they have sometimes been used as mounted infantry with satisfactory results, and T am sure that, with but little training, many of the members of Rifle Clubs would be as well fitted to take their places in the ranks or to carry out any other duties which may be assigned to them. Then, further onThese men really constitute a valuable reserve to the existing Force, and in time of emergency would, with very little training, be fit to again take their places in the ranks. Here is an opportunity to increase the available military force for active service in time of war. I suppose that we could count on at least 100,000 men belonging to .rifle clubs, - who would be more or less, and mostly more, proficient in the use of the rifle; and, speaking as a layman who has taken opportunities to ascertain the opinions of military experts, I should say that here we have a force of volunteers which could with great advantage be utilized in time of emergency. If our present volunteer system is thought to be incompatible with the system of a partially-paid militia, it might be advisable to abolish the ordinary volunteers, and establish a general partially-paid service, so organized that in time of war the strength could be increased to the necessary number's. addition, there is, or would be in a short time, a reserve, as I say, of at least 100,000 riflemen of the different clubs, who would augment the militia; and such a force in time of war would be more than ample for all the requirements of the Commonwealth without calling on other citizens. But in order to make riflemen of Mf. Johnson. service in time of necessity, there must be opportunities for training and practice; and ranges should be provided at every suitable spot, contiguous to railways and other lines of communication where practicable, so that valuable time may not be lost by the men in travelling. T am perMeet- fectly satisfied, from my contact with members of rifle clubs, that if ranges were provided at suitable places reasonably a repre- near the most populous centres, every Saturday afternoon and holiday would find men making shooting their hobby, and enrolling themselves. Most of them would, in course of time, become crack shots, and such a force, combined with the militia, would be of incalculable value.",32
168,Mr STORRER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They will be crack shots only at fixed ranges.,33
169,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"But riflemen will, in most cases, endeavour to make themselves proficient in shooting at movable, as well as at fixed targets. I know of riflemen so enthusiastic that they have erected targets in the backyards of their premises, and miniature ranges in their basements. The desire to become expert shots is natural to the young men of the country. And, given encouragement, they would take to rifle shooting as readily as to cricket, football, running, and yachting. Another subject of complaint is the shortage of officers and military instructors. I am glad to note that a recommendation has been made that the instructional staff shall be increased, but I do not know what steps the Minister proposes to take with a view to giving effect to that recommendation. In the absence of an adequate staff of officers and instructors, we cannot expect our volunteers to receive the training which they seek, and which is necessary to make them proficient. Regarding this shortage of officers, Major-General Hoad writes in his reportThe shortage of Officers of the Citizen Forces is a matter of great moment, and no Force under such conditions can be said to be in a satisfactory state. I consider that the frequent visits of Commandants to the' various parts of their commands should do much to remedy a state of affairs the seriousness of which cannot be overIn estimated. The Minister might, with profit to the community, give some consideration to fhis question. Without a sufficient number of officers and instructors, our Military Forces, no matter what theix numerical strength might be, would be little better than a rabble in action. With regard to schools and classes of instruction, the Inspector General has something of very great interest to say. He writes, at page 17 of fhis reportThere is an evident desire on the part of the officers throughout the Commonwealth to improve their Military knowledge, but many officers in the country expressed to me their inability to attend Schools of Instruction, which, as a general rule, have been held in or near the principal in each State. They could attend local Schools or Classes if such were held. I consider such Schools or Classes should, as far as possible, be arranged, and that they should be carried out in accordance with a syllabus of progressive work, prepared^ and published ' beforehand. Where it is not possible for officers to attend 'Continuous Schools or Classes, arrangements should be made to hold them on evenings, Saturday afternoons, and half-holidays (as may be most convenient to the officers), extending over a period of two or three months. The Regulations should, I consider, be amended accordingly. On the next page, we find a reference to the delay that has arisen in connection with the supply of arms and equipmentThe following examples will serve to show the - delays which have occurred under the present - system of relying on oversea supplies for such of our requirements as cannot at present be made in the Commonwealth. Then follows a table showing that eight - quick-firing guns were ordered for use in New South Wales in November, 1904, and that they were not received until January, 1906. Then, again, eight quick-firing guns were ordered for Victoria in 1904, and were delivered as follows-September , 1905, one gun, one carriage, one limber; ""December, 1905-the e months later-si x carriages and six guns; March, 1906, one gun, one carriage, and seven limbers. In November, 1904, four quick-firing guns were ordered for Queensland, were delivered as follows-fou r guns and four carriages in February, 1906, and four limbers in April of the same year. In April, 1905, four quickfiring guns were also ordered for Western Australia. Fifteen months laterin July, 1906-fou r guns were delivered, and in February of the following year the four carriages and limbers came to hand. Under the heading of "" remarks "" we have the statementGuns, Carriages, and Limbers, although ordered in November, 1904, were not received complete until March and (in the case of New South Wales) May, 1906, and even then, owing to the non-receipt of important parts, such as Range Indicators, Fuze Setters, &c, they were not available for use until some time in ^07. As to the guns ordered for Western Australia, the Inspector-General remarksSame remarks apply, except that order was not placed until April, 1905, and that guns and carriages were not received until February, 1907. In these circumstances, how is it possible to have our Military Forces in a complete state of efficiencv ? Is it reasonable to expect our city troops to take an overwhelming interest in their work when the means to make themselves proficient are not provided for them? These facts show that the real trouble lies, not in the present system, but in its administration. In the absence of proper administration, the best-systems in the world must be abortive. No army can possibly be efficient if the sinews of war are withheld ; no army can be efficient when arms, accoutrements, and all the other paraphernalia 'of a military department are withheld. If the Minister would address himself to remedying these obvious defects in the present system, he would render a far greater service to the Commonwealth and those engaged in its defence than by anything he could propose in the nature of a new scheme of compulsory military training.",33
170,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,We do not limit our efforts to that. There is a good deal of other work going on.,34
171,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"My complaint is that these essentials are being neglected-that the Minister is blaming the system when the administration is really at fault. I am referring not to his administration alone, but to the administration of the Department for some years. Some of the matters complained of in Major-General Hoad's report occurred before the honourable member and took office.",34
172,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"TheInspector-General makes a recommendation to the Board, on which there are intelligent and-experienced men, and there is frequently a difference of opinion amongst them in regard to these matters. The honourable member will see that there is a conflict in connection with what he might interpret as the administration. I am not finding fault with the system or the Board, nor do I find any fault with the report; the conflict is inevitable.",34
173,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"-That portion of the report to which I haye just been referring relates to the supply of rifles, ammunition, and quick-firing guns, and to the shortage' of officers and instructors.",34
174,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,There can be no doubt as to the supply of rifles and ammunition; they are all right.,35
175,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If they are, the change must be of recent date, because the honourable gentleman himself has, more than once, complained of the lack of rifles, and also of the character of those supplied. The quality of the ammunition supplied has been the subject of complaint in this House.",35
176,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There are about 24,000 rifles on order, ancl they are coming.",35
177,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They may be here three or four years hence.,35
178,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They are coming now.,35
179,Mr ROBERTS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They may be the quick-firing guns-at the same speed.,35
180,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Quite so. I come now to the condition of the rifle clubs, which should prove a valuable adjunct to our military forces in time of emergency, and ought to receive every encouragement. I have some of these clubs in my electorate, and their general complaint is that there seems to be on the part of the administration a lack of interest in their development. They complain of want of ranges, and that, even where miniature rifle ranges have been set up, tubes cannot be obtained.",35
181,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I think that here. Will the honourable member let me have details of his complaints ?,35
182,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I have communicated with the honourable gentleman on several occasions. v,35
183,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Are there rifle clubs in the honourable member's electorate which cannot obtain Morris tubes?,35
184,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They have been ing promised for months.,35
185,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The rifle clubs must have them by now.,35
186,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not think fhat they have. One club in my electorate promised a dozen tubes, and received, I remember rightly, only two. I cannot tingencies. say whether they have since obtained a further supply. They have probably grown tired of writing to me, because each time that I have received a communication from them. I have preferred a request to the Minister that the tubes should be supplied, and have received the stereotyped replythat they were coming, and that when suffitralia cient were .available they would beforquestion warded.",35
187,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"When the honourable member asked for them first, there were none in Australia. We sent for a supply, I think that when they arrived all demands were met.",35
188,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"When the 500 ordered were about clue, it was complained to me that only two were obtainable.. Those were quite insufficient, and sixty or seventy men were unable to join the club because of the non-arrival of the tubes.",35
189,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If more are wanted, will the honourable member find out and let me know, giving me the name of the club?",35
190,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I shall ascertain if the clubs are supplied according to their requirements, and if they are not I will take the opportunity of reminding the Minister of his promise. On the question of the following supply of rifles for cadets, Major-General Hoad's remarks are instructiveFrancotte Rifles1,900 ordered in April and June of 1906"", received in the Commonwealth from February to July, 1907. 300 ordered in December, 1906, received ini May, 1907. Westley-Richards Rifles1,500 ordered in April, 1906, received in May and July.. 1907. 5,000 ordered in December, 1906; 2,200 ordered in June, 1907-Receive d in January and February, 190S. A long time evidently elapses between orthe tubes are dering and delivery.",35
191,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We propose to cure that by making them here. ' Mr JOHNSON - But it will be a long while before rifles are made here. What should be done, instead of wasting money on revolutionizing the present system, is to devote it towards perfecting the organizations already in existence, and encouragtheir extension, especially in the case of the militia and the rifle clubs. As many ranges as possible ought to be provided. Not only should rifles be furnished in .numbers sufficient for present purposes, was but a reserve stock should be always on if hand to guard against possible conI f we wait for the outbreak of actual hostilities before providing the Military Forces with the equipment that will be found necessary in time of war, the probabilities are that we shalt not get those supplies at all. As a matter of ordinary precaution, it would be wiseto have a sufficient supply on hand in Austo meet emergencies. Dealing with the of organization, Major-General' Hoad saidThere should under any circumstances be a. continuity of policy in connection with the deand fence of the Commonwealth. I think nobody will find fault with that - declaration. If we continually chop and change our policy we shall never .have any system at all worth troubling about. We shall always have greater or less disorganisation. There should, therefore/ be continuity of policy. Major-General Hoad ..goes on to sayIn my opinion a Scheme of Defence based - strategical and other considerations should ready have been decided on, this scheme - carried out as regards establishments of Corps, Guns for Coastal Defences, & c , & c , as were available. . . . Further, it is necessary to discuss and decide what Force is required meet any possible attack as distinguished a probable attack, the Forces to be raised being in accordance with this scheme. To remedy steps should be taken to consider and decide on ten a General Scheme, the Schemes of Defence for of the several States co-ordinating with the General ample Scheme. This General Scheme should be based on-1 . The probable forms of attack. 2. The gency. Forces required to meet attacks either by or sea. 3. The steps required to supply reserves to these Forces in the event of war. 4. The means of sufficiently training the Citizens of Australia so as to be .prepared in addition to any attack. With regard to probable forms of attack, if we were situated like European I could understand it being absolutely necessary to place the greatest reliance upon our military strength and organization our defence, but we inhabit an island conexpenditure. tinent many thousands of miles removed from the base of operations of any posI sible foe, so that the only attack to which we can possibly be subjected will from over the sea. Such an attack, to made in force, must be conducted by a large fleet of ships, carrying an immense number of troops. Such a fleet of troop-ships, carsevered. rying an invading army to our shores, would have to be convoyed by an immense naval fleet to insure its safety. Are we in Ausexists in Australia. tralia prepared to find the means to prevent such an invasion in the only way in which it can be prevented-by providing a fleet at least equal to that of any possible tacking country ? With our population, I not think that we are prepared to do so.",35
192,Mr BAMFORD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Then the honourable member admits the possibility of attack.,36
193,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not admit it while Great Britain retains the command of the sea. I say that it is possible only when the British Navy has been crippled. I cannot conceive that it is possible for any enemy at war with Great Britain to tach from her base of operations in Europe or Asia-and that enemy must be a large naval Power, or we need not fear attacksufficient ships, to convoy the army that it would be necessary to land to take effective possession of Australia. I certainly cannot conceive that.the people of Australia would"" be willing to subject themselves to the enormous load of taxation necessary to provide a fleet capable of meeting such an attack. It is therefore not the question of land on defence with which we ought to mainly alconcern ourselves. We should not neglect being that question, but we have to look at the funds probabilities of the situation, with, of course, a due regard to its possibilities. to But, even having regard to the extreme from possibilities of invasion with which we are this, likely to be confronted, within the next or fifteen years, a war strength 50,000 men would be more than to meet any possible emerTherefore, if we are to effectively land protect Australia, even if we make Australian defence a. purely Australian question, best relying solely upon our own resources, and meet disregarding the existence of the British Navy and its duty to defend Australia in common with other parts of the Empire, that defence must be by means, not of an nations, army, but of a navy.",36
194,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And to duplicate the British for Navy would be rather a stupid form of,36
195,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Unquestionably ; but am looking at the question now from the point of view only of those "" Little Ausbe tralians,"" who raise the cry of "" Australia be for the Australians,"" and dislike the I m perial connection. Some of them covertly, and some openly, express a desire to see it That is an open secret. I believe that the Minister has more than once referred to the fact that such a sentiment Whether it obtains to any large extent I am not prepared to say, but I do nat think it does. We have had exhibitions in this Chamber of deepatrooted dislike to anything British. We saw do ample evidence of it in the Tariff debates. The honourable member for Batman, by the way, turned the debate on this Bill more or less into a fiscal debate, but I should like to remind the honourable member of the anti-British sentiment that was always displayed when the question of preference was discussed in connection with the Tariff.",36
196,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member for deBatman voted for preference to Britain.,36
197,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Minister and his colleagues, times out of number, voted against it, and showed in that way their antipathy to Britain in the matter of commerce.",36
198,Mr STORRER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member knows that that is not correct.,37
199,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Wheneve r there was an opportunity of giving Australia an advantage at the expense of Great Britain, it was taken by the Minister and his colleagues, by their direct supporters, by those who sit in the Ministerial corner, and even by some who sit on this side of the chamber. The Australian spirit was exhibited as against the British spirit all through the debates. I refer to that matter merely as one of the phases of thatanti-British sentiment which crops up now and then, and which is largely responsible for. the introduction of the defence scheme at this juncture. I do not think that, outside of Victoria, and outside the brain of the honourable member for West Sydney, there has been any great outcry for a purely Australian system of defence. Outside of Victoria, and, indeed, of a small section in Victoria, no exception has been taken to the subsidy now paid to Great Britain for the protection,, of the Australian Imperial Squadron. I am inclined to believe that there is at work in this State a force which was largely responsible for the utterances of the Prime Minister when he misrepresented Australia at the recent Imperial Conference as being opposed to the payment of the subsidy. I do not think that, outside of that small section within this State-and I believe mostly within this city-an y considerable section of the people have ever demurred in the slightest to that payment. I am convi'nced that if a vote of the people were taken tomorrow they would be unanimously in favour,, not only of continuing the subsidy, but of considerably increasing it.. The project of an Australian Navy is also a brand-new idea on the part of the Minister of Defence. He has only recently developed it, his political record showing him to have been previously antagonistic to it, and to favour the Imperial connection.",37
200,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,So I do now.,37
201,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Formerl y the Minister has always emphasized Australia's pendence on the British Navy.,37
202,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That does not exonerate us from doing our duty.,37
203,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No r does it exonerate the Minister from the responsibility of probe posing a wrong measure, and plunging the country into expenditure which must bring about ""intolerable taxation,"" to repeat words which he used, on a previous occasion.",37
204,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,How can it injure England for Australia to put her house ir* order ?,37
205,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Wit h a view to making clear the Minister's former position, let me quote what he said on the Naval Agreement Bill, on 14th July, 1903, as reported in Hansard, vol. XIV . , page 2048. His view then was thatIt would be disastrous to Australia to divide Imperial and Australian interests so far as the navy is concerned. . . . The opinions of the Admiralty experts of today are in favour of the proposal before us, which virtually'contemplates that there shall be no separation of Australian and Imperial interests so far as the navy is concerned. Every honourable membeT .who has spoken has granted that there must be no separation of Imperial and Australian interests generally. It has been conceded by all that if Britain goes down, we must go down, and that if the British Navy loses its power we cannot stand. We could not hope tomaintain an independent position among the nations without the aid of Great Britain.",37
206,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Does the honourable member agree with that?,37
207,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Of course, I do.",37
208,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Then the honourable member agrees with me.,37
209,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I agree with the Mr Ewing of that day; I differ from the Mr Ewing of this.,37
210,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I still, hold those views. "" Mr JOHNSON - At that time the Minister was' opposed to any interference with the Imperial connection. He gave it as a reason for supporting the proposed Naval Agreement that we must rely on Great Britain for our defence.",37
211,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I reiterated the same views in my recent speech.,37
212,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Minister told us in 1903, that Australia cannot stand if Great Britain goes down; that our only ""hope is in the power of the British Navy. deFurther on he said-pag e 2049It has been argued that as we have an Army that has done so well, we should also have a Navy. None of the authorities either of a few decades ago, or of the present day, have laid it down that the Army and the Navy should considered from the same stand-point. The main duty of the Army in Australia is to remain at home; its main work being very much that of a garrison in a fortress, namely, to protect the countiy and to destroy the enemy, should he reach here. The object of the Navy, however, is to seek the enemy and destroy him wherever he may be found.",37
213,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Does the honourable member agree with those views?,38
214,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Certainly .,38
215,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Then we are still in agreement. _.,38
216,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Is the little flotilla of six destroyers, nine submarines, and two depot ships, which is to constitute the ""Australian Navy, to seek the enemy and destroy it?",38
217,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Thos e vessels are for coastal defence, such as they have in England and in other civilized countries.",38
218,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In the speech from which I have quoted, the Minister pointed out that mere coastal defence is useless; that what is needed is a navy which will seek and destroy the enemy wherever he - may be found. To continue my quotation - pag e 2050Some rather homely examples have been used in connection with this debate, and I will give one which strikes me as fairly applying to the relative positions of the Army and the Navy. When ials are known to infest certain houses their destruction is brought about by the use of traps and cats. The trap is placed in some sequestered spot that it is presumed will be visited by the rat. The rat may not go there, but if he does he is offered such inducements that he will probably remain. The cat, on the other hand, instead of being stationary like the trap, travels from the basement to the ceiling-anywher e that the rat is likely to be found. The usefulness of the trap depends, so to speak, - upon the volition of the rat, whereas the effectiveness of the cat, as a destructive agent, depends upon its own volition. Thus, the Army remains at home to destroy the enemy should he land on our shores after having escaped our cruisers abroad. The Navy, however, goes out into the blue water to find the enemy no matter where he may be, and to destroy him there. Since an Australian Navy would have to work ih concert with the Imperial Navy it could not stay at home.",38
219,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Was the honourable member a Minister when he made that as followsspeech ?,38
220,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No . It is since he message became a Minister that his ideas have unto your telegram dergone transformation. Now he is imbued with a desire for an Australian Navy <>f microscopic proportions, which certainly cannot be sent out on to the high seas to seek and destroy the enemy. Is it desired - to duplicate the Imperial Navy, or is Australia to leave Great Britain free, in time of war, and look after her own protection? To do that we must have a navy equal to that of the British Navy.",38
221,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It would be absurd to discuss such a proposal.,38
222,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I think so. The scheme for which the Minister is responsible will not bear discussion. The criticisms alreadydelivered against it have riddled it, and if a division is taken, I hope the good sense of the House will be found opposing it. The Minister also saidHowever, it must be apparent that the control of the Navy, working, as it will, with a world-wide responsibility, and with a world-wide scope, must be different from that of the Army. In the communication between the Prime Minister and the Imperial authorities, however, the need for Commonwealth control of the Australian Navy has been insisted on, ancl I suppose that the Minister of Defence does not differ from his leader on that point. It will be seen that at that time the Minister held that there could not be divided control, and that even if we had an Australian Navy, it should be under Imperial command.",38
223,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That was not an Australian Navy such as the honourable member has described, but purely Australian coastal defence.",38
224,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"As I understand that the Budget speech is to be delivered tonight, I ask leave to continue my remarks tomorrow. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA ROOSEVELT.",38

228,Mr MATHEWS,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,Chines e puzzles !,39
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"No ; whatever I say I shall make as plain as I possibly can, though it may not be as plain as it might be. I think the House will readily understand that, at this particular stage of the financial history of the Common- wealth, such a task as the delivery of a Budget statement, is not devoid of complications, nor is it of the easiest character. We are arriving rapidly at a time when a new state of things in finance must inevitably take place; and, on the eve of that change, you will see that a straining of financial conditions might very reasonably occur-condition s that will doubtless become easier after the termination of 1910. . To give a succinct statement to the Committee will necessarily take some time; and I have, therefore,, to crave the indulgence and attention of honourable' members, perhaps for a longer period than I did on the last occasion.",39

231,The CHAIRMAN,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"I did not underand stand the honourable member, the Trea- £13,620; New Revenue, surer, to be reading his speech; but, as I know, there is nothing to prevent the honourable gentleman from reading a statement so important. I may say that in other Parliaments such a course is quite common.",39
232,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"In Canada, it is.",39
233,The CHAIRMAN,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"Not only in Canada, but in Australian Parliaments, it is quite usual for a Treasurer to read the. whole of his Budget statement.",39
234,Mr FULLER,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,But what about our Standing Orders ?,39
235,The CHAIRMAN,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"I know nothing, in the Standing Orders to prevent the Treasurer from reading such a statement.",39
236,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"I am glad, Mr.. Chairman, that you have so ruled, because it is most desirable that I should be able to refer with ease to, and to explain clearly, the great mass of figures beforeme. It is important that the figuresshould be correctly stated, because thisBudget speech will circulate, not only throughout Australia, but in Great Britainand in other parts of the world; and I feel that I , at any rate, am not competent todeliver such an address without having very copious notes before me. I may say that the same objection was raised on the occasion of the last Budget speech, and a. similar decision given.",39
237,Mr FULLER,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"So long as the Treasurer says that he is not capable of delivering: the speech without reading it, I am satisfied.",39
238,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"1 should like the honourable member to attempt to do what I am doing to-night without taking the same course that I am taking. I noticethat on the delivery of the last Budget speech in Canada, the Treasurer read every word, because he desired to have published in Hansard many of the tables, which could not be done unless they were read. I shall now proceed to give a history of the financial position, commencing with last year's figures. The total revenue received during the financial year ended 30th June, 1908, was £15,015,798. It and Excise, £11,645,409; Post Office, Telegraph, Telephone, £3,297,100; Defence, £25,784;.. so far Patents, £17,421; Trade Marks, Copyrights, and Designs, £ 8 , 6 5 7 ; Miscellaneous, following table shows a comparison between - Receipts:Customs' and ExciseUniform Tariff.. 8,692,750 9,451,588 Special Tariff . : 201,569 Post Offiee, Telegraph, and Telephone 2,372,861 2,404,730 Defence 10,657 Patents Trade Marks, Copy^ right, and Designs New Eevenue 2,775 Miscellaneous 16,373 f Total Receipts 11,296,985 12,105,937 11,630,998 11,465,598 11,881,924 12,832,891 I am giving this table in order to make the history as complete as I can, and with a view of showing, step by step, how the expenditure has increased since Federation. When the Budget was introduced on the it h August last year it was estimated that the Customs and Excise revenue would be £10,509,000, the actual revenue for 1906-7-exclusiv e .of the Western Australian Special Tariff-havin g - totalled .j£9>(>3 >7& - The receipts for the past 1 0 financial year amounted, however, to the unprecedentedly large figure of jQi 1,645,409, showing an increase on the previous year of £2,013,629, instead of the estimated increase of £877,220.",39
239,Mr REID,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,In spite of all the reductions in the Tariff.,40
240,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"The reductions might have made more revenue, be-cause the Tariff was rendered thereby less - efficient in many cases.",40
241,Mr CARR,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"It became, in effect, a revenue Tariff. e",40
242,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"In parts it was made a revenue Tariff against my wish. I attribute this large increase in Customs duties partly to the new Tariff and partly to the general prosperity caused by the high prices ruling for primary products. Had I felt certain, I should have added the good seasons as a cause, but I have records which show that, during part of that time, the seasons were not so good as might be. Prices, however, were very high; and, therefore, I think I am right ""in attributing .the prosperity to those high £7,807-in all, £15,015,798.

At the time the Budget was submitted it was impossible to make any accurate forecast, as it was not known what effect the Tariff would have; and my estimate, therefore, had to be of a conservative character. In the case of a continent such as Australia, it is quite impossible, at present at any rate, to make anything like a sure estimate, when altering the Tariff, of the return for the next year. Tha postal revenue amounted to £3,297,100. The estimate was £3,190,000, but an allowance of £117,000 was made for penny postage, being the amount of shrinkage estimated for six months. The estimated revenue-no t taking into account the shrink- age likely to be caused by the introduction of penny postage-was , therefore, £3>3 7>ooo> which is a figure but slightly 0 in advance of the actual receipts. "" New revenue"" yielded £13,784 mare-than was anticipated. This head of revenue was defined for the first time in the Surplus Revenue Act passed last session. Speaking generally, it includes all revenue which, from its nature, is not credited to any particular State, but is divided amongst the States on a population basis. . For instance, proceeds of sale of Acts of Parliament, costs and fines recovered under the Immigration Restriction Act, most of the fees collected under the Patents Act, and' interest on moneys placed on fixed deposit by the Commonwealth in London and Australia are all credited to this account of new revenue. The expenditure for the year 1907-8, exclusive of sums paid tp the States Treasurers, amounted to £6,158,893. diture each year under the various Departments :- 1901-2.

When the Department was transferred to Federal control, it held £25,000 advance from the Government of New South Wales, which was used as "" tillmoney "" for Savings Bank and money order purposes. The State Government desired that this advance should be returned, as it really belonged to the Sayings Bank Commissioners. It was accordingly repaid, and a similar amount was advanced to the Postal Department to enable it to carry on the money order work. During the year it was found that £15,000 would suffice for the purpose, and the balance, £10,000, was repaid to expenditure. The expenditure during 1907-8 for New Works and Buildings was £426,289, so that the total expenditure on account of the Department, exclusive of the money order advance, was £3J344J 3^- I revenue collected was £3,297,589, showing a balance of expenditure over revenue of £46,547. Not taking into account the expenditure fbr New Works and Buildings there was a credit balance of £379,742. Later on, I will show a table of the expenditure each year. During 1907-8, a new arrangement was made between the Department and the Railways Commissioners. From the ist of March, 1901, an annual payment of £225,546 had been - Sir William Lyne.

243,Mr FISHER,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,Does that include payment for services rendered by railway servants ii» respect to postal work ?,41
244,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"No ; this sura relates purely to the carriage of mail matter. Numerous applications were made tome by the-Department during the past yearfor amounts not provided in the annual Appropriation Act. For the most pressing? claims I made advances from the Treasurer's Advance as far as funds would allow,, in anticipation of Additional Estimates,, which were afterwards submitted to Parliament and passed. On three occasions I nearly exhausted the Advance Account before obtaining supplies from the House.. The It was not an easy matter to deal with. »",41
245,Sir JOHN FORREST,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"The honourable member practically broke the law. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - I followed a. very good example-that of the right honourable member. Acting upon the authority of the Surplus Revenue Act and the Special' Appropriations for Harbor and Coastal Defences and for Old-age Pensions, the sum°f £^44IJ354 was debited during 1907-ff to the States on a population basis. Of this amount, £250,000 was credited to the Harbor and Coastal Defences Trust Account, and £191,354 to the Old-age Pensions Trust Account. It has been objected in certain quarters that it was not fair to make a debit in 1907-8 for the purposes of age pensions to a State which was actually paying pensions in that year. But I may point out that the States have been treated exactly alike in this matter. The amounts accumulated in the Trust Account will not be expended until the Commonwealth comPremiers mences payment of the pensions, when the ponement. States which pay pensions will be relieved of this large annual expenditure. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is that money earning interest?",41
246,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"Yes . I shall deal with that matter later on. Complaint has also been made that a want of conhardly sideration was shown by the Commonwealth Treasurer in not recognising that the finances of some of the States reit quired in the last month the revenue to which the earlier distributions of the year led their Governments to rely ing upon. This criticism is founded on a mis1907-8, conception of facts. In June the Commonture wealth appropriated and transferred to Trust Fund an amount of £250,000 for defence, and an amount of £191,354 f old-age pensions. These amounts were charged to the States on a population The State Treasurers were aware that £250,000 would be debited for Defence purposes, for the amount was included in grumble about? the original Estimates submitted on the 8th of August, 1907. During the current financial year the payment to Trust Fund for old-age pensions will be spread throughthe out the. twelve months.",42
247,Mr HUTCHISON,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,Will that be suffi1907-8cient ?,42
248,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"I shall show that, so far as I can judge, by the end of the financial year after next we shall not have overdrawn to any material exNew South Wales 3,566,371 tent. By that time we shall be approaching the close of 1910, when Victoria I hope we"" shall have more money. It must be remembered that the State surers received from the Commonwealth, in 1907-8, far more than fhey were led to Tasmania expect, as the Treasurer announced in his Budget speech, on 8th August, 1907, that they might expect to receive £7,779,290, whereas the actual payment made was £8,859,596. It has also been asserted that the Commonwealth arrangements inopportune, .in view of the fact that was desirable to adjust the whole of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, and that such an adjustment should not have been anticipated. But oldit must be remembered that already six Conferences of the State Premiers .and Treasurers have been held,- in which the Commonwealth Ministers, by their representations, endeavoured to arrive at a basis satisfactory to all parties. It was the State who"" were responsible for the post",42
249,Mr HEDGES,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,That is very doubtful.,42
250,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"There is no doubt about the matter at all. The result of those Conferences was extremely disappointing, and the Commonwealth could have been expected-considerin g the large obligations which it has shortly to meet-to wait an indefinite time, while was parting with funds it had the right retain, and which will be absolutely necessary to it in the near future. Deductfrom the total revenue received during viz. :-£15,015,798 , the expendi£6,158,893, we arrive at a balance of £8,856,905 returnable to the States. The actual amount paid over during 1907-8 was ° £8,859,596, the difference being a small r unadjusted balance brought over from the basis - previous year, 1906-7.",42

Mr KING O'MALLEY --The population has increased.",42
252,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"Not in the same proportion, as I shall show presently. In any agreement made vvith the States for the return of surplus revenue, it must be clearly recognised that the figures for 1907-8 are to be treated as exceptional. I must again repeat my conviction that the State Treasurers have not yet realized the fact that in order to pay them the large surpluses they have enjoyed in the past many considerable sacrifices have been made by the Commonwealth Treasurer. In conseauence of no payments being made to the State Treasurers during June, it was Amount of throe-tourths of Not Customs and Excise Revenue which the Commonwealth was constitutionally bound to pay to P the States 3,325,422 2,358,648 1,082,349 Amount paid to the States out of the one-fourth of Net Customs and Excise Revenue whioh the Commonwealth was entitled to oxpend 291,944 Amounts actually paid to the States on account of 1907-8 3,617,360 :J,377,687 1,038,142 * Amount paid to State less than not possible to adjust the expenditure for that month in the usual way.

255,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"We want it , and must have it. I should be very glad to help the States; in fact, we have shown our earnestness all through in that direction, but we must not starve Commonwealth services any longer.",44
256,Mr WEBSTER,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,The Treasurer helped them too much.,44
257,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"I think so. I shall give the revenues of, all the States before I sit down, and show what a nice position they are in through our handing over all the money to which I have referred.",44

259,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"He had a credit balance of nearly £ 1 , 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 in the one year. I come now to the estimate of revenue for 1908-9. I have made the following estimate of revenue for the current financial year. The detailed figures will be found set forth on pages 25 and onwards of the Budget papers. The principal items are-Custom s and Excise, ,£11,040,711 ; Post Ofiice, Telegraph, and Telephone, £3,483,000; £ 5 , 5 0 0 ; Patents, £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 ; New Reverue, £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 ; Trade Marks, Copyright, and Designs, £ 5 , 2 6 0 ; Miscellaneous, £ 6 , 8 0 0 ; total, £ 1 4 , 5 7 7 , 2 7 1 . The total revenue ceived during 1907-8 was £ 1 5 , 0 1 5 , 7 9 8; so that the estimated amount for 1908-9 is £438,52 7 less than that received during 1907-8. Let me say here that the honourable member for Flinders has twice made an estimate that we would be short by about £1,000,000 this £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 next year.",44

262,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"As I wanted to refresh my memory, I have been reading in Hansard what the honourable member said last session. I am quite aware that he did not propose anything to take the place of what we were doing, but, in a kind of "" breaking-down"" speech, attempted to show that the revenue would be deficient by £1,000,000 this year, and by £2,000,000 next year. I wish to deal now with the estimated Customs and Excise revenue for 1908-9. The most difficult estimate which a Treasurer has to make is that of the revenue from Customs and Excise. In a country such as Australia, where periods of prosperity, caused mainly by has favourable seasons and periods of distress, alternate irregularly, it is impossible to forecast the revenue with any degree of certainty. I have here a table showing the Customs and Excise revenue actually received, omitting the Western Australian special Tariff, in each year since 1900. For the year 1900 it was £ 7 , 7 6 2 , 6 5 3 .",44
263,Sir JOHN FORREST,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"That was before Federation, and the sliding Tariff did not begin until 1001.",44
264,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"I am giving that 'year to show what has been done, and how the revenue has fluctuated. In 1900-1901, it was £8,189,529.",44
265,Mr WILKS,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,What page is that on?,44
266,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"It is on page 18 of my speech, if the honourable member wants to know.",44
267,Mr FULLER,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"The reading of a speech is out of order, and should not be Defence, allowed.",44
268,The CHAIRMAN,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"I must ask the honourable member for Illawarra not to cast reflections on the Chair. If I thought the re- Treasurer was out of order, I should take the necessary action.",44
269,Mr FULLER,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"I Avithdraw the statement ; but I rise, - at the same time, to a ]3oint of order. I wish to cast no reflection on the Chair, and I quite recognise that the Treasurer, in making the financial year, and statement, is entitled to quote largely from notes; but I submit that he is not entitled to address himself to the Committee in the way he has been doing. I would call your attention, sir, to May, eleventh edition, page 310In the Commons, a member addresses the Speaker; and it is irregular for him to direct his speech to the House, or to anv party on either side of the House. A member is not permitted to read his speech, but may refresh his memory by a reference to notes. The reading of written speeches, which has been allowed in other deliberative Assemblies, has recognised in either House of Parliament. A member may read extracts from documents, but his own language must be delivered the form of an unwritten composition. It appears to me that a written tion is being delivered to us to-night.",44
270,Mr GLYNN,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"It is not the Treasurer's speech. ,",45
271,Mr FULLER,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"As the honourable member suggests, they are not the Treasurer's own words. I regret that it was necessary for you to call me to order, but I contend that the Treasurer is entirely out of order in submitting a written composition.",45
272,The CHAIRMAN,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"-Standing order 256 distinctly lays it down that no honourable member shall read his speech. It is also correct that May, as quoted by the honourable member for Illawarra, states definitely that an honourable member shall not read his speech, but I take this to be quite different occasion. The Treasurer is de- 'receipts amounted to £9,631,780. livering the Budget statement, and the bate on it will follow. I differentiate between the position in which the Treasurer is placed and the position of those who will take part in the subsequent debate.",45
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,Does ' the standing order make that differentiation?,45
274,The CHAIRMAN,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"There is nothing in the standing order to guide me with regard to a Budget statement. In Queensland, it is always read, and copies are delivered honourable members while it is being - The matter itself is most important, and, moreover, it is difficult for me to tell when ^232.583the Treasurer is reading and when he is not reading. There are, at times, large pected that. numbers of figures to be quoted, and it would be impossible for any honourable member to keep those in his head. In the circumstances, so long as I have the honour to occupy this position-, I shall make the 1907. differentiation between a Budget statement and ordinary speeches that I have already indicated. In the debate which will low, no honourable member will be in order in reading a speech.",45
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,"In other words, what the Minister is doing is out of order, but you, sir, permit it.",45
276,The CHAIRMAN,INVITATION TO PRESIDENT,I ask the honorwithin able member to withdraw that remark.,45

283,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CUSTOMS AND EXCISE REVENUE ACTUALLV,"It gave me a bit of a shock nevertheless. This was no t doubt owing, in a considerable degree, to heavy withdrawals from bond in July, Since then the revenue has considerably recovered, the gross Customs and Excise revenue from ist July to 7th Ocfoltober being £3,146,416, as compared with £3,227,784 received in the similar period last year- a shortage of only £81,368. It is very gratifying to find that, although the revenue for the first month of the year fell off so largely, it is reviving, and is now, asi I have said, £81,368 of what it was last year. After very careful consideration I have arto, rived at an estimated Customs and Excise revenue for this year of £11,040,711. This is £1,408,931 more than was (received in 1906-7, and £604,698 less than the receipts of 1907-8. the sugar Excise and bounties-and to .save time. I am making these remarks as brief as possible-as some misapprehension appears to exist as to the effect on the Federal finances of the sugar Excise duties and the bounty paid, I would like to explain thai in the year just closed the position was this: The Excise revenue received during 1907-8 was £741,929-the .one-fourth only which the Commonwealth could legally expend under section 87 of the Constitution being £185,482, and the bounty paid, including expenses, £584,630, leaving a deficiency of £399,148. .This deficiency does not ireally represent the cost of working the sugar plantations with white labour, but arises from the fact that the Commonwealth can use only one-fourth Sugar Season (being for year com- Sugar Produced by mencing 1st April).

Coming now to Up to 1903 there was no bounty, the en1 couragement given to the growth of white sugar being given in the form of a rebate. Had the rebate system been continued, the result would have been that during 1907-S the Excise revenue received would have been £741,929, the rebate given £584,630, and the net revenue £157,299, one-fourth of which-namely , £39,327-woul d have been available for Commonwealth expenditure. Thus, instead of a deficiency in connection with Excise sugar and bounty of £399,148, we should have had ai surplus of £39,327. Thus the Treasurer would have been £438,475 better off had a rebate, instead of a bounty, been given.

The amount of black-grown sugar fell from 67,107 tons in 1902 to 23,517 tons in 1907.

A considerable falling-off is estimated in the quantity of sugar produced this year.

South Wales has received a great impetusfrom the high price of butter. I do not, however, anticipate that this will have any effect on the Excise receipts, as there will be sufficient Australian sugar in bond to supply requirements. It is very satisfactory to know that at"" any rate we can produce more than sufficient sugar for our use.

The number of telephone connexions in 1906 was 51,285; in 1907 it was 61,800. The numerous questions asked in Parliament, to and the recent appointment of a Royal DeCommission, point to the fact that it is that Parliament should have in the formation of the inner working of this Department regularly supplied to it.

Quite lately it was stated, for instance, by a gentleman in the district of the honourable member Riverina, that it was intended to drastically cut down the rural mail services, which quite untrue.",52

330,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I may perhaps be permitted to suggest to the Department that it would be better to make an effort meet difficulties which may arise, instead giving a summary refusal on the ground that there are no funds available.

331,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"If the funds not available, what other reply can the partment give?",53
332,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The funds are available for anything like a reasonable penditure. There is no doubt that, though the toll system and other reductions of charges have been beneficial to the publation basis. lic, the Treasurer has lost considerable revenue thereby, and in my opinion the was scarcely ripe to carry out some of these -£*4o,ooo . changes. I may mention-and in this I think the Postmaster-General will support me-that the checks upon the toll system have not all come in yet. This is causing a good deal of expenditure for extra hands. The checking is now, and I think can be, only imperfectly done. I come now to - defence expenditure. The total amount of expenditure required in connection with the has taken place in all the States. Defence Department is estimated at £ 1 , 1 0 2 . 6 8 1 . I refer honourable members page 63 of Budget papers. of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 for harbour and coastal defence, the appropriation for last vear was £ 1 , 2 4 4 , 8 5 7. and £1,084,505.

'«-5 19056 19067 19078 .... ... ... 190S-9 (estimated) ... ... Whilst I am on the subject of the Defence Department, it might be interesting state that during the last year the actual - strength of the senior cadets has increased from 2,178 to 7,613, and the cadets from 16,432 to 21,353. The rifles used by the - cadets are of the Westley-Richards and £ Francotte type, and they have been in that creased from 9,095 to 18,417, while 8,000 for more are on order. During the year 18c miniature rifle ranges have been estab- « is lished at various schools throughout the Commonwealth. At the cadet camps held in the several States, 542 officers ana 10,371 cadets attended. Thirty out of the thirty-six 19-pounder ammunition waggons have been delivered. These are of to local manufacture, and are quite equalin of every respect to the imported article. This brings me to the subject of old-age pensions. An amount of £ 4 1 0 , 8 1 0 has been included in the Estimates as a payment are during the financial year to the Old-age DePensions Fund. Instead of transferring the amount at the end of the year, as was done in 1907-8, the expenditure will be exspread as evenly as possible throughout althe year. "" The expenditure is charged, as honourable members are aware, on a popuI n July £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 was transferred, in August £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 , and in time September- a heavy month for payments",53

334,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The honourable member should not say that.

337,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"In Victoria, only 20 per cent, of those who are entitled to' pensions go upon the fund. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - I do not think that any one who does not deserve and * need a pension should get one. In New South Wales, I have known of cases in which the relatives of persons iri high positions, drawing good salaries, have been allowed to go upon the fund.",54
338,Mr REID,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,It is disgraceful that relatives allow that to happen.,54
339,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The payments in the other three States, viz., South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, on a similar basis, should not amount to more than £ 3 2 5 , 0 0 0 , so that I think we might fairly estimate the total annual expenditure at £1,225,000 . I am aware that this is a smaller figure than that generally quoted as an estimate, but I believe that we can deal generously with the people who wiW be entitled to these pensions without burdening the public funds to a much greater amount than this. There are, of course, in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, a certain number of people who will claim pensions under the Commonwealth Act, but who are debarred from participating under State legislation owing to the residence clauses. But; on the other hand, I am strongly under the impression that there has not been in New South Wales as careful a scrutiny into the claims of individuals as I think is only right and just, so that I believe that it will be found eventually that the Commonwealth expenditure will not be over the amount I have stated, viz., £1,225,000,- and that would include provision for invalid pension's. In order to make this expenditure of £ 1 , 2 2 5 , 0 0 0 in 1909-10, the Treasurer will have, as I have before explained, the amount of £ 1 , 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 available. might leave him with a deficiency of for New £ 1 2 5 , 0 0 0 on the 30th June, 1910. It would not require a very large inflation of revenue in 1908-9 and 1909-10 to meet this amount, and, considering the fact that we are looking nearly two years ahead, I think and if that that honourable members will agree that I have this year done all that is possible or necessary in this direction. Should there be a small deficiency in 1909-10, it will be easy to finance it , as we shall then be very near the termination of the period for which the Braddon provision has force.",54
340,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Does the Treasurer contend that the old-.age pensions payable in Victoria will amount to only one-half of about the total paid in New South Wales?,54
341,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The figures I have, given are an estimate of the expenditure . for this year under the State Acts, and have been supplied by the State authorities.",54

349,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I have explained that the revenue now being received is not our normal revenue. It is estimated that there will be returned this year £795,904 less than last year, but £218,852 more than in 1906-7, and £677,961 more than in 1905-6. It has been said that, during the last financial year, large sums were handed over to the State Treasurers in excess of their actual requirements, whilst money required by the Commonwealth for urgent telegraph and telephone works was not available. In reply to this criticism, I would state that during the year 1907-8 I advanced money to the Postal, the Defence, and other Departments in anticipation of Additional Estimates, up to the full amount available from the ""Treasurer's Advance."" real reason that such a large surplus was handed to the State Treasurers was that the Departments did not expend the full amounts voted. In all, the amount of £422,408 was unexpended. of this amount the Postal Department failed to expend £62,140, the Defence Department £105,089, and the Department of Home Affairs £212,360.",56
350,Mr FOWLER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Thes e figures show shameful mismanagement.,56
351,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"It is not my fault that the money has. not been spent. I got Parliament to vote it, and have put no check upon its expenditure. Had it been spent, we should not have heard so great an outcry.",56
352,Mr REID,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,We may be sure that it was not the fault of the officials.,56
353,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Of the amount which the Postal Department failed to expend, the balance unexpended of ordinary votes was £54,771, while that unexpended for New Works was £7,369.",56
354,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Why was the money not spent ?,56
355,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The blame is in some cases put upon the State Departments. Do what we may, we cannot get the money spent.",56
356,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Then there should be some other arrangement.,56
357,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I think that we should have a Public Works Department of our own. That, however, would be expensive; but we have been considering the matter, especially of late, and it may be that, if it can be done reasonably and cheaply, we shall have our own Department. No doubt there were exceptional circumstances last year. The Tariff debate occupied a very large part of the session, and could not be interrupted. In consequence, the Additional Estimates for £571,028 were not introduced until April.  delay in getting the expenditure approved by the House.",56
358,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Whil e I did not get the expenditure approved until late in the year, I was using the Treasurer's Advance to anticipate votes which were afterwards passed, so that there was not the great delay there might have been.",56
359,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Then the Treasurer acted illegally.,56
360,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"That may be, but the House said I did right. I have The received strong assurances that the Department of Home Affairs, which has been the greatest offender in this respect, will make every effort to push on the works under its charge this year. It is my inOut tention to introduce the "" Works and Buildings"" portion of the Appropriation Bill at a very early date, and if the revenue keeps up to add to the works already proposed, in order that there may be no delay in this direction. The estimated Customs and Excise revenue is £11,040,711. Deducting cost of collec* tion, £289,122, we have a balance of £10,751,589, three-fourths of which is £8,063,692, which is the amount of the estimated balance to be paid over during the year to the various States. This is the first financial year in which this provision in the Constitution, so lauded by its admirers and so vilified by its critics, has really come into the region of practical politics. Hitherto the Treasurer has framed his Estimates with the knowledge that, whatever happened, his expenditure would not exceed one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise. It will be necessary during the year to keep careful watch over both revenue and expenditure in order that the. requirements of section 87 may be complied with. In consequence of the Trust Funds having been augmented by the payment of £250,000 into the Harbor and Coastal Defence Trust Account, and of £191,354 into the Old-age Pensions Trust Account-in all £441,354-it has been found advisable to place a considerable amount of the Trust Funds on fixed deposit with the banks at 3 per cent. Altogether there is now on fixed deposit ,£443,ooo. The honourable member for Darwin asked me a question on this point, and I have taken care that the money is uot lying idle.",56
361,Mr TILLEY BROWN,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I could get the Treasurer 4 per cent.,57
362,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"But I am afraid the security would not be good. The funds held by the Commonwealth in London amounted on the 31st of August, 1908, to £187,089. In addition there were remittances in transit on that date amounting to £94,148. As far as was - consistent with safety, moneys not immediately required have been loaned to the market through the medium of the Bank of England, which assures the return of the amount loaned with interest. Arrangements have recently been made with the bank under which its charges for commission and insurance have been reduced. When the gross rate earned is 2J per cent, or over, the bank now charges f per cent. When the gross rate earned is under 2 1 per cent., only J per cent, is charged. After deducting the bank's commission, £[4,163 was earned as interest during 1907-8. The amount of £250,000 voted last year remains to the credit of the Harbor and Coastal Defence Fund. Before expenditure is made, the approval of Parliament will be sought. The total estimated expenditure for the current year is £6>5 3>519I t is certain that this amount I will be largely augmented in the future. It is, of course, quite impossible to predict, with any degree of certainty, what the total expenditure of the Commonwealth will be, say, in 1920, but the following New South Victoria. Queensland.

It will be seen that the State of Victoria is still keeping the lead as a distributing centre. During the year figures may be useful in enabling honourable members to form some approximate idea on the subject:-Expenditur e for current year, £6,513,579; less Sugar Bounty expiring in 1913, £518,900-leaveing £5,994,679. The increases in expenditure of Post Office and Defence Departments (with the following new services) will probably bring the expenditure to a total of £9,000,000 :-Increas e in Postal Expenditure, Increase in Defence Expenditure ; Northern Territory ; Railway Deficits: Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, Port Augusta to Oodnadatta ; Old-age Pensions; Advertising and Immigration; General Elections (one-third of triennial cost); Census (one-fifth of quinquennial cost); High Commissioner; Further State services which may be taken over; Unforeseen. I was asked last session to give details, and was induced to do so in an approximate way, but I do not think it is fair to ask the Treasurer or the Treasury officials to give Estimates on w'hat must be mere guesswork. I have, therefore, just given the total which the officials believe represents the amount required. I have not included in the above figures any payment to the States in respect of transferred properties, as it is not known what form the compensation to the States will ultimately take. If my Public Debt proposals are adopted, interest amounting to about half-a-million will also have to be borne by the Commonwealth in 1920.

I regret to state that the negotiations fell through, owing to the refusal of the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria. The Government is still engaged in correspondence with the States, with a view to arriving at (he best practical means to be employed 10 advertise the resources of the Commonwealth in Great Britain and elsewhere. No decision has yet been reached, but the Government, by the circulation of publications prepared by the Commonwealth Statistician, by newspaper advertising, and the purchase of a number of special issues of suitable periodicals, are helping to keep the Commonwealth before the eyes of the British public. I have been asked to state that a sum of money has been appropriated with a view to the Department of Home Affairs obtaining suitable Australian timbers and keeping them in a proper place until they are thoroughly seasoned, so that :> better test can be made of the value of such timbers than there has been in the past, or can be made until the matter is taken up by the Government. I may say that recently I was visiting my electorate, and found there a blacksmith, wheelwright and carpenter, who uses nothing but Australian timber, for which he has a great demand in everything he makes. I asked him the reason, and he said it was because he never used a single piece until it had been three years seasoned, and he declared that the blue-gum which he used was equal to American hickory. I also desire to say that there has been an unexpected demand for the Commonwealth Year-Book; it contains a great deal of valuable information, and it is proposed this year to print 12,000 copies instead of 8,000.",57
363,Mr CROUCH,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"And, I hope, sell it at a cheaper rate.",58
364,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"As n matter of fact, the printing costs more than we get for the book; but, seeing that it contains so many informative details, which have been obtained at the cost of great research, and that it advertises the country so effectively, I believe it would ' pay handsomely if we gave it away. It is not always easy to perceive the direct result of advertisement; but it must be obvious to all students of the British press, that this country is now receiving a much larger share of attention than at any previous time, and the more the advantages of Australia become known, the more we have to gain. There is no doubt that the visit of the American Fleet was a great advantage to us in this as in other respects. Not only throughout the United States, but in Canada and Europe, attention wfll have been called to the Commonwealth. Probably no other advertisement which could have been conceived would have been more effective. A very great deal can be done by means of illustrative advertisements in such places as will attract attention, and in the event of the Commonwealth purchasing a site in London, an excellent opportunity will be afforded of following the example of Canada in the establishment of an advertising bureau. As to the valuation of properties transferred from the States to the Commonwealth, I had hoped to be able to inform the Committee of the estimated values of the properties transferred from the States to the Commonwealth; but am told that, as the valuations are not yet complete, it is impossible to give the details at present. The valuations will, I understand- I have seen them as far as they go - be finally completed in a month or two. The total amount will probably be between £8,000,000 and £9,000,000. It has been stated that the amount will be £10,000,000 or £12,000,000; but it will not reach £9,000,000 - The Commonwealth Government has been frequently criticised for deferring the payment to the States of compensation for the transferred properties. But it must be admitted, in the first instance, that the transfer of properties was really only a nominal one. The properties have not been handed over to a foreign body. The Post Office in Sydney is just as much at the service of the people of Sydney as before - Federation. All that has happened is that the Commonwealth Parliament is now trustee for properties for which the State Parliaments were formerly trustees. It will, however, be said that the Constitution enacted that the Commonwealth should compensate each State for the value of the properties transferred to the Commonwealth, the method of compensation to be determined by the Federal Parliament, if no agreement could be made. A little reflection will show that the agreement referred to in the Constitution will have to be made by the States, as the question of compensation is one which affects the Commonwealth Parliament principally, because it has to act as umpire in the matter. For, as any payment by the Commonwealth to the States will be made by charging each State on a population basis, it follows that all that is to be done is to effect an adjustment between the States. Even if the extraordinary course recommended by some were followed, viz. : if the Commonwealth borrowed, say, £8,000,000 or £9,000,000, and paid the amount over to the States, the people of the latter would have to contribute the interest on that loan on a population basis. Supposing, again, that the Commonwealth paid interest on the value of these properties, each State would, as previously explained, be debited on a population basis, and the amount due to each State, viz., the interest on the value of its properties, would be credited to ft. . But during the bookkeeping period each State is debited with the expenditure in connection with the departments transferred. It follows that immediately the Commonwealth commences to pay for the properties, it must debit each State-as part of the ordinary expenditure of the transferred departments-with rent for the buildings it uses. That is, each State will receive interest on the value of the buildings, but will be debited with the rent, viz., the interest which the Commonwealth is paying. The two sets of entries will neutralize each other, the consequence being that, during the bookkeeping period, no compensation will seally be paid. Put in another way, during the bookkeeping period each State would be debited with the interest-rent-to be paid to it for the property transferred, i.e., interest would be charged as "" transferred expenditure. The real reason that has kept this subject in the foreground is that there has been an erroneous impression that, if the Commonwealth has to pay the States, sa Y- £320.000 per annum-the figures are used merely for illustration-it would have to pav the amount out of its one-fourth Customs and Excise revenue, and that this would prevent it from taking advantage of the Surplus Revenue Act to that extent. But th s is not the case. It must be re; membered that the Commonwealth Parliament has to finally decide on the method of compensation, and it has been already explained lhat what is required is merely an adjustment between the States. As each State has to receive the value of its tiansferred property in some way, and has to pay its proportion on a population basis of the total amount of the transferred properties of all the Sta.tes, It follows that the balfmre between these amounts is all that would be dealt with. The interest on that would not be a considerable sum, so the Commonwealth would not be fettered in the wav imagined. In regard to the question of stflmp printing, it is proposed to Sir William Lyne. establish at once a Commonwealth Stamp Printing Office, under the control of the Treasury. All stamps required by the Commonwealth, with the exception of those of New South Wales and Queensland, will be printed in this ofiice. It is intended to transfer Mr Cooke, who has been in charge of the stamp printing in Adelaide, to take charge of this branch, and it is hoped that , a considerable saving in expenditure will result.",58
365,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Where is the Commonwealth Stamp Printing Ofiice to be established ?,59
366,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Here . We have a report under consideration as to the stamps to be issued, one Board having recommended a certain method, while the Department recommends another. The question has yet to be decided.",59
367,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I hope that we shall have an oppoi tunity of discussing the question of the kind of stamps to be issued before it is finally settled.,59
368,Mr FRAZER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Why is it not proposed to print in Melbourne the stamps required for New South Wales and Queensland?,59
369,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"That matter was arranged, I think, by the right honour the able member for Swan, when he held office "" as Treasurer. The reason for making an exception in the case of New South Wales is that there is in that State an exceptionally fine stamp printing plant.",59
370,Mr CROUCH,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,The printing of stamps is carried out much cheaper in Adelaide.,59
371,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"But the plant there is not as large as we require. A Coinage Bill will shortly be introduced, to authorize the introduction of an Australian silver and bronze coinage. I have very carefully considered the relative advantages of coining the silver in Australia, and of accepting the offer of the Imperial Government to coin any silver required, charging only the cost of coining. I have come to the conclusion that for the present, at least, the wisest course before us is to accept trieoffer of the Imperial Government. I anticipate an annual profit of £21,000 on new coins required, that is, on £60,000 per annum. There will also be an annual profit for a considerable time to come-sa y for twenty years-o n £100,000 worth of the present silver coin, which we shall be at liberty to withdraw from circulation. The annual profit on this would be about £35,000, so that, altogether, I anticipate an annual prcfit of £56,000.",59

376,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Why does not the - Government accept the offer made by the Western Australian Mint?,60
377,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"A similar proposal has been made by the mints in other States. The work will be done here by the Imperial authorities. Gold is minted in ""Western Australia, and the coining of silver will be done here.",60
378,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Will it not be carried out in the Old Countiy? Sir WILLIAM , LYNE - I believe that it will be done here. I am informed Mis. DEAKIN - I do not think that the coinage of silver will take place here.",60
379,Mr FRAZER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Who is the Treasurer's informant ? - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I have very - good information. The coinage of silver will not be undertaken in Perth by the - Commonwealth Government.,60
380,Mr FRAZER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,It certainly will not if the honourable member has a voice in the matter.,60
381,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I have a veryfriendly feeling towards Perth.,60
382,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"We have there the biggest mint in Australia, and it mints more gold than do all the other mints in the - States.",60
383,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I believe that there is a very fine plant in the Western Australian Mint. Since I have been drawn into a. discussion of this phase of the question, let me say that I do not feel disposed"" to invite Parliament to agree to all the mint buildings in Australia being taken over by the Commonwealth. If they were, when we - established our own mint in the Federal Capital, we should have on our hands a - number of buildings that we did not require.",60
384,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,We do not wish the Commonwealth Government to take over the Western Australian Mint.,60
385,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The proposal for locally coining silver and for combining with such coinage the manufacture of brass and cupro-nickel cups has been condemned by the Board of Experts to which it was referred. The report of the Board has already been presented to Parliament. The Board came to the conclusion that the cups for the cartridges could be manufactured in Australia, but that it was not desirable that the Mint should undertake it-as o that it was desirable that the manufacture of small-arms ammunition, requiring, as it does, technical skill ami expert training entirely foreign to mint work, should be carried out in a separate establishment from the Mint. The reports which have from time to time been made public regarding Papua, show that considerable progress is being made in the development of the Territory. During the year a considerable advance has been made in the cultivation of rubber and cocoanut trees, which do not come into bearing for several years, and sisal hemp, for which a large part of the less valuable country appears specially suited, and which has the advantage of offering a speedier return for capital investment. The Government is endeavouring to assist planters by the establishment of experimental gardens, in which may be seen actually growing specimens of all valuable - economic plants, and from which intending cultivators may obtain close at hand, ancl without risk attending importation from abroad, young plants ready to be transplanted as the process of clearing proceeds. These establishments will, it is hoped"", in a short time be self-supporting, at anv rate, to a large extent. It is contemplated, also, to establish hill gardens at different altitudes, so as to illustrate the very diverse possibilities of the country, and in order that the efforts of growers need not be occupied solelv with the rubber .trees, cocoanut palms, and other products of the low-lying coastlands, but mav be extended to the cul-tivation of the plateaux - and hillsides of Papua's great mountain regions. The Government is looking forward to the result of these efforts hopefully, not merely for the prospect they offer of adding to the list of exportable commodities, but also on account of the opening up of healthier regions, which may be utilized as sanatoria, by those suffering from the ills necessarily attending the strenuous life in the tropics. The mining resources of the country furnish an interesting theme for speculation. Gold has been found in many rivers, in some in payable quantities. Its only occurrence at present known in reef form is at Woodlark Island, in the eastern part of the, Territory, where several enterprisers are reaping satisfactory rewards. There appears every reason to hope that when the country becomes opened up, the efforts to discover payable gold reefs may be successful. Within the last two years, copper has been found in the neighbourhood of Port Moresby. The Government, by the establishment of a laboratory ancl otherwise, has rendered much valuable help to those engaged in this industry. A number of representatives of investors are now engaged in more closely examining the country, with a view to testing the mines to a greater depth; if local smelting works are constructed, the cost of the expensive land transit and long sea voyage to Australian smelting works will be obviated. attention is being given to the making of new roads and tracks, for wh:ch special provision was .made last year - by Parliament. The work is difficult, but excellent progress is being made.

387,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Yes . The imports into Australia amounted in J 9°7 to £51,809,033, and the exports to £72,824,247-the being £21,015,214 more than the imports. Adding these amounts, £124,633,280 represents the total trade of the year.

British South Africa were in 1907 £28,266,525, the exports £48,390,763, the total trade being £76,657,288. Such a comparison between the trade of Australia and that of the great Dominion of Canada cannot fail to impress the mind with the great advance mad under Federation by the country in which we live.

In 1907 they amounted to £42,280,980, thus showing the enormous impetus which Federation has given to trade communication between the States. DurMuch ing the three years from 1903 to , 1906 the number of hands employed in factories increased by 33,200, from 195,500 to 228,700 - an average increase of, say, 11,000 per annum. Complete figures for the year 1907 are not yet available, but. those so far to hand bear gratifying evidence that this increase has been considerably augmented. Thus, in New South Wales alone, the number of hands emacres ployed in factories increased during 1907 by no less than 9,372, whilst in Victoria an advance of 5,674 was experienced, and 131 in Queensland an advance of about 4,000. It may, therefore, be confidently antici76 pated that when the complete returns for 4,752 acres the Commonwealth are compiled, the increase in the number of hands employed during 1907 will be about 20,000, and the total number for whom employment has been found in manufacturing industries at the end of 1907 was little short of 250,000 - as compared with 195,500 at the end of 1903. The increase in the number of factories during 1907 was also very satisfacexports tory, and amounted to about fifty in Queensland, 170 in Victoria, and no fewer than 526 in fiew South Wales. In the matter of wages paid, the New South Wales figures increased during the year by £1,087,530 - fro m £5,591,888 to £6,679,418-whils t in the. same year those The for Victoria also showed a substantia! increase of £514,207-fro m £5,468,470 to £-5,982,677. The total wages' bill for 1907 in connection with Commonwealth manufacturing industries may be said to have amounted approximately to at least £18,000,000 . As an indication of the permanent character of the industries which are being established in the Commonwealth, it may be noted that the value of machinery and plant used in the factories is rapidly increasing, and that the horsepower of engines used is also on the increase. Thus, in Victoria, the value of machinery and plant increased between 1904 and 1.907 by £ 7 4 4 , 3 2 4 - from £ 6 , 0 2 7 , 1 3 4 to £6,771,458-o r nearly £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum; while in New South Wales the increase between 1904 and 1906 was no less than £758,434> or almost £ 3 8 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. For 1907, the increase in New South Wales was probably considerably larger, than this latter amount. From 1904 to 1907, the horse-power of engines used increased by 11,844-rfrom 40,859 to 52,703-o r nearly 4,000 per annum, while in two years in New South Wales, from 1904 to 1906, an increase of 12,349-fro m 62,407 to 74,756-too k place, averaging over 6,000 per annum. There is every indication that during 1907 this increase was more than maintained. The extent and importance of the manufacturing industry of the Commonwealth is shown by the fact that the total value of the output for 1907 may be stated approximately at £90,000,000, of which somewhat less than two-thirds represents the value of the raw materials treated, and upwards of £32,000,000 represents the value added in the process of manufacture. Complete Commonwealth figures of this nature for a series of years are not available, but an indication of the rat? of growth may be obtained from the fact that between 1904 and 1907 the value of the total output of Victorian factories increased - by £ 7 , 2 7 3 , 7 6 5 ; while between 1904 and 1906 the value of the output of those of New South Wales showed an increase of £ 7 , 6 3 6 , 9 3 9. The satisfactory nature of the increase in industrial activity already noticed is enhanced by the fact that the improvement has taken place practically all along the line, and has not been due to the abnormal and possibly ephemeral development of some one or two industries. Thus, taking one item of growth only, viz., the increase in the number of hands employed, as furnishing an indication of the ' [45] progress experienced, it will be found that in the case of New South Wales the class of industries engaged in treating raw materials, the products of pastoral pursuits showed an increase of 549 hands. Wood-working establishments, an increase of 984 hands; metal working establishments, an increase of 2,796 hands; factories producing food, drink, and narcotics, an increase of 640 hands; clothing and textile factories, an increase of 2,225 hands; printing, bookbinding, & c , an increase of 729 hands; coachbuilding and harness making, an increase of 795 hands; boat building, an increase of 107 hands; furniture making, an increase of 154 hands; chemical works, an increase of 109 hands; jewellery establishments, an increase of 171 hands; heat, light, and power works, an increase of 119 hands. Though perhaps less strikingly than in New South Wales, the Victorian returns for 1907 also show marked increases in the various industries. The following are the increases in the number of hands employed in various - establishments, viz., those treating raw materials the product of pastoral putsuits, 350; stone, clay, and glass works, 174; wood working, 430; metal works, 411; factories producing food, drink, narcotics, 825; clothing and textile factories, no less than 2,237; printing, bookbinding, & c , 330; coachbuilding and harness making. 114; furniture making, 202; chemical works, 175; and heat, light, and energy works, 191 hands. Complete details of output for 1907 are, up to the present, available in comparative form for Victoria and Queensland only. These, however, show-a satisfactory progress in the quantities of "" the various products turned out by the different classes of factory, and indicate that when full returns are available it will be found that the growth of the manufacturing industry during 1907, from whatever point of view it may be considered, was most satisfactory, and furnishes strong grounds for confidence in the future progress of this side of our national development. The estimated population cn the 31st December, 1908, is 4,278,000, viz New South Wales ... ... 1,607,000 Victoria ... ... 1,270,000 Queensland ... ... ... 550,000 South Australia ... ... 400,000 Western Australia ... ... 264,000 Tasmania ... ... ... 187,000 Total ... ... ... 4,278,000 This showed an increase on the previous year of 80,962, a quite inadequate figure, as it includes gains from all sources. 1907-8 (3 1 / 1 2 / 1 9 0 7 ) 1,568,942 1,248,095 54^765 39 .665 190S-9 Estimated (31/12/1908) It is anticipated that, in the near future, another Conference of Premiers and Treasurers will be held to discuss the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. In view of the near approach of the period when the Commonwealth will be unfettered as regards the expenditure of Customs and Excise revenue, I consider it eminently desirable that a settlement shall be arrived at. The main principle laid down by the Prime Minister and myself at the last Conference was that there must ultimately be a complete severance between the Commonwealth and State finances. The scheme proposed provided for this, and it appears to me, as it is better understood the States will recognise the liberality of the scheme. The State Treasurers have not, however, so far realized the advantages offered them. At present the States are paying annually, Interest, £8,840,000; Expenses, £50,000; Sinking Fund contributions, £800,000; Old-age Pensions, £990,000, £10,680,000. To place themselves in the position which the Commonwealth Treasurer offers to place them in-that is, of being relieved of their debts, now totalling £247,974,624, in thirty-five years-an annual payment to Sinking Fund, accumulating at 3 per cent, interest, would be. necessary of £4,101,000. amount now paid to sinking fund by the States. £800,000, £3,301,000 is left. So that they would pay in all £13,981.000. The States now receive from the Commonwealth annually an amount of £7,740,000, which is the average for the last seven years, so that> if the present payment by the Commonwealth to the States were continued, they would have themselves to provide £6,24.1,000. The Commonwealth Government, however, offers to put them in the same position, that is, of having their debts redeemed in thirty-five years, asking for the first five years an 'annual payment from them of only £2,890,000, the States would gain annually, during the first five years Sir William Lyne. the population of Australia in 1900, was 3,745,840, the increase in the eight years, As from all sources, has been only 532,160POPULATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH.

They would then be entirely relieved of their debts, but would retain their assets, many of them revenue producing. As regards their future borrowing, they would secure full advantage of the market, as under the proposed arrangement no clashing of loans could take place. It appears to me that, when the State Treasurers fully realise the liberality of the offer made by the Commonwealth, they will be much more inclined to view the scheme favourably. I hope that the matter will be thoroughly ventilated by the State Parliatotal, ments, as I am convinced that the more the proposals are examined the greater will be the conviction that, at any rate, a good basis has been laid down for the settlement of this important question. The following surpluses were announced by the State Treasurers on their transactions for the vear ending 30th June, 1908 :Deducting the £ New South Wales ... ... 1,513,989 Victoria ... ... ... 440,151 Queensland ... ... ... 115,302 Soutli Australia ... ... 483,523 Tasmania ... ... ... 75.337 The' Treasurer of Western Australia, I regret to say, ended the year with a deficit of £2,365. Deducting this small amount the State Treasurers were able to announce surpluses amounting in the aggregate to £2,625,937, most, if not all, of which was paid to them by the Commonwealth. We, on the ether hand, are close up to the limit of our one-fourth of the Customs and ' Excise revenue under the Braddon section. so that Sir JOHN FORREST - That is not so, seeing that the Government are taking a £3.351,000. lot of monev under the Surplus Revenue Act.",61
388,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"We could not do what we want unless we took that money. Banking legislation, especially with regard to a Commonwealth note issue, has been engaging my attention. I have discussed the matter with the Prime Minister, and a Bill has been drafted embodying some of the suggestions of the governor and directors of the Bank of England, whom I had the privilege of meeting when in London. It is intended to introduce the necessary legislation at the first convenient opportunity.",64
389,Mr CROUCH,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,To what effect?,64
390,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I cannot say positively, but it will probably be in the direction of a note issue.",64
391,Mr CROUCH,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Then the Government propose to take over the note issue?,64
392,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Yes ; but I do not want to confine myself actually to that statement. I have estimated that £12,000 will be sufficient this year to pay the iron bonuses. No one year will be burdened with more than £50,000. that the policy of granting these bonuses will be of great benefit to Australia, and will open up avenues of employment to a large number of people. This industry is one that Germany, the TJnited States, and Canada, especially have done their best to foster, either by protection or by bonuses, or by a combination of both. Considering the immense deposits of ore known to exist in Australia, instead of importing millions of pounds' worth annually df iron in a raw and manufactured state, the development of these natural resources should, within a short period, place Australia in the front rank of the iron-producing countries of the .world j and while we cannot afford to undertake this development at a loss, we can, by means of a bonus, give the necessary impetus to this great industry.",64
393,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"B v the of £30,000 a year? Will that not all go to one firm?",64
394,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"No . sion is made in the Bill that if claims involving more than £30,000 are made the monev can be divided equally amongst the claimants. Another great and urgent reason for development is the necessity for having the raw material for defence in time of trouble. The amount of £12.000 has been included in the Estimates for the current year. Then the expenditure will probablv proceed more rapidly-probabl y [ 4 5 ] -* at the rate of about ,£50,000 per annum. It is somewhat premature at the present time to express any opinion on the operation of the Bounties Act of 1907. The provisions we made for the encouragement of certain industries by that measure were exceedingly liberal. It should, however, be borne in mind that the bounties were for the encouragement of future cultivation and development of the special' industries we desire to promote. I look forward with great confidence to a substantial increase in the value of our production by reason of the assistance which the bounty will afford, and have no doubt"" it will have the effect of permanently establishing several new and prosperous industries. Although the amount paid away in bounties last year was small, being only £176, it is anticipated that during the current year £15,000 will be expended. A Bill in relation to the Northern Territory will shortly be laid before Parliament. The great importance of opening I trust up and settling the Territory need not be dwelt upon now, as the matter will be fully considered later on. The expenditure this year will be very small. The steps necessary to determine the precise site for the Capital of Australia are now being taken, and will, it is hoped, result in a choice which will be confirmed by the whole people of the Commonwealth. The outlay during the present year will be small, and can readily be met from the "" Treasurer's Advance."" The loss on the Pacific Cable for the year ending 31st March last was £62,362 ios., the Commonwealth proportion of which was £20,787 ios - For the period ending 31st March, 1903, the loss was £90,518 14s. 40V, the Commonwealth proportion being £30,172 14s. 9d.

This year the revenue was considerably increased owing to the earthquake at San Francisco. Communications are at prescent proceeding with our representative in London in respect to the possibility of further popularizing this line of communication. A proposal for the application of a system of wireless telegraphy to the groups of islands in the Western Pacific is now engaging the attention of the Government. Last session a Quarantine Act was passed, to come into operation as soon as proclaimed. The Comptroller-General was directed to proceed to the various States, and-with the concurrence of the respective Governments-to arrange for the performance of duties and transfers of properties. Satisfactory arrangements have so far been made with the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, ancl Tasmania, and, it is expected, will be shortly concluded with South and Western Australia. The object of such arrangements has been, as far as _possible, to avoid duplication of work and undue increase of expenditure as regards the necessary staffs, and as far as practicable to make use of the services of the State officers who have control of local health matters or those relating to stock and plants. The upkeep of the present quarantine stations and plant will involve considerable expenditure, though the exact amount cannot be precisely ascertained at present, and new expenditure will be necessary in order to bring the condition and equipment of such stations up to date. In one or two cases it may be necessary to provide altogether new stations with a resulting expenditure for buildings and plant. The survey for the line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta is being proceeded with. Mr Deane furnished a report on 10th October that the line has been located for 365 miles, and that he expected to be able to complete the work by the end of last month. The line had been pegged for 220 miles. It is expectedthat all field work in this portion of the Tine will be completed before the end of the year. With regard to water, shallow borings have been in progress for about 100 miles, but so far no success has been met with. There appears to be no difficulty in'providing catchments for water between Kalgoorlie and the edge of the Nullaboor Plain, and it is probable that dams can be constructed for conserving the water. On the Nullaboor Plain, which is of limestone formation, and full of joints and small crevices, there may be more difficulty, and artificial catchments may have Sir William Lyne. to be resorted to. The Western Australian Government, it is understood, contemplates spending more money on bores in . this region, and should good results ensue the water difficulty will be minimized. Good broken stone ballast can be obtained for the first 100 miles. From there to the edge of the Nullaboor Plain, about 180 miles, it does not exist, but in the plain, limestone will be available. The distance from Kalgoorlie to the border is approximately 460 miles, of which about 273 miles will be across the Nullaboor Plain. As regards the South Australian portion of the line, it is reported that between Port Augusta and - Tarcoola it will be possible to get sufficient catchment areas for reservoirs, not only for construction purposes, but also for working the line. From Tarcoola to the border excavated reservoirs with artificial catchment areas will have to be provided. The field work on this portion will, it is expected, be completed by March 'next, after which plans and estimates will be prepared for sub-, mission to Parliament. As the actual work of survev was not taken in hand before the beginning of June, it 'may be reasonably anticipated that the whole work will be completed within the period of twelve months estimated as necessary by the conference of engineers. In connection with railway matters, I might mention that negotiations are now being, entered into with the eminent Australian inventor, Mr. Brennan, for the right to use his mono rail throughout the Commonwealth. Should a tentative agreement be arrived at, it will be laid before Parliament without delay. I understand that the Indian Government have already made some such arrangement M,r. REID - The Indian Government has control of the railways. There are none under our control.",64
395,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"We may use the system in the construction of two transcontinental railways.' The vessel which is being built by the Government of the State of New South Wales under contract with the Commonwealth, and to which some additional interest attaches as the first vessel obtained by the Commonwealth Government, was launched at the end of August, being christened the Endeavour, after Captain Cook's famous ship. She is now being fitted with boiler, machinery, &c. Experts pronounce the vessel to be a very fine model, and well suited for the purpose for which it is intended. Comment has been made as to the difference in price between this vessel and an ordinary Scotch trawler, but this is evidently made without knowledge of the facts. The Endeavour is not an ordinary trawler for commercial purposes, but a vessel for scientific investigation and perimental trawling. Moreover, under the enlightened labour laws of the Commonwealth, she will carry a much larger crew than the trawlers of the Northern Seas, .and their accommodation will be of a vastly different kind. Even if the craft ihas cost more, the money has gone in wages to our fellow citizens, and not out of the - country, and has helped to demonstrate that it is not necessary to send abroad for everything. I think I can fairly claim that the financial position which I have placed before the Committee is one which makes it possible for us to face the demands of the future with confidence. If I may assume that the States will take a reasonable view of the financial situation as a. whole, and that we can arrive at an agreement with them during the current financial year, many of the difficulties that hitherto have seemed insurmountable will be got out of the way. We may look forward to the inauguration of a national system of old age pensions, to the placing of the public services of the Commonwealth-especiall y the Post and Telegraph Department-o n an efficient and economical basis, and to carrying out our proposals for coastal and harbour defence. Although the financial aspect of the sugar industry is not satisfactory to me, yet the great success of white labour is worth a good deal to us. We have demonstrated that, even in the warmest areas, and at the coast levels, arduous field work can be well done by white men. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I have done, and am doing, my best to smooth financial difficulties, and I that honourable members may well congratulate themselves that, under all the circumstances, we have done so well, and that we shall so soon emerge into what cannot fail to prove an easier period for the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I move That the item ""The President, ^1,100,"" be agreed to.",65

In the present Bill the ordinary expenditure provided for is £717,749, while the refunds of revenue amount to £10,000, making in all £727,749. No increases in salary will be paid on the authority of this Bill, except the ordinary increments to officers who do not receive more than £160 per annum. The expenditure under it will be on the basis of last year's Estimates. It is usual to pay on the 15th of the month, but as the Senate will probably not deal with the Bill until tomorrow, it is proposed to pay this month on the 16th.

422,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"There is nothing in the Bill except votes based on the old Estimates, which were full y discussed.",68
423,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"If that be so, it seems quite idle to place the proposals before us in this form, because we might as well have merely an abstract. The votes are divided into salaries and contingencies, and we are given no idea as to what the - votes for ""contingencies"" cover. It is a - waste of good paper and ink to put the Bill before honourable members in this form.",68
424,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,There is in the Bil l to discuss that was not discussed .last year.,68
425,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,What is the object of submitting the Bill in this form?,68
426,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,That servants may - be paid the day after tomorrow.,68

In the circumstances he might very well have delivered his Budget speech a few - days earlier. I do not complain that the honourable gentleman is wanting in industry, but of his having left the delivery of the Budget until the Treasury is exhausted, .and it has become necessary to pass a Supply Bill within a few hours if the public servants are to be paid. The Treasurer practically says, "" Open your mouth, shut your eyes, and trust me.""",68
430,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,It j right if honourable members would always trust me.,68
431,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,It doubt be all right for the Minister. The honourable gentleman has given no justification for asking that this Bil l should be pushed through as a matter of urgency.,68
432,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I have said that I require the money to pay the public servants the day after tomorrow. If they are not paid they will have to thank the honourable gentleman.,68
433,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Of what use is it for the honourable gentleman to talk in that way? He knows well that he should not have placed honourable members in such a position that if they discuss this Bill they must delay the payment of the salaries of the public servants. Honourable members should not be placed in such a position. The Treasurer knew that a Supply Bill would be required at this time, and he should have made his arrangements accordingly.",68
434,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Calare) [10.50] - It is not right that the introducnothing tion of such an important measure as this should have been delayed until the money in the Treasury was exhausted, or that honourable members at the close of a trying sitting should be asked to rush through a the public number of important items of expenditure presented in such a way as to give no information. We have been told that this Bill is. founded on last year's Estimates, - but it contains merely a number of votes is not for salaries and contingencies. What is meant by contingencies is left to the-imagination. It is well known that the stages of the Supply Bill is required in order that honourable members may be given an opportunity to criticise the action of the Government and the work of the public Departments. The country at the present time is very much dissatisfied with the administration of some of the more important Departments, and, notably, of the Treasury. During last year and the greater portion of this year there has been a game of battledore and shuttlecock going on between the Treasury and Post and Telegraph Department. When 'the Post ancl Telegraph Department has been blamed for not carrying out its work the officers of that Department have in their turn blamed the Treasury for not having provided them with sufficient money. We had a statement from the Treasurer this afternoon in which the honourable gentlewould be all man attempted to explain where the trouble really lies, but it was of so discursive a character that I think it must have left would no honourable members in as big a fog as ever. Now the honourable gentleman asks us to forego our right of criticism, and I enter my strong protest against this unbusinesslike method of conducting the business of the country. I can quite understand the force of the contention that the 1 salaries of the public servants ' must be provided for almost immediately. of But who is to blame for that ? The blame certainly rests with the Government for havmust ing neglected to afford the House a reasonthink able opportunity to criticise the expenditure upon various Departments. with the Electoral Office, it is proposed to appropriate £ 9 0 0 for salaries, and £ 2 for ""contingencies."" In the same partment we are asked to vote £ expenses connected with the administration of the Electoral Act, in the absence discussed last year. of any explanation as to what that large sum is intended to cover. We have been informed that the expenditure incurred in connection with the recent visit of the American Fleet aggregated £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 , and we are now asked to vote £ 6 , 0 0 0 to cover immediate demands consequent upon those festivities. The Bil l is practically divided into two parts, the first of which relates to "" salaries,"" and the next to "" contingencies."" Nobody appears, to understand what the latter term covers, and it is only reasonable that particulars should be forthcoming. Under "" ferred Expenditure,"" we are asked propriate £ 4 4 2 , 0 0 0 for the purposes of the Postal Department, in addition to £ 5 , under the heading of "" Other "" expendiplaced ture. Yet we are to be prevented from crithat ticising the administration ment. I protest against the Bill being dealt with in the hasty manner proposed.",68
435,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Yarra) [10.59] - I certainly think that we are entitled to an planation of the expenditure covered by term "" contingencies.''",69
436,Dr LIDDELL,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"In Victoria, the expenditure under . that heading, amounts £ 3 ° j ° o o , which is equal to the sum exsystem as much as he does. pended in all the other States.",69
437,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I would point out to honourable member that the salaries which we Budget. are asked to vote in connection with the Postal Department In New South Wales adhere to which he refers amount to £ 8 8 , 0 0 0 and the contingencies represent £ 3 3 , 0 0 0 , whereas in Victoria the salaries total B £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 , and the contingencies are reless sponsible for only £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 . like the Postmaster-General to say why therefore, in Tasmania the expenditure under "" contingencies "" represents almost 50 cent, of the amount payable as salaries, whilst in Victoria it represents only seventh of the salaries payable? Should the Commonwealth public servants not receive the salaries due to them at the middle this month, I do not desire the respon. sibility to be thrown upon me. That fault rest witli the Government. I certainly that it is due to the House that we should know what particular items in this In connection Bill "" contingencies "" are intended to cover.",69

440,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"We have not had an opportunity of examining those items. The Bill consists of ""salaries"" and ""contingencies,"" the latter involving the expenditure of immense sums. I should like to know what items are covered by ""contingencies."" I also desire to know whether the large amount which it is proposed to expend upon defence in New South Wales includes any sum connected with the new defence scheme of the Government.",69
441,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The Bill provides Transfor no works at all,, but merely for the to appayment of ordinary salaries.",69

We may take the ordinary running expenditure as based Supply Bill [14 OCT., 1908.] upon the regular Estimates. Just as Ave may keep a check upon the turnover in business, so we say that it is reasonable to estimate that in two months a certain amount will be required. But, as regards how the money is to be spent, we are the dark, as I believe the Treasurer is.",69
448,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I have already stated that the vote is based on last year's suspense. Estimates.,70
449,Mr SPENCE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"That is not a good way of doing the business of the country, and is time that a greater effort was made away with Supply Bills, and to let us know the purposes for which we are asked to vote not passed. public money. It seems to me tha'f it would have been a far simpler plan to ask formality. for a lump sum for each Department. It 'is a rough method to ask so much for salaries and so much for contingencies, that does not leave us in a proper position to control the finances. I do not wish to - offer any obstruction to the passage of Bill, as the salaries have to be paid.",70

454,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Before the - close of last session, we took three months' supply in order tb enable honourable members to have a recess for that period. I stated then that I would bring down the Estimates as early as possible after House re-assembled. On the 16th Septemwas ber last, we met again, and I had to pare a statement of a very difficult character, but within a month from fhat - time. I have made it. I refrained from ing for a Supply Bill before I made that statement, because I did not think that would have been fair to honourable members - to do so. Honourable members must not - think that we can do without Supply Bills - even when the Estimates have been passed. Suppose, for instance, that we passed new Estimates during this week. ""House would not part with the Appropriagoing (No. 2) 1908-9. 1185 tion Bill until nearly the end of the sesa sion. The power to pay under the approved Estimates would be suspended until the last few days of the session. What would be the practical result?

The Bill does not include any extraneous items or works which are debatable.",70
460,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,The honourable gentleman is following the usual course.,70
461,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Exactly . As: regards the contingencies, I would remind the honourable members that every item of them debated here at length last session, preand explanations given which can be seen in Hansard. I did not anticipate that there would be any debate regarding conasktingencies to-night, because they were debated last year. I expected that the House it would vote the sums for which I amasking until such time as we can pass the Estimates. If the state of public business permits, I want the Prime Minister to allow me an opportunity to deal with the Estithe mates as early as possible, so that we mayThe vote the money, and know what we are to do before we ask for another Supply Bill. That is the proper course to take with reference to our expenditure, which ought to be controlled by Parliament.",70
462,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,The worse of the thing is that the honourable gentleman is asking for Supply on the basis of last year's Estimates for a period of five months.,71

464,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Surely the Estimates could have been brought down much earlier !,71
465,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,No ; they have been brought down within a month from the beginning of the session. It has been an unheard-of thing for a Treasurer to bring down the Estimates and deliver his Budget speech as early as I have done this session.,71
466,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I think that the Budget was delivered earlier last year.,71
467,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,No ; not by a month.,71

I am sure that the House has been thoroughly occupied ever since 'it met. Even if 1 had wanted to make my statement earlier, I could not have obtained the necessary information until the present time. I could not, for instance, form a reasonable estimate of the revenue likely to be obtained from Customs and Excise until the beginning or middle of this month. In the early part of this year, it looked as if we were not likely to have anything like the revenue which we now have a prospect of receiving - and",71

I have strained everv nerve in order to arrive at the present position, so that we can go on at any moment with the Estimates, and let honourable members vote the money before we ask them to pass another Supply Bill. I would ask' for only one month's supply to-night, but, before we could turn round, we should have to ask for another Supply Bill, and. the same trouble would be experienced.",71

I promise that, if possible,, the Estimates will be discussed before further supply is asked for. I do not think it. is proper that supply should be obtained,, in the ordinary course of events, until the Estimates have been dealt with, but I have no option in the special circumstances of the case ",71

478,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,And then the honourable member will proceed once more to doleout sums?,71
479,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Quite so. T had to adopt that course on three different occasions last year, whilst the Tariff wasunder consideration. When a Supply - Bill was passed I was able to replenish the Treasurer's Advance Account, and I managed in that way to carry on until, the Estimates were dealt with.

I intend to ask the Prime Minister to afford the Committee an early opportunity of proceeding with the consideration of the Estimates. T have not held office as Treasurer of the Commonwealth for any length of time, and I certainly do not wish to continue a practice to which I have often objected. I desire to secure the reputation of giving the House an opportunity to deal with the Estimates at the earliest possible date.

486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I am not quite .sure that the honourable member could not. I , for one, think that it is time we made a stand for the control of'the expenditure - of the Commonwealth by this House. Sir' WILLIAM LYNE - I quite admit that.",72
487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"In recent years - we have lost entirely any real and effective scrutiny of the expenditure of the Commonwealth. It may be to some honourable - members a very light matter to vote away large sums as they have been doing of re-cent years, but it is high time that we applied ourselves in a proper way to a strict investigation of the moneys that the coun.try requires. I object most strongly to the - way in which this expenditure is covered up under the heading of "" contingencies."" I think, Mr Chairman, that the way in - which the Treasurer is carrying on in the Labour corner is positively indecent. - suggest that we should elect a chairman for the Corner; we should then be able to - proceed.  - Chairman, it seems to me",72
488,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I have not finished.,72
489,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The honourable .member resumed his sea.t.  to listen to this outcry against the voting - of large sums under the heading of "" C o n tingencies."" I have avivid recollection of the stand which I took for three years in the early history of this Parliament in opposition to the practice of voting large sums under the headings of ""Contingencies',"" "" Salaries,"" and laneous,"" without anything like complete information as to what those items covered. Sir George Turner, who was then Treasurer, assured us that everything w.as in perfect order, and I met with little sympathy. We were told by the Treasurer of'the day that the Supply Bills, as they were submitted to us from time to time, provided for ordinary expenditure, and his assurance was accepted. That is why I am surprised that honourable members to-night are not prepared to accept a similar assurance from the Treasurer.",72
490,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"We have come round g' aa< to bear testimony to to the honourable member's way of thinking.  calls to my mind the complaint made tonight by the Treasurer in the course of not do his Budget statement, that States officials were to blame for the large unexpended balances in respect of votes for the carrying out of public works for the Commonwealth. The delay in carrying out public works is due to the fact that, as a rule, six months of the financial year have passed before the Estimates relating to new works and buildings are dealt with.",72
491,Mr HUME COOK,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"That is only partially the reason.  was the cause of the trouble in South Australia. The Treasurer ought to submit the Estimates earlier in the year, so that new works may be proceeded with. We are invariably told that works that are really urgent cannot be proceeded with until the Estimates are passed.",72
492,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"That is necessary, otherwise Parliament would have no control over the expenditure.  necessary, I do not think..that we ought to blame States officials for delay in carrying out public works, which is due rather to the late stage in the session in which the Estimates are usually passed. The Estimates for new works and buildings will not be dealt with this year until Christmas is close at hand. The States authorities generally have six months in which to carry out these works. And af the end of that time a large amount of the inoney is naturally unexpended, and a number of people are complaining that the works are not completed. A large amount was not expended last year. The blame really attaches to us for not passing the "" Miscel- Estimates in time to allow the work to be done. ,",72
493,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I wish to have the Estimates passed in time this year.  Supply Bill itself, for three yearSj on every possible occasion^ I raised objections, and was assured that there was nothing new in the items voted. We have had a similar assurance from the Treasurer to-night. He tells us that the votes are based upon the actual expenditure in the previous year. I see nothing to object to in the Bill in that respect, though I should certainly like to obtain fuller details as to the expenditure covered by ""Miscellaneous"" and "" Contingencies."" There is one Department as to which the vote for salaries is £1,500, whilst the "" Contingencies"" aire £700 and the "" Miscellaneous "" £6,000. That is to say the vote for "" Miscellaneous "" is four times the amount for salaries.",72
494,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Parramatta) [11.28] - It is time that we made a protest against the wav in which these Estimates are presented to Parliament. I am not saying this for the first time. It is positively absurd for us to attempt to criticise the details. Everything is covered up in ""Contingencies,"" ""Miscellaneous,"" and other items for which we have no details. We are voting this money without knowing what it is for, on the simple assurance of the Treasurer that it is "" all right."" We have been doing the same sort of thing for eighteen months. Last year we did it until the very closing month of the financial year, when we passed a final Supply Bill, the Estimates not having been dealt with. If we could see any prospect of a reasonable scrutiny of the Estimates during the currency of this Supply Bill, there would not be so much to object to in it. Considering that no very urgent public business is going forward, the Government ought at least to be content with Supply for one month.",73
495,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"If I asked for Supply for one month, I should have to come to Parliament again before very long.",73

497,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I hope not.,73

506,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Wide Bay) [n.31] - It is refreshing to know that the deputy leader of the Opposition is waking up to his duties. Is it not a fact that the form of this Bill is different from any other temporary Supply Bill brought before any other Parliament in Australia,, and is not its form occasioned by a desire to please_ another Chamber? It would befar better if the Treasurer wanted' £750,000 for temporary supply purposes, to omit details. The details now supplied' are worthless, as every one admits. On a previous occasion, when the honourable member for Parramatta raised a question about contingencies, I said that we ought, not to deceive the public in these matters. The details supplied with this Bill arereally nothing more than a placard. They are furnished for no other purpose thanto meet the wishes of another place. T admit at once that there ought to be morefinancis;l discussion in this House thanthere has been in the past.

I believe they were introduced on ihe 8th August. The Treasurer gives as an excuse for delay on the present occasion that Parliament has not been sitting. But he has had a sufficient recess, and the Budget could have been prepared then.",74

On page 284 it will be seen that £ 2 5 , 5 2 8 was voted, and only £ 4 , 9 0 0 was spent. On the next page the total appropriated for New South Wales was £ 4 0 , 0 0 0, of which only £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 was spent. Those Estimates were passed last year earlier than is likely to be the case this year. Do the Government propose any different system in order to expedite the works? For Victoria £77>ooo was appropriated, and only £ 2 7 , 0 0 0 spent. Are we to continue to pass Estimates for large sums for works and buildings, of which only about one-fourth or one-fifth will be expended? What is the use of voting money in that way year after year ? We are asked to vote five months' supply on the basis of the old Estimates, without a penny for works arid buildings.",74
514,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I cannot go into those to-night.,74

519,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,This is the worse year that we have ever had in that respect.,74
520,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I think it is. I have urged the Minister of Home Affairs to see that the works are proceeded with without delay, and not to allow votes to lapse, as they did last year. I have emphasized the necessity for action by him in that direction. The Post and Telegraph Department expended within £ 8 , 0 0 0 of the vote passed for its purposes last year.",74

524,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Immediately the debate on the Budget is concluded, the works and buildings Estimates will be dealt with.

The honourable member for Yarra has shown that in one Department only 25 per cent, of last year's appropriations were expended, and there may be ample justification for inquiry into the contingencies and miscellaneous expenditure set down in the Bill.",75

533,Mr FRAZER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Yes ; but it is unreasonable to ask us to vote £750,000 in a Bill of which we received copies only today.

542,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Parramatta) [11.51] - I appeal to the Treasurer to comply with the request from below the gangway. I agreed to allow the Bill to go through, and, as a consequence, have been subjected to the jibes and jeers of members below the gangway. I have been told that I have not , done my duty in not preventing the Bill from passing. The Government should protect its friends on this side when they are attacked in this way. I hope that progress will' be reported, so that we may meet in a more reasonable frame of mind tomorrow. I should like to know if my honourable friends are serious. The amendment of the honourable member for Lang is a slug: for their blunderbuss, and, if they mean business, let them use it. If they do not, let them put away that rusty old weapon, so that we may go home.",75
543,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Boothby) [11.53]. leader of the Opposition misunderstands our position. We plead for an opportunity to properly criticise the Bill, but do not propose to take action hostile to the Government. From his point of view, no doubt, criticism is absurd, unless its aim is to turn out the Ministry. We have no reason for supporting the amendment. He. suggests that it _will test our sincerity; but it will not do so, and therefore I shall not vote for it. I have a right to protest against being asked to pass this Bill on such short notice. The Postmaster General has taken credit for expending all but £8,000 of the amount voted for his Department last year, but in the Estimates, at page 292, - I find the itemLess amount which it is anticipated may not be expended during year, £48,467. First of all, the total appropriation was £411,877, and the, amount actually expended was only £356,041, and the difference is the amount which the Post and Telegraph Department did not expend.",75
544,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"-That was for new works, and not under the control of the Department.",75
545,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"But it is here clearly stated that the expenditure was under the control of the Postmaster General. . Mr Mauger - I say that £8,000 was unexpended, and no more. .",75

555,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The figures are not quite correct. wrong at all ; it was not anticipated that the sum of £48*467 would be expended, and Parliament did not vote it. The with actual sum voted was £363,410.",76
556,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Adelaide) [12.4 a.m.]. about the total. - In view of the Royal Commission which is at present investigating the affairs of Department, and of the answers which are plain the matter. regularly received from the Postmaster General respecting the non-expenditure of moneys appropriated, that gentleman's cent statement is of exceptional importance. The honourable gentleman must go further in explanation or concede an adjournment for a few hours, in order that the point raised by the honourable member for Boothby may be investigated. Certainly the Postmaster-General, in his brief explanation, has not given anything like a statement. He has deliberately inbetormed us that the sum of £48,467 was not voted by Parliament; and, if that be the case, the whole of the Estimate, so as his Department is concerned, is in Deerror. Does the Postmaster-General say that the appropriation of £21,506, as on page 290, for the construction extension of telegraph lines, instruThe ments and material, is wrong? Was that Deamount voted by Parliament for expenditure during the year 1907-8?",76
557,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Yes .,76
558,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Then the presumption that on each of the separate items in the Estimates of this Department the honourable gentleman must give the same reply, and, totalling the whole of the items, we must reach the grand total of £411,000, in which case the £48,000 which the honourable gentleman told us was not appropriated by Parliament was really appropriated, judging by the reply which he gave in connection witli the single item.",76
559,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,The amounts are voted in sub-divisions.,76
560,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"That does not alter the position at all. If honourable members will look at page 290 of the Estimates, will find a sub-division, for which the sum of . £116,892 is set down. If I ask the * Postmaster-General whether that t amount is correct, his answer will be us, "" Yes "" ; and if we add together the amounts for the whole of the sub-divisions, was we again reach the grand total of £411,000; and yet, when the Minister was asked whether Parliament appropriated may that amount, his answer was "" No.""",76
561,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,The answer was,76
562,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,The honourable gentleman must have been wrong in his answer respect to the particular item if he was right in the answer he gave when asked,76

564,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I shall be very glad reto hear the honourable gentleman do so.,76
565,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Hume-Trea surer) [12.10 a.m.] - The matter is regulated in accordance with the method adopted in the Post Office, and I do not know that it is the best method to adopt. The honourable member for Adelaide has referred to particular items, but the practice has been to estimate the saving, not upon one or two items, but upon the whole of the items. In this way, the estimated savings on the whole of the items in the Estimates referred to amounted to £48,467. The estimate of expenditure, which I brought down, as Treasurer, was £411,000. The savings estimated to be made by the Department, amounting to £48,467, were taken off that amount and were not voted, so that the sum actually voted was £363,000. I referred to the matter today in dealing with a paper which came before the Treasurer just before I took charge of the Treasury Department. I showed that a claim of £511,000 by the Department was reduced by £86,000. Sir John Forrest further reduced the amount by £20,000, and that amount represented the general saving, exactly as the amount of £48,467 in the Estimates referred to represented the general savings on the Post and Telegraph vote.",76
566,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Wh v is this method adopted by the Post and Telegraph Department when it is not followed by the Home Affairs Department?,77
567,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Because of the multiplicity of works carried out by the .Post and Telegraph Department.,77
568,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The Post and Telegraph Department is a very large Department. The officers do not care to be confined to particular items for savings of a particular amount. They prefer to estimate the general amount for savings over the whole vote, which may subsequently be distributed over particular items. I can tell honourable members the practice that was followed in New South Wales when I held office there as Minister for Works. A large sum was voted in the schedule for works, and, at the head of the schedule, there appeared the intimation that the expenditure was not to exceed the total amount, but that the votes might be varied from one work to another. The intention was that if it was found that the amount voted for a particular item was short, something might be taken from another vote to make up the deficiency.",77
569,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,A very undesirable practice.,77
570,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I think it was; Rut it was continued in New South Wales for many years. In the same way, an estimate is made of the total savings on the vote for the Post and Telegraph Department, and if it is found that the amount set down for one item is not sufficient, something is taken from another where thf amount voted is believed to be in excess of what will be required.",77
571,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"We can understand that explanation; but it is certainly a new one. ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I happen to know all about these matters. The amount of £48,467 is, if I may so describe it, a general gleaning of savings, not upon one item, but upon the whole of the items for the Department. If the total expenditure did not exceed the £363,000, the Treasurer would not interfere, but if that amount were exceeded, I should step in and require to know why.",77
572,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I presume that the expenditure is only upon works authorized byParliament.,77
573,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Certainly. The Secretary to the Treasury has raised the question whether this is a wise practice to adopt, and the answer generally, has been, as the Postmaster-General has indicated, that as the departmental vote covers a multitude of items, it is impossible, in the case of any particular item, to say exactly what the saving is likely to be.",77
574,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,But Parliament might be given a record of the expenditure on every item.,77
575,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,That is done. - Mr BATCHELOR - The practice is to load up the total so as to have a little to go and come upon in dealing with each item.,77
576,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The practice has been to estimate the total savings and distribute them as required over the various items. I never interfere with a Department, so long as it keeps within its vote. But if the Department went beyond its vote, as the Post and Telegraph'Department would, in this case, have done if the expenditure exceeded £363,000, when the application was made to me for money from the Treasurer's Advance, I should require to know what it was wanted for, and I should then take control of the matter, and say how much should be spent. I hope I have now made the matter clear.",77
577,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Yarra) [12.14 a.m.] --Assuming that the honourable gentleman's explanation is correct, I point out that whilst the vote was £363,000 last year, we are this vear to be asked to vote £356,000 ; and I assume that the amount of estimated savings has not been deducted.",77
578,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"There are no savings on that amount. iVIr. TUDOR - If the Treasurer will look at page 290 of the Estimates, he will nnd that there is an estimated saving of £4,107 for New South Wales, and of £""4,720 for Victoria, and so on down the list. Then the totals appear less the estimated savings during the year?",78
579,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,They ought to appear.,78
580,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The estimated savings are as follows:-Ne w South Wales, £ 4 , 1 7 0; Victoria, £ 4 , 7 2 0; Queensland,. .£1,795; South Australia, £i,545i. Western Australia, £1,080; and Tasmania, £740. If the total amount unexpended last year was £48,467, why is not a similar line shown upon these Estimates?",78
581,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Because the estimated savings have been deducted from the previous lines, and only £60,000, for example,, instead of 100,000 has been carried forward.",78
582,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Then for this year the total net expenditure is shown as against the total gross expenditure for last year.,78
583,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I think that the arrangement of the Estimates might be improved. ',78
584,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I am sure that it can be. Before we are afforded an opportunity of discussing these Estimates, we find that several months of the financial year have expired. I joined with others earlier in the evening in requesting an adjournment of the debate upon this Bill, so that we might have a reasonable opportunity of examining the items embodied hi it.",78
585,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Honourable members will probably have an opportunity of - dealing with these Estimates this month.,78
586,Mr CHANTER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Riverina) [12.20 a.m.]. - I think that honourable members are a little bitunreasonableto-night. It has always been customary to permit the necessary business of the House to be transacted in time to enable honourable members who reside outside the city to catch their last trains and trams. What can be gained from this debate? Absolutely nothing. As a matter of fact, the Estimates are not before us. I have always objected to the system of delaying the consideration of the Esti- mates until the fag end of the session. Upon this occasion, however, the Treasurer is entitled to credit for having made his Budget speech much earlier than usual. The Bill merely provides for the carrying - on of the ordinary services of the country, the items contained in it being based upon the expenditure of last year. In view of the Treasurer's statement early in the evening that he would confer with the Prime Minister as to when the Estimates were likely to be proceeded with, and of his subsequent declaration that the debate upon his Budget would open on Tuesday next, I think it is somewhat unreasonable to engage in a discussion which can have no practical result.",78
587,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Does the honourable member think that a debate of two hours upon a Supply Bill covering two months is unreasonable?,78
588,Mr CHANTER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The honourable member knows perfectly well that since the opening of the session honourable members . opposite have been pressing the Government to deal with no other measure than the Seat of Government Bill. Two or three days ago it was known that the Treasurer would deliver his Budget today, and that he would, subsequently, ask the House to pass a Supply Bill covering necessary expenditure. We oannot discuss the Estimates for the current financial year at this juncture, because they are not before us. Personally, I have always held the view that the consideration of the Estimates should be the first business with which Parliament should be asked to deal each session. In the face of the Treasurer's statement that he would proceed with the consideration of the Estimates on Tuesday next, and that this Bill only covers necessary items, I think that honourable members should treat him in a' better way than they have done and pass the Bill without this critical debate, which cannot lead to any result or elicit that kind of information which is desired. Mr ROBERTS' (Adelaide) [12.26 a.m.]. - I am very grateful to the Treasurer for his explanation of the method adopted ; but I suggest that we might have something different. It seems to me that it is distinctly - though , of course, not deliberately-de ceptive. Suppose, for instance, that we vote £20,000 for a given purpose. An average person would form the impression that within a few pounds that sum would be expended on that item. But, unfortunately, the Minister for the Department decides that he will save a particular sum on the total vote. He. is not certain in his mind as to the items on which that sum shall be saved, but on the total vote of, say, £400,000 he intends to curtail the expenditure to the extent of £50,000. .The idea of making what he calls that saving is hi his mind when he forms the estimate. The suggestion that he does not know on which item this saving is to be made scarcely meets the'case in that he is not confined to the actual expenditure on any particular line. £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 may be voted for one line and £ 5 , 0 0 0 for another line, but the expenditure may be actually transposed. There is no power to interfere with him then. The only power we have for effective criticism is on the actual total when we come, to deal with the Estimates of nextyear. But when the Treasurer is forming his Estimates the items given are deceptive, in that when he comes to the total he says, "" I am going to curtail that expenditure by - £5 > 0 0 0 0 - "" I * is & > large way of doing the thing, but it seems to me that when framing the Estimates he might reasonably curtail each item by £ 1 , 0 0 0 or £ 2 , 0 0 0 . _",78
589,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,That is not practicable.,79
590,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,It is.,79
591,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"We l l , I speak frorn a good deal of experience.",79
592,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,It is just as difficult to curtail the total expenditure at the beginning of the year as it is to curtail the expenditure on the different items. of no particular item is the Minister limited.,79
593,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Is he not?,79
594,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The Treasurer will find that on one item the appropriation may be £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 , and the expenditure £ 5 , 0 0 0 , and ' that on the next item the appropriation may be^ £ 1 5 , 0 0 0 ' and the expenditure £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 . . lutely no limit one other. The limit is in regard to the total, ' and that is where the Treasurer steps inand demands that a' particular Minister shall not overstep .the bounds. Does the Treasurer ever Intervene with a colleague and say that a sum of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 having been appropriated for a particular service, he shall not spend more than that sum on that item?",79
595,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Yes, should have to wait for a fresh appropriation if we could not carry out the work for the sum voted, unless, of course, an additional sum could be obtained from the Treasurer's Advance Account.",79
596,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Did the Treasurer intervene when the Minister exceeded the appropriation of £ 7 9 , 0 0 0 for the construction and extension of telephone lines, instruments, and materials, including the construction of conduits and the placing of wires underground, by the sum of £ 4 , 0 0 0 ?",79
597,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I am quite certain* that I had to step in. I had a pretty goodi '-' go "" with him over that.",79
598,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"It will be seen that, we are obtaining information all the time.",79

602,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,So long as the grand total was not exceeded.,79
603,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I did not say anything about the grand total. a ne,79
604,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,That is what I understood the honourable gentleman to state..,79
605,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,I stepped in in a great many cases.,79
606,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"It seems that the Treasurer interferes in the case of every item where the expenditure happens toexceed the vote. He might have saved, some time if he had made a proper explanation to the Committee. There mightbe some method adopted other than what. really amounts to deception. In the case",79
607,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,A different' method has; been adopted this year.,79
608,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Is theie any anticipated saving this year? If there is an. anticipated saving in bulk, the several items must be deceptive. We find that a deduction is made from the total in respect There is abso- of a probable saving, and the Minister is= way or the quite unable to say on which item that saving is to be effected. People may imagine,, on looking at the Estimates, that ""in respect. of a certain item £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 is to be expended, but they are unable to say that the Minister may not make a saving in connection with that very item. This practice enables the Minister when questioned on the subject to reply, "" It is all a quesdecidedly. We tion of finance."" There is no possibility of any one pinning down a Minister to a particular method. He may continue to give the same stereotyped reply to every question, with the result that a Royal Commission may be appointed to inquire into the administration of another Department. With the honourable member for Bourke as Chairman of the Postal Commission, thePostmaster-General may view with the greatest complacency the appointment of"" that body; but I suggest to the Treasurer that a different system might well be - adopted. The present system, it seems to me, affords a Minister an opportunity to - mislead honourable members- I do not say that a Minister would do so deliberatelyrespecting the expenditure on a particular item, and we may continue to receive in - answer to questions a reply which I gather from honourable members is becoming somewhat offensive, in so far as the Postmaster-General's Department is concerned. The Treasurer said last night that the Secretary to the Treasury had called attention on two or three occasions to the objectionable features of this system.",79
609,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The honourable member will note that, in consequence ""of the Secretary to the Treasury having done so, an alteration has been made in the old system.",80
610,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,The Treasurer might well explain the alteration that has been .made.,80
611,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,An alteration has been made in the method of arranging the figures.,80
612,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"In the method of arrangement which has been attended with some very awkward results in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department? I have heard, all over Australia, comments - on the replies given to questions by the Postmaster-General. A few days ago, I ventured to put to him a question respecting some work that I had reasonable ground for believing would be attended to. His answer-give n in the most off-hand manner-was , "" Everything depends upon the finances."" I thought to obtain a somewhat clearer statement by writing to him, but his written reply was even more hazy than his verbal one. I shall return to the attack in the hope of obtaining a more definite statement. Duringi my short career as a member of this Parliament, I have had the privilege of addressing two letters to the Postmaster-General's Department, and the replies, for evasiveness, are of a character deserving the highest commendation. Whether such replies are characteristic of the Department, I do not know, but, if they are, the Minister must expect to meet with a little adverse'criticism. I ask the Treasurer for more information as to the improvement effected under the new system as compared with that of preceding years.",80
613,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Hume-Trea surer) [12.42 a.m.] - If the honourable member will turn to page 292 of the Estimates he will see that the total appropriated for 19078 in respect of division No. 5 was £411,877. From that a deduction of £48,467 was made in respect of the amount which it was anticipated might not be expended during the year. Under the heading of New South Wales, page 290, provision is made in respect of the current financial year for items totalling £95,826, less an estimated saving of £4,170, which reduces the amount to- £91,656. That is the item that is voted on. Then, again, turning, to page 292, the honourable member will see that the total for the division No. 5 is £356,140, and that although the words "" Less amount which it is anticipated may not be expended during year "" follow, in respect of the appropriations for 1907-8 no deduction is made at that point in respect of the vote for 19089. The figures under each heading of the division are adjusted, and there is no readjustment at the end of the division such as there was last year under the system to which I and the Secretary to the Treasury objected.",80
614,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Adelaide) [12.45 a.m.]. - There is a distinct improvement, I find, as a result of the explanation made by the Treasurer. The improvement is so noticeable that I am surprised that he has not recognised .that this line called "" savings "" should not appear at all. Previously we have had the amount given in a grand total. Now it is given under different headings. We learn that the Minister for a particular Department makes an estimate of the amount he expects to spend under a particular division, and afterwards arrives at the conclusion that he will curtail the expenditure by a certain amount.",80
615,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Not curtail j may possibly not spend the amount.,80
616,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I prefer the word "" curtail "" to the more deceptive word ""saving.""",80
617,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"How is it possible fo estimate the exact amount to be spent? MT. ROBERTS - I am not asking the Minister to do so. Attention has been called to the method of constructing the Estimates. We find on inquiry that the Treasurer's Department has questioned it seriously, to such an extent that the Minister himself has been forced to adopt an improvement. He has gone half-way along the road to effect an improvement. He would complete the work by cutting out the item altogether.",80
618,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,The item is not there this year.,80
619,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"It is in five places instead of one. It is not placed in the resolution of Supply grand total as it was last year. For instance, under "" V i c to r i a "" there is an alleged saving of £ 4 , 7 2 0 , and under the heading of ' ' New South Wales"" also a large amount.",81
620,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"I rise to order. I desire to know whether it is competent for the honourable member for Adelaide to anticipate discussion upon the Estimates-intable Chief, which will come on for consideration at a later date?",81
621,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"The honourable occasion member is quite in order in the line of address that he is pursuing. The Committee is entitled to redress of grievances before the grant of Supply, and if the honourable member chooses to adopt his present line of argument he is entitled to do so.",81
622,Mr FRAZER,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,It was a ridiculous point posedof order for an ex-Chairman to take.,81
623,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Possibl y the honourable member for Laanecoorie considers he has some justification for his action, I have not been many weeks a member of this House. But may I say to him that I 'have hacl, perhaps, more parliamentary experience than he has had. surer has a method of framing Estimates they were never intended to bear. that is entirely new to me. I have called attention to it without having had an portunity of consulting the Secretary of Department; but it appears that the method has been questioned by his own officers such an extent that a decided alteration has been made. But we are still at a loss as to the items upon which the Minister expects to make what he calls a "" saving next year.",81
624,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,Canno t the Minister have a little latitude?,81
625,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"He has all the latidividuals. tude that he desires, because he over-estimates expenditure in some instances under-estimates it in others. The method present adopted leads honourable members to believe that the expenditure will be to a certain amount, although by showing whr.the calls a "" saving "" the Minister permitted to withhold expenditure at his discretion by saying that it all depends upon the state of the finances. Under these circumstances the Estimates are not guide, as they ought to be, to honourable members. Amendment negatived. Question resolved in the affirmative... Standing Orders suspended, and resolution reported and adopted. Resolution of Ways and Means covering adopted. Ordered-'That Sir William Lyne and Mr Groom do» prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the there is foregoing resolutions. Bill presented by Sir WILLIAM LYNE , and passed through all its stages.

626,Mr EWING,DEPARTMENT OUT OF LOAN MONEYS FOR WORKS AND,"Richmond-Minister of that Defence) [12.57 a.m.] - When speaking, as in the House a few days ago, I drew some allegorical sketches on broad lines,, which were not intended for microscopicexamination. An interpretation has beeni The Treagiven to some of my remarks whichi I was dealing simply with the broad quesoption of the serious injury that had been his inflicted upon our defence forces, and the impossibility of procuring officers if they to were expected to spend large sums on dress. That was the end I had in view. I was dealing with the matter in a nonpersonal way, from the point of view of "" the system', and not in any way with in dividuals. I trust it will be recognised' that my remarks were intended to deal solely with the questions of system and procedure, and not to refer in any way to in and Mr Webster (Gwydir) [12.59 a.m.] at I desire to ask the Treasurer whether heintends to go right on with the Estimates, up because the members of the Opposition aremost anxious to get them out of the way. is Measures of great importance for the benefit of this country' are pending, and an effort should be made to dispose of the Estimates at the earliest possible moment. a The members of the Opposition are prepared, at any sacrifice, to assist the Government in that direction, so that we may proceed with the Defence Bill , and otherimportant measures.
