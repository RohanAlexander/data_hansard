1,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Will the Attorney General cause the Divorce Bill to be circulated amongst honourable members during the adjournment about to take place?,4
2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Althoug h a draft of the Bill has been prepared, the Government have not had an opportunity of settling its terms. Until that is done and"" the Bill put before the House, it would' certainly be most improper to publish it. The Bill ought to have been introduced' long ago, but the excuse of the Government must be the extraordinary circumstances in which the country finds itself. It will be introduced at the earliest possible moment when we resume our sittings. NA ADVERTISEMENTS.",4
3,Mr HIGGS,ENEMY TRADING,"In connection with theTrading with the Enemy Act, I wish to know whether the Attorney-General baff seen an advertisement published in theArgus, and covering about a quarter of a. page, in reference to "" Sanatogen,"" which, I understand, is a German preparation?"" If so, has he satisfied himself that this preparation, or some portion of it, which is said to be entirely British made, is notmade in Germany?",4
4,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY TRADING,"The position in regard"" to "" Sanatogen "" and a number of otherpreparations of German origin which have a wide reputation, has been considered by my Department aa well as hy the Government. Thero can be no doubt whateverthat "" Sanatogen"" and one or two other patent medicines or foods are of German origin, and that the profits derived from: them go to Germany. The Government, have decided that no newspaper publishing an advertisement relating to this preparation shall be permitted to passthrough the post.",4
5,Mr KELLY,ENEMY TRADING,"Following on the ques*tion put to the Attorney-General by thelionorable member for Capricornia, I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he bas yet taken any step to put into effect the recommendation I made to b i m last week, and in which be concurred, that the Government sbould absolutely prohibit the importation into Australia of all goods covered by an enemy trade-mark or trade description ?",4
6,Mr FISHER,ENEMY TRADING,"The matter bas been given consideration, but it is one that cannot be decided in a day. No man can say ofMiand what goods may not be excluded to our own disadvantage, and bowever strong may be our desire to fight the enemy, we are not going-if I may use an every-day expression-to cut off our noses to spite our faces.",5
7,Mr HIGGS,ENEMY TRADING,"I understand that the Minister of Trade and Customs has in the past prohibited the importation of certain quack medicines that claimed to do more than they could do. I wish to know whether the Minister bas observed the claims which 'are set forth in this morning's Argus as to the virtues of "" Sanatogen,"" informing the public that old people will be made healthier, happier, and more vigorous, and that it will produce a real and lasting improvement in one's bodily health, a definite increase in one's nerve energy, and a profoundly beneficial effect upon every organ and function in one's body? Is the Minister satisfied that this medicine can do all that it claims to do; bave his analysts in formed b i m that the advertisement is fraudulent in its claims, and will he therefore prohibit the importation of the medicine ?",5
8,Mr TUDOR,ENEMY TRADING,"T he sole control that the Customs Department has of this matter under the Commerce Act is the power to prohibit the importation of any article which does not comply with certain restrictions which are laid down. I am not sure wliether "" Sanatogen"" is one of the articles which has been dealt with from an advertisement point of view, though I do not think that its importation would be allowed with the leaflets making these claims accompanying it ; but once an article comes in there is no power to prevent leaflets being printed and wrapped round the bottles or tins. In the Customs Department there are advertisements from nearly all the newspapers of Australia advertising quack remedies which would not bave been permitted bad they accompanied the bottles on their i m portation.",5
9,Dr MALONEV,ENEMY TRADING,It could be stopped if we provided that the formula sbould be printed on the label.,5
10,Mr TUDOR,ENEMY TRADING,A recent House of Commons inquiry approved of the action taken by the Customs Department here as being absolutely the best that could be taken as far as the power of the Commonwealth existed to protect the people in this regard. Unfortunately we cannot deal with the newspapers which publish these advertisements.,5
11,Mr KELLY,ENEMY TRADING,"H as the Attorney General directed the attention of the newspapers to the enemy nature and character of ""Sanatogen""? If not, does he propose to give them warning as to his intention to penalize them for continuing such publication ?",5
12,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY TRADING,"Certainly . But I assume that they will take this declaration of the policy of the Government as a warning. We do not propose to proceed against the newspapers without warning. In addition to "" Sanatogen,"" I propose to notify the other preparations which, in the opinion of the Department, f all within the same class, after which any newspaper publishing such advertisements will fall within the scope of the notification. NAVYDEPARTMENT DIGEST.",5
13,Mr KING OMALLEY,ENEMY TRADING,"Will the Minister for the Navy state whether it is true as reported that he proposes to in troduce in connection with his Department a digest such as that issued by the Department of Home Affairs, so that he may keep a grip over the Department of which he is the first Sea Lord ?",5
14,Mr JENSEN,ENEMY TRADING,"I have instructed the Chief Accountant of the Navy Department to examine the digest system followed by the Department of Home Affairs with a view to its application to the Department of the Navy. WHEAT CHARTER AGREEMENT.  surplus of 3 | per cent, out of the 5 per cent, rebate granted in connection with the chartering of ships for wheat and wool freights, I wish to ask the Attorney General whether he will recommend to the State Premiers that the residue, whatever it may be, after providing for expenses incurred, shall be refunded to the producers either in the shape of a reduction in freights or otherwise?",5
15,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY TRADING,"The position of the Commonwealth in this matter is that of agent for the States. The expenses in curred by the States and the Commonwealth in chartering freights will have to be provided for out of the 3 | per cent, to which the honourable member refers. The residue, whatever it is, will be handed to the various States, and they can either hand it over to the shippers or direct to the farmers. We do not propose to make any claim of any kind. Our only interest in the matter is that the expenses of the freight arrangement, whatever they areand, compared with the tremendous magnitude of the transaction, they will be relatively small-mus t be borne by the transaction. Subject to that, the matter is at the disposal of the States.",6
16,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENEMY TRADING,"I wish to ask the Attorney-General whether, havsteps ing regard to the agreement which he entered into with the shipping agents, is not a fact that there will be a surplus of Â£30,000 out of the Commonwealth's portion of the rebate to cover any exopinion penses that the Federal Government may incur ?",6
17,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY TRADING,"If , as the honourable member has suggested, we do make that unless amount-and it is the first I have heard modity. of it-then , of course, the whole of the 3 | per cent, can go back.",6
18,Mr RODGERS,ENEMY TRADING,"In the event of a charter being arranged abroad, and not directly through the agents of the monwealth, will the charterer abroad ceive 4d. per ton and the local agent f t l is per cent, also?",6
19,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY TRADING,"The charge will bo f t h s per cent, plus 4d. per ton. JA M FOR DEFENCE FORCES.",6
20,Mr HAMPSON,ENEMY TRADING,"Will the Minister for the Navy ascertain if the reputed 2-lb. tins of jam supplied to the Defence Forces contain only 20 ozs. or less. I so, will he see that, for the future, all tins so supplied contain the of 32 ozs. ?",6
21,Mr JENSEN,ENEMY TRADING,"I had some dealings with this matter when I held the position of Assistant Minister of Defence, and am able to say that the Department purchases jam by weight, irrespective of the tin weights. INTER - STA TE BUTTERTRADE .",6

23,Mr SPEAKER,ENEMY TRADING,Order ! When submitting a question the honourable member is not permitted to read a statement from a newspaper.,6
24,Mr CHANTER,ENEMY TRADING,"The New Soutb Wales Government have prevented dairy farmers from sending their product into Victoria, and if something is not done to protect them they must give up the in dustry. Will the Attorney-General take to protect the interests of these dairy farmers and conserve the freedom of trade it between State and State ?",6
25,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY TRADING,"I know of no warrant profor this action of the State. In my any citizen has a good right of action against a State which interferes in any shape or for m with the free flow of products from one State to another, and u n t i l it has acquired any com",6
26,Mr FISHER,ENEMY TRADING,And then it is absolutely wrong.,6
27,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENEMY TRADING,"In view of the fact, that most of the farmers who are sending Comproduce from State to State, are poor remen who are unable to incur the cost of the necessary legal action against the State, will the Attorney-General undertake to institute the necessary proceedings with the object of having this question settled, or, at all events, will he support any citizen who is willing to take a test case to the Courts ?",6
28,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY TRADING,"If any citizen willsupply evidence for a primd facie case I shall consider it with a view to taking f action directly by the Commonwealth, but I must have the evidence before I could"" full weight think of doing so. TELEPHONERATE S.",6
29,Mr THOMAS,ENEMY TRADING,"Now that the new I telephone rates have been laid on the table by the Postmaster-General, are they in force?",6
30,Mr SPENCE,ENEMY TRADING,"They are not in force. Begulations have yet to be drawn. SMALL AEMS FACTORY, CANBERRA.",7
31,Mr MATHEWS,ENEMY TRADING,Is it the intention of the Minister of Home Affairs to abandon his motion with reference to the building of a Small Arms Factory at Canberra ?,7
32,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENEMY TRADING,No . EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. POSTAL UNIT .,7
33,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ENEMY TRADING,"In selecting postal officials for service in Egypt, will the staffs in the various States be drawn on, thus enabling the unit to have a better all-round geographical knowledge of the States ?",7
34,Mr JENSEN,ENEMY TRADING,When the Minister of Defence is finally deciding this matter I feel sure that every State will be treated on a fair basis. ORDER OF BUSINESS : A DJOURNMENT OF PARLIAMENT .,7
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENEMY TRADING,"Will the Prime Minister say what is to be the course of business at this sitting, and what will be the length of the adjournment that is to be made?",7
36,Mr FISHER,ENEMY TRADING,"I am glad that the right honourable gentleman has asked this question, because I am afraid that I see no prospect of the House adjourning this week. I regret it . However, I tliink that we shall adjourn in time to enable us to pay our respects to the remains of the late Major-General Bridges. If there is work to do we should come back next week to do what we are paid to do. propose that we should sit until the lunch adjournment, and then adjourn until another day.",7
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENEMY TRADING,"I am sure that agreed the Prime Minister will see the unfairness of what he now proposes to do. Does he consider his treatment fair after an arrangement has been made, on the strength of which the Government has been allowed to get a number of Bills through practically without discussion, and after honourable members have sat up all night in order to assist Ministers to get them through ?",7
38,Mr FISHER,ENEMY TRADING,"There was no reflection upon the right honourable gentleman in tended. The state of business here and in another place renders it impossible to adjourn if Parliament is to protect the interests of the people. I regret it . I long for a short adjournment, but it is at present impossible. I appreciate the action of the right honourable gentleman in allowing three urgent Bills to be put through last night.",7
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENEMY TRADING,"Will the Prime Minister postpone dealing with the Income Tax Assessment Bill and the Income Tax Bill in another place until the public have had the opportunity to consider the amendments made in this Chamber, aud so that we may know that we are doing the right thing before the measure is finally placed on the statute book? It was rushed through this Chamber pell-mell, and it would seem that honourable members on this side bave been "" let in "" over the whole business. That will not happen again.",7
40,Mr FISHER,ENEMY TRADING,"I hope that the right honourable gentleman is not right or correct in saying that he has been "" let in . """,7
41,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENEMY TRADING,"We bave been "" let in , "" absolutely.",7
42,Mr FISHER,ENEMY TRADING,"It is the desire of the Government not to have anything passed through Parliament without the approval of Parliament. We cannot postpone indefinitely the taxation which is necessary for public purposes, but there will be a reasonable delay of two or three days.",7
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENEMY TRADING,"I desire to make a personal explanation, in view of circumstances arising out of something, as to which I feel sure there is some misunderstanding. The Prime Minister will I recollect that last evening I discussed with him, and also with Senator Pearce, as representing the Senate, the business to be doue prior to the adjournment. A f t e r a friendly consultation it was",7
44,Mr SPEAKER,ENEMY TRADING,"I am afraid that the honourable member is going beyond a personal explanation, and I suggest that a preferable course for him to take would be to ask leave to make a statement.",7
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENEMY TRADING,That is what I should like to do.,7
46,Mr SPEAKER,ENEMY TRADING,Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member has leave to make a statement? Leave granted.,8
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENEMY TRADING,"As I have already stated, after a friendly consideration of the business sheet, as well as the sad duty we all have to perform today, it was agreed that certain Bills should be put through last evening. I may say that we on this side made a great sacrifice in consenting to put these Bills through without the consideration to which they were entitled; indeed, I think we strained our public duty in order to meet the Government in every possible way. In addition to other business, I allowed the right honourable gentleman to take the Income Tax Bill to the third reading; and further, allowed the Attorney-General to introduce yet another referendum proposal, in order that the second reading of it might be considered today.",8
48,Mr WEST,ENEMY TRADING,You are a philanthropist.,8
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENEMY TRADING,"I very much regret to hear an interjection of that kind. Does the honourable member not see that if arrangements made between parties cannot be adhered to, parliamentary government becomes impossible. I am sure that this is realized by every honourable member opposite, except the honourable member for East Sydney. After making this sacrifice in order to assist in clearing up the business today, we are now coolly told by the Prime Ministeralthough we have fulfilled our part of the bargain generously, and in full measure - that the arrangement cannot be adhered to on his side. I wish it to be understood that I am making no personal reflection on the Prime Minister- I am far from doing that-bu t merely pointing out that if this kind of thing is to go on, it will be absolutely impossible to conduct the business of the House, or to make any sort of working arrangement as between parties. I do not wish the right honourable gentleman to definitely commit himself now, but I ask him to see if the arrangement made cannot be adhered to, and honourable members so informed before the business is concluded today. The position is very serious, and I have never encountered the like before. The Minister of Defence, who controls the business of the Senate, was present, as I say, at the consultation, and if there is any difficulty in another place, I can only express my sorrow. I ask the Prime Minister to seriously reconsider his reply to me just now, and see if it is not possible to carry out the arrangement made.",8
50,Mr FISHER,ENEMY TRADING,I should like leave to make a statement.,8
51,Mr SPEAKER,ENEMY TRADING,Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member have leave to make a statement? Leave granted.,8
52,Mr FISHER,ENEMY TRADING,"My words will be very brief. The facts as stated by the honourable member for Parramatta are correct. I cannot adhere to the arrangement made, and I am very sorry. NA CAMP.",8
53,Mr FENTON,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"Has the Defence Department decided to do away with the twelve days' camp, so far as ordinary training is concerned; and, if so, is it proposed to substitute half-day and day drill? The latter would necessitate many young men who are the support of their families losing considerable time at their work, and I ask the Minister for the Navy to consult with the Minister of Defence with a view to postponing altogether the drills.",8
54,Mr JENSEN,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,I shall be pleased to bring the question of the honourable member under the notice of the Minister. EXPEDITIONARY PORCES. NEWSPAPER POSTAGE : LIVERPOOL CAMP : HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION : VOTING FACILITIES : MENINGITIS : MISSING LETTERS.,8
55,Mr MANIFOLD,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"The other day I asked the Postmaster-General a question regarding the transmission of newspapers to the members of the Australian Expeditionary Forces abroad. I have since received a letter from a gentleman interested in the matter, wbo tells me that, on going to the local suburban post office and presenting two copies of the Argus, made up in one packet, for the front, he was told that he would have to pay postage of Id. on each of the papers. At another post office he was informed that he would have to pay 4d., because the packet could not go as newspaper matter, there being more than one newspaper. The gentleman, following the matter up, took the packet to the post office in Bourke-street East, where the official in formed him that, as it was under 16 ozs., and was addressed to the Forces, it could be sent for I d . Is it a fact authority for sending newspapers to the front at that rate ?",8
56,Mr SPENCE,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"I shall make inquiries, and give the honourable member a reply later.",9
57,Mr ORCHARD,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"The Minister for the Navy promised that he would visit Liverpool Camp during his visit to Sydney last week-end, in order to see for himself the condition of certain conveniences there. Can the honourable gentleman inform us as to the result of his observations ?",9
58,Mr JENSEN,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"I did promise to visit the Camp, and made all arrangements to carry out my intention, but I was suddenly called by the Prime Minister, and had to leave Sydney on the Sunday night. That, of course, prevented me visiting the Camo.",9
59,Mr MATHEWS,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,H as the Minister for the Navy made arrangements to lay on the table the papers relating to the investigation into the administration of hospitals at the front?,9
60,Mr JENSEN,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"In accordance with the promise I made to the honourable member yesterday morning to place these papers on the table today, I spoke to the Minister, and also telegraphed to the Secretary of the Department, but the papers have not yet arrived.",9
61,Mr GREGORY,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"I desire to know what effort is being made to carry out the promise given by the Minister of Home Affairs some time ago, in reply to a question by me, that provision would be made to give voting facilities in connection with the Referenda to those who have gone to the front.",9
62,Mr ARCHIBALD,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"I do not think that the arrangements are yet completed, and I , therefore, ask the honourable member to further postpone the question.",9
63,Dr MALONEY,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"Notwithstandin g the splendid arrangements that have now been made for free dentistry for the troops, I should like to know whether the Minister for the Navy has had his attention drawn to a letter in the Age of 19th  dentistry, who suggests that all the soldiers should be supplied with tooth brushes and antiseptic powder, in order to prevent contamination by the germs of meningitis. Will the Minister for the Navy bring the matter under the notice of the Minister of Defence, in order that every means may be taken to prevent the that there is spread of this disease?",9
64,Mr JENSEN,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"No doubt this question by the honourable member is a most important one, and I shall be very pleased to bring it under the notice of the Minister. I may inform the House, however, that the Minister of Defence is already doing everything possible with a view to keeping down this terrible disease, and bas had several consultations with the medical officers with that object in view.",9
65,Mr YATES,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"In view of the fact that the question has been raised so frequently, I should like to know what report has been received in regard to the non-arrival of correspondence for the soldiers billeted in Egypt? I have received a letter in forming me that one member of the Forces, who left here ou the 20th A p r i l last, liasi received only two letters out of three or four a week that have been written to him since. A peculiar phase of the matter is that his friends receive all the letters that 'he writes; there must, therefore, be something radically wrong.",9
66,Mr SPENCE,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"The postal arrangements at the front are not in the hands of the postal authorities, but in the hands of the military authorities. The Defence Department is taking steps to' organize a complete post office staff for the front , consisting of trained and experienced officers, who will be given military rank, and this, we hope, will result in great improvements. I remind the honourable member that a few days ago it was shown by the official correspondent at the front that on one occasion 250 bags of mails went to the bottom of the sea. Whether there have been other similar occurrences I do not know, but this would account for, at any rate, the loss of some letters. However, arrangements are now being made to do everything possible in this connection. PANAMA EXHIBITION.",9
67,Mr SAMPSON,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"Has the Government in hand the report of the Chairman of the Panama Commission, and, if so. will it be placed on the table of the House before we rise for the proposed adjournment.",9
68,Mr HUGHES,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"On that subject. I have no knowledge, good, bad or indifferent. The question should be addressed to the Prime Minister. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. WASTE or SUPPLIES.",10
69,Mr CHANTER,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"Is the Minister for the Navy aware that statements are being made that large quantities of beef and mutton were on two occasions provided for wounded soldiers wbo were expected to arrive at the hospital at Mont Park, that no soldiers arrived, and that the meat was not utilized and had to be buried. Will the Minister inquire into the truth or otherwise of those statements?",10
70,Mr JENSEN,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,I shall make inquiries and endeavour to give a reply at the next sitting. KALGOORLIE - PO RT AUGUSTA,10
71,Mr GREGORY,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"As some statements have been published in the press, which, if true, would be a severe stricture the administration of the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway, and as I understand majority of honourable members have been advised of the terms of those statements, will the Minister of Home Affairs make available the papers relating to the matter so that honourable members may able to judge what warrant exists for the allegations ? I have a high opinion of the Engineer in Chief, and I think that, Navy, upon noticein justice to him, the papers should be made available.",10
72,Mr ARCHIBALD,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"I am in possession of a sworn declaration, a copy which is being sent to the Engineer in Chief with a request for a report thereactive on.

76,Mr SPENCE,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,I announced a considerable time ago that I have stopped the reductions. I readily give an assurance that there will be no further reductions; this is not a good time to make them.,10
77,Mr MASSYGREENE,ANNUAL MILITARYTRAINI NG,"In view of the fact that I sent to the Minister yesterday particulars of two cases in which the allowances have been reduced, will he see that the instruction given by bim is carried out by his officers?",10

If this be the case, when was the arrangeof ment made, ancl for what reasons? 3. Is it a fact that young men who offer for service in these districts cannot obtain free railway passes to Sydney, to enable tlicm to enlist, but are given passes if they go to 4. Is not a recruit a fighting unit for the whole Commonwealth; and, if so, is it considered to be of any consequence that ho must enlist in a particular State? 5. Is he aware that recruits from the districts named in Now South Wales prefer to enin Sydney, where they have relatives and in preference to going to Queensland, the where they must, for a time at least, be strangers; and is this not likely to seriously recruiting? 0. Is he also aware that the people of New South Wales have subscribed huge sums of money towards patriotic funds, and particufor the relief of wounded soldiers and their dependants, and for comforts for soldiers on service, and that if recruits enlist in another State tliese funds will not be available for them, or for their benefit in any way? 7. Will he seriously consider the advisability of issuing passes to recruits from all parts of New South Wales for young men who may desire to enlist in Sydney?",10
82,Mr JENSEN,CARRIA GE OF WESTER N,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. The arrangement was made in 1010, when the universal training scheme commenced, and was finally brought into operation in November, 1911, for the reason that for essential purposes of military organization it was necessary to complete the divisional and brigade organization by the inclusion of the 12th Battalion Area (the Northern Rivers District of New South Wales) in the 3rd Infantry Brigade, the remaining three battalions of which are in Queensland. 3. Yes, except in the case of men who live in localities soutli of Grafton. 4. Yes; but it is desirable that the recruiting arrangements should fit in with the organization of m i l it a ry Districts, and that the cost of transit of recruits should be reduced as much as possible. 5. The preference of recruits to enlist in Sydney has not'previously been brought to notice. It is not known wliether this matter is likely to seriously affect recruiting. 0. It is known that sums of money have been subscribed as stated, but it should not be a difficult matter for the committees managing those funds to arrange that a soldier who lives, or whose dependants live, in New South Wales should obtain benefits from same, notwithstanding that he enlisted in another State. In regard to one fund whioh has been largely subscribed to, the Premier of New South Wales, who is the chairman of the committee managing the fund, has stated that the money will be available for the relief, not only of soldiers who live in New South Wales, but also, if necessary, fov soldiers who live in other States. 7.

110,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"Balaclava) [11.46] Owing to the late habits which this House has developed, I was unfortunately absent last night when this measure was advanced to its present stage. I had proposed in Committee to endeavour to secure the consent of the Government to an alteration in the schedule affecting, not the yield which it will give, as anticipated by the taxing authorities, but the method of its compilation; and to ask the Attorney General to favourably consider a proposition to make the schedule plainer. Students of taxation, and particularly taxation on incomes that fluctuate, are agreed that what a taxpayer desires most of all is a plainly-marked schedule which will enable him to calculate for himself the taxation that he bas to pay. It is idle to suggest that one taxpayer out of a thousand will know what he has to pav under this schedule u n t i l he receives his assessment notice from the Taxation Office.",13
111,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,I cannot agree to that.,13
112,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"Let us consider for a moment some of the formulae that run through the schedule. We all know that it is impossible for the average man to work decimal fractions in pence, or anything else. He has no difficulty in dealing with the grades or steps in a schedule, but where he has to work out in decimals, a difference of so many pennies in respect of the rate of taxation on a given income, the the task is one which the average man who has lost his knowledge of school detail feels incapable of attempting. If he wishes to ascertain whether or not the Commissioner's figures are correct, he will thus be driven to the accountancy profesam sion, and will have to pay a member that profession a substantial sum to check bagged. the assessment notices of - the Taxation Office. I am endeavouring to set out a sympathetic way what I think are the obvious objections to this schedule; I repeat that I do not wish to substanThat tially injure the yield from the tax. I the taxpayer does not attempt to check his assessment notice by any expert means, he will always be under the impression that he has been overcharged, and that irritation will continue throughout the period covered by this tax.",13
113,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,Can the honourable ber suggest any means of removing that impression from the mind of the average taxpayer ?,14
114,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"There is a simple, means which the taxing Commissioner will suging gest to the honourable gentleman. not say it is possible to remodel the dule within the next twenty-four hours, but if , as I understand, we are to back next week, then I think this House should consider whether we ought not delay the third reading of the E i in order to enable the taxing Comadopted missioner to present us next Tuesday or Wednesday with a differently-framed wise create. schedule. The Commissioner should be told that incomes from Â£15 6 up to the next stage should be treated as one step, and that all within that step, subject the exemption, should pay a tax of 3d. in the Â£ i ; that the next step should be equally definite, and that all witlii n should pay 4d. in the Â£ 1 ; and so the set of stairs is raised, each stair marked in plain figures, with the rate of tax payable. That is the method folschool lowed in Australia in respect of income tax, as well as certain land taxation.",14
115,Mr BAMFORD,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,But it is hard on the taxpayer.,14
116,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"It may press more heavily or it may fall more Hghtly on the taxpayer. That depends upon how the member's proposal. system is worked out. But as a principle to be adopted in framing a schedule this kind, it has the merit of being to the ordinary taxpayer.",14
117,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"It has the same merit the that a.sandbag or a club has-i fectly plain, but also perfectly inexcusable.",14
118,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"That interjection may be clever, but it is entirely irrelevant. I not suggesting that either the Governof meut or the taxpayers should be sandA l l that I propose is that the taxpayer sbould bave the wool taken off in his eyes so that, having ascertained what his income is, he may be able to see and and understand how much he will have to pay. is the position that we in this House, f proposing, as we do, to impose this direct taxation in order to meet the needs of the nation, should desire to achieve. It will involve great thought and care on the part of the officer deputed to frame such a schedule as I suggest should be embodied in the Bill . The schedule would memhave to be drawn up with due regard to the fact that the desire of the Government is that the tax shall yield a revenue of Â£4,000,000 per annum, and the grades would have to be so fixed as to yield that amount. I am not suggesting the lightenof the tax at either end, or in the I do middle; all that I propose is that an alscheteration be made by using figures that will make the schedule plain to all. Such come a proposition must recommend itself to the Attorney-General, and, since it would to only involve a delay until Tuesday or l l Wednesday next, surely it should be ? It would remove a good deal of the irritation which this tax will other",14
119,Mr FENTON,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,Would not an explanatory table issued by the Commissioner to to the taxpayers be sufficient?,14
120,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"No . The average taxpayer after he has reached thirty or forty ityears of age is not usually a first-class on, as mathematician, and there can he no being doubt that the average man who will have to pay this tax has long since lost his knowledge of the elementary principles of the decimal system. I do not know wliether even the Attorney-General would be able to correctly work out such a sum as I might throw at him.",14
121,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"If I cannot work out the sum, then I will accept the honourable",14
122,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"I could not, while standof ing here, give the honourable member one plain that would be sure to trip him .",14
123,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,I am not going to allow honourable member to go away and t is perlook up a hard one for me.,14
124,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"If the Attorney-General will give me a half-an-hour's grace, I will give hirn one that will involve the acceptance of my proposition. The Taxation Commissioner does not work out these details on his feet. He sits at a desk with a great staff about him checking definite figures. I say without hesitation that there will be irremovable irritation amongst the great bulk of the taxpayers if the Goverument push this schedule into operation, and that we should endeavour, even at the eleventh hour, to avoid it .",14
125,Mr MATHEWS,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"The average taxpayer does not attempt to work out for himself what he has to pay. As a rule, he simply pays on the assessment notice.",15
126,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"No . Under the Income Tax Acts in operation in the States, a taxpayer, as soon as he knows what his income is, is able to say what tax 'he should be called upon to pay.",15
127,Mr WISE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,And taxpayers actually check the figures set out in the assessment notices.,15
128,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,They do.,15
129,Mr MATHEWS,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,Tber e are always objections to a fiat rate.,15
130,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,I am not speaking of a flat rate.,15
131,Mr MATHEWS,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,The Victorian income tax is based on a flat rate.,15
132,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"No ; it is arranged in stairs, or gradations, rising from 3d. to 6d. in the Â£ 1 on inoome from personal exertion, and from 6d. to Is. in the Â£ 1 in respect of income the produce of personal property. Could we not do the same ?",15
133,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,It is quite a wrong system.,15
134,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"It is interesting to hear the honourable gentleman, who is but an experimentalist in this form of taxation, talking in this way to men who have bad to face it for twenty years, and who bave found that the system I advocate works to the satisfaction of the taxpayers.",15
135,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"To the satisfaction of the Taxation Office, but never to the satisfaction of the taxpayer.",15
136,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"It always gives, I venture to think, more satisfaction than any bewildering system based on high mathematical principles is likely to give to the ordinary taxpayer, who, just as a man who wants to make a purchase in a shop desires to see the goods marked in plain figures, likes to see the income tax rates plainly set out.",15
137,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,We shall supply the taxpayers with a plain statement of what they will have to pay.,15
138,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"But that statement will be in respect of groups of Â£500 , Â£ 6 0 0 , Â£700, and so for t h ; that is of no service to the man whose income comes between those grades. The proposition I am making has the advantage of simplicity. That, surely, is a decided merit?",15
139,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"It is; but the system is unjust, since it discriminates between those on one fiat and those on the next flat.",15
140,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,So does this schedule.,15
141,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,No .,15
142,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"When the amount gets beyond a certain figure, the rate rises. My system would provide for a plainly marked set of stairs as against a system which rises in curves of the second and the third degree.",15
143,Mr BAMFORD,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,This is a ramp.,15
144,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"No ; it is like one of those modern inventions of the railroad which runs in a series of eccentric curves, and no man not versed in the bewildering principles of high mathematics will be able to determine accurately what he has to pay.",15
145,Mr MASSYGREENE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,A curve of the first degree is .,15
146,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"A curve of the first degree is such as is worn on the waistcoat of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports; a curve of the second degree is such as is worn on the waistcoat of the Attorney-General. I do not think any complicated principle sbould be associated with this tax. What we want to achieve is a simplicity that is calculated to offer no disadvantage to the Treasury and to give greater satisfaction to the taxpayer. Surely this is well worthy of the consideration of the Government. If they can show that any real loss of revenue will result from the substitution of a carefully prepared schedule, such as I suggest, for - that now in the Bill , I will withdraw m y proposition. I do not wish to reduce the amount which the Government have said it is necessary to secure from j t h is tax in order to meet the needs of the nation. As one who watched the introduction of the Income Tax system in this State, I can say that quite enough irritation is aroused by proposing a fresh income tax without still further complicating the menus by which taxpayers may determine whether they have been fairly treated in the assessment of their incomes. Attorney-General will do what I propose, he will remit the schedule again to the Taxation Office Staff, with a direction that they shall build a new schedule while yielding the same revenue and, as far as possible, preserving the yield for each grade, will be marked in plain figures, so that he who runs may read. There is another point to which I desire to refer. We were told by the Prime Minister that this is a war tax. The Bill does not show that it is. On the contrary, it indicates that it is to be a continuing tax. Clause 5 sets out that this rate is fixed for all the years it will run. The principle of income taxation hitherto followed in Australia has been to establish, first of all by an Assessment Bill, the conditions on which shall be annually taxed-the between the Treasury and the direct taxpayer. That Bill has always been followed in every State, I think, by another measure annually fixing the rates. If the need of the Treasurer was great in one year, the rates were advanced; Treasurer felt that he could grant a reduction in his next annual fixation of the tax, the rates were reduced. city of such a system enables concessions to the taxpayers to be made when the nation can do with less, while Treasurer holds out his hands more money when he requires revenue. That principle should be followed by the Commonwealth. sbould be an annual fixation of rates. Clause 5 offends in two ways. the principle of the annual fixation of the tax, and avoids the still more fact that this is admittedly a war tax. No honourable member on this side of the chamber would have agreed to the tax under any condition other than that it was to endure only for the period during which the expenditure upon the war has to be met. If we were to talk of a rate of 5s. in the Â£1 on the higher grades of income as a permanent or enduring it would be, probably, the most crippling thing one could conceive of as regards the financial, commercial, industrial interests of the wealth, and it is only because nation realizes that it is fighting for its very existence that we say, "" Very well, it is a case of your money or your life."" Rather than forfeit our existence the people sbould be asked to pay even, Mr Watt. If the if necessary, at the rate of 10s. in the Â£ 1 . In that sense a rate of 5s. in the Â£ 1 has been accepted by honourable members-because the tax is to be collected for war which, purposes.",15
147,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,That rate of 5s. is almost academic.,16
148,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,It will not be academio to the people who have to pay it . .,16
149,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,Seeing that companies are exempt very few people will have to pay it .,16
150,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,I can name half-a-dozen men in my own electorate who will bave to cheerfully foot the bill at the rate of 5s. in the Â£ 1 . as Mr HUGHES - Nam e one.,16
151,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"I do not intend to mention any names, but I can assure the honincomes orable member that there are half-a-dozen relationship men in my electorate who will have to pay this rate. Those who have noted the growth of wealth in Victoria and New South Wales know well that this rate will fall upon some persons-compara tively few I admit-and if it were not for if the the war this academic proposition, as it is termed by the Attorney-Generalthough it is not academic, it is realThe elasti- would not have been introduced. Seeing, however, that it is essentially a levy for war purposes, honourable members on this the side have assented to it . I doubt whether for half the honourable members on the Minismore terial side of the Chamber would admit the wisdom of this tax as a permanent There tax. I credit honourable members with the possession of a certain amount of It offends economic knowledge and desire to further the interests of this country. They must important know that a permanent tax of 5s. in the Â£ 1 on the top grades of income would do more to increase unemployment than anything else they could suggest.  but this is a special tax.",16
152,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"The Bill before us does not make it a special tax. It is framed : in the permanent phraseology of every tax, measure imposing an income tax, however small, as if it were to endure for all time. If I were speaking of a rate of and 2s. in the Â£ 1 I could utter precisely the Common- same thoughts, and feel that they were the equally truth f u l . In Victoria there was a rate of Is. 4d. in ordinary times of peace on the higher grades of income, and the State Government took actual tests as to the effect of that rate, not only on capital in the State, but also on capital which was introduced from abroad, and the results showed a flight of capital, in duced by the high rate, higher than that imposed in other States or in any sister Dominion. I do not hesitate to say that if a rate of Is. 6d. in the Â£ 1 is imposed after the war it will drive capital out of the country to our disadvantage, and will give to the people who live in the country no advantage whatsoever. It is useless to say that high taxation equalizes wealth. The owners of wealth can say, "" We do not intend to pay what is equivalent to 1 \ per cent, of incomes in Australia when we can invest our money in Canada and j>ay 1 \ per cent, only, or in the Argentine, and pay 5 per cent, only."" All the operations and calculations of the investing public are governed by circumstances ascertained by and known to them. If we maintain an exceedingly high rate of taxation on incomes, Australia will become a poor country, we shall drive out the accumulations of wealth withi n our own borders and deter the introduction of capital. If the Attorney-General is quite sincere let him omit the words in the clause which prevent the annual fixation of this tax. At any rate, let him do it for this year. No one can see further ahead than July, 1916. No one knows how long the struggle will last, or what economic conditions will prevail in Australia during the continuance of the war or when hostilities have ceased.",16
153,Mr FENTON,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,The honourable member knows that the year has been altered.,17
154,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"Yes , but my argument has just the same force. We are asked to furnish the Treasurer with as much revenue as we can get for the financial purposes of this year. Next year our needs will be clearer to us. It may not be necessary to have the tax. In any event it is safer to say to the taxpayer that, although the Assessment Bill is to remain on the statute-book, the rates are fixed for one year only. This Bill does not do so. I am right, I think, in saying that the rates are fixed annually in all the States, though the State Assessment Acts are permanent measures. Will the Attorney-General consent to the elimination of the words "" and each financial year thereafter "" ? Their omission would proclaim to the taxpayer that we had fixed the tax for the present year only. There would be ample opportunity in the next financial year to fix the tax that will be receivable during that year.",17
155,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"I am willing to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member, but not in the exact form that he suggests, because I do not know whether Parliament can meet during the financial year, 1916-17. The war is still in progress, and I do not know what may happen, or what we may be able to do.",17
156,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"I am pleased that the Attorney-General has accepted the suggestion, though I still think that the elimination of the words would be the wisest course to follow. We should go to the people with a statement that we are putting certain rates on their incomes for this financial year only, and that, if the circumstances next year are as bad as they are this year, or even worse, they will be called upon to face the issue and pay according to the needs of the Commonwealth. I hope that the Attorney General will also consider the question of an alteration to the schedule on the lines that I bave suggested. It would give a considerable amount of satisfaction to taxpayers, large and small.",17
157,Mr HAMPSON,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"Bendigo) [12.12] Last night, when we were dealing with clause 16 of the Inoome Tax Assessment Bill , and the Prime Minister intervened in order to bring forward some new business, I understood that the Bill was not to be dealt with any f u r the r ; and, as I had already been thirteen hours in attendance, I left the precincts of the House. I was desirous of drawing the attention of the Attorney-General to clause 17 dealing with mining companies, but I find now that the Bill was passed through the Committee stage early this morning. Clause 17 says that "" the capital expended by a person carrying on mining operations """,17
158,Mr SPEAKER,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,The honourable member must not deal with a Bill that hasalready been disposed of.,17

161,Mr SPEAKER,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"I point out to the honourable member for Bendigo that we are now dealing with a Bill to impose a progressive tax on incomes, and that in? that Bill there is a schedule showing the amount that will be collected, and so forth.",17
162,Mr HAMPSON,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,I was misled by the honourable member for Balaclava discussing clause 5; I thought that the whole Bill was under discussion.,18
163,Mr SPEAKER,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,The honourable member for Balaclava was discussing clause 5 of the Bill before us.,18
164,Mr HAMPSON,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,Then it appears that I shall have no chance of saying anything in reference to this taxation as it affects mining companies.,18
165,Mr SPEAKER,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,The honourable member will see that that is not my fault.,18
166,Mr HAMPSON,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,Then I can only express my regret that the business is conducted in this way.,18
167,Mr MASSYGREENE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"Richmond) [12.16] I went home last night with the assurance of the Prime Minister that no business would be dealt with except.the Income Tax Assessment Bill, and yet this morning I find the Bill before us at the thirdreading stage. I should not have spoken ou the motion for the third reading had I ar. opportunity to speak in Committee, and I only wish to support what has been said by the honourable member for Balaclava in regard to the schedule, which is expressed in terms that only those wbo understand higher mathematics can follow. I suggest to the Attorney-General that, if it must be expressed in a way that mathematicians only can understand, he should adopt the infinitely more simple form of the curve of the first degree, which is represented by a straight line drawn from point to point, each Â£1 carrying its additional taxation. The actual difference in the amount of revenue that would be raised if this plan were adopted would be infinitesimal, an amount not more than a very few thousand pounds, while an enormous amount of trouble and dissatisfaction would be prevented. The only difference would be a very slight increase on certain portions of the actual incomes, and if honourable members saw the curve of the first degree reduced to a diagram they would understand what is meant. The honourable member for Balaclava suggested that the formula should be altered to definite steps, beginning at 3d. and going on to 4d., 5d., and so on, and so arranged as to bring in the same amount of tax in the aggregate. I do not know that there is any reason why that should not be done ; but, at the same time, if the Government desire to adopt the same principle that they have adopted in regard to the land tax, with a gradual gradation by which each pound will carry its additional tax, that can be done, and still be expressed by the adoption of the curve of the first degree.",18
168,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"There is no special virtue in the ramp, when the stairs are understood.",18
169,Mr MASSYGREENE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"I do not see any special virtue in the ""ramp,"" and the terms used are very difficult to follow. There is no necessity to rush this business through for the Senate, and I hope the Attorney-General will consider whether it is not possible to get the same, or practically the same, revenue without introducing the friction and dislocation that I believe this formula will cause. I am glad to hear from the Attorney-General that he proposes to adopt the suggestion made by the honourable member for Balaclava in regard to clause 5, calculating the tax only for this year, and allowing Parliament from year to year to say what the actual rate shall be. I am certain that if it were generally understood that this tax had to operate indefinitely-and that is what is expressed in the Bill",18
170,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"Did it ever strike the honourable member that, with the amendments we bave made, the tax may prove wholly insufficient for the purposes of the Commonwealth ?",18
171,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"All the more reason, for taxing anew each year.",18
172,Mr MASSYGREENE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"If we leave the impression that this tax is to be continued indefinitely, it will leave an effect on commercial and industrial life the reverse of beneficial. This tax is almost prohibitive in its incidence, and if the capitalist gets it into his bead that, on money invested in Australia, he will, in addition to the State income tax, have to pay a Commonwealth tax that is almost penal, I venture to say that out of the very limited capital that will be available for developmental purposes after the war, Australia will get a still smaller share of the world's capital than sbe has been getting for a number of years. Of the capital sent from England into other countries for developmental purposes in recent years, a very small portion in comparison has come to Australia.  Â£500,000,000 of British capital has been invested in the last twelve years, while in Australia the amount is only Â£400,000,000.",18

175,Mr MASSYGREENE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"No oue knows better than the Minister of Home Affairs that, in. calculating the interest derivable from capital, the investor takes into account the taxation of the country as one of the charges, and if two countries offer the same rate of interest, and one has double the taxation of the other, he knows where to invest. At any rate, I hope that the actual rate at which this tax will be will be expressed in terms more easily understood by the general public.",19
176,Mr MANIEOLD,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"Corangamite) [32.30] - I sbould like to know from the Attorney-General whether a man with an income of over Â£2,500 a year starts from the lowest rate and gradually works up, or whether be starts at what is laid down for incomes over Â£2,000. pose a man has an iucome of Â£2,500 does he commence to pay at 11.713 pence, or does he pay on the whole amount at the rate of 33.600 pence? In other words, does he commence to pay under paragraph 6 and finish paying under paragraph e, or does he start to pay at once under paragraph e ? I sulted several lawyers on this question and they cannot agree as to what is the effect of the schedule. The matter cerstated tainly requires elucidation. An income of Â£6,500 is taxed at the rate of 5s. the Â£ 1 , and according to the statement attached to the schedule the average rate works out at 41.7305 pence. I believe the Attorney-General has stated that there are few incomes in the Common5s. wealth of Â£6,500 per annum, and, therehit fore, very few persons will be taxed the highest rate. No figures in proof that assertion are to be found in Knibbs, or in any other authority. Such a culation is impossible, and I believe that this tax will realise a great deal more money from the higher taxpayers than is anticipated. The impost will affect, to a great extent, those people who are developing the country, and who have put money into more than one State. Let me quote my own case as an illustration. I have investments in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. TJnder the State taxation laws I pay in each As I State on the income I derive in that State, but if the whole of my income earned in different parts of the Commonwealth is bulked, I shall pay at a very much higher rate than I pay under the State Acts. If a man enjoys an income of Â£3,000 in Victoria be will pay on that income under the States rates. He may also have an income of Â£3,000 from New South Wales, and a further Â£3,000 from Queensland. It is impossible for the At torney-General to trace whether the man who pays on an income of Â£3,000 in Victoria has derived a similar income from New South Wales. Possibly a man will have a total income of Â£9,000, and levied he will pay on that total a higher rate than he pays in the separate States on his three different incomes of Â£3,000 each. It will be found that under a Federal tax a great many people will pay at a much hi|gher rate than they pay under the State income taxes, and, therefore, the tax will realise a considerable amount of money in excess of what is estimated from the people who pay at the higher rate. SupI know of a great many people who have interests in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. Many companies are in the same position, and if the At torney-General will enlighten me as to how the tax will operate in those cases I shall be very much obliged. have conI l r . JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [12.36] - In reply to the honourable member for Balaclava the Attorney-General that the 5s. rate was almost academic, and very few people would be rei n quired to pay it . The presumption is that otherwise he might consider the advisability of cutting down the rate. The honourable member for Corangamite having assured the Attorney-General that the rate is by no means academic, but will severely a number of people who have at large incomes, I should like to know of whether the Minister will now consider the advisability of reducing the rate. calWhen the honourable member for Balaclava was speaking the inference was if he could show that there were a great many people seeking relief from the higher rates that would be the best of all reasons why the Attorney-General sliould reduce tbose rates, but now that the honourable gentleman has been assured by the honourable member for Corangamite that there are many people who will be required to pay the higher rates, I fancy that the Minister, buttressed by those facts and statements, will be all the bolder in imposing the tax. No matter which part of the compass the criticism comes from , the Attorney-General adroitly turns it to the advantage of his own Bill and the perpetuation of this tremendous tax.",19
177,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"It has only an academic interest for a majority of people, but it will be very real to those who pay it .",20
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,I think the honourable gentleman said that very few people would pay at the higher rates.,20
179,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,That is so.,20
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,And that is the reason why the Attorney-General turned down the argument of the honourable member for Balaclava.,20
181,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,On the adopted his argument.,20
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,For a reduction of the higher rate?,20
183,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,The honourable member did not suggest that it be reduced.,20
184,Mr WATT,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"I did not reduction in this particular year, but I showed what would be the effect if it were perpetuated.",20
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"The point I wish to stress is that the 5s. rate does not stand by itself. I have had a statement prepared which shows that in New South Wales, at any rate, the taxation of some Imperial companies will amount to a total of 8s. lOd. in the Â£ 1 . They will be taxed by the States, by the Commonwealth, and by the Imperial Government. What companies will operate anywhere under such conditions? I do not know of any oompany, unless it be one that is extraordinarily situated, that could earn an income tax of that amount and pay dividends. Very few companies are making a profit of 8s. lOd. in the Â£ 1 , and this tax means that we shall take from them all incentive to enter into business and enterprises in some States at any rate. That is the serious aspect of this tax. I cannot for the life of me see anything in the war legislation as presented by the Prime Minister that should require taxation amounting in the aggregate to 8s. lOd. in the Â£ 1 . If taxation at this rate is necessary for war purposes, it must be paid. If the taxation for war purposes amounted to 10s. in the Â£ 1 , it would have to be paid. The whole wealth of the community must be placed under tribute to finance the war; but is it necessary to finance this year's operations in such a way that the requisite taxation in New South Wales will in the aggregate amount to 8s. lOd. in the Â£ 1 ? There can only be one result to this. Capital will seek an outlet to some sphere where taxation is lighter, and I submit for the serious consideration of the Committee the question whether these higher rates ought to be imposed, particularly as the tax is a triplicate tax. Three taxes will actually be imposed upon many companies in New South Wales. Representations on the point have been made to the Treasurer, and I would again ask him to reflect whether it is not possible to lighten the burden somewhat. Otherwise capital will be stampeded out contrary, I of the countiy, and if it is, honourable members may bid ""good-bye"" to the staying power of the country and to its resourcefulness for war or any other purposes. During recent years capital has not been pouring into Australia. Hapappeal for its pily, the country has been able to do without it to a great extent, though bad more capital been invested here, our industrial concerns would have been much more prosperous even than they have been, their ramifications would have been extended, and the volume of trade infinitely greater. But the fact remains that very little foreign capital has been coming in during recent years, and not much more may be expected if a triplicate tax is to be imposed upon it. I should like the right honourable gentleman to make it perfectly clear that the revision of these rates will be considered. In my view a lower maximum rate, if the tax were properly levied, would give a bip""*er aggregate return, for I do uot think the tax has been so fixed as to get the most out of it . It seems almost to have been imposed to give people an invitation to avoid it by taking their capital elsewhere. The war taxation in Great Britain has been definitely allocated for war purposes, and it will be taken off when the war is over. There is no guarantee that this tax wil l come off at the conclusion of the war.",20
186,Mr FLEMING,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"On the other hand, there is a suggestion that we are going to have it every year.",21
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"There is that suggestion. Another aspect of the situation has also to be borne in mind. Those wbo will be called upon to bear the tax directly, will endeavour to secure relief, and if they are manufacturing concerns, the only way they will be able to secure it will be by passing the tax on in the increased price of their goods. My honourable friends in their attempt to h it the big man will be simply hitting themselves in the long run . Many firms will not be able to continue their operations unless they do pass the tax on, and in conse- quence prices will be re-adjusted, and the consumer will be called upon to bear a big share of the higher penal rates. The object of the Bill ought to be to secure that the tax shall operate equitably over the entire population. 1 can find no evidence that that will be the case, and I would again suggest to honourable members opposite that would do much better if they limited the taxation rate and spread it over a wider area. Such a course, in the long run, would be to their advantage, and particularly to the advantage of the working men of the community. If a man is rich he ought to pay the tax, but there is no provision in the Bill for seeing that the rich man will pay. If he is engaged in business, he will be only the agent for the payment of the tax. He will pay it out, but he will take it in again, and so the tax will not h u r t him nearly as much as may be supposed. going to stress this point any further. I have already indicated where I think much more money could be gathered at a less cost and with a great deal more fairness and equity than under this proposal. In peace times it is the easiest thing in the world to pass on income tax. It is not quite so easy now, I admit; but, at the same time, the tax must be passed on in many cases if the people concerned are to live, or if they are not to go out of business altogether. They must readjust their affairs. The rate of this income tax, particularly as it becomes a triplicate tax, will , in many instauces, have the effect of absorbing the whole of the existing profits. Mr Asquith laid it down as a cardinal principle of economics that a tax of Is. in the Â£ 1 on incomes in times of peace must eventually f all upon both profits and wages. That waa the theory of all the financiers who preceded bim. It was the doctrine of Mr . Gladstone, as honourable members will see if they read his financial speeches. My recollection is that Mr Gladstone's view was that, unless the tax were levied moderately and equitably, it would be the poor people and consumers of the country who would eventually bave to bear it . Let it not be imagined that in making these remarks I am trying to shield a few rich people in the community.",21
188,Mr ARCHIBALD,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"The right honourable member ought to add that in those days Gladstone tried to keep the British revenue down to Â£80,000,000.",21
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"He believed in the old Liberal programme of "" Peace, Retrenchment, and R e for m . """,21
190,Mr WISE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,All three have now gone.,21
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"Yes , all have gone, and Gladstone is in his grave, with wiser, bigger, and abler economists in their they places, but I doubt if the lot of the poor is very much better having regard to the tremendous strides that have taken place in scientific production. However that may be, there is no sign of economy in Australia. This Government does not believe in economy. It believes in extravagance, in lavish spending, thinking that by throwing money around it is serving the best interests of the country. I am glad to hear that there is a possibility of the clause which refers to taxation in succeeding years being modified. I would like to point out, further, that while the I am not British tax is very high, the British war obligations are in some respects greater than our own. But do honourable members know that, whereas the deduction that we propose for each child is Â£ 1 3 , in Great Britain the amount is Â£ 2 0 ? It has been argued that it would be illogical to make a greater deduction than Â£ 1 3 , inasmuch as that sum is the pension that wili be granted for the child of any soldier who falls in battle.",21
192,Mr WEST,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"Would it not be inconsistent otherwise ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - There would be no inconsistency. The two things are not at all related. Great Britain is paying less in war pensions than we pay,, but Great Britain is allowing a greater deduction per child for income tax purposes than we propose, so that if we are acting logically Great Britain must he acting illogically. But my main contention is that taxation at this period should be limited to the amount required to meet charges arising out of the war. That is not the case here. The only burden we are taking over from the ordinary services on account of this war is Â£1,800,000. To liquidate that we propose to raise Â£4,000,000. The right honourable gentleman told us yesterday that, while this loan was practically for war purposes, he would not separate the income from this tax from any other portion of the revenue. That is to say, this money may or may not be used for war purposes. There is no definite assurance that it will be.  Minister gave an assurance on that point the other day.",21
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"That was precisely the assivrance the right honourable gentleman would not give. He said yesterday morning that he declined to treat these finances in a sectional way at all. That is to say, he would not separate the war loan from the ordinary iucome of the year.",22
194,Mr SAMPSON,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,That means that the whole of this new tax will be devoted to the ordinary services. Mr JOSE PH COOK - That is so.,22
195,Mr WEST,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,F r o m where has the Treasurer to obtain his revenue ?,22
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"The honourable member knows that additional probate duties and land taxation were imposed last year; but a better way of getting revenue at this period would be to establish economies in the ordinary Government services. That simple recipe is long overdue. Its operation may be postponed, but it will have to be faced sooner or later. In both State and Federal establishments expenditure is swollen and extravagant, and is rapidly becoming a tremendous burden upon the people of the country.",22

198,Mr FLEMING,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"Robertson) [2.30] I propose to offer a few observations regarding the relationship which this measure bears to the war. Clause 5 provides thatIncome tax shall bo levied in and for the financial year beginning on the 1st day of July, 1915, and each financial year thereafter. If , aa the Government claim, this is a war tax, introduced under the shadow of the war, surely the words "" and each financial year thereafter'' should be omitted from the Bill !",22
199,Mr HANNAN,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"The honourable member does not think that our financial responsibilities will terminate with the war 1 """" Mr FLEMING - I make no such suggestion. The point that I wish to emphasize is that it is always much easier to re-enact a measure than to repeal it . It is open to us to re-enact this Bill from year to year, and to fix the rate of income tax that shall be paid in respect of every year during which the war continues. We all hope that the war will be over before the end of the next twelve months.",22
200,Mr SHARPE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"The Opposition might be Prime in power twelve months hence, and they would not re-enact such a B i ll as this.",22
201,Mr FLEMING,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"Unfortunatel y for ' the Commonwealth, we are not likely to be in power within the next twelve months.",22
202,Mr TUDOR,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,The honourable member's party made a mistake twelve months ago.,22
203,Mr FLEMING,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"We did ; and the people made a mistake in returning the Labour party to office. They have two years in which to realise the error they committed, and I have no doubt that, at the end of that time, they will give an emphatic demonstration of how full y they do realise it . The Attorney-General, in discussing this Bill , said that there were in Australia few incomes of more than Â£6,500 a year, so that the higher rate for which it provides was more or less merely a matter of academic interest. I have good reason for believing that quite a number of incomes earned in Australia exceed Â£6,500 a year, and while those who enjoy them are for the most part anxious to pay their share of any just taxation rendered necessary by the war, it is hardly fair to h it them as heavily as they will be hit under this Bill .",22
204,Mr THOMAS,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"I know of one poor fellow who has an income of Â£60,000 a year.",22
205,Mr FLEMING,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"B y all means let the Government tax his income. I know of the man to whom the honourable member refers, and believe that he has given very little to the war funds There rests upon every man of wealth the responsibility of giving as freely as he can in the present crisis. W it h some rare exceptions, wealthy men in Australia are realizing to the full their responsibilities in this respect, and are observing the very best traditions of the Empire. These men bave made their nnancial arrangements for the year; and although those who were not afraid of what taxation might be imposed gave as freely as they could to the various funds, some of them have restricted their giving because of the fear of taxation of this kind being imposed, and the necessity of making provision to meet it . afraid that if we impose these extortionate rates upon big incomes, the effect will be very prejudicial to the further issues of the war loan. The Treasurer spoke yesterday of the magnificent subscription to that loan. We are all proud that Australia has done so well ; but there is a very real danger that, if too heavy a tax be placed upon these higher incomes, there will not be anything like so good a response to the f u t u r e issues of the loan. The Treasurer quoted certain figures showing the subscriptions made by private companies, and, in one or two instances, by private individuals. quite a number of private persons had subscribed more than the smallest of the sums which he read out; but that he thought it inadvisable to mention their names. If this super-tax be imposed at the rate set fort h in the Bill , I am afraid that very little wil l be received on the next flotation from those who subscribed so well to the first issue.",22
206,Mr SHARPE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,Does not the honourable member think that the new taxation has led people to subscribe to the war loan ?,23
207,Mr FLEMING,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,There is a possibility that the new taxation has induced people to subscribe to the loan because,23

209,Mr FLEMING,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"I was merely replying to an interjection. - Sir WILLIAMIBVINE - On a point of order, I submit, with great respect, that the financial position in all its aspects is open for discussion on the motion now before us, and that to restrict the discussion by any means would be to deprive the House of a privilege which it bas always exercised; and which has always been claimed, both here and in the House of Commons, in connection with the thir d reading of any measure providing ways and means, or taxation for the Government. I ask you, sir, to carefully consider the question before you rule that any portion of the financial question is not open to the fullest and freest discussion on this motion.",23
210,Mr SPEAKER,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"The lionorable member bas mistaken the object of the t h i r d reading of a Bill . I called the honourable member for Robertson to order when he was referring to the Loan Bill . That measure was discussed at considerable length when it was before the House recently. Honourable members were then I am afforded ample opportunity to say all that they desired in respect of it ; and that Bill having been dealt with , it is not now in order to refer to it . I did not object to the honourable member for Robertson making a passing reference to it , but he would not be in order in discussing it On a motion for leave to introduce a Bill of this character, every honourable member has an opportunity to discuss, to the fullest extent, the whole financial position. Extensive referenoes may also be made to the financial position on the motion for its second reading, since it is a measure relating to finance; but once such a Bill He said that has been dealt with in Committee and reported to the House, then, on the motion for the thir d reading, the debate must be confined to the provisions of the Bill itself. The Bill cannot be discussed in a general way. I lay it down clearly and distinctly that, on the motion for the thir d reading, honourable members must confine themselves practically to the contents of the Bill as it comes from the Committee. I have always followed that rule, and it is followed in all Parliaments.",23
211,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"W it h o u t venturing to move any dissent from your ruling, sir, may I point out that the motion for the thir d reading of a Bill is one on which full debate is permissible. This is a question which concerns both sides of the House, and, unless you are following some very definite authority of which I am entirely ignorant, I venture to ask you to consider whether we should not be entitled, on a motion for the thir d reading of a Bill , to give any reasons, relevant to the Bill., as to why it should not pass. A motion for the third reading of a Bill is not different, so far as the limits of debate are concerned, from a motion for the second reading. I do not wish at this stage of the session to create any difficulty, but I should like to know, sir, whether this question has received as yet your full consideration. I feel convinced that your ruling, as just given, would immensely limit a privilege which the House has hitherto exercised.",23
212,Mr SPEAKER,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"If the honourable member will examine the authorities he will discover that at each stage of a Bill the debate upon it is further limited, and that at the third-reading stage the discussion is confined to the subject-matter of the Bil l itself.

213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,I should like your authority for that.,24

217,Mr FLEMING,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"The method of riving at the tax employed in the Bill may be simple enough, but, in my opinion, country people will be considerably confused by it . There is no need for altering the methods to which they have been accustomed in the States. Artists delight in curves, but wbo would describe the Attorney-General as being artistic? If this graduated income tax is imposed to such a heavy extent as to drive the people with higher incomes out of the Commonwealth, or to give our citizens no encouragement to earn large incomes, we shall damage our future and to Great Britain. we shall aggravate an evil which has been growing at a rapid rate during recent years, owing to the feeling of insecurity tion there. that men with capital are experiencing in regard to Australia. The flow of capiin tal from the seat of the Empire to Auspay tralia bas been decreasing to a most alarming extent. We used to be told that trade followed the flag, but, as a matter of fact, in these days of comI mercialism, we know that sentiment is laid aside, and that trade follows investposed ment. The commercial activity and the growth of Australia have depended to a very large extent on the investments made here by the people of the Mother Country. We are told by the Minister of Home Affairs, in an interjection, that all investments depend on the rate of in terest offered, but the influences governing the investment of capital are extremely complex, and the rate of interest is only one aspect. Great B r it a in last year invested Â£25,000,000 in Argentine, Â£14,000,000 in the United States. Â£13,000,000 in Mexico, notwithstanding all its internal disturbances, Â£12,000,000 in Brazil, and Â£12,000,000 in Australia. Here we have a country which is guaranteed by the Union Jack, which is filled with white people, and which exists under a Britis h Constitution, yet money is going just as fast into Brazil, which is peopled to a large extent by a darkskinned race of half-castes, and which has nothing like the possibilities of raising people that Australia has, and labours under the disadvantages always appertaining to tropical climates. It would seem to indicate that there is something extremely and radically wrong in the management of our financial affairs. If we make it impossible for men with capital to turn their eyes to Australia we shall divert the stream of invigorating money which formerly flowed here. If we conar- tinue to impose a graduated tax to the enormous extent provided in the Bill , we shall drive away quite a number of men with capital who are now here-mor e than have been driven away by existing taxation. I know of my own knowledge that quite a number of men with capital are leaving Australia because the tax of big incomes is so great that it does not pay them to stay here when they wish to retire from business. ",24
218,Mr FLEMING,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,Some of them wil l go ,24
219,Mr FLEMING,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"If a rich man dies Australia his heirs are called upon to over a third of the estate in probate duties. Some people are turning their - eyes to New Zealand. I do not know what the probate duties may be there, but know that in the case of the Argentine Republic taxes are greater than those i m in Australia, though not much greater than will be imposed here when this Bill becomes law, coupled with the recently-imposed probate duties. When men consider that they have made sufficient money to keep them for the rest of /tiheir lives, they leave the Argentine. They say that they would go anywhere rather than give up to the State half the money that they have provided for their children. The probate duties there are nearly half the value of large estates. The result of this heavy taxation has heen that, in all parte of the British Empire, men can be met who have made money in the Argentine, and taken it elsewhere to spend it . The time is coming when we should realise our responsibilities to the men who have made their money in Australia. In nineteen cases out of twenty these individuals are prepared to meet their responsibilities to the State, and we should treat them in such a way that, they -'Will continue to pay their r i g h t f u l share of the taxation of the State and not overtax them to sucb an extent that they will find it necessary to go anywhere else in order to escape it . It is - quite possible to impose such heavy taxation as will defeat the object of the tax. It may be too heavy for the people to bear, and it may also prevent people from making the incomes which otherwise would be made. The effect of the taxes we are imposing on big incomes will be to drive people out of the country, and in consequence Australia will be so much the poorer.",24

221,Mr FLEMING,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"There are many good things we have heard long ago, but, unfortunately, some of the supporters of the Government hear good things all their lives, and do not realise the application of them. The time will come in Australia when we will drive out all the solid people. No matter from what stratum of society a man may spring, if he settles in this country, prospers, and leaves his money to his children, the community reaps a real advantage, and it would prove a grave and growing danger if we were not to encourage such men by giving them what, after all, is only fair play.  must express surprise that the Attorneyvery General has given us no information as the taxpayer will prove numerous. to the precise nature of the amendment he has promised to insert for the purpose of limiting the operation of this tax to one year.

We have a right to know exactly where we stand. There is an obvious necessity for limiting the operation of the Bill to twelve montbs. This would save a great deal of unrest, and satisfy the public that the Bill is meant to be what it purports to be, namely, a war measure.

244,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,Migh t I ask a question ?,26

I must ask honourable members to conduct this debate in proper order. point out that, so far as the amendment referred to is concerned, it could not be moved on the motion before us.  thing that appears to reflect on the bona fides of the Attorney-General, I withdraw if. In my opinion, the proper way is to have the amendment made bere, and I can see no reason why it should not be. The method suggested by the Attorney General is somewhat doubtful, inasmuch as this House has no control over another place, and we have the right to safeguard ourselves. However, now that the Attorney-General has given an assurance, I am satisfied for the time being.",27
255,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"On the point of order raised just now, I desire, Mr . Speaker, to call your attention to May, l l t h edition, page 501.",27
256,Mr FENTON,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,Is the 'honourable member raising a point of order ?,27
257,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"Yes . You , Speaker, took occasion to inform me that it was impossible for the Attorney-General, at this-stage, to carry out his promise by moving an amendment. I think, standing order 183 it is quite true that a Bill must be recommitted before the Order of the Day is called on; but, with such a standing order, the practice in the House of Commons, which we are directed to follow [242] when not otherwise inconsistent with our procedure, is set out in May at the page mentioned. A f t e r stating that, by standing order No. 42, verbal amendments only can be made to a Bill on the third reading, May goes on to sayWhen material amendments are desirable, the order for the third reading of the Bill may be discharged, and the Bill recommitted to introduce the amendments in Committee.",27
258,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"W it h your consent that can be done, but, without your consent, it cannot.",27
259,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,We wish it to be done.,27
260,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"Then why not tell your people to sit down, and shut up ? asked what Sir WILLIAM IRVINE - Will you do it ?",27
261,Mr HUGHES,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [3.15] - Tber e are three points to which I shall very briefly address my remarks. The first is the statement made by several honourable members that the method of the schedule is complex, leaving the taxpayer in an atmosphere of doubt as to how much he has to I desire to pay. We are asked to adopt in place of it the system of gradations operating in the States. Several honourable members have urged that course upon me with very great force. I admit that, on the face of it , the system adopted in the States is more simple, but it is illogical and unjust. It makes a man who is at the beginning of his particular class pay much more than the man who is at the end of the preceding class, so that a man who receives Â£999 pays, say, 4d. i h the Â£ 1 , while the man receiving Â£1,000 pays 5d. or 6d. in the Â£ 1 . That is a strong in ducement to men to understate their in come. In any case, it is grossly unfair, and the only argument in its favour is that it is easy to understand. The system adopted in this B i ll is scientifically regulated and absolutely just. A man pays exactly on the amount of income he receives; he has no inducement to understate that iucome. The incidence of taxaMr tion proceeds on an even curve of in creases, the rate of tax increasing w it b each additional Â£ 1 of income. I much prefer the system we bave adopted. It is TJnder, scientific, logical, and fair . I cannot believe that there can be any confusion in the minds of the public, in vitw of the very plain statement of the effects of the Bill set out in the schedule. I desire to make perfectly clear to the taxpayers, who are very seriously concerned in this matter,' exactly what their position is. This brings me to the point raised by the honourable member for Corangamite, who desired to know the position of a taxpayer who was in receipt of an income of Â£2,500. I ask the honourable member to look at the schedule, which is to be distinguished from the footnote. The latter is published longitudinally, and is not part of the schedule, but merely an illustration of its effect. In the footnote is set out the actual amount of tax paid per Â£ 1 on every Â£ 1 of income, whereas in the schedule itself there is set out the rate of tax levied on the last Â£ 1 of income. The difference is fundamental. The point I desire to touch upon is the suggestion of the honourable member for Balaclava, and other honourable members, that this rate of tax should operate for one year. I understand that in the United Kingdom the practice is to reimpose the income tax every year, re-adjusting the rates as the circumstances time to time demand. An income tax has long been regarded as the most flexible and convenient for m of meeting fluctuations of revenue. It can be made light when the revenue is coming to band freely from other sources, and heavier when the revenue declines or the expenditure increases. There is considerable doubt as to the amount of revenue we shall derive from this tax, owing, as I pointed out in Committee, to the absence of data. I think it fair and proper that we sbould bave an opportunity, in the light of one year's experience of the tax, to adjust it to the circumstances obtaining at that time. That proposition is fair and reasonable, and I am perfectly content to adopt it , but the question arises as to how that may be done. I submit that, with the consent of the House, an amendment can be made by striking out the words "" and each financial year thereafter."" That amendment will meet the circumstances of the present occasion. I wish to make that amendment, if I may be permitted to do so.",27
262,Mr SPEAKER,DUPLICATION OF SMALL ARMS,"I would point out to honourable members that we seem to be adopting methods of conducting business that are scarcely creditable to the House, which does not seem to know precisely where it is. We have now passed the stage when this Bill can be recommitted in the ordinary way, and if the Standing Orders are to be ignored honourable members will see the difficulty in which I shall be placed. I may give a ruling one minute, and in the next the House may agree upon a course which will have the effect of setting my ruling at nought. If the House is going to continue this irregular course of procedure, I do not see that the Standing Orders will be of much use to me. If it is the desire of the House that the Attorney-General shall have leave to withdraw the motion that has been under discussion for the last four hours, I am entirely in its hands; but I would suggest that on an occasion like thir d this the House should take the course of suspending the Standing Orders, so that its business can be conducted properly. I ask the House to help me in mairitaining order and the proper conduct of business, for if irregular methods are adopted, my efforts to keep order or to interpret the Standing Orders, so as to secure the proper conduct from of debate, will not be of much avail. Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member have leave to withdraw the motion for the third reading of the Bill? Leave granted. Motion, by leave, withdrawn. Motion (by Mr HUGHES) agreed toThat the Bill be recommitted for the reconsideration of clause 5. In Committee (Recommittal): Clause 5Income tax shall be levied in and for the nnancial year beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and fifteen, and eaeh financial year thereafter. Amendment (by Mr HUGHES) agreed toThat the words "" and each financial year thereafter"" be left out. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with a further amendment, and report adopted. Bill read a third time. NA (SENATE'S. TERM OF SERVICE ) BILL. Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr HUGHES) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until Wednesday next. House adjourned at 3.32 p.m.",28
