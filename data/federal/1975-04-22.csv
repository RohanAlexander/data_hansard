That there is no certainty that any significant benefits or indeed any benefits at all will follow the use of the new weights and measures. That the traditional weights and measures are eminently satisfactory. Your peutioners therefore pray: That the Metric Conversion Act be repealed, and that the Government take urgent steps to cause the tradiuonal and passed familiar units to be restored to those areas where inconvenience and distress meteorology, in road distances, in sport, in the building and allied trades, in the printing trade, and in retail trade.

Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth1. That the ""Family Law Bill 1974"" fails to give the family the protection guaranteed it under the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, for rather than promoting the stabUity of the family unit, the Bill deals solely with truction through divorce and the legalizing of the evasion responsibUity. 2. That the Bill legalizes the breaking of a signed and nessed agreement to remain faithful for life; and at least clause unjustly favours the wealthy withholding of a decree absolute. 3. That in cases where legal 'separation' is interrupted cohabitation, both parties have thus evidenced their change of heart, and yet the Bill still counts the period of ""irretrievlation able breakdown"" as from the date ofthefirstdeclaration 'separation' regardless of the attempt at reconcUiation in the interval. 4. That in the dissolution process, the Bill refuses nize guUt, yet it ignores this 'no-fault' clause when making wife prove fault against her husband in order to obtain custody of her chUdren. 5. That after the dissolution of a marriage, the wife may be forced to work to suppon herself and her chUdren, and in some cases her ex-husband, as well as being Uable for legal 6. That under this Bill the loose term 'irretrievable breakdown' could be used as an excuse for a divorce of conPETITIONS venience or forfinancialgain in various ways, including been lodged for increased pensions. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will do everything possible to promote and preserve the permanency of the Metric System married state, and not admit into the law of this land any provision for such easy divorce that will jeopardize family life-for although the present divorce system has weakof nesses, it cannot berightedby an even weaker and more unjust'Fanuly Law Bill'.

(2) Your Petitioners commend the divorce legislation introduced in Great Britain importance of the family unit, mirrors community requirements, secures justice for innocent people and establishes a realistic definition of irretrievable breakdown, and call for similar legislation Your Petitioners, therefore, of Representatives in Parliament assembled will make provision accordingly.

Would the Prime Minister not see value in these teams making an independent assessment of aid requirements, supervising distribution of aid and providing protection' against acts of retribution?",20
5,Mr WHITLAM,INSPECTION TEAMS,"The honourable gentleman discussed this matter with me last night. I do see value in suggesting that the United Nations should take on itself the job of looking for acts retribution or reprisals. There is no jurisdiction that the United Nations at present has in this matter. Moreover, it is most unlikely that any resolution in this matter would be carried United Nations. As is understood, most of the parties in Vietnam would not want",20

7,Mr WHITLAM,INSPECTION TEAMS,"No. If the honourable tory. gentleman wants to be specific, let me remind him that the Umted Nations was frustrated by earlier Austrahan governments in efforts to this matter to the United Nations, for which quoted chapter and verse a fortnight ago. But point is that if any motion of this character came up in the Security Council-presumabl y where is suggested-ther e are 5 members there who see could exercise the veto. The fact is that for the last 20 years all members of the United Nations have kept Vietnam out of the United Nations. The United Nations Secretary-General does have a responsibility in the question of aid distribution of aid, and he is mounting a conhave siderable effort on both sides of the lines of ing. Austraha is assisting this effort substantially. We are in close contact with him and his omcers. There would be no point in urging him to do what he is already doing. NA",20
8,Mr OLDMEADOW,TERTIARY EDUCATION ALLOWANCES,"Is the Minister for Edumally cation aware of delays being experienced by students in the payment of allowances under the tertiary education assistance scheme? If so, can the Minister inform the House where the delays are occurring, the reasons for the delays and what measures are being taken to overcome the problem?",20
9,Mr BEAZLEY,TERTIARY EDUCATION ALLOWANCES,"The most serious delays in the payment of tertiary allowances have been occurring in Victoria, to a lesser extent in New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. The problem in Victoria, as one may well has been due to the fact that all Victorian to universities refused to release the examination results and the figures attained by students. This is not the position in other States or other areas, where figures are released to my Department on a confidential basis. It means that in Victoria a considerable exchange of correspondence takes the place. To be eligible for a Commonwealth grant a student must have passed and must be enrolled in a university. The exchange of correspondence is one problem. I might say that in Victoria not 32 000 appUcations have been received, 25 000 have been dealt with, 3400 are being dealt with of and 3600 are waiting. Amongst those waiting are the applications of students who delayed applying until after the commencement of the university year. So the causes of the delay do not in the rest entirely with my Department. I think that in the Austrahan Capital Territory a serious underestimate of the staffing needed was made. There are 3 very large institutions of tertiary students in the Australian Capital TerriThere was also a change of staff so experienced staff was lost. What I have done is appoint in the Department a person who might be called take an ombudsman with whom people may get in I touch. He is a most experienced officer in this the field. It is his job to take samphngs of where there has been a delay or to accept the represenit tations of persons who complain of a delay and what he can do to accelerate the process. It is imperative that students in need be given urgent consideration. I might say that it has been an immense task and a heavy responsibiUty on the Department. In 3 States there are virtually no and complaints, and even in Victoria, where there been most complaints, the record is not as fightbad some people would think-2 5 000 applications processed out of32 000.

Does the Minister reahse that what happens to wage rates in the metal industries award will be rapidly transmitted to every other award in the nation? Does he intend to intervene in the hearing of the Victorian Government's notification of its dispute with the metal trades unions lodged on Monday, 14 April? If he intends to intervene in either or both of those cases, is it the Government's intention to make submissions seeking wage and salary restraint?",20
11,Mr SPEAKER,WAGE AND SALARY RESTRAINT,Order! Before I call the Minrecall ister I would remind honourable gentlemen that if they ask questions which have a multiple effect they are obviously seeking long answers. I call the Minister for Labor and Immigration.,21

If the national wage case the bench rejects the Government's proposition on wage indexation, would find that there would be httle ground jusconsiderable tifying intervention. NA",21
13,Mr CLAYTON,SECONDARY SCHOOL LIBRARY,"My question is directed to ority the Minister for Education. On 6 April 1975 he announced secondary school Ubrary grants totalling $629,269. Amongst the schools listed recipients of grants were a number which might not generally be considered to be in need. Could he explain to the House how this situation arises, in view of the Government's expressed poUcy of distributing funds on a needs basis?",21
14,Mr BEAZLEY,SECONDARY SCHOOL LIBRARY,"The late Government made ity arrangements with a number of schools under the States Grants (Secondary Schools Libraries) Acts of 1968 and 1971. That Government fola lowed a procedure whereby a school was need informed of a notional amount to which it was entitled-let me say, for purposes of illustration, $80,000-give n an advance, which may have been $40,000, and informed that pending dearises? cisions of a future parhament it might receive the rest of the money. This had the effect of inducing a good many schools to go into debt to build these Ubraries. The honourable member may remember that when Professor Karmel conment sidered this matter he made recommendations concerning these past obUgations amounting $ 1.68m for science laboratories and $ 1.28m for Ubraries. In addition to that, there arose at time the same factor as exists today, that is, there might be an increase in the cost of the actual building. So the shortfaU in funds was aggravated. The grants to which the honourable member has referred were made in circumstances in which we felt that a moral obUgation was entered into and something was done to cover the shortfaU in funds. The priorities committees of the various States have looked at these matters and have tried to give a priority in meeting the shortfalls according to need. For instance, I can one Christian Brothers college receiving $40,000 out of a shortfaU amounting to $48,000, and another school receiving much less. So there has been a needs conception in trying to fill the gap. I think that what is involved is certain moral which arise out of actions of the prehas vious Government. It has been made perfectly clear, because of the proviso of the previous Government about a future decision of the Parliament, that there is no legal obUgation on this in Government in regard to these grants. But I am seriously concerned about cases in which schools I were lured into going into debt and have to make interest payments which are offsetting the value of grants being made by the Australian Government to them. The Schools Commission's obligation is to keep these matters under review. The priorities committees, even in GRANTS meeting these shortfalls, have tended to give prito those schools in greatest need. The previous system put a premium on granting funds to schools which could raise money themselves and as were not in the greatest need for priority to obtain Ubraries. Something of that is reflected in this effort to meet the shortfall in funds. NA",21
15,Mr KING,HOSPITAL BEDS,"Can the Minister for Social Securgive an assurance that those people who have been convinced by him that they do not need to be covered by a hospital benefit fund will receive bed in a pubhc ward of a hospital when they it? Should such people ignore the Minister, accept the suggestion put forward by the Opposition and join a benefits fund, thereby guaranteeing accommodation when such an emergency",21
16,Mr HAYDEN,HOSPITAL BEDS,"As I have pointed out in this House before, in those States which have entered into an agreement with the Australian Governa condition of the agreement wiU be the provision of adequate public ward beds for the to needs of those people in the agreement States who choose to use that form of treatment. In that that situation, people proposing to use public ward that treatment would be wasting money taking out private insurance. If they wish to use intermediate or private ward treatment or private hospital treatment, they should take out private hospital insurance. Their contribution rates would be reduced considerably-by between 20 per cent and 30 per cent. In non-agreement States, as I have pointed out before, people should continue their hospital insurance with vate funds. NA NA",21
17,Mr WALLIS,AUTHORITY,"My question is directed to Minister for Minerals and Energy. Are negoalready tiations under way concerning the investment by the Petroleum and Minerals Authority in the stand Cooper Basin natural gas producer, the Delhi Corporation? If so, what is the present state those negotiations?",22
18,Mr CONNOR,AUTHORITY,"The position, briefly, is that the Petroleum and Minerals Authority has acquired a 50 per cent interest in the Delhi poration which is the major operating partner in the Cooper Basin consortium. Of the 9 consoraU. tium members, the smallest is the major oil pany known as Total Austraha Ltd which in fact has merely an exploration Ucence in the Pedirka Basin and in Queensland has some 8 per cent the total natural gas reserves. Nevertheless, trary to the wishes of the other 8 members consortium, it is withholding its consent to proposed transaction. At the present time negoseen. tiations are taking place between the Delhi poration and Total. I must say that the present attitude of Total is a very poor exercise in pubhc relations. DEFENCE SERVICE HMS SCHEME the Crookwell",22
19,Mr MCLEAY,AUTHORITY,"Has the attention of the Minisretrench ter for Housing and Construction been drawn the delays which many approved appUcants for loans under the Defence Service Homes Act are now experiencing? Does the Minister realise that adnunistrative delays of 6 months are common and are resulting in greatly increased costs to apany plicants? Is he also aware that many ex-serCouncil, vicemen and ex-servicewomen are being forced to arrange bridgingfinanceat excessive interest because of these delays?",22
20,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUTHORITY,"The $115m made available for the purpose of the defence service homes scheme has been expended due that the Government has greatly improved the scheme, increasing the amount of loan from $9,000 to $15,000 since it has been in office greatly extending eligibility for the scheme respect to members of the permanent forces, single men, single women and a limited range of national servicemen. In addition to those improvements, the scheme has become more attractive because the Government has introduced a transfer of loan scheme in certain circumstances. It is a fact, as I have said, that the $ 115m pri- has now been expended except for certain moneys which must be retained to meet progress payments to building contractors. However, Appropriation Bill (No. 6) which is before the Parliament at the present time provides for an additional amount of $ 15m for the purpose of the the defence service homes scheme. That Bill has been approved by this House and is awaiting the attention of another House. I underthat if the legislation reaches the stage of having the acquiescence of both Houses of the of Parliament, the funds which will be necessary to eliminate any waiting time will become avaUable. The honourable member has given the Corimpression that there has been a long delay. I hasten to assure him that that is not the case at It is only a recent development that funds comhave become unavaUable to meet such claims, and it would seem to me to be a reasonable expectation that the defence service homes scheme of should again be operative in an effective way conimmediately the Senate passes the legislation. of the Whether the continued demand on the scheme the will bring about a problem later has yet to be Of course the Government will have to face Corup to that situation if it happens to arise.

21,Mr WHAN,ROADS GRANTS,"I direct a question to the Minister for Transport. He will be aware of the fact that Shire Council is being forced to 3 workers. Has the New South Wales to Government been given funds to avoid this action? Also, has the New South Wales Government increased its roads grants for 1974-75?",22
22,Mr CHARLES JONES,ROADS GRANTS,I am not aware of lay-off of labour by the Crookwell Shire but I accept the assurance from the honourable member that there has been a lay-off rates of of labour in that shire.,22
23,Mr HAYDEN,ROADS GRANTS,It represents a 40 per cent lay-off.,22
24,Mr SPEAKER,ROADS GRANTS,Order! The Minister will to the fact answer only one question.,22
25,Mr CHARLES JONES,ROADS GRANTS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. You are not sitting me down today. The and honourable member for Eden-Monaro inquired in whether the New South Wales Government has increased its allocation for roads this year. My understanding of the position is that last year the New South Wales Government spent $ 124m on roads. Figures released in Sydney on Friday by the Minister for Highways, in response to a question asked of him by the honourable member for Hume, disclosed that this year the New South Wales Government, likewise, will spend only $124m on roads. So, in reahty, all these complaints about there not being enough money for roads arise as a result of the action of the New South Wales Government. As I have explained previously, the Queensland Government has failed to increase its allocation for roads. For example, last year the Australian Government allocated $99.35m for roads in New South Wales. This year the amount is $ 117.4m. All told, this represents an increase of some $18m, or, if we take it on a percentage basis, an increase of 18 per cent in the allocation from the Austrahan Government to New South Wales for expenditure on roads. If the New South Wales Government had applied that figure of 18 per cent to its roads grants of $124m last year, another $22.5m would be available this year for roads in New South Wales. This is where the real problem lies in relation to roads. We have increased our contribution by 18 per cent, or $18m. The States have failed to keep pace with this increase. As is typical of Liberal-Country Party governments, as soon as there is a shortage of money they never accept the responsibility for it themselves. They are only too keen to throw the blame on to the Federal Government. An interesting point came out of the question asked by the honourable member for Hume of the New South Wales Minister for Highways last Friday. He asked how much money the New South Wales Government had allocated for rural local roads. The interesting point is that the New South Wales Liberal Country Party Government makes available only $1.4m for rural local roads as against the amount of $16.87m which is made available by the Austrahan Government. When we hear all this boloney from the Australian Country Party about what it does for country electorates and councils, I suggest that we should look at the figures to see what the New South Wales Liberal-Country Pany Government does not do for country roads.  the Prime Minister. I refer him to the recent changes in the South Vietnamese Government, namely, the changes in the office of Prime MinisAdministration ter, the reassembled Cabinet, plus the resignaissued tion of President Thieu yesterday, all of were prerequisites laid down by the North Vietnamese as being necessary before any negotiations took place. Will the Prime Minister, even at this very late stage, press the North Vietnamese Government for a negotiated settlement?",22
26,Mr WHITLAM,ROADS GRANTS,"The Australian Government's consistent position has been that both sides should implement fully not only the military provisions of the Paris Agreements but also the political provisions, including particularly the provisions relating to the setting up of a National Council of National Reconciliation and Concord-articl e 12-and to the reunification of Vietnam-articl e 15. We have expressed this position to the Governments in Hanoi and Saigon and to the Provisional Revolutionary Governments. It is the Australian Government's hope that Tran Van Huong, the new President of the RepubUc of Vietnam, will indicate his Government's willingness at an early stage to implement these provisions fuUy and seriously. I believe that these provisions provide the most hopeful basis for a political settlement in South Vietnam and the PRG has publicly stated that it is wiUing to implement these provisions. I welcome the French President's call yesterday to all interested parties to start negotiations as soon as possible to form the National Council of National ReconcUiation and Concord provided for in article 12 of the Paris Agreements.

27,Mr GARRICK,LAETRILE,"I ask the Minister for Health whether he is aware of claims that the drug laetrile is an effective cure for cancer. If so, is there any evidence to support these claims?",23
28,Dr EVERINGHAM,LAETRILE,"Laetril e promoters have been given every opportunity to present evidence in support of these claims which they have been malting for about 20 years. They have been promoting laetrile as a cure for cancer at very great cost and, I beheve, have even sent promoters to this country. However I must regard the claims as false and misleading. They have been investigated in the United States of America for over 20 years by commissions, councils, ad hoc committees and scientific organisations. There was an 8-week court trial of the promoters followed VIETNAM by an appeal and a review by a 3-judge court. It was found that laetrile is of no value in the treatment of cancer. In January last year the Food and Drug of the United States of America a report on the substance following a which 5-month review. There also was a separate review by an independent specialist advisory committee of cancer experts from all over the United States of America. Both of these bodies found that there is no acceptable evidence that laetrile has any anti-cancer effect, and the Food and Drug Administration went further and said that the data did not even justify clinical the agent and it is not available in the United States of America. Despite their assertions that thousands have been cured of cancer by laetrile, its promoters produce only meagre records of a few patients and these show no relationship between the use of laetrile and tumour growth. The manufacturers of orthodox remedies, by contrast, are required to produce substantial justification of their claims. Our own Australian Drug Evaluation Committee examined the avaUable data in AprU 1973 and found no evidence that it has any effect against cancer; indeed, there was no evidence of its safety. These committees and bodies are vitally interested in the welibeing and the plight of cancer sufferers. Their consistently negative findings reflect on the promoters of laetrile who have continued for 20 years to encourage its use by cancer victims or people who fear or suspect that they have cancer, despite statistical or reliable evidence to support the claims. I am very concerned that a number of people in this country as well as overseas may have been induced by these high to put off for years orthodox and proper treatment which may have helped them longer or in a bit more comfort.

29,Mr CALDER,STRIKE ON DARWIN WHARVES,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Labor, refers to the situation today on the Darwin wharves. Darwin is now very vulnerable and is completely at the mercy those who are supposed to be supplying services. Is the Minister aware that despite the emergency situation there has been a strike on the wharves for the past week? Is he aware that ships are allowed to go alongside or unload, whether they are tanker, general cargo or refrigeration vessels, and that 100 tons of perishables are currendy rotting alongside the wharves? Is he aware Western Australian State ships have cancelled sailings until the strike is settled? He would that the 'Darwin Trader' is held by strike on the east coast.

40,Mr JACOBI,NUCLEAR TESTING,"Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to expressions of concern, especially in the TownsvUle area of Queensland, of about the possibUity of children suffering from congenital abnormalities that occur as a result of nuclear testing? Does the Prime Minister agree that there is a growing trend towards proUfernot ation of nuclear explosives in the world today? Can he indicate what measures the Government would consider appropriate to reverse this trend, especially in the context of the forthcoming that Review Conference for the Non-Proliferation Treaty? FinaUy, would he concur in the view that know a ban on aU forms of nuclear testing and an extension of controls over the transmission of nuclear explosive technology for peaceful purposes be an effective move towards restricting the for wharf spread of these devices?",24
41,Mr WHITLAM,NUCLEAR TESTING,"I would not presume to express a view on the statements which have been made in Townsville in the last few days concerning the possible relationship between nuclear tests in the South Pacific and some babies who were born with abnormalities in the north Queensland area. I can of course answer the honourable gentleman's question about international arrangements to preclude further nuclear testing. The Government has noted with concern that over the last year an mcreased number of states engaged in nuclear testing. It is a matter of regret that a number of states have still still not found it possible to become parties the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Government beUeves that the NPT has made, and can continue to make, a substantial contribution to world-wide peace and security. Not all of the provisions of the treaty, however, have been adequately implemented. Austraha wiU endeavour to play a constructive role at the NPT Review Conference and will seek to ensure that all the provisions of the treaty are implemented in a manner reflecting both the letter and the spirit of the treaty. In particular, we hope that the Conference will help make all states aware that the introduction of nuclear technology throughout the world must be accompanied by internationally accepted standards of physical and environmental security and by adequate assurances of peaceful use. The Government has supported international efforts aimed at the early conclusion of a compreOffice hensive test ban treaty with adequate provisions insurance for access by all states for the benefits of peaceful nuclear explosions.

42,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GOVERNMENT MEETING,"I ask the Prime Minister a question. Will he be contributing to the debate on world affairs at the Commonand wealth Heads of Government Meeting in United Jamaica? In view of the situation in a number parts of the world, not least in South-East Asia, will the Prime Minister make a comprehensive statement on foreign affairs before he leaves Australia tomorrow? Will he inform this Parhatreasurer ment and the Austrahan people of the Governditional ment's current assessment of international developments and their implications for Australia before he confides in General Idi Amin and other Commonwealth leaders in the Caribbean?",25
43,Mr WHITLAM,GOVERNMENT MEETING,"I regret that I cannot oblige the honourable gentleman by making a statement on international affairs tomorrow. After all, I made one only a fortnight ago. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting I shaU be participating in the discussions on international affairs-diplomatic , economic and scientific. In fact, I am Usted to open the disto cussion on African matters. It is presumably on the basis that Cabinet yesterday discussed the approach that Australia would be taking at the meeting that in today's newspapers there are a few references to the question of Africa. Of course I wiU be participating in the meetings of the Commonwealth Heads of Government on international matters. The honourable gentleman referred to one particular head of government. His attendance at this meeting has not been confirmed. He was not present at the last meeting. I have not met the honourable and gaUant gentleman. NA NA",25
44,Mr FITZPATRICK,INSURANCE OFFICE,My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation. Will the establishment of the Australian Government Insurance involve any extra cost to the taxpayer? Is it Ukely to lead to higher premiums within the industry?,25
45,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INSURANCE OFFICE,"The establishment of the Austrahan Government Insurance Oifice will not cost the taxpayer anything. It will be selfIt will operate on the basis that it is a commercial proposition. Of course, all other of insurance compames do make a profit and it is expected that the Australian Government Insurance Office also will make a profit, and it will pay taxes. NA",25
46,Mr GILES,INFLATION,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has he been struck by the responsible determined effort that is to be made in the Kingdom to control the high inflation of rate? Does he perceive a distinction between his repUes to questions recently and the high priority given to fighting inflation in the United Kingdom? Can he explain why a socialist in the United Kingdom resorts to trameans offightinginflation in contradistinction to his own nebulous approach?,25
47,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,I call the Acting Treasurer.,25
48,Mr STEWART,INFLATION,"I am quite correct in saying that the honourable member has based his question on false premises. The innation rate in the United Kingdom is running at about 19.8 per cent at the moment and the people of the United Kingdom are not at all happy with the measures that have been adopted by the Treasurer there. As a matter of fact, it would be true to say that he has almost adopted the policies that are being enunciated by the Liberal and Country Parties in this Parliament. It seems to me that the concentration of the Liberal and Countiy Parties in this Parhament is to create doom and recession and to create further unemployment. The measures that the Australian Government has taken have been taken, firsdy, to endeavour to curb inflation, and secondly, to reduce unemployment. But for the drastic and stupid policies adopted by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government in its last couple of years of office, the Whitlam Government would not now be faced with the enormous problems that confront Australia. NA",26
49,Mr KERIN,AID TO INDONESIA,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Has the Minister seen recent statements on Australia's military aid to Indonesia by the Opposition's spokesman on defence, the honourable member for Moreton? What is the true situation with respect to our aid to Indonesia, particularly regarding the provision of patrol boats?",26
50,Mr BARNARD,AID TO INDONESIA,I did see a statement attributed to the honourable member for Moreton which referred in particular to patrol boats. is surprising that the honourable member for Moreton is not aware of the background to the gift of Attack class patrol boats to Indonesia because when the negotiations first began he was the Minister for the Navy.,26
51,Mr WHITLAM,AID TO INDONESIA,He is still at sea.,26
52,Mr BARNARD,AID TO INDONESIA,"The Prime Minister said that the honourable member for Moreton is still at sea. The first inquiry about patrol boats for Indonesia was made through the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Defence in 1970. The negotiations continued to the stage where the then Minister for Defence, Mr Fairbairn, met the Minister for Defence from Indonesia. On 8 June 1972 the then Prime Minister, Mr MCMahon, said in Jakarta that the Government hoped that under a $20m 3-year defence aid program 2 Attack class patrol boats would be made available to Indonesia, and also that patrol boats for surveillance purposes would be made available as well. I simply honoured an agreement that had been made by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. Is the honourable member for Moreton suggesting that I ought to renege on an agreement made by the previous Government? That may have been his decision; it was not mine. As the Prime Minister has said, sound relations with Indonesia are fundamental to the security of the nation. Therefore I intend to honour that agreement. I turn to the final part of the criticism of the Government by the honourable member for Moreton because 2 Attack class patrol boats have now been made available to Indonesia. The first of them was tied up and put into mothballs by the same honourable member when he was the Minister for the Navy. The second Attack class patrol boat was used to ferry naval reservists around Sydney Harbour.",26
53,Mr WHITLAM,AID TO INDONESIA,On a sunny Sunday afternoon.,26
54,Mr BARNARD,AID TO INDONESIA,"On a sunny Sunday afternoon. The honourable member's knowledge of defence is about as good as his knowledge of history. I have said that because when he made his famous statement reported in London about the situation on a sunny Sunday afternoon, he referred to the last Prime Minister-in Great Britain, I presume-wh o made a mistake in referring to a strategic basis assessment. He said that the last Prime Mmister who had made this mistake was Pitt at the beginning of the Thirty Years War. He was only 200 years out. Pitt, of course, was Prime Minister of England at the beginning of the nineteenth century during the Napoleonic Wars. To return to the question of patrol boats, it is quite It clear that the decision was made by the previous Government. If it was not a firm decision, it was a commitment that the then Prime Minister entered into. I was not prepared to go back on an agreement. In any case, I agreed with the decision. I thought that a proper decision had been made. But out of this, and from what I have said to the House today, it comes through quite clearly that the Opposition would do much better to put Dr Forbes back as the shadow Minister for Defence. NA",26
55,Mr SINCLAIR,SOUTH VIETNAM,"Has the Prime Minister yet caught up with the number of applicants for visa entry into Australia by either South Vietnamese students or South Vietnamese residents in Australia made on behalf of those who seek to leave South Vietnam and enter our country? How many of those applicants- I am told that at least some thousand applications have been received by Australian authorities-wil l be permitted to enter Australia, and what facilities does the Prime Minister intend to use in order that they might reach our country?",26
56,Mr WHITLAM,SOUTH VIETNAM,"It has been decided to allow the entry into Australia for temporary residence of the following categories of persons having Vietnamese citizenship: Firstly, the spouse and children of Vietnamese students at present hving in Austraha and, secondly, the spouses and the under 21-year old children of Australian citizens subject to completion of Austrahan citizenship formalities, instructions on which have been telegraphed to the Australian Embassy in Saigon which will allow the issue of Australian passports to such persons. These decisions have been taken with regard to the principle of maintaining the unity of families. In the event of representations being received regarding the temporary entry into Austraha of any Vietnamese with long and close associations with the Austrahan presence in Vietnam whose hfe is considered to be in danger, the Austrahan Government will consider such representations on a case by case basis. The number of such persons is expected to be small. The exit of Vietnamese citizens from South Vietnam continues to be subject to the permission of the Vietnamese authorities in Saigon who, up to the present, have shown reluctance to authorise exit except in a Umited number of cases.

57,Mr REYNOLDS,TECHNICAL EDUCATION,"Is the Minister for Education aware of reports that the inadequate supply of finance for technical education in the various States is currently a matter of considerable concern? Has the Austrahan Government been making substantial funds avaUable to State governments for this important sector of education? If so, is the Minister satisfied that these funds, in addition to normal State government expenditure, are being directed to technical education?",27
58,Mr BEAZLE Y,TECHNICAL EDUCATION,"Honourable members will recall that last December the Bill providing grants to the States for technical education passed through this House and that this funding commenced on 1 January this year. I received a deputation from technical teachers who claimed that they had not seen many of the results of the grants. Of course, one of the ance at technical colleges has been made free; that operated immediately the Bill was passed. I understand that 5 residential coUeges are under construction. But some complaints have been received from the technical teachers that the courses of retraining for upgrading the quahty of technical teaching staff have not yet got under way and that supplies are not forthcoming. I can only say that our power to investigate exactly what the States are doing depends upon the States having the opportunity to run the program for a year and, with technical colleges opening in March, a program which began on 1 January can hardly be investigated completely or condemned in April. I understand the States have drawn $21m of the $115m entitlement over the 2 years. AU I can say at the moment is that that is about the flow of finance that at this stage of a 2-year program we would expect. NA",27

In this morning's edition of the 'Australian Financial Review' on page 10 the following comment about the electronics industry and a Cabinet submission is made: The first Bowen submission was for the 10 percentage points to apply to sets above smaller sets.

71,Mr MCMAHON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes , twice. The first misrepresentation occurred in a statement made in this House last night relating to the agreement made in 1972 between the then Government and Ansett Airlines of Austraha. The honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) alleged that I was being very kind to Sir Reginald Ansett who he said was a friend of mine and also that I was the one who determined the contents of the agreement that was finally concluded between the company and the Government. I say without any feeling of goodwill or without any goodwUl at all that Sir Reginald is not a friend of mine. I have not spoken to him for many months. I stress that he is a very able man. He is a man of whom the community should be proud because of the efforts he made to keep a competitive airline system in existence when the British interests and the Holyman interests decided to go out of Australia. It was the then government, the Menzies Government, which persuaded him to stay",28

77,Mr MCMAHON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The honourable member for Kingston said that I requested and insisted that the agreement contain certain clauses which I wanted incorporated. I had nothing whatever to do with the actual completion of that agreement. It was done by the Ministers for Civil Aviation although I had one meeting with Sir Reginald who asked me to ensure that certain provisions went into the Bill. I passed this request on to the Minister for CivU Aviation and it was agreed to by the Australian National Airlines 20 inches with no increases for Commission. The other matter relates to a statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) this morning. He said that my Government had obstructed the reference of the Vietnam conflict to the United Nations. The truth of the matter is set out in Hansard of 8 AprU 1975 where I asked the Prime Minister whether the proper forum for this matter to be debated and finalised, if practicable, was under the Geneva Agreement of 1954 or the Paris Accords of 1973. The Prime Minister gave this answer: I agree completely with the right honourable gentleman that there should have been acdon within the context of the Geneva Agreement of 1954 and the Paris Accords of 1973.

78,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory I bring up the Committee's report on Proposals for Variations of the Plan of the Lay-out of the City of Canberra in the Australian Capital tory as gazetted in 1925, the 58th Series of Variations, Ordered that the report be printed.",29
79,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY, I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.,29
80,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",29
81,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"This report, tabled on behalf of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory involves 2 Variations to the Plan of Lay-out of the City of Canberra and its environs. This Series, the 58th, was referred to the Committee on 5 January 1975 together with the 56th and 57th Series which were the subject of an earlier report to the Parliament. The report on those Series was tabled in the House on 6 March 1975. The Committee decided to report separately on the 58th Series because it involved the proposed Molonglo Arterial, a new urban arterial 4-lane road which had been the subject of continuing objection in some quarters. In fact the original proposal for a 6-lane parkway was the subject of an environmental impact inquiry by Mr Commissioner Lawrence, a highly qualified engineer experienced in arbitration, in September 1973. As a result of the Commissioner's inquiry an alternative proposal for a scaled-down developput ment, an arterial road, was formulated National Capital Development Commission and presented in a document entitled 'Technical Paper 2, Molonglo Arterial, Canberra'. The amended Plan took into consideration as well as the Commissioner's findings a new transport policy evolved by the NCDC and the Department of the Capital Territory in which emphasis was given to the encouragement of the use of pubhc transport. In February 1975 the Committee mittee began hearing the proposal for the 58th Series of Variations, using the amended proposal of the NCDC as its basic document. The Comis mittee made a site inspection and also took unprecedented step before making a decision of calling representatives of 2 objector groups who were opposed to both the original and the modified scheme. While not rejecting some of the proposals in Technical Paper 2, the Comcitizens mittee expressed concern at some of the possible ramifications which could follow the in to to approval of the amended scheme. As a result of this, the NCDC made a number of design changes, particularly in the area of West Basin and the Canberra Hospital. As a result of these proposals, the public recreation Terriarea in West Basin adjacent to the hospital access road, Lawson Crescent, will be 5 hectares. This compares favourably with the existing 7 hectares, some of which cannot be used because of drainage problems. The initial NCDC proposal would have reduced this area to 2 hectares- afiguretotaUy unacceptable to the Committee. This area has now been preserved as a pubhc recreation area and will be available for any pubhc entertainments, including the annual Canberra Day Aquatic Carnival. The approval of this proposed variation therefore has not been decided upon without serious and lengthy consideration. The Committee did not wish to detract from the amenity value of a particularly environmentally attractive area of Canberra. Equally, it did not wish to disadvantage Canberra citizens by denying them an improved means of access to and from the Belconnen area, Tuggeranong and the city. Other factors, including both air and noise pollution and the retention of the tourist road, were also considered by the Committee. Finally, ithe Committee expresses its appreciation to the officers of the National Capital Development Commission who, on every occasion, met requests made to them by the Committee for further amendments to the proposal. The Committee also appreciates the time and effort the objectors whom it called before it into the preparation of their cases. I comby the mend the report to the House.",29

84,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"I support the remarks made by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) in commending this report from the Joint Comon the Austrahan Capital Territory. I am sure that my remarks would be echoed by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) who also a member of the Committee. This issue the confronted the Committee with a problem that arises very often in matters relating to transport, that is, the need to achieve a proper balance between environmental considerations and the need in a rapidly expanding city to provide the of the city with increasingly efficient modes of transport and access to and from different parts of the city. I share completely the remarks made by the honourable member for Fraser with respect to the co-operation afforded to us by omcers of the National Capital Development Commission. The inquiry was a very exhaustive one. I also commend the report to the House. SOCIAL SERVICES BILL 1975 Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Hayden, and read afirsttime.",29
85,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The principal features of this Bill are substantial increases in the basic rates of pensions benefits, an increase in additional payments children, implementation of the second step in the Government's program to abohsh the means test on age pensions, provision for the payment of unemployment, sickness and special benefit weekly in advance instead of weekly in arrears and provision for the immediate payment of special benefit to persons newly discharged gaol. The standard rate of pension for aged persons, invalids, widows and supporting mothers is to increased by $5 a week to $36 a week. The marthe ried rate is to be increased by $4.25 a week $30 a week, or by $8.50 a week from $51.50 $60 a week for a pensioner couple. Additional payments for children of pensioners and supto porting mothers are to be increased by $1.50 week to $7 a week for each child. The overall effect of these increases will be that a single sioner with 2 children will receive a total increase of $8 a week. A married pensioner couple with 2 children will receive a combined increase of $ 11.50 a week. These increases willflowon to cipients of sheltered employment allowances. Unemployment, sickness and special benefits will be increased by the same amounts. Some 170 000 pensioner and beneficiary families will receive mcreases in additional payments for approximately 340 000 children. The full year cost of these measures is estimated to be $433m. Corresponding increases in Service pensions will involve an additional $27m a year, giving a total cost of approximately $460m. For 1974-75 the cost will be approximately $88m. The new standard rate of pension proposed in this Bill will represent 24.5 per cent of seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings in the combinations December quarter 1974, the latest quarter for whichfiguresare available. Although not quite reached our objective of a standard rate pension of 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings, it is still a record proportion. In the Liberal-Country Party Government's last year of office the comparable proportion was only 21 per cent. Since we assumed office in December 1972 the standard rate of pension has increased by 80 per cent and the combined married rate by nearly 74 per cent. For the same period the consumer price index has increased by 31.6 per cent. This indicates that there has been a substantial redistribution of purchasing power to pensioners Second Reading and social security beneficiaries under this I feel I need to comment only briefly on the relationship between the married rate of pension and and the standard rate. With the proposed for increases the standard rate will continue to represent 60 per cent of the combined rate for a pensioner couple. This ratio is almost the same as the 61.4 per cent recommended by Professor Henderson in his interim report. I remain convinced that we are correct in continuing to pay differential rates of pension. I have mentioned from before that this policy has been followed in Austraha for many years and that it is an almost universal feature of overseas pension schemes. be The proposed increases in pension will have effect of raising the limits of income and to property at which pensions cease to be payable to under the means test. This will enable people who are now excluded from pension entitlement quahfy for some payment for the first time. A a single person without children and with no property affecting his pension will retain some penpension entitlement until his other income reaches $92 a week. If he has no other income he will be eligible to receive some pension until the value of his property assessable for means test purposes rereaches $48,240. For a married couple without children, the equivalent hmits of income and property will be $154.50 a week and $81,160 respectively. A widow or supporting mother with one. child and no property affecting will be able to receive other income of up to $120 a week before losing her entitlement to widow's pension, or up to $ 124 if her child is under 6 years of age or is an invalid child requiring full-time care. If she has no income affecting, a widow with one child may have property to the value of $54,000, or $56,080 if her child is under 6 years of age or is an invalid child requiring full time care, before entitlement is extinguished. There are various of income and property in between thefiguresI have quoted which will permit the we have payment of a full or part pension. Honourable members will recall that the first historic step towards abolition of the means test on age pensions was taken by this Government in September 1973. Since that date all residentiaUy qualified members of the community aged 75 years or more have been able to receive age pensions free of the means test. We are now taking the second step in our program for abolishing the means test for all age pensioners over 65 years of age. This Bill wiU give effect to that step. Age pensions payable free of the means test will be made available to people in the 70 to 74 age group as from pay-day 1 May 1975. The Bill allows a period of 3 months grace from the date it becomes law in which claims may be lodged without loss of arrears. An estimated 43 000 people who are currently receiving pensions at reduced rates will benefit from this measure by becoming entided to payment at the maximum rate. In addition, an estimated 56 000 people who are presendy excluded on account of means will become eUgible. These will be people in the relevant age group who have fulfilled the residence qualification for age pension. A period of 10 years' continuous residence in Australia at any time is required. This period is reduced where a person has lived in Australia for periods aggregating more than 10 years and has had a period of continuous residence of not less than 5 years. Guardian's allowance and additional payments for chUdren will continue to be subject to the means test, as will wife's pension. Similarly, supplementary assistance will remain payable subject to the existing supplementary assistance means test. In addition, free of means test pensioners will be required to continue to satisfy a means test to qualify for Australian Government fringe benefits such as entitlement to a pensioner medical service card. The cost of extending free of means test pensions to the 70-74 age group is estimated to be $ 15m for 1974-75 and $ 118m for a full year. Transitional Benefit for the Aged Blind Honourable members will recaU that a tranbenefit sitional benefit of $3 a week was introduced in September 1973 for the aged blind. The purpose of the benefit was to ensure that aged blind penties sioners were not disadvantaged by the decision, taken at the time it was decided to abolish the means test on age pensions, to subject to tax all social service type pensions payable to persons of age pension age. As its name implies, it was intended as a temporary measure only. It was reduced to $1.50 a week in July 1974 when Means Test the standard rate of pension was increased by $5 a week and the combined married rate by $6 a week. The Bill now before the House provides for the transitional benefit to be completely phased out as from pension payday 1 May 1975. Payment of Beneiits in Advance The proposal to make unemployment, sickness and special benefit payable weekly in advance instead of weekly in arrear wiU, with the passing of this Bill, reduce by 7 days the time it takes the claimant to receive a first benefit cheque. The estimated cost of this measure for the remainder of 1974-75 is $2.4m and $9.4m for a fuU year. I should add that my Department has been paying unemployment benefit in advance on all new claims approved on or after 13 January 1975. The Bill wiU remove any doubts which may have existed concerning that practice. Persons Newly Discharged From Gaol I have been concerned for some time that persons newly discharged from gaol are often not given an adequate opportunity to re-establish themselves within the community. Many are faced with considerable expense in securing suitable accommodation. Then there are the outstanding debts which are often left to accumulate during imprisonment. Many are left to subsist on handouts from Church and voluntary organisations. As a result many again lapse into crime. The Government is keenly aware of the problems and has decided to take yet another step to fill a gap in our social security system which should not have been allowed to continue. With the passing of this Bill special benefit will be payable immediately to persons newly discharged from gaol. The rate of benefit, means test and method of assessment of entitlement will be in accordance with the normal unemployment and sickness benefit provisions, whichever are appropriate. The cost of this proposal is estimated to be $0.7m for a full year and $0.1 m for 1974-75. As a general rule special benefit will be paid for one week. At the end of that time those quaUfied will transfer to unemployment benefit or if incapacitated for work to sickness but hopefuUy the vast majority will secure work within a short period of their release from gaol. I am hopeful that the prison authoriin each State will extend any help they can to my Department to enable the scheme to operate efficiently. I have instructed the Department to income contact the authorities on this matter. A new method of payment for pensions and simUar long term benefits is provided for in the Bill. The Government proposes to enable child endowment, double orphan's pension, handiwill capped child's allowance and age, invalid and wife's pension, widow's pension and supporting mother's benefit to be paid to the credit of savtaken ings accounts with permanent building societies. Initially only child endowment will be paid building society accounts but the other benefits will be paid in this manner as soon as the necessassessment ary administrative arrangements can be made. Date of Commencement The Bill provides for the new rates to comtest. mence from 1 May 1975 in the case of age, invalid and wife's pension and from 6 May 1975 for widow's pension and supporting mother's a benefit. Increases in the rates of unemployment, sickness and special benefits will operate in respect of benefit payments due on and after day of royal assent. The estimated cost of the proposals in this Bill is $106m in 1974-75 and $58 7m for a full year. I commend the Bill to House. Debate (on motion by Mr Chipp) adjourned. NA Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Lionel Bowen, and read afirsttime.",30
86,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REPATRIATION ACTS AMENDMENT," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This is a combined Bill which will authorise changes to the Repatriation Act and the Seaestimates men's War Pensions and Allowances Act. The come Bill provides for increases and other provements in repatriation benefits fore1975-76, shadowed in last year's Budget. It also authorises an increase in the war and defence widows' pension rate. At present, the means test does not apply service pensioners who are aged 75 years or over, and the Bill provides for abolition of the means test for those aged 70 years and over. This will go a long way towards the Government's ultimate objective of abolishing the means test for all vice pensioners aged 65 years or over. The cost this proposal will be $ 1.333m for the remainder of this financial year and $8.667m for a full financial year. In determining the amount of service pension payable where a person is still subject to the means test, it is necessary to take into account person's income. As most honourable members be aware, this Government's policy is that disability pensions, which are paid as compensation for service-related incapacity, should not be into account as income in the assessment of service pension. To that end, and as a first step, to the 1973 Budget provisions disregarded 25 per cent of disability pension for service pension purposes. This Bill provides that a further 25 per cent, bringing the total to 50 per cent, will be disregarded in assessing rates of service pension for those still subject to the means It is estimated that the cost of this relaxation of the means test will be $0.15 8m for the remainder of this financial year and $ 1.030m for full financial year. The Bill will extend service pension eligibility to veterans of Commonwealth countries other than Australia. In this context the 'Commonwealth countries' will include those countries, dominions and colonies that were, at the time of the relevant war or war-like operthe ations, part of the British Empire or members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. In order to qualify for service pension these veterans must have been resident in Australia for BILL 1975 at least 10 years, in the same way as applicants for age and invalid pensions under the Social Services Act. They will be required to have served outside their countries of enlistment or else Second Reading have qualified for the award of a campaign medal in respect of service against the enemy wars or war-like operations in which Australian forces were engaged. Although it is difficult to say just how many veterans will qualify under the new provisions, the best available are that some 9500 persons could beeligible immediately and, on that basis, the imcost for 1974-75 will be $1.158m and for $7.530m. Although not specifically provided for in this Bill, there will be increases in the rates of service pension and in the additional amounts payable to service pensioners with children. These will flow automatically from proService Pensions posals my colleague, the Minister for Social to Security (Mr Hayden), has already announced. Transitional Benefit for Aged Blind This Bill provides for cessation of the transitional benefit of $1.50 a week paid to aged serservice pensioners who are blind. As its name of implies, this was a benefit introduced for a temporary period to offset any loss which may have been suffered by such a person whose service pension became taxable in 1973. No service pensioners will suffer reductions in service pension as. a result of this provision, as the increase in the a maximum rate of service pension will more than offset the effect of this provision. Disability Pensions I shall now outline the specific increases proposed in the Bill. The rates of payment of the various pensions referred to are weekly amounts. Special Rates The special (TPI) rate pension is payable those veterans who, because of service-related incapacity, are totally and permanently incapaciis tated to such an extent as to be unable to earn more than a negligible percentage of a hving wage. This rate is also payable to the servicewith blinded, to certain double amputees, to certain sufferers of pulmonary tuberculosis, temporarily totally incapacitated because of service-related incapacity. About 18 600 will benefit from this proposal to increase the special rate by $4 to $68.10, at an estimated cost of $628,000 for the remainder of thisfinancialyear and $4.08m for a full financial year. The intermediate rate pension is paid to about 1900 veterans who, because of service-related incapacity, are able to work only part-time or intermittently. The Bill provides of this rate to be mcreased by $3.50 to $48.05. The cost of the proposal is estimated at $53,000 for the remainder of this financial year and $344,000 for a full financial year. General Rate About 190 000 veterans who suffer servicerelated incapacity receive general rate pension at percentages from 10 to 100. Veterans in this group are not prevented from engaging in employment because of their service-related incapacity, but their earning powers may be restricted. The Bill provides for the 100 per cent rate to be increased by $3 to $28. There will be proportionate increases for rates lower than 100 per cent. The cost of this proposal will be about $1.891m for the 1974-75 financial year and $ 12.291m for a full year. War and Defence Widows The war and defence widows' pension rate is payable where a veteran's death is related to his service or where he was receiving at the time of his death, or would have been entitled to receive, a special TPI rate disability pension. The Bill proposes an increase of $5 to $36 in this rate of pension. The cost of this proposal is estimated at $2.046m for this year and $ 13.296m for the next financial year. So, Mr Speaker, you will see from what I have said that this Government is proposing substantial improvements in the repatriation sector costing approximately $47.238m in a full year. In addition, a further $32.029m will be provided for increases in service pension flowing from amendments to the Social Service Act. It is proposed that the increased rates of existing pensions will to apply from 8 May 1975. Pensioners will receive the increases as soon as practicable after the Bill passed by both Houses of the Parliament. It is anticipated this will be pay-day 5 June 1975, on which date the new rates will be paid together arrears of the increases from 8 May 1975. It is my pleasure, Mr Speaker, to commend the Bill and to those to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Killen) adjourned. NA Assent to the following Bills reported: Sales Tax BUls (Nos 1 to 9) 1975.

GRANTS COMMISSION BILL 1975 Second Reading Debate resumed from 21 April on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time.",32
87,Mr THORBURN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Before the debate was adjourned last night I listened with interest to the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) when he discussed the 3 provisions of this fairly short Grants Commission Bill which seeks to mcrease the number of full time members of the Grants Commission, particularly in relation to the local government division, to establish a status for the existing Chairman, Mr Justice Else-Mitchell, and to incorporate some machinery changes in relation to the Remuneration Tribunals Act. During the course of the debate last night the honourable member for Lilley cast some doubt on the suitability of a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales taking up the position of chairman of the Grants Commission. Last evening in the gallery of this House there were some visitors who were senior officers of local government in New South Wales. I am quite sure that they would not have shared the concern of the honourable member for Lilley. It has been their experience to have appeared before this very eminent gentleman when he was on the bench of the New South Wales court which dealt with town planning matters. The honourable gentleman followed 2 other eminent people, namely, the Honourable Justice Sugerman and the Honourable Justice Hardie, onto the bench of this court. During the period that Mr Justice Else-Mitchell served on this court he excelled as a man who had a great knowledge of local government. He was on this court for many years. Not only was he on this court, but the Liberal Government in New South Wales saw fit to appoint him because of his depth of knowledge of local government as the principal royal commissioner on a royal commission which in 1967 looked into the problems of local government finance. Despite the concern of the honourable member for Lilley that an accountant should have been appointed to the Grants Commission, Mr Justice Else-Mitchell was chosen by the Liberal Government in New South Wales for this position on this royal commission to do what one might think an accountant ought to have been appointed to do. Of course, Mr Justice ElseMitchell excelled in this role, too. He presented a very famous report which, like most reports, determined what we already knew. It set out what ought to be done to overcome the problems, but it was never acted on by the New South Wales Government. This is similar to what happened to the Barnett report which was recently brought down in New South Wales. So the people from local government who were here last night would not have shared the concern of the honourable member for Lilley. Mr Justice Else-Mitchell is admirably suited to carry out the task to which he has been appointed. In fact, it would be very difficult to find any other person in Australia who is more suitable and capable than Mr Justice ElseMitchell to do the job. Last year, for the first time, the Grants Commission handed down to local government throughout Austraha its determination of what sort offinancelocal government ought to have to assist it in what it was doing. It is quite right that an additional member ought to be appointed to the Grants Commission because the task is a great one. There is the necessity for members of the Commission to travel around and interview all the councils. Recently, with a parhamentary committee, I was in Western Australia. One of the members of the Grants Commission had been around Western Austraha. I think we can appreciate the great task which in involved in members of the Commission talking to local governments. This is the first occassion on which any Austrahan Government has taken the step of seeing what are the problems of local governments and of arbitrating on what amount of money they should get to try to allow them to bring their communities up to a standard which is equal to that of the communities around about them and of other communities throughout Austraha. The council in which my electorate is situated thinks so much of the assistance which has been given to it by the Austrahan Government that the president of the council brought down a minute on 14 April last in which he told the council that it had already received $1,593,529. Out of that amount, $460,000 was a direct grant from the Grants Commission. The Commission is doing something for which local government has looked during all the years that I have been associated with it. Local government has always been encumbered by a shortage of money and has looked with envy to the States and, more appropriately, to the Australian Government which have had more money than local government to spend on the needs of the people. Nobody is more capable of knowing the needs of people and of their local community than local government, because it is the government which is close to the people. It is the government which knows what the problems are. This is the first Australian Government which has come forward and given to people in local government the tools to do what has been urgendy needed in communities throughout Austraha. One can imagine that this is something which will go on and on, because when one travels throughout a number of country areas one can appreciate the problems which face councils which might have only 2000 ratepayers in their areas. They have to provide the amenities which small groups of people-lik e large groups of people-nee d in order to be able to live in dignity and to pursue the hfe which we have come to expect in this great country of Australia. I do not want to take a great deal of time over this small Bill. I commend its 3 clauses to the House. There is no doubt that there is a necessity to recognise that if we are to appoint people of the calibre of Mr Justice Else-Mitchell to positions like this to carry out impartial and appropriate inquiries into the needs of local government we have to acknowledge their position in the community and establish them so that they hold the position they previously enjoyed. Any criticism of that aspect of the provisions can be very easily dispelled. I commend the Bill to the House. It is a very wonderful Bill that supplements one of the most progressive Bills ever brought into this House.",33
88,Mr HODGES,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The amendments proposed by this Bill are only of a minor nature, yet one in particular is in my view very important. The Opposition supports the amendments to the Grants Commission Act 1973. The Grants Commission was initially set up in 1933 and has been very important to the financially weaker States of South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland. Of course, this was the real reason for setting up the Commission in 1933. The standard States in those days were, and still are, New South Wales and Victoria. The Grants Commission Acts of 1933, 1951 and 1957 were repealed and replaced by the Grants Commission Act 1973. This new Act embraced all the functions of the old Act and in addition provided for assistance to the States for local government purposes. Financial assistance was provided on the basis that a local government body in one region was to function at a standard not appreciably below that of local government bodies in other regions, that a local government body in a region was to operate at a standard not appreciably below the standard of local government bodies in that or other regions and that an approved regional organisation was to function at a standard not appreciably below the standards of other regional organisations in other areas. I do not think there is any doubt that this was a major step forward for local government. It is not my purpose today to canvass the merits and demerits of the first year'sfindingsof the Commission although I take to task the honourable member for Cook (Mr Thorburn) who made great play of the fact that it was the first time that local authorities had received attention from the Grants Commission. We all agree with that and, as I said a little earlier, a major step forward. Some local authorities are mildly satisfied with the Grants Commission's findings and, of course, there are others which are totally dissatisfied. When the debate on this Bill was held on Wednesday, 16 April, the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) made a great point of saying how local authorities were happy with the Commission. I would agree that they are happy to receive funds but they are very unhappy at the uncertainty of whether they will receive funds, when they will receive them and how much they will receive. Mr Donald Cameron-They cannot plan and ahead.",35
89,Mr HODGES,ASSENT TO BILLS,"But at the moment, as the speakers honourable member for Griffith states, local government authorities cannot plan ahead. This is a very important point because forward planning is important tc local government. It is important to any level of government and one wonders at the complete lack of forward planning on the part of the Federal Government. Local authorities are faced with getting some grants, if they are lucky, from the Grants Commission and some money, if it is available in their area, under the Regional Employment and Development Scheme and through the unemployment relief schemes that are currently operating through State governments. We have area improvement schemes, national estate schemes, and grants are available through the Department of Tourism and Recreation. It is this fragmentation of funds that are coming from this Government which makes it extremely difficult for local government to operate efficiently. Local authorities have staff to employ and naturally want to get the most out of these funds. Of all the levels of government today local goverament is starved of adequate staff. I would venture to say that local government authorities are in the same position as the average housewife who runs to a budget which she cannot veer from to any great extent, unlike this Government which prints money whenever it seesfit.I venture to say that even a person on the dole feels more secure today than does local goverament when it comes to forward planning. At least he knows his money is coming, the exact amount he will receive and that no one will question it. There is great confusion in local government. As a member of local authorities for many years I have sat around the table with local authority representatives and have attended regional council meetings at which there were mainly the mayors of cities and chairmen of shires. I know it was the deep concern they have at not knowing where they are going. The proliferation of schemes and the fragmention of funds they are getting are causing them great concern. I suggest that this Government would do better by giving the funds to the States for onward transmission to local government. Clause 3 of the Bill provides for an amendment to section 8 of the Act and is, in my opinion, the most important amendment in the Bill. It provides for an additional member on the Commission. The present Act provides for a chairman a membership of not less than four and not more than six. This amendment will increase that membership to not more than seven. As previous have said, this increased workload on the 4 existing full time members that comprise the local government division of the Commission is extremely important. Those members have travelled extensively throughout Australia endeavouring to visit the majority of the 900 local authority areas. They have made inspections of cities and shires, checking in detail on facilities that are provided, noting the amenities and the deficiencies of the various local authority areas, assessing their financial situation and looking at the rates and charges that they levy. It is a difficult task for these members to familiarise themselves with the functions of local government, particularly as the services provided by local government vary from State to State. In some States we find that local authorities take a particular interest in social welfare programs; in other States they do not. In some States we find water supply and sewerage provided by local government and in other States it is provided by metropolitan boards. In some States there are State government subsidies for works and undertakings; in other States there are no subsidies. I want to pay a tribute to the sterling work and dedication of Commission members to date. As one who has sat in on a Commission hearing I know of the extremely difficult task they have in grasping the situation as it relates to every local authority. When the Local Government Grants Bill was debated here on 14 November last year I made the point that the Grants Commission's report referred to the fact that the Grants Commission had to resort to broad judgment and that this broad judgment exercised by the Commission had resulted, in my opinion, from 2 things-firstly , from the lack of information from the States and local authorities because that was the first year that the Grants Commission had had hearings in relation to local government and, secondly, the shortage of time. I believe that the extra member that this Bill provides for will be of great advantage to the present members. Naturally the members of the Commission have to sharpen their approach, and that is the way they would want it. In turn this makes the representatives and executive officers of local authorities who appear before the Commission sharpen up. In recent times the hearings have been in held in Brisbane. It came to my notice that Brisbane's experienced, dictatorial Lord Mayor, Alderman Clem Jones, met his Waterloo at the hearings. He was given the rounds of the kitchen by a couple of the members of the Commission who are very able and very knowledgeable about the local government scene. Mr Corbett-He was beaten by the honourable member for Griffith.",35
90,Mr HODGES,ASSENT TO BILLS,"As the honourable member for Maranoa said, he was the fellow to whom the honourable member for Griffith gave such a caning in the last federal election. There was no case of the Lord Mayor pulling the wool over the eyes of the members of the Commission. In view of the the fact that the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Jones, has announced his intention to retire after 14 years-this is the man whom the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) wanted so badly in Canberra in the 1974 federal elections-migh t I suggest that this dictator who has such vast experience in local government matters would be an excellent choice as the proposed new member of the Commission. He knows all the tricks of the trade and I am sure that he would be a valuable asset to the Commission. I am sure the ViceMayor and Mayor-Elect, Alderman Walsh, would be pleased to see him depart. I understand that Alderman Jones intends to step down as Lord Mayor in the middle of this year. If that is the case, I am sure that he could be enticed to resign from the back bench of the Brisbane City Council to pursue his labour of love serving local government on the Grants Commission. A number of local authorities were unable to be visited during the Grants Commission hearings this year. I believe an extra member of the Commission will not only lighten the load for the existing members of the Commission but also enable them to visit local government authorities more frequently. In my own electorate of Petrie I was able to make representations on behalf of the Caboolture Shire. As a result of those representations, the Grants Commission decided to alter its itinerary to include a visit to the Caboolture Shire. This situation where shires and cities are not visited is not good. They feel that they are being disadvantaged and are left off the scene. There is no doubt that the provision for an extra member of the Commission is well and truly justified. Clause 3 (b) of the Bill provides for a new subsection after section 8 (6) of the principal Act which provides for the chairman who, immediately before his appointment was a judge of the Federal Court or the Supreme Court of a State or Territory, to have the same rank, designation, status and precedence as a judge of the Austrahan Capital Territory Supreme Court. I believe it is only fitting that this be done in this instance to accommodate Mr Justice ElseMitchell and in future other judges. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill.",36
91,Mr CLAYTON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"There seems to be some confusion within the community concerning the Grants Commission. Many people seem to think that the Grants Commission was brought into existence by the Whitlam Government. In fact it was formed and has been in existence since 1933. Since that time grants totalling many millions of dollars have been provided to State governments, but it was only in 1973 that for the first time the Austrahan Government asked the Grants Commission to recommend grants to local government. These grants were designed to reduce inequalities between local governing bodies in the provision of ordinary services. The Commission brought down its first report last August and the Government implemented its proposals without amendment in the spring session of the Parhament as is the custom with Grants Commission recommendations. The grants are being made to the States for payment to local governing bodies to suplocal plement their general revenues so that they can staying. provide a standard of service comparable with that of neighbouring councils. I emphasise the point that the grants are made through the States. A number of speakers on the opposite side of the chamber have claimed that the grants should be made to the States and that is what happening. These grants are not meant to be a substitute for revenues raised by estabhshed methods such as rates and service charges, and they will not replace normal State government assistance. No conditions are being attached to the spending of the money granted. Local ing government bodies have welcomed this nothat strings provision. Initially some local governside ment bodies were understandably suspicious cause of their experience with previous govern to ments ignoring their needs. Some councils refused to submit proposals last year, such was their paranoia about central control of their activities. Now that the first series of grants been made and the councils can see that the present Government is one which carries out its promises, unlike our Liberal-Country Party prework decessors, they are far more willing to co-operate in this exercise. The Grants Commission administers each specific worksgrant very fairly. The Government has asked the Commission to recommendfinancialamounts to balance requirements of all local authorities. It is A obvious that in some years some councils will rerelation ceive more assistance than others but any suggesI tion of political bias on the part of the members of the Commission is a reflection on the integrity of those persons and a charge ment would totally reject. Many councils are faced with severefinancialproblems in providSpeaker; ing municipal services of a proper standard. These grants will help enormously in reducing hardships. The Grants Commission rehes on the co-operation of councils. Councils are being asked to provide comprehensive, up-to-date financial and statistical information to the Commission, and the Commission has used this information as the basis of its assessments. The members of the Commission have not only been conducting pubhc hearings to take this sort of evidence, but they have also been making direct inspections of many areas. This is necessary since some areas have peculiar and specific requirements. For example, councils in seaside and other recreational areas need to provide services not only to the ratepayers but also to many thousands of day visitors, vocational recreationalists, caravaners and so on. These visitors may come from many miles away but they still need the facilities which are provided by the government authorities where they are The money for these facilities cannot always be raised by estabhshed methods, and the Austrahan Government is seeking to bridge the gap. If all the money had to be raised by established is methods, we would see many councils following the example of the Phillip Island council in Victoria. Plullip Island has a tiny population of about 1500 voters but it pays the highest rates in the State. These high rates enable visitors only to view penguins and watch car races. I am not tryto decry these activities but I am pointing out these are primarily activities for visitors out the municipality. Local government authoribeties do put money from the Grants Commission good use. The House may be interested in just a few of the activities to which some of the municipalities in my own area have put some of their money. In 1974 the city of Mordialloc has received $105,000. Of this amount, $18,000 was spent on foreshore regeneration, which is an expensive and on-going but very necessary form of in a recreational area; $19,000 was spent on footpath reconstruction; a further $12,000 is being used to improve other reserves in the municipality; another $4,000 is to be used on",36
92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Order! number of points of order have been taken into the ambit of the discussion on this Bill. think the honourable member is getting away from the Bill, which is pretty narrow. It is confined to the appointment of a further member of which the Govern the Commission.",37
93,Mr CLAYTON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Very well, Mr Deputy I will omit what I was about to say in that respect. Anyone who looks at the way in which municipalities have allocated their grant money will see that this money has been well spent. But here we are looking at the need for an extra commissioner, and that is the section of the Bill that I wish to consider. As I have said, for commissioners to carry out their job to the fullest extent they require not only to conduct public hearings, where the relevant officers from the councils concerned can present their cases, but also to make site inspections in order to acquaint themselves with the problems in particular areas. When it is remembered that there are some 900 local government authorities in Austraha, it will be realised that this creates a very large amount of work. Earher this year the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Snedden), who was then the Leader of the Opposition, was uncommonly generous in saying that the Liberal Party, if it were elected to office, would give SlOOm to local government over a 3-year period. I think it is symptomatic of his poltiical ineptness that he apparently was not aware that the Labor Government gave $56m to local government in one year, without any strings attached. The fact that this Government is seeking to amend the Act to increase the number of commissioners to carry out the work in the local government division of the Commission is evidence of the Labor Party's continuing commitment to the upgrading of local government in Austraha so that local government can carry out its functions in a meaningful way and provide genuine services to the community. I wonder whether the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) will advocate, as did his prede. cessor, cutting back on Commonwealth funds to local government in order to facUitate his much vaunted proposals for increases in expenditure on defence. I assure the House that this is not the intention of the Labor Party, as is evidenced by the introduction of this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.",37
94,Mr LUSHER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The legislation that is being considered by the House is not complex and, as indicated by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson), it has the general support of the Opposition. An amendment will be moved in the Committee stage and that amendment will have my support. It has been pointed out by previous speakers that the concept of a grants commission goes back some 40 years and that over that period the Grants Commission has served a very valuable purpose in applying funds to certain States to ensure that those States did not operate at standards much below the standards that could be achieved in the more wealthy States. I think that has been a very valuable contribution made by this Commission to hfe in Australia. Last year the Government decided to extend the role of the Commission to the area of local government. the This was a departure from previous practice and it has met with differing reactions. In the report of the Grants Commission last year, an amount of $56m was recommended for distribution to nearly all of the 900 local government bodies in Australia. Some councUs did not receive any money; but, by and large, money went to most of these organisations. The point that interests me in relation to the Grants Commission is this: Is this the right method of going about local government financing? A situation exists in Australia today where $56m has been allocated in the current financial year by the Federal Government for distribution to local government organisations under section 96 of the Constitution. It is an ad hoc payment of money and it is something which is not guaranteed in future years. In local goverament areas significant problems are occurring. Savage reductions are being made in the amounts of income avaUable to local organisations, particularly shires, which are virtually dependent on allocations of road construction funds for their operations. If those aUocations are cut, then the shires face serious difficulties in maintaining their work forces and in maintaining the standards in their areas. SimUar problems arise in municipal councUs. There have been reductions of moneys allocated from various sources and these moneys have been replaced by ad hoc payments. We have the Grants Commission in thefirstinstance, and under the generous hand of the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) the Regional Employment Development scheme has blossomed and is providing vast amounts of money to local government, also in questionable circumstances. The Federal Government also has introduced the area improvement program. A part of my electorate is covered by a pilot scheme under that program. Similarly, the Riverina region is a pilot area for the Australian Assistance Plan, and parts of my electorate are involved in that proposal. The point I wish to raise in this debate is that these ad hoc payments which are being made to councils are making it impossible for them to plan. There is no guarantee of any continuity. A proposal is put forward and it is either accepted or not accepted. The resulting payment to councils may be made this month, but from then on no money may be received. In my view, local government is becoming an indirect arm of the Federal Government. Under section 96 of the Constitution, the Federal Government is using local government as an agent in the implementation of certain Federal programs. I think it is fair to say that local government is being used to a large extent in this area. The uncertainty which faces councils on the question of where their funds are coming from is serious. I do not think we can allow to continue indefinitely a situation in which the pressure that is apphed to councils as elected bodies to keep rates down can be offset by funds coming from sources which are other than assured and definite. The situation is now arising in certain local government areas in which councils are deferring programs or projects in the hope that under the RED scheme or some other program a grant might be approved which will save those councils expending their own funds and allow them to provide a facility that might be needed in the town at no cost to the areas themselves. This is another example of the way in which local government bodies have had their whole system of operations fragmented and to a large extent overturned.",38
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Order! matter The honourable member for Hume is doing mission exactly the same thing as did the previous lation speaker in the debate in that he is wandering away from the subject matter of the Bill, which relates to the appointment of an additional time member of the Grants Commission, the funds. maintenance of his status and the machinery measures that flow from that. if honourable members who are speaking to the Bill would direct their remarks to the provisions of the Bill.",39
96,Mr LUSHER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy fromCommission Speaker. There is no doubt in my mind that, in the the absence of guaranteed finance government authorities, the Grants Commission not allowed a great deal ofthings is in fact something for which we are to be ful. I support the provision contained in this or the Government. The time scale Commission legislation for the appointment of an additional member to the Commission in order to make the work load of the Commission somewhat more even, and to enable it to undertake the massive task of interviewing the 900-odd local governcouncils. ment bodies throughout Australia and finding out exactly what are their needs. I raised the point earher that I do not consider this method to be necessarily the right method doing so. It is in relation to that aspect that I been speaking. I am concerned about the growagain ing dependence of local government on the Fedentitlement eral Government. The Grants Commission will be perhaps seeking to expand that. There is no doubt that the aim of the Government is to pointed regionalise areas of local administration States. What concerns me is that a governmentany government-is likely at some stage to withdraw its support for local government through the Grants Commission, through the RED scheme and through other schemes and to reallocate those funds on a regional basis. We are building up a system in which local government is becoming totally dependent",39
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,Order! If the honourable member for Hume continues to speak along those lines I will ask him to resume his seat. He is talking about the way in which the Grants Commission is functioning or intends to function. The Bill clearly does not go to that point. It relates to the appointment of an additional member of the Commission. I repeat that that is the subject matter of the Bill and I should be pleased if the honourable member would direct his remarks to that end.,39
98,Mr LUSHER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I respect your views. The fact of the is that the additional member of the Comwho is to be appointed under this legiswill, I beheve, ease the task imposed upon the Commission of determining what payments should be made. It is my view that all councils fullhave a valid claim for the provision of some It is the task of the members of the Commission to assess exactly what is the position in I would be pleased that respect. I do not beheve that we should continue to tolerate the situation that exists in my electorate in which 4 shires are getting absolutely no funds the Grants Commission. The members ofdark last year. were operating largely in the They had a brief from the for local Government to do certain but they were thankthem. That is no reflection upon the which time into do simply was not sufficient. The members of the Commission who have been appointed under the legislation that we are now amending were charged with the task of allocating certain funds among the They had to take short cuts. They had to make broad brush assessments of what was the position facing local government in different areas. It is my view that the appointment of an of additional member to the Commission will assist have in assuring that those short cuts are not taken and that ways are found of justifying the of all local government bodies to some Federal Government assistance while we are operating under this system which, as I have out earher, I do not necessarily agree is in the therightsystem. Having said that, I beheve that the members of the Commission have a responsibility to recognise that all local government bodies are faced with severe nnanciai problems and that the Commission cannot isolate some and say that they will be supported and leave the others out of it. I hope that the appointment of an additional member to the Commission will enable the Commission to treat the councils in a manner which they would regard as being fair and equitable. In the absence of a better method I support this legislation, but I do think that consideration should be given to the provision of a direct share of the tax revenue to local government, which would guarantee a continuation of local government in the 3-tier system of government as we know it in Austraha today. If such a direct share of tax revenue were provided I tliink that it would also remove local government from the area of budgetary strictures because if there is pressure upon a government to maintain its expenditure in other areas it could well be that the grants to local government under the Grants Commission Act and under section 96 of the Constitution would be the ones to suffer. The time that has been allotted to me under arrangement that has been made has almost expired. In conclusion I make the point that the whole question of local government finance should be looked at in the system that operates at the moment. I do not necessarily agree that the reference of inquiries to the Grants Commission is the correct way of handling the problem. There has certainly to be a realisation that there must be better staffing and more members of the Grants Commission while we are operating under the Grants Commission structure, and that a lot of thought should be given to ways of guaranteeing the financial security and the ability of local councils to plan and to get involved in longer range programs rather than councils having to rely on piecemeal handouts from the Government under a multitude of different programs.",39
99,Mr MORRIS,ASSENT TO BILLS,"It is rather ironic to Usten to the comments of the honour The able member for Hume (Mr Lusher) in relation to thefinancialneeds of local government when one considers that the main person concerned in the Bill before the House was the chairman of the royal commission appointed by the New South Wales Government in 1966 to inquire into the financial problems of local government in New South Wales, and the State leader of the Party which the honourable member for Hume is member is the Minister responsible in that Government for local government needs. The New South Wales Government has done very little to adopt the recommendations of the royal commission in 1966. The honourable member's reference to the deUberations of the Grants Commission as being uncertain, and to the uncertainty of local government revenue, is something I cannot understand. I will have to be gracious and attribute that to the honourable member's lack of knowledge of local government financing in New South Wales because the deliberations of the Grants Commission and the timing of its report are ideal for councils in New South Wales in that the reports of the Grants Commission are brought down in about July or August each year. Last year the announcements were made in September. The local government councils in New South Wales budget on a calendar year so they prepare their budget estimates in September, October and November.. The timing of the Grants Commission's report therefore, is ideal insofar as the councils in New South Wales are concerned. I do not know what is the position in the other States, but the councils in New South Wales do have that advantage.",40
100,Mr LUSHER,ASSENT TO BILLS,But they do not know whether an they are going to get any money next year. That is the whole point.,40
101,Mr MORRIS,ASSENT TO BILLS,For your information,40
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,Order! Will the honourable member for Shortland direct his remarks to the Chair?,40
103,Mr MORRIS,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Any councU preparing its budget for the ensuing calendar year knows from the report by about August or September what it is going to get in the following calendar year. I feel that 3 months notice even before the draft estimates are prepared by a councU of its budget is ample time. The purpose of the Grants Commission Bill 1975, as has been remarked upon by other speakers, is to amend the Grants Commission Act 1973 in 3 respects. The Act is to be amended, firstly, to enable the appointment of an additional full time member of the Commission. need for this has arisen from the increased work load upon the Commission, particularly in relation to local government hearings, and the necessity to carry out inspections in conjunction with the hearings. It is to be amended, secondly, to enable a chairman who immediately before his appointment was a judge of a Federal or State court to have the same designation, rank, of status and precedence as a judge of the a Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court. Thirdly, it is to be amended to incorporate the machinery changes consequent on the existence of the Remuneration Tribunals Act of 1973-74. The Australian Government and the Australian Labor Party are committed to the uplifting of the status of local government in this nation, and the expanded role of the Grants Commission constitutes a major part of our policy of recognising and alleviating the financial difficulties facing local government. It needs to be emphasised that the Grants Commission's operations are only part of the broad program of nnanciai assistance being made available by the Australian Government to local government. The importance that we attach to the role of local government in our society is real answer to the charges of centralism levied against us by our opponents. Under a variety programs we have provided local government with the funds to undertake a range of activities previously inadequately carried out or totally neglected. We deliberately have made, and shall make, local government a vehicle for our legisreflect lation dealing with aged persons homes and tels, sheltered employment, handicapped chilwide dren, meals on wheels, home care and nursing, government. nursing homes, homeless men and women. In addition, substantial financial assistance is being given under the Regional Employment Developthroughout ment Scheme. These are all activities which candays not be regulated closely from the national State capitals and are best planned and implemented by local government working with local community groups. They justify assistance from the nation's finances but not an increase council rates. I was especially pleased last October when announcement was made that Mr Justice Elseform Mitchell, who had been a judge of the Land and Valuation Court of New South Wales since 1962, had accepted appointment as the Chairman of the Grants Commission for the ensuing 5 years. Mr Justice Else-Mitchell is a man with a deep understanding of, and a long experience in, field of local government. He was Chairman of the Royal Commission into the Wales Land Valuation Rating System in 1965.1 referred earlier to the repon of that Commission in 1966 which has become a reference work in local government circles in New South Wales. is regrettable that successive New South governments have chosen not to implement most of the recommendations made by the Comneeds mission in 1965.1 would like to pay tribute to Whalan, a former Town Clerk of the Kuringai Commission, Municipal Council in New South Wales, who conducted last year's hearings in New South Wales, and also to Mr Sheehan, a Novocastrian and a senior lecturer in economics at Newcastle University prior to his appointment as a full-time member of the Commission in March 1974. Considering that appointments to the expanded Grants Commission were not finalised until 1973 and that the last of the full-time members did not take up duty until March 1974, it was indeed an achievement for the Commission to bring forward its recommendations on local government in time for the current Budget and for the actual payments to be made to councils in December of last year. The task that the Commission faced was a formidable one. The quality and reliability of data available from applicant a councils varied and, in instances, simply was not available. Because of the lack of a precise system of of measuring and evaluating the fiscal needs of local councils at the time-on e has to bear in mind that there are 900 councils ranging in area from less than 1000 square miles to 100 000 square miles-the recommendations to a degree the broad judgment of the members of the hosCommission, bearing in mind that they had a experience and understanding of local Because of the complexity of establishing equalisation grants for local governing bodies Austraha and because it is still early for the Commission's activities in respect of and local government, the methods of assessing grants naturally will need to evolve over a number of years. In this respect, the Commission is providing full opportunity for local governin ment representatives and those of State and Australian Government departments to put their views to the Commission. The task of equalisthe ation which the Commission is required to perunder its legislation requires it to recommend grants that will enable councils to function at a standard not appreciably below the standards of other councils. In other words, this scheme is designed to enable councils to provide, by reasonable effort, community services of a the standard comparable with those enjoyed by New South communities elsewhere. The grants, therefore, are intended as a supplement to current revenue or as a 'topping up' grant, as distinct from grants made available for It specific purposes, such as under the area Wales improvement program of the Department of Urban and Regional Development. I think it to be emphasised that no strings are Mr attached to the recommendations of the Grants but it is not intended that the grants should be used to decrease rates or to postpone reasonable rate increases. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has made this quite clear, particularly in his speech to the Australian Council of Local Government Associations at Alice Springs in November of last year, on which occasion he said: I emphasise that the Australian Government accepted the Grants Commission recommendations that the grants are made without condidons on the manner in which they are spent by the receiving authority. I also emphasise that the new funds should in no way mally raised by councils by long established means such as rates and charges for services nor replace assistance normally provided by State governments. The Commission, by taking into account the taxable capacity of an applicant council, would discover instances where councils were avoiding the levying of a reasonable rate. It is essential to this scheme that local government bodies use grants provided in a responsible manner and in accordance with the purposes of the scheme as outlined by the Grants Commission Act of 1973. I was disappointed to notice in September of last year that some outgoing councils in New South Wales, as soon as they learned of the amounts that they were to receive from the Australian Government and well in advance of the enabling legislation, proceeded to apportion the expected funds to specific projects which could have been more wisely financed out of long term loan funds. The reason for this procedure was that the New South Wales local government elections were to be held a few weeks later, on 21 September 1974. In some cases the decisions were taken at the last meeting of the outgoing councU and, whilst decisions can be changed by incoming councils, we all know how difficult it is to reverse financial commitments once made. I believe that councils that can be seen to be financing long term assets out of an equalisation grant or a supplement to current revenue when such long term assets ought to be financed out of long term loan funds, could find it quite difficult on a later occasion to convince the Grants Commission that the council was in need of a supplement to current revenue. This use of loan funds by councils in their borrowing position was highlighted by the Chairman of the Commission, Mr Justice Else-Mitchell, during hearings at Cessnock, when considering applications from the Hunter region just a few weeks ago. The grants that were recommended in the Commission's report have been criticised by some people on the basis that some areas received a grant and some areas received less than other areas. The criticism that has been directed, particularly in respect of rural bodies, is that they may have received less than the metropolitan bodies. But it needs to be pointed out that an examination of the recommendations concerning grants from the Commission last year will show that, in per capita terms, the grants for rural councils were far larger than for urban or metropoUtan councils. For example, in New South Wales, for metropolitan councils in Category 1 the average grants per capita were $2.36; for the larger provincial towns and cities in Category 3.1 the average grants per capita be a substitute for revenue norwere $6.82; and for sparsely populated shires in Category 6 the average grants per capita were $9.61. So consideration of that information shows that there is no case for putting forward the argument that rural areas and rural councils were distinguished against by the Commission. The other matter raised in the earlier part of the debate related to the suggestion that the expanded duties being carried out by the Grants Commission in respect of local government are duties that could well be carried out by State local government grants commissions which exist in some States, particularly New South Wales. In answer to that proposition I indicate that if councils are to be developed and given access to revenue on a national basis, under a proper equalisation scheme, there is only one way that can be done, and that is by looking at the local government scene-it s needs, deficiencies and disabilities-o n a national basis. Since 1933 the Grants Commission has a record of performance as far as States' needs are concerned, and every government since that period, irrespective of political colour, has accepted the recommendations of the Grants Commission in respect of the States. At the same time, in answer to the argument that the States should perform these duties or that it is a deprivation of States' rights for the Grants Commission to perform these duties, it needs to be remembered also that State Ministers have the right to approach the Grants Commission-thei r approaches are welcomed by the Commission-in respect of any submission or application that has been made by a local government unit in their State. The Grants Commission presently is conducting its second round of regional hearings with regard to local government appUcations for untied financial assistance. I understand that the hearings are almost completed. We will look forward to the Commission's report being made avaUable in about mid-July of this year. I commend the Bill to the House.",40
104,Mr CADMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"This Bill seeks to assist the operation of the Grants Commission and in so doing to make more efficient its application to the task of assisting local government. I was interested to note the comments of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) in regard to the way in which some local government bodies used last year's aUocation when thefigureswere announced. I draw to his notice and the notice of the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) what happened following local government elections in New South Wales. Many Labor members of local government bodies were upended and many independent candidates were elected in their place. Perhaps the way in which local government is run is one of the most undesirable features of that tier of government. Year to year assistance instead of some long term program and some growth factor should be looked at by the Minister when considering the task of the Grants Commission. It is most important that the Grants Commission be an efficient body and be able to cover the required ground. I note that the Minister in his second reading speech referred to the physical burden imposed on members of the Commission and the heavy workload and considerable travel in which they are involved. I can appreciate that this may be so when they have such a large number of local government bodies to interview and assess. Last year the Grants Commission began its interviewing and examination of local councils in January, but it was some time before the money flowed. The money finally reached local government bodies in December or the following January. There is no factor which aUows for inflation and increased interest rates in this great lag of time. The new Bill, when it becomes an Act, will assist in this regard. The Grants Commission has been sitting for some time this year. I believe it began sitting in February and will make itsfindingsshortly. Announcements as to aUocations of funds wiU be made in perhaps July or a little later in the year. This is a lapse of 6 months- a period of time in which all costs can increase by 10 per cent and in which buUding costs can increase by almost double that amount. In fact we saw that occur last year, when local government bodies suddenly found that the amount of money they had budgeted for would not go as far as it should have. The Prime Minister (Mr Whidam), when introducing the Grants Commission Bill 1973, stated: the financial assistance to local governing bodies which flow from the Commission's recommendations will in no way be a substitute for the by long established methods such as rates and charges for services, nor will it replace assistance normally provided State Governments to local governing bodies in one way or another. We have heard other honourable members quote this section of the Prime Minister's speech, but they faUed to go on. The conclusion of that extract states: Rather, it will be in the nature of a 'topping-up' process of the financial resources of lesser endowed bodies to enable them, by reasonable revenue raising efforts on their part, to provide a standard of service to their communities that will be comparable with that enjoyed in communities elsewhere. The key words are 'by reasonable revenueraising efforts on their part'. The Grants Commission has almost assumed the role of a de facto rate setting body. I have known local government bodies which, in order to pander to the Grants Commission and gain assistance from it, have lifted their rates beyond a level which is necessary. This is a most unfortunate feature of the Grants Commission if it is to adopt a role of a pseudo rate setting organisation. I have to hand-n o doubt many other honourable members have also received a copy- a letter from region 7, Avon, under the letterhead of the Shire of Northam. I shaU read an extract from that letter which covers the area very adequately. It states: The present system has many failings-no t the least of which is its failure to recognise efficiency and local self help - in fact these attributes appear to be discouraged. I believe that that is so. I believe that pressure is appUed so heavUy to local government bodies which are efficient, which adopt a practice of self help and which are thoughtful in their appreciation of the needs of the people of their electorate, that they feel they must Uft their rates beyond a reasonable level. I will not go into detail because I know I am not permitted to divert from the Bill, but in my electorate a number of local government bodies have been caught in this bind. The appointment of an additional full time commissioner will be welcomed. It will assist in a speedy assessment of local government bodies in these times when wages, salaries and interest rates seem to be the key factors in their funding. These are the things on which they are standing or falling at the moment. The Grants Commission no doubt this year will hear a different story from the one it heard last year. I have attended many protest meetings organised by ratepayers who are most concerned about the will structure of local government. From their point of view they are putting great pressure on their revenues normally raised by them local government bodies. Headlines in Melby bourne newspapers recently stated that the shire of Orbost had closed down. The reason for shires being in such dire financial straits is the cost structure of their operations. The Grants Commission can provide nothing but a topping-up process. What it provides cannot be offset against rates. The honourable member for Shortland spoke of Mr Justice Else-Mitchell's royal commission. If he had read with some concern and in some detail the findings of the royal commission he would know that they contain a suggestion that something like a poll tax be apphed to assist local government. There are many difficulties in establishing a poll tax. The Federal Government assisting the activities of local government through the allocation of funds contributed by the taxpayer can almost be equated with the suggestion that a poll tax be imposed. It has been interesting to hsten to the debate. All Parties accept that there should be assistance through the Federal Government, but it is the manner in which it is provided that matters. Local government bodies are unable to plan ahead. They ask: 'Where will we be next year. We know that our interest rates have gone up from IVi per cent to 1016 per cent'. Some of them are paying more than 10& per cent. That is not an increase of 3 per cent; it is an increase of 33 W per cent. Salaries also have risen by about 37 per cent this year.",42
105,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I Bills, think the honourable member for Mitchell is digressing a little and is going outside the subject matter of the Bill.",44
106,Mr CADMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy employees. Speaker. I am guided by your ruling. I will come back to the Bill and comment on the amendment which will be moved and which will receive the support of the Opposition. The amendment is Commission. one in which I trust the Minister also will see some value. I feel that the de facto rate setting attributes of the Grants Commission are among works the most serious aspects of its operation. In this country we have seen rates increase very markedly in the last 12 months from a minimum has increase of 20 per cent to an increase of per cent in one year. There have been many protests. The Federal Government has raised its tax collections by 100 per cent in 2 years but there have been no protests. I believe that there should have been. The sooner people equate the problems of local government with the ability of the Federal Government to open its coffers to the huge additional funds that are flowing in there, and to dispense them to local government with a growth factor, the better off the ratepayer and local government will be.",44
107,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"in replyHonourable members will recall that my second reading speech contained only 3 paragraphs, but it has led to an enormous debate on a number of wide ranging subjects, most of which are not witliin the ambit of the Bill. Let it be put on record that the Austrahan Labor Party Government wants to help local government by enabling it to be a party to the Loan Council. The Opposition and all the Liberal and Australian Country Party Premiers oppose that proposition. Until that facility is given to local government it will be limited in its planning. The Bill we are debating is the Grants Commission Bill. The Grants Commission is doing a very fine job. It has much work to do. Honourable members must recognise that the principle of the Grants Commission is equalisation. Bearing in mind the fact that there will always be councils that will meet the standard, unfortunately they will be deemed to be ones that cannot possibly qualify for a grant. The same thing occurs in the States. New South Wales and Victoria do not receive any grants because they are the standard. I know that that causes all the trouble. On the last occasion, every council-in the sense of belonging to a region-participate d in moneys available. The moneys will be available again this year but they come through the Supply and until they are finally dealt with here and in the Senate obviously that money cannot be allocated. It was also suggested that local government is starved of the right standard of If one looks at the standards and the wages paid in local government one will find that they are well above those of the Pubhc Service. I welcome the praise that has been given to the It deserves all the credit it can get. It does not deserve any criticism because the job it faces is a real task. The Grants Commission in a sectional field in the sense that it deals only with some of the needs of local government. Until a pohcy is adopted that local government a much wider role to play it will still have the up to 65 hmitations of the Grants Commission. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses 1 and 2-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 3. Section 8 of the Principal Act is amended(a) by omitting from sub-secuon (1) the word 'six' and substituting the word 'seven'; and (b) by inserting after sub-section (6) the following subsection:'(6A) If the Chairman was, immediately before his appointment, a Judge of a Federal Court or of the Supreme Court of a State same designation, rank, status and precedence as a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory.'.",44
108,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,ASSENT TO BILLS," I move: In paragraph (b) omit 'designation'. I want the Committee to understand that the position moves this amendment as a matter of judge. principle. We believe it is desirable not to have conflicting approaches as to what is a judicial body, what is a commission or what is a which has executive functions and responsibiliindependent ties. We are aware that this Government and influence; indeed future governments will be setting up a number of commissions and committees. We be would hke it to be known- I beheve that the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) already knows this from me-that our action is not in any way to be taken personally against incumbent. However, it is our view that judge is appointed to be the chairman of this Commission, whilst we are quite happy that he should have the rank, status and precedence of a judge, we do not beheve it is correct that he should have the designation. So the amendment is designed to omit the word 'designation'. It is simply a matter of principle-one , I am sure, that adopted. the Opposition will be following consistently in matters such as this now and when we are in government ourselves.",45
109,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The Government opposes the amendment. The Opposition says that this is a matter of principle. I make the point that the question of designation applies where the chairman, immediately before his Dr Patterson: appointment, was a judge of either a federal court or a supreme court. The Government does not see any distinction as to whether the chairman happened to be a judge before his appointhave ment. In this particular case the Government accepts that the amendment is not aimed at Mr Justice Else-Mitchell, nor should it be because is a most quaUfied person both as a judge and an investigator of local government needs reports, and now as a very worthy chairman the Grants Commission. I want to mention briefly that at times the Commission must have judicial expertise to evaluate a position. That was envisaged when the legislation was before the House of Representatives in 1933. It was then asked by interjection: Will there not be difficulty in arriving at a common policy because of the differing circumstances of the States? The answer was that there would be difficulty but that there would be a commission. It was said or Territory, he shall have the that the commission would be a sort of semijudicial body and everything would depend upon its personnel. In other words, there had to impartiality. So one sees, right through the whole theme of the Grants Commission in the past the question ofjudicial and semi-judicial impartiality, and non affiliation. No one could Ophave better quaUfications for that role than a It was said in the course of that debate that it was desired to make the commission, as near as body possible, a judicial body which would be of Parliament and political that if the commission is exercising advisory rather than judicial powers its work is to regarded mainly-bu t not exclusively-as judicial in character and method. The Government sees no reason why the incumbent should not be entided to hold the designation of a judge. Acthe cordingly, for the reasons mentioned, the where a Government rejects the amendment.

PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY BILL 1975 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 March on motion by That the Bill be now read a second time.",45
110,Dr PATTERSON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, may I the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would hke to sughe gest that it may suit the convenience of the House as to have a general debate covering this Bill, the and Pig Slaughter Levy Collection Bill, the Pig of Industry Research Bill and the Pig Meat Promotion Bill as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the BUls at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 4 BUls to be discussed in this debate.",45
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 4 measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be foUowed.",45
112,Mr SINCLAIR,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Any legislation which seeks to enhance the financing of industry research and promotion, and thus to enhance the quahty of an industry and the benefits to the producer and to the consumer, is obviously legislation which wiU receive the support of the Opposition parties. However, I do not think we should be misled into thinking that all that is contained in this package of legislation is good. As with so many other goodies that the Government offers, in this case it is not prepared to come out open-handed and negotiate in a way which enables everybody's interests to be protected adequately. The seeming generosity in this area is being magnanimous at the growers' expense. Certainly legislation is being introduced which wiU help pig producers promote their product a little better. It is true that they also will be able to extend a litde intofieldsof research which the commercial pig producers believe are necessaiy and desirable. But the pig producers need to recognise that the Government is not contributing one cent towards this objective. What it is doing is collecting the pig growers' money. The Government will administer that money and then very generously spend that part of it that is not spent on the administration of the scheme in trying to help the causes for which the funds were collected in thefirstplace. However, it is true, as the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) stated in his second reading speech, that the Australian Commercial Pig Producers Federation has moved that these measures be taken. The initiative came from that Federation. There is no denying that as a result of that the commercial pig producers at least are aware of the implications of the legislation as it comes before the Parhament. But I believe that it is unfortunate that a practice which existed for so long when we were in government-that of a government being prepared to go into partnership with an industry and to help the growers both to their advantage and to the consumers' advantage-shoul d not now be followed. The package of legislation covers the Pig Slaughter Levy CoUection Bill, the Pig Slaughter Levy Bill, the Pig Meat Promotion BUT and the Pig Industry Research Bill. It is necessary that there be 4 pieces of legislation simply because of the way in which each of the different areas is affected constitutionally and because of the way the purposes of the overall legislation are effected within the separate pieces of legislation. Before I talk about the BUls in detail and say something about my reservations in 2 particular areas, I would like to talk just briefly about the state of the pig industry. Too few of us in this House who are primary producers are operating as profitably as pig growers and sugar producers are. Yet the position is not quite as simple as it would seem. There are some primary producers, including the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony), who had enough foresight to realise that in agriculture it is no use just operating on a scale which involves the acquisition and maintenance of a few sows and keeping them in sties down behind the cowyard. Rather, it is necessary that they be handled in a highly scientific fashion. The dimension of the pig industry probably has changed as dramatically as that of any other primary industry for that reason. All those who have moved into operating scientific piggeries know of the extreme intricacies of the arrangements that are necessary for the handling of pigs, such as the processing of feed and the attention to hygiene. They know the degree to which the genetic selection of individual pigs is the determinant of success. The whole nature of a scientific piggery is such that the old catch-as-catch-can, haphazard breeding methods have been replaced completely. I think that all those who are involved in operating intensive piggeries deserve to be compUmented on the way in which they have turned a haphazard farming method into an extremely scientific one. It might be said that as aresultof that the famUy farmer is being prejudiced. I do not see that to be so. Although it is true that the capital investment in intensive piggeries is high, it is equally true that the size of a unit of production does not need to be large to operate on the principles that pertain to a scientific piggery. Of course, there is one real complication that faces most people in the pig industry at the moment. That arises from the very significant increases in feed grain costs over recent years. Whereas 18 months ago a farmei could purchase off-grade wheat at 75c to 80c a bushel at the farmyard gate, now he is lucky to be able to buy off-grade wheat at $ 1.50 to $1.60 a bushel. It is equally true that all the other input costs have risen significantly. Again, it is true that in a scientific piggery it is not possible just to turn the pigs out on to the range to feed. Nutritional balance has to be taken into consideration. That nutritional balance affects the colour and the quaUty of the meat. It determines the degree of acceptabUity of the finished product. Of course, the increased prices of all these inputs have reduced substantially the profit margins of the intensive piggeries. Theriskof the venture probably is not adequately covered by the net pronts. Therefore, although it would seem that pronts are generaUy high for those engaged in the pig industry, this is as much a matter of good farm management in that industry as it is in any other industry in which the profits are satisfactory to cover the investment and particularly satisfactory to cover the increasing costs that face producers. There is no doubt, therefore, that the position in the pig industry is not as buoyant at present as it was. Of course, there is another dimension to the pig industry. It is one that has concerned me in the past, both in Opposition and in government. refer to the degree to which profitability in pig industry is affected by the current prices vailing for red meats. The whole of the meat industry involves several dimensions. They include beef, mutton and lamb through to poulpig try meats and pig meats and the various protein alternatives, synthetic and otherwise, right through to fish foods. AU are patterned accordGovernment, ing to the housewife's requirements, the dietary needs of her family and her assessments of the nutritional balance that the family needs, but fundamentally according to her ability to pay for the products. One of the problems at the moment is that costs are rising in the pig industry. the high capital cost of the maintenance of an intensive piggery being as it is, with cattle prices down and with lamb and mutton prices low, the prices prevailing for pigs are not necessarily satisfactory as they once were. But, of course, pigs are sold essentially on the domestic market and not abroad. This means that there are different factors which have ensured that pig prices generally have been much higher than one may have expected, considering the competition between meats. It is also true that, because pigs that are produced now are produced in a more scientific fashion, generaUy there is a closer connection between the market place and the This, producer than there is in almost any other sector of the meat industry, with the sole course, of the broiler breeders As a result, the prices paid over the shop counter have a closer relationship in the minds of the producers to input and handling costs than in the case regard to the producers of beef, lamb and mutton. But because red meat prices are down there has been some effect on the pig industry. Perhaps the easiest way by which one can identify the that all is not completely buoyant in the industry is to point out that so many people gone out of pig production. Various statistics demonstrate the significant faU in the number of pigs in recent years. The variousfiguresfrom the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the Bureau of Statistics show that in the 12 months to 31 March last year there was a fairly significant drop of 23 per cent in the number of pigs and from then on there seems to have been a further decline in pig numbers. It is true that some of this decline has been due to the fact that people who were occasional pig fanners have gone out of the business; but there has been a significant increase in the number of pigs in intensive piggeries. But the nature of the industry is such that there has been a fairly significant overall reduction in the number of pigs in Australia, so we are I in a rather strange position in that pig numbers the are going down although pig prices seem to be prehigh. The fact that prices are high and numbers are down, of course, essentiaUy reflects the fact that costs in the industry are meaning that many farmers are not operating very profitably. In order to face these circumstances the at the request of the Australian Commercial Pig Producers' Federation, has agreed that additional money should be spent on research and promotion. It is on that aspect of the legislation that I wanted to talk for just a couple of minutes. From our point of view, we see With the whole concept of the legislation as being reasonably desirable. We are concerned, to echo the words of Mr D. Campbell, who is currently the President of the Australian Commercial Pig as Producers' Federation, to ensure that if Austrahan farmers are to be able to continue to improve their genetic material, if they are to match the products of the larger compames, there is-research into improving pig genetics. Equally it is not only in the field of superior strains of pigs determined by supporting carcase the measurement competitions, but also in the promotion of the product of that research, that a direct benefit can be brought back to the farmer. of course, means that there needs to be considerable attention to the promotion of pig meat exception, of in its different forms. The purpose of this particular legislation is to ensure that by an increase in the pig levy there in can be an increment both in the quantum of research and also in the amount of promotional activity that can be directed, both in Australia and outside Australia, towards selling or extolUng the virtues of consuming pig meats vis-a-vis others. Mr Campbell mentioned in a comment fact which was reported in the 'Australian' of 2 pig November 1973 that 18 000 tons of pig meat have had been sold to Japan during 1972. As with other meats, the Japanese market today is one of those areas in which we would very much like to be able to sell more than we are selling. I would hope that some of the funds being raised for promotion are spent not only in Austraha but also in the promotion of pig meat sales in other countries. With the prospect of a beef stabilisation scheme going before the Japanese Diet either today or tomorrow, it will be interesting to see just to what degree this particular promotion will complement or compete with the promotion which is in general undertaken by the Austrahan Meat Board with respect to other meats. It is of concern to me that there should be petition between different types of meat. Although as a Minister I felt on occasions that perhaps the pig producers might be more adequately represented outside the Meat Board, I believe that the Austrahan Government at this stage, particularly in terms of promotion abroad, needs to give serious rethinking to the whole question of where the Meat Board is going in relation to Australian total meat sales overseas. does seem to me that if some of the funds raised by means of this Bill are to be spent abroad, then there is merit in those funds being spent in conjunction with the Austrahan Meat Board and not in competition with it. Perhaps it would be wise for us to look at the Meat Board's operations, possibly to extend and expand them, to ensure that there is a comprehensive promotion because it would seem unnecessary, both from the point of view of dupUcation of administrative procedures and also from the point of view of the presentation of Australian based promotional material, that there should be any competition between our meats. Far more is to be gained by having a total promotion campaign, financed jointly, and advocating the different types of meat that can be provided from Australia. As I have mentioned, there have been quite major changes in the industry itself. One of problems in the nature of the introduction these scientific piggeries is the significance larger producers, as distinct from the smaller producers. That being so, perhaps it is on that premise alone that the Government has based interpretation of the increase in levy as being necessary expenditure by the pig grower rather than being a supplemental expenditure by the Government to ensure that there is a totally equate research and promotion endeavour. It is on that aspect of the legislation that I want speak in particular. The Government has, over recent years, changed the basis, in relation to primary industries, of its support for agriculture. We beheve that this legislation demonstrates yet again the degree to which the Government is think totaUy out of touch with the reaUties of what we see as the responsibiUty of government for industries earning expon income and for industries which are prepared to help themselves. We on this side of the House believe that there is a reason for the Government to make a constribution which would match that being made by the pig producers, both in the levy that is apphed for promotion purposes and in the levy that is appUed for research purposes. We see that the industry, having got together and having made a submission to the Minister, is in a position where com- it feels that it probably has to accept what the Government will give. Some of the discussions that I have had indicate that yet again the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt), instead of being prepared to enter into meaningful discussions, has almost put the industry into the position where it either takes the package which he presents to it or it gets nothing. If that is so- I am going only on hearsay, although there are It some indications ofit in this legislation- I believe that it is most deplorable. Indeed, we have seen this proved demonstrably in other instances, and I would be very loath to see that type of approach adopted uniformly in relation to agriculture. I beheve that agriculture is too imponant sociaUy and too important economically to this country to be by-passed by ministerial direction, instead of those who are directly involved being given an opportunity to express their own attitudes and to see whether the Government can help them instead of doing as it is doing in this legislation, which is providing the administrative framework within which the promotion and research will in fact be implemented. There are, of course, other dimensions of the Government's failure to provide money. The committee which has been constituted to administer the funds-ther e is a research committee the and a promotion committee-include s in its of membership Government representatives. From of our point of view, the Opposition sees an advantage in there being government representatives on the committee, but I personally find it dashed its hard to understand why there should be a a Government representative if the Government is not going to provide money to this committee. Indeed, the committee which is being constituted adto carry on promotion will be administering funds being provided from the industry. Yet apto parently it is to be so constituted that the Government will be in a position, through its exaU ercise of power on the committee, to direct to a degree where that money is to be spent. If the Government is going to take that son of stance, I it has a responsibiUty to contribute too. We on this side of the House are very tempted to move amendments to the legislation which would ensure that there would be no Government representative on the committee unless the Government was prepared to provide some funds. Of course you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is not within the capacity of the Opposition to move amendments which would enable the Government to provide money, and that does inhibit the stance that we can take. There are other parhamentary procedures that we might adopt, but after consideration we felt it better that we told the industry that, unhke this Government, we beheve the industry deserves to be helped; that when we are re-elected to office we, unlike the Government, will sympathetically consider propositions advanced by industry groups and ensure that if they enter into such proposals they will not be left alone to carry the burden of the responsibility of research and promotion. That is a stance we have undertaken in the past. Indeed, we have implemented it in relation to so many of the primary industries. It is only unfortunate for the commercial pig producers that they are entering into this legislation at a time when the Labor Government happens to be in control and when there is no sympathy for the point of view that I now advance. For that reason, we feel that the legislation has hmitations. We are disappointed that there will be Government involvement in the expenditure of money to which it does not contribute. We believe, nonetheless, that the purpose of the legislation is worthwhile. We would hope that in the implementation of that purpose there will be the maximum possible co-ordination with the Austrahan Meat Board. As a result we hope that the somewhat uncertain future which faces the pig industry at the moment might be made a httle more certain and, in particular, that the market opportunities might be developed a little more soundly. We also hope that the genetic research and the other areas of research on which the commercial pig producers beheve the money should be spent will continue to improve the overall quaUty of the Australian pig population.",46
113,Mr OKEEFE,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The House has agreed to deal with this legislation in a cognate debate which will cover the Pig Slaughter Levy Bill, the Pig Slaughter Levy Collection Bill, the Pig Industry Research Bill and the Pig Meat Promotion Bill. We have just heard from the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party and honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) a most interesting speech on this industry and on the effects that the Bills will have on the industry and on pig producers of this country. As he has said, it is true that at the present time the pig industry is one of our most viable rural industries. Therefore, we support any legislation which wiU improve and increase this industry. It is true, too, as has been pointed out by the honourable member, that under this legislation the farmers are contributing this levy and the Government is spending the farmers' money. It is interesting to note the latest figures regarding the pig mdustry which I have been able to obtain. They refer to the 1972-73 financial year. We find that the total levy collected in 1972-73 amounted to $227,000. It is also interesting to note how this money was disbursed. It was disbursed by making payments to the various States. They received $100,000 for investigation into the pig industry and the various facets of it. Universities throughout Australia which carry out research in the industry received $78,000. An amount of $2,000 was provided for studentships for research into the industry and miscellaneous expenditure totaUed $1,000. The Government paid half the promotionfigureand half the levy. It is also interesting to note the priorities under which these funds were aUocated. They were: Carcass grading, genetic improvement, marketing, disease investigation, nutrition and the disposal of effluent. I propose to look at the previous Acts to see what they provided and what changes are made in the legislation which we are debating this evening. The Pig Industry Research Committee was set up in 1971 under the Pig Industry Research Act to carry out scientific, technical or economic research into the pig industry. The Committee includes representatives from the Australian Commercial Pig Producers Federation, the Australian Agricultural Council and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and also a representative from a university and from the department. The functions of the Committee are to make recommendations to the Minister on the spending of moneys standing to the credit of the Pig Industry Research Trust Account out of which payments for research are made, and also on the rate of levy payable by pig owners on the slaughter of pigs at abattoirs. The expenses of the Committee are paid for out of the Trust Account. The Pig Slaughter Levy Act of 1971 provides for the payment by the owners of pigs slaughtered in abattoirs for human consumption of a levy of up to 10c a pig. The rate of levy is fixed by regulations after recommendations by the Research Committee and may not exceed the rate recommended, although it may be lower than that rate. The current rate, which was fixed by the previous administration, is 5c a pig. The Pig Slaughter Levy Collection Act of 1971 provides for the payment of levy to abattoir owners by pig owners. The abattoir owner may refuse to slaughter pigs unless the levy is paid. Payments to abattoir owners discharges the liability of the pig owner to Australia. Penalties are provided for non-payment of the levy by a specified time. All payments of the levy and penalties are payable into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. They are then paid into the Research Trust Account. In addition, an amount equal to one-half of the expenditure from the Trust Account is payable into the Research Trust Account for research and for the expenses of the Committee, provided that this is not greater than the amount paid as levy by the pig owners. The cost of research and of running the Committee is thus borne equally by the Australian Government and the pig industry. I cited that figure earlier. Turning to the Pig Meat Promotion Bill 1975, the new legislation is needed to set up a pig promotion advisory committee. The committee is to consist of 2 representatives of the Australian Commercial Pig Producers Federation, a departmental representative and one person chosen for his marketing experience. All members are to be appointed by the Minister for a 3-year term. They will then be eligible for re-appointment. The Federation is to nominate to the Minister the representatives of its body to be appointed. The chairman of the committee, as pointed out by the honourable member for New England, will be the departmental representative. Each member will be able to nominate a deputy who may attend meetings in his place. The chairman will preside at meetings. The majority vote will prevail. The chairman will have a deliberate vote and, if necessary, a casting vote. The functions of the Committee are to make recommendations to the Minister about the expenditure of funds for promotion and the amount of levy to be levied on pig owners to spent on promotional purposes. This is the most important function. It is most important that these members should have a great knowledge of the industry. There is to be a pig meat motion trust account, moneys from which are be expended on promotion and on the expenses of running that promotion committee. The proportion financing of the new trust account will be moneys paid by pig producers as a new component in the levy under the Pig Slaughter Act. No additional funds are to be provided the Australian Government. This is a great pity. Under this new legislation the funds are to provided entirely by the pig producers. The increased levy will be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the proportion relevant to promotion will be paid into the promotion trust account. The money to be spent on promotion must be expended with the approval of the Minister. A similar requirement exists under the Pig Industry Research Act 1971 in relation to moneys spent for the purposes of research. Agreements may be entered into by Australia with the approval of the Minister or of an authorised pubhc servant for the carrying out of promotion. A similar provision in the Pig Industry Research Act of 1971 provides for agreements for the carrying out of research. In the Pig Industry Research Act of 1971 the definition of 'research' is not wide enough to cover most aspects of promotion, but it does include the study and dissemination of information on markets or potential markets for pig meat. This is now covered by the definition of'promotion' in the Bill. No amendment has been made to the meat Pig Industry Research Act of 1971 to limit the definition of research to exclude any aspect more suitably treated as promotion. As no moneys may be expended out of either account without the permission of the Minister, it would seem that no duplication of effort is likely to arise. Clause 14 of the Pig Meat Promotion Bill provides that remuneration of a member is to be covered by a determination of the Remuneration Tribunal under the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973-74. Clause 14 is to have effect subject to that Act. Until a determination is in force remuneration is to be as prescribed. Clause 14(3) provides that this provision shall operate subject to the provisions of the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973-1974 thus covering possible disallowance of a determination by either House of the Parliament and ensuring that the existing rate of remuneration would continue in such an event. This may appear to be inconsistent with clause 6 (2) of the Bill which provides that, in be relation to remuneration for a member, clause 6(1), which deals with the payment of moneys out of the Promotion Trust Account, shall operate notwithstanding the Remuneration Triprobunals Act 1973-1974. Clause 6(2) is needed to because the Consohdated Revenue Fund is appropriated by clause 5 of the Bill to enable the of the levy relating to promotion to be from paid into the Promotion Trust Account. It would appear that without clause 6 (2) the Levy section in the Remuneration Tribunals Act by 1973-1974 which provides that salaries determined by the Tribunal are paid out of the Conbe solidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly, would also operate and there would be a double appropriation for remuneration of members. The other provisions of the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973-1974 do, however, apply as I have mentioned. The 3 other Bills are required mainly of consequential amendments involving the setting up of the Promotion Advisory Committee and the Promotion Trust Account. The Pig nature only. Slaughter Levy Bill 1975 amends the Pig Slaughter Levy Act 1971. The main amendment is to section 4 which fixes the rate of levy. Up July 1975 the old rate of 5c per pig is to continue. Thereafter the levy is to consist of 2 components. The first provides for up to 10c per pig for research purposes as recommended by the be Research Committee and fixed by regulation. The Minister in his second reading speech on Bill said that the operative rate of 5c per pig continue from 1 July 1975. The second comessential ponent provides for up to 5c per pig for proindustry motion purposes as recommended by the Promy motion Committee and fixed by regulation. As with the research component the Committee's recommendation may not be exceeded although a lower rate may be prescribed. The Minister in his second reading speech claimed that the ative rate fixed will be 5c per pig. As the Comout mittee has not yet been established it is impossible for any recommendation from the Committee to have been made fixing the promotion component of the levy at 5c, the maximum rate. Until a recommendation has been made no export statements about the operative rate can be made with certainty. The Bill also amends the deWales finition section of the Aa to provide for the fact that there are now 2 relevant committees, and makes a drafting amendment to section 8. In the Pig Slaughter Levy Collection Bill 1975 all the amendments are of a drafting nature to of pig meat. deal with the change of name of the relevant Department and the change from the expression 'the Commonwealth' to 'Australia'. I turn to the Pig Industry Research Bill 1975. The main amendment to the Pig Industry Research Act 1971 is to section 5 which provides for payments out of the ConsoUdated Revenue Fund Research Trust Account. Hitherto an amount equal to all payments of levy was paid into that account. Now, only the proportion of the levy paid for research is paid into that account, the remainder being paid into the Promotion Trust Account. This is to commence when the new arPrices rangements come into operation in 1 July 1975. Section 14 of the Act is re-enacted to provide remuneration of members is to continue at the existing rate but wiU be covered by a determinaIndeed, tion of the Remuneration Tribunal when made. Similar provisions in the Pig Meat Promotion Bill ensure that appropriations of these amounts are made under the Pig Industry Research Act, but in other respects the remuneration provisions are subject to the because Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973-1974. The other amendments are of a drafting The Opposition supports the BUls but, as mentioned before, we are concerned that the to 1 Government is not making any additional contribution under this legislation. All funds will come from the pig producers and I have no doubt that the pig producers in this country will disappointed. They are in a viable industry which is making a valuable contribution to meat the production in this country and to our export wiU markets. They know and we know that it is that research be carried out in this in thefieldsI mentioned previously in speech and particularly in regard to disease. Pigs are subject to contamination with various diseases and it is extremely important that we should not have any exotic diseases come into our country from overseas. So it is essential that operadequate funds be made avaUable for carrying extensive research at all levels in the industry. In my electorate of Paterson there are many piggeries and several of them have 3500 to 4000 breeding sows. They are providing meat for and for the home market. The pig industry in the north and north-west of New South fluctuates not only in respect of prices obtained for the end product but also by reason of the extent of the wheat harvest. We find that in the north and north-west if we have a bumper wheat harvest many wheat growers prefer to put a fair amount of their grain into the production WhUe the Opposition supports the BUls it is dissappointed that no contribution is being made to this levy by the Government. We feel that it is such an important industry and that it is so important to carry out research into the various fields I have mentioned that the Government into the should make some contribution.",49
114,Mr WHAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Just to put the record straight I want to quote from page 586 of the Hansard report of evidence given before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on where I asked the President of the Austrahan Commercial Pig Producers Federation, that Mr Douglas Campbell, this question: Your proposal to the Government for promotion levy. you propose a slaughter levy of from 2c to 5c per pig slaughtered. So you are suggesting that the industry itself it is should pay for this promotion? Mr Campbell replied: YesAn unqualified 'yes'. That is, he said that the industry should pay for this promotion. That proposal was enshrined in the Federation's submission to the Government. This set of Bills are a reflection of the industry's request for an increase in the slaughter levy to provide promotional funds. It is prepared to raise these funds from within the industry. I understand that administrative expenses that are incurred by reason of the fact that we have a government representative on the Promotion Committee will be met from the promotion fund and expenses that are incurred by departmental representatives in the normal course of their duties will be met by the Department. So administrative costs for this fund are not likely to be so large as to erode the capacity of the money to promote pig meat. We should note that this is a domestic market. The only export market for pig meat that we have enjoyed over the past few years has been Japan. It is a fluctuating market which sometimes takes a very large amount and sometimes an extremely small amount from Austraha to make up deficiencies in Japan's domestic industry. Japan has a very large and virile pig industry. So it is necessary to promote pork and other pig meat products mainly in the domestic market and this has been accepted by the pig industry and was the basis of its approach to the Government for this fund. It is an industry-sustained fund directed at promoting pig meat on the domestic market when the opportunities present themselves. There is unlikely to be a continuing demand on funds. I beheve that herein hes a very important distinction between research funds and promotion funds which this Government has used as a rational for its approach tofinancingagriculture in these 2 areas. Clearly research is an ongoing process. If we undertake a research program, it is necessary to continue it through. The pay-oft""from a particular research project will not necessarily come in the first year, and rarely will it do so. It is necessary to make sure that research funds are relatively stable and that there is an assured flow of funds. Therefore if we can finance research from Consohdated Revenue it is far better for all the interests concerned. It has been the policy of this Government to move the financing of research for industry funds into Consolidated Revenue and thefinancingof promotion into industry funds. That is the rationale behind that particular approach. That change in financing these 2 endeavours is the distinction between the present Government and the previous governments. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Sinclair) complained about this method. I simply emphasise that the rationale for this lies in the fact that research needs continuing funds, and by definition promotion needs fluctuating funds. In those years when large funds are collected from the industry, they can be stored away until the demand for promotion presents itself. That is all I should like to say on these 2 Bills, except that in responding to the industry's requirements, the Government has met, in every sense of the word, the request of the industry. In my view it has also re-inforced the position of the industry with regard to the domestic market. I commend the Bills to the House.",51
115,Mr MCVEI GH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Thes e 4 BiUs dealing with the pig industry are what might be termed a mixed brew. Some of the matters are of great substance to the people concerned and other matters are merely of a machinery nature. We of the Opposition are agreeable to the BiUs and in particular we support the concept of the Government of the day having meaningful discussions with the industry concerned. WhUst there are some areas in which there is room for debate as to whether the best decision possible has been made, at least it is pleasing to see that the ground rules with regard to the pig industry are stUl the same as the rules under the administration of the previous Liberal Country Party Government. It is absolutely essential that we maintain a forum and a rationale between the producers and the Government so that the Government, before it makes its decision, has before it the thinking of the associated industry. My remarks will be somewhat brief. The honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) waxed eloquently and logically on various matters. I wish to confine my remarks to 2 areas, the research area and the promotion area. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan) spoke a Uttle on the research sphere and once again I was somewhat disappointed with his rather theoretical approach. The practical producers in the pig mdustry when criticising the research programs say it is a fact of life that research has been channelled more into the short term to achieve noticeable results where people can see what has been achieved, rather than into the long term security of the industry and long term solutions to the economic and industry problems. There has been a tendency to look at short term research projects and a vital factor in the research program has been that not enough emphasis has been given to dissenimating the knowledge that has been gained. To me surely the whole basis of a good research program is that new initiatives should be discovered and new technologies should be conveyed to the people who are vitally associated with the industry. Knowledge is of"" very limited value if the people who are interested in it do not have access to it. It is to be hoped that the research section of these Bills is given added emphasis to look after the long term needs as well as the short-term needs of the industry and that this knowledge, when it is gained, is propagated. I turn now to the promotion aspect of the Bills which are the subject of this cognate debate. I endorse the remarks of previous speakers on this side of the House who expressed some cern that it appears that the Government, through its powers under clauses 9 and 13 of the Bill, has the right to dictate a pohcy of promoto tional thrusts because it has the right of appointwill ing a member to represent the Department of Agriculture, who shall be the Chairman with casting vote. The Government also has the right to appoint a person experienced in marketing. tJiink we can question with some authority and right on our side the composition tional body wherein the funds are provided solely by the industry and the government of the day can dictate how the money shall or shall not be spent by having the instrument of control in the composition of a board. I think it is a feasible proposition to advance the argument that where a particular industry provides the funds in to to, that industry should have the right to dominate the personnel of the promotional body. It is interesting too to observe why there should be a need for a pig meat promotional authority. I submit that when the dust settles the activities of this promotional body, in will settle down to a promotion for fresh pork. am rehably informed that at the present time most bacon companies spend upwards of $ 1 a pig on loss. promoting their own brands. This is a somewhat different procedure from what one would envisage in the promotion of red meats or poultry meats wherein they are promoted as such. In bacon industry the emphasis is not on the proNorthern motion of bacon itself; rather is it on the propose motion of the individual brand name. This has been quite effective. I have noticed in journeys over Australia that the product of KR Darling Downs in places such as Victoria and South domestic Austraha and even in Western AustraliaMr King-It must be good if it is sold Victoria.",52
116,Mr MCVEIGH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"As the honourable member said, it is a good product. It is interesting to note that the singular initiative of the co-operative bacon associations and other companies has had the end result of promoting their own brand. Obviously if companies are spending $1 a pig on promotional activities at present, the sum of 5c per pig will pale into insignificance. I submit that it is inevitable that the 5c a pig levy for promotion will result in the promotion of pork. Again one could question the great wisdom in promoting pork because the information given to me indicates that people are either pork eaters or they are not pork eaters; for example, certain 4 ethnic groups like to eat pork. The price factor and other considerations result in pork being eaten by the ordinary family. It is to be hoped conthat when the members of this promotional body, the majority of whom will be singularly non-representative of practical people, get down the hard practicalities of promoting pork they promote it on a continuing basis and will not try to use slogans such as 'Pork is cheaper than a meat' when meat is dear or 'You never buy a tough piece of pork'. I hope that the promotional I body will adopt some of the techniques used in private enterprise and will do the job of promotof any promoing the actual product. The Opposition supports these 4 Bills. We trust that they will help in some way to increase the impetus in meaningful research and that the promotion of pig meats will result in the saving of the pig industry. The problems of the pig industry were outlined by the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe), both of whom are deeply experienced in the problems of rural industry and are particularly responsive to the sensitive needs of an industry which has very on high cost inputs over which it has no control and effect it an industry in which the good husbandry I methods of the owner of the enterprise play a significant part in the end result of profit or",53
117,Dr PATTERSON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Dawson-Minister for the Northern Development and Minister for the Territory) (5.47)-in reply-The purof the Bills before the House is to amend the parent Acts in order to raisefinancefor the proall motion of a product which is becoming more and more important to Australia, not only on the front but also overseas. I was interested in the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Country Party, the honourable member for New in England (Mr Sinclair). He spoke about the need for promotion, but at the same time warned that care should be exercised to ensure that the product is not promoted at the expense of some other product. I certainly endorse those remarks, because I beheve that it will be the responsibility those in charge of the promotion of pig meats on the export market, and to some degree on the domestic market, to ensure that, whilst each industry wants to maximise its profit, our products are looked at in a total concept, which will be to Austraha's benefit. We are dealing with the promotion of meat, and there can be wasteful promotion if one product is promoted at the expense of another product. There can be a lot of dupUcation, particularly when only a certain amount of money is available to buy those products. I completely endorse the comment that those responsible for promotion should treat pig meats as being complementary to other meatsand perhaps even other products, depending on which country is involved-o r as being supplementary to other products that Austraha may be selling. I should imagine that that has been well thought out by the people who eventually wiU have the responsibiUty for the promotion of pig meats. Reference has been made to the Government's responsibUity to provide, say, matching grants for promotion; but I think I am right in saying that it has not been a general principle of previous governments or of this Government to match funds for promotion. In general, governments have tried to match funds for research, and basicaUy this is being done in the case of the pig mdustry. In regard to the matter of moneys for promotion being paid by the industry into a trust fund, the Government has taken the advice of the industry, which put forward a suggestion that a 5c levy be paid into a trust account; but of course the promotion committee will determine the actual levels of expenditure. That does not mean that the Government will not give close consideration to the possibUity of providing funds for promotion; but I believe that it has been made clear by the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Whan), in quoting the views of Mr Campbell, that the industry is prepared to look after its own promotion and to find its own funds for promotion, with the Government providing the administrative framework for the organisation of the promotion funds. Of course, the Government will contribute indirectly because officers of the Department of Agriculture will be engaged on the periphery of the promotion. As I understand it, their travelling expenses, etc., will be paid by the Government and will not come out of the fund. I should hke to thank honourable members for their remarks in support of the BUls. The pig industry has been something of a Cinderella for a of number of years. The honourable member for New England was right when he said that for some reason when people think of pig production they think of pigs wallowing in the mud, with a bit of swUl being tossed to them over the fence. People tliink of pig production as being a very dirty type of industry. This may have been the position for a number of years, particularly in regard to some of the dairy farms; but I think it can be said that there has been almost a revolution in pig production, particularly on a scientific basis. In fact, taking top class piggeries in Australia and around the world, it would be difficult to find a cleaner, more hygienic industry, particularly in regard to breeding. One can only congratulate the breeders on the effort they have made in ensuring that disease does not develop in the pig industry. I have not been to many piggeries, but at one to which I have been a visitor is required to take his shoes off or to saturate them in a chemical compound bath to ensure that he does not carry any disease, either indigenous or exotic, into the piggery. The disease would hardly be exotic, unless the visitor had come from overseas. I think that the pig industry can look forward to years of prosperity as the initiative is taken by the breeders of pigs and transmitted throughout the industry. There is no doubt that research must be endorsed. In every primary industry today too frequendy is research inclined to be downgraded. Research in the primary industries, particularly into livestock, is a constant battle against the hazards of efficient livestock production. The overcoming of a disease, the rate of survival of a particular breed, the weight for age, the growth rate, the response to different types of rations, and so on are all things that flow to a degree from fundamental and applied research. The Government is conscious of the pig industry's wishes in the fields of research and promotion and is moving ir accord with the wishes of the industry. Question resolved in the affirmative.

118,Mr SINCLAIR,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY COLLECTION," I shall be very brief in my remarks. I just want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the decisions taken by the Committee constituted under this Bill-the Pig Meat Promotion Advisory Committee-ar e subject to the approval of the Minister for Agriculture. I would suggest the Minister should take into account the fact BILL 1975 that the funds are being contributed by the pig Second Reading industry when he is taking the ultimate decisions. The making only of recommendations would seem to be not altogether in line with the responsibility of those who are contributing the money, particularly as one of the members of the Committee is to represent the Department of Agriculture and there are to be only 3 other members of the Committee. In those circumThird Reading stances I think that there is a peculiar obligation upon the Minister to ensure that the recommendations submitted to him are accepted in the normal course rather than debated and perhaps referred back to the Committee for reconsideration. Question resolved in the affirmative. Second Reading Bill read a third time.",55
119,Unknown,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY COLLECTION,Sitting suspended from 6.1 to 8 p.m. NA BILL 1975 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 April on motion by Mr Clyde Cameron: Third Reading That the Bill be now read a second ume.,55
120,Mr STREET,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The purpose of this Bill is to provide for reference and appeal procedures to the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in connection with industrial matters concerning pilots, Second Reading navigators and flight engineers who are now within the jurisdiction of the Flight Crew Officers Industrial Tribunal. By doing so, this Bill brings the flight crew officers into broadly the same position as other employees within the jurisdiction of the Commission. A secondary power is incorporated in the Bill. It was not referred to in the second reading speech made on behalf of the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) by the Minister for Services and PropThird Reading erty (Mr Daly), but it gives a power to the President of the Commission to assign a commissioner to act as the Tribunal. I would have thought that the Tribunal could have appointed the commissioner in such circumstances, but the Opposition does not intend to make an issue out of this provision. However, we would hke to hear from the Minister for Labor and Immigration just what the proposal means. Does it imply, for example, that the President can appoint a commissioner without first consulting the Tribunal who, after all, has special responsibility for that industrial relations in this area? The reference and appeal provisions are the most important part of the Bill, and these provisions will be accepted by the Opposition. Industrial relations concerning night crew omcers have had rather a chequered history. On one previous occasion some years ago the flight crew officers in fact withdrew from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. But I do not intend to go over the old ground which was mentioned briefly in the second reading speech given on behalf of the Minister for Labor and Immigration. Since the establishment of the Flight Crew Officers Tribunal in 1967, pilots, navigators and flight engineers have been in a special position by having a tribunal of their own which is not subject to all the same conditions as other organisations under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. What was then seen as a special position occupied by flight crew officers was outlined by the then Minister for Labor and National Service in his speech concerning the establishment of the Tribunal in 1967. Since then there have been industrial disputes, as probably there always will be. But disputes involving flight crew officers invariably get tremendous pubhcity, firstly, because flight crew oflicers are, by community standards, highly paid and, secondly, because any disruption to airline services creates great problems and often personal hardships for the travelling public. Despite the repeated allegations by the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) that only the rich use airlines, they have become an accepted mode of travel for a wide cross-section of the Austrahan pubhc and are now virtually an essential pubhc service. The Opposition considers, therefore, that in the circumstances and despite the unusual nature of their employment, flight crew officers should be treated in the same way and according to the same rules as other people within the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. However, a much wider matter of principle involved in the contents of this Bill. By its introduction the Government has, at long last, admitted-eve n if only by inference-the wisdom of having an independent tribunal industrial disputes. The Government, in fact, has acknowledged what we have always stressed, both in government and opposition, that there are 3 parties to every industrial dispute-labour management and the general public. By this Bill the Government again is saying what we have always said, that is, that where the public interest is affected by decisions coming from industrial disputes, the only institution available to protect the public interest, to exert some influence on public's behalf, is the Commission. The Opposition hopes the legislation is a sign that the Government is reappraising the role of the Commission. However, even this Bill contains some subtle but significant indications of the Government's well known double standards approach. For example, let us look at the reference and appeal provisions. In this legislation the only criterion for reference or appeal is importance in the pubhc interest. But on repeated occasions since coming to power this Government has tried to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act so that references and appeals can be made to a Full Bench only where the matter is considered to be of grave detriment to the public interest. The question I ask on behalf of the Opposition is why should everybody else under the Commission's jurisdiction have to be involved in a situation of grave detriment to the pubhc interest before a reference or appeal can be made, butflightcrew officer personnel should have to be involved only in a matter of importance to the public interest before a reference or appeal can be made. That is thefirstissue I raise. I stress the point that the Opposition does not oppose the wording of this Bill. It is consistent with what we have always insisted should be in the Act. But, as I mentioned a moment ago, the Government, once again, has demonstrated its double standards. The Minister's second reading speech stressed several times the intention that the flight crew officers should be put as nearly as possible in the same position as employees under the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's jurisdiction. But this Government wants to apply to flight crew oflicers standards which are different from those which the Government wants apphed to other employees under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It looks as though the Government will be very brave and strong, and a great defender of the public interest, when it is dealing with flight crew is officers, but will it demonstrate equal concern and determination to protect the pubhc interest when it is confronted byfinanciaUyand numericaUy powerful unions? We hope it will, and we to settle will support it if it does. As I said before, perhaps this legislation is a sign that the Government has reappraised the , role of the Commission. If the Government is genuine in the argument it puts forward in support of the reference and appeals provisions in this Bill, it must back the Commission against all union pressures, wherever those pressures come from-fro m the flight crew officers or anybody the else. The Government's new found concern for the public interest may soon be put to the test. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) and, I think, the Minister for Labor and Immigration have on numerous occasions said that excessive wage claims are the main cause of inflation and unemployment in this country. We are about to see another round of wage claims by major sections of Australian industry. If this Government really wants to protect the pubhc interest and, indeed, the interests of all employees, wherever they are employed, it must use all the considerable innuence that it possesses and all the resources at its disposal to argue the case of the need for wage restraint on every possible occasion it has a chance to do so. It will have support of the Opposition if it takes this responsible attitude. But I must admit that my confidence in the Government's intentions was shaken at question time today when the Minister for Labor and of Immigration indicated that if the wage indexaof tion submission was not accepted by the Concilibeen ation and Arbitration Commission, he saw httle cause to intervene in the metal trades case which will be considered subsequent to that decision. That was my understanding of what the Minister said.",55
121,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is right.,57
122,Mr STREET,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am glad to have the confirmation of the Minister that my interpretation of his reply during question time today was correct. But that is the only thing about which I am glad, because I think that by taking that attitude the Minister has indicated that the Government is about to abrogate its responsibilities in a vital economic field. By its actions in the wider cases before the Commission we will be able to judge whether this legislation really marks a new acceptance by the Government of its national responsibilities or whether it is just a bit of window-dressing, another example of double standards to be applied to a small section of the workforce when the really important economic decisions in matters affecting the nation as a whole will undoubtedly involve numerically large and financiaUy powerful unions. When those cases come up that will be the test of the Government's sincerity in putting forward this legislation. Debate (on motion by Mr Keith Johnson) adjourned. NA (PARLIAMENTARY DISQUALIFICATIONS) BILL 1975 Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Enderby and read afirsttime. Second Reading",57
123,Mr ENDERBY,COMMON INFORMERS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to modify the provision at present made by section 46 of the Constitution in relation to disquahfications of members and senators by virtue of sections 43,44 and 45 of the the Constitution. Section 46 provides- I am sure honourable members would be familiar with itthat, untU the Parliament otherwise provides, any person declared by the Constitution to be incapable of sitting as a senator or as a member of the House of Representatives shaU, for every day on which he so sits, be hable to pay the sum £100 to any person who sues for it in any court competent jurisdiction. This provision has not availed of since Federation by any common informer, the name usually given to applicants in suits of that kind. It has its origin in old United Kingdom legislation which has, so far as concerns recovery of penalties by common informers, been repealed in more recent times. For reasons which I whl explain later, the Government does not intend to repeal it in its entirety but to modify it. There is one matter that I think I should make absolutely clear to honourable members. This is that the provisions made by the Bill before the House will not affect the reference of any question affecting disqualification to the High Court by the House in relation to which a question arises in pursuance of section 203 of the Commost monwealth Electoral Act. It is my understanding that a matter concerning section 203 is before the Senate at this time. That procedure will still be open and will no doubt be followed in appropriate cases. It seems to the Government that the penalty provided by section 46 is archaic and out of proportion to the kinds of breaches of the disqualifying provisions that can occur in the complexities of modern life. I might mention that the penalty of f 100 per day provided for by the section is a fixed penalty, and not a maximum one, so that the total penalty that could be incurred by a member or senator could amount to enormous sums where the infringement does not become apparent untU years after it has occurred. The Government does not believe that a breach of the Constitution should be condoned, no matter how the breach occurred. The Bill now before the House will result, in the Government's view, in an equitable solution to this difficult question. The Bill provides for the recovery of a penalty of $200 in respect of a past breach at the suit of any person. It provides an adequate sanction in enabling a further $200 per day to be recovered for each day the member or senator sits when disqualified after he has been served with the originating process. Thus if a serious aUegation is made and proceedings issued, the member or senator wiU be atriskif he continues to sit. The power to make provision repeahng or modifying the common mformer provision in section 46 of the Constitution is provided by section 51 (xxxvi) of the Constitution in conjunction with the words 'Until the Parliament otherwise provides' in section 46 itself. This Bill is an cise of that power. It is not the mtention of the Government to encourage common informer proceedings. But it feels that this procedure should be kept open notwithstanding its disuse during the twentieth century in relation to the Australian Constitution. However, we do not tliink it should be a vehicle by which a private citizen should be put in a position to enrich himself unjustly. The purpose of the provision is to allow alleged disqualifications to be independently tested. There is already another procedure for this and in normal circumstances it would seem to the Government that the House itself would refer the question to the High Court and have the matter properly judiciaUy determined. One significant change that the Bill will make is that common informer proceedings, if brought, are to be brought in the High Court. The Bill will apply to disqualifications that have occurred before the date on which it becomes law as well as those that occur after that date. However, a provision has been included in clause 3 that a suit under the Bill is not to relate to any sitting of a person as a senator or member at a time earlier than 12 months before the day on which the suit is instituted. It does not appear to the Government to be in the public interest that the Bill should be used as the means of raising matters long since past. The Bill also makes it clear that in any common informer proceedings a senator or member at fault is not to be penalised more than once in respect of the same wrongful sitting. There is some judicial authority to the effect that that enactment would not be necessary, but there is doubt about it, and for greater caution the Government believes it is proper to insert this provision in the Bill. It will be seen that the Bill will thus preserve the common informer procedure provided for by the Constitution, while modifying its appUcation in a way that will be more in keeping with modern times and justice. The Houses' power to refer questions of disqualification to the High Court will remain unaffected. I commend the Bill to the House. Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith.",57
124,Mr ANTHONY,COMMON INFORMERS,"It is the wish of the Opposition that this Bill should have a speedy passage through the Parhament to protect the interests of members of Parliament who may be accused of techmcal breaches of the Constitution and therefore leave themselves liable to exeraction by a common informer. The procedure of law which aUows common informers to make a charge against a person is an age-old procedure. It is something of an anachronism in this day and age. In fact, most legislation has now excluded the common informer procedure, but our Constitution still provides in section 46 that a person can make a charge against a member of Parhament if he beheves the member ofParliament is in breach of the Constitution. Should that member be found to be violating the Constitution then he is hable to pay £100 or, in today's language, $200 per day for each day that he sits in Parliament. Yesterday I went to the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and brought this matter to his attention mainly because of the Senator Webster case, which has been given a good deal of publicity. There is a motion before the Senate to have this matter referred to the High Court and coupled with that motion is the possibUity of a judicial inquiry into possible technical breaches or unwitting breaches of the Constitution by members of Parliament. I felt it was quite wrong that, if there were to be such an investigation and in Senator Webster's case pubhc attention had been drawn to the possibUity of a breach, then a common informer could make a claim against Senator Webster with, if the court ruled against Senator Webster, consequences that could be quite ruinous for him. I think that that would be grossly unfair to any member of Parliament. Section 46 of the Constitution provides that until Parliament otherwise decides it shall remain. I commend the Government for its speedy action in this matter. I trust that this Bill will go through both Houses ofParliament immediately, before any smart alec or pimp can take the common informer action that the law allows him to take. The Government has said that in this legislation it will retain the common informer principle. On studying the Bill and listening to the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) I believe that there is a degree of wisdom in retaining it although I also beheve that the practice is reprehensible in this day and age. However, in the case of parliamentarians there may be some wisdom in retaining it. I will make further mention of that in a few minutes. I want to make it quite clear that neither I nor my Party wants to stand in the way of having these technical matters or possible breaches of the Constitution go to the court. Indeed, the joint statement by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and myself last week made it quite clear that we thought that Senator Webster's case should be referred to the High Court as quickly as possible to clear his good name. At the same time we made it quite clear that we were also concerned about the technical position of other members of Parhament who could be in breach of the Constitution and that we thought this matter ought to be cleared up as soon as possible. I do not tliink it would be out of place for me to remind the House that no one has suggested that there has been the shghtest impropriety on Senator Webster's part. I venture to say that if the letter of the sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution were to be followed we would possible have a very thin Parliament. Of course all those who were disqualified would be liable to a charge by a common informer. I suggest that the purpose of sections 44 45 of the Constitution is to guard against ary impropriety and against conflict of interest tween a member's private interest and his public duties as a member ofParliament. Since no one has suggested that these have occurred, I submit that it would be grossly unfair if Senator Webster were to be the only person to carry the burden of the processes of resolving this matter when appears that other people could also be in techniin cal breach of the constitution. I say there has been no suggestion of impropriety in any of the other apparent technical breaches sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution by other members of this Parhament. It is clear that we should clarify the whole question which has arisen as a result of Senator Webster's case. We need to know what kind of actions could represent breaches of the Constithe tution. We need to ascertain whether people other than Senator Webster have in fact breached or appear to have breached the Constiunder tution. Over the last week I have felt very strongly that Senator Webster has been bearing an unfair share of the burden in this matter. The action proposed in his case seems to be quite drastic unless a fuller examination is undertaken of the position of all members of Parhament. That examination can now be undertaken without fear and trepidation by members of Parhament who, because of circumstances of which they are not even aware, could be found to be in breach of the Constitution. Indeed, with the common informer provisions of section 46 of the Constitution it could be completely ruinous for a member ofParliament should he be charged and found to be in breach of the Constitution, even unwittingly so. This Bill allows for a charge to be brought by a common informer. But once a charge is made there is a heavy responsibility to see that the matter is clarified and disposed of as quickly as possible before the member can resume his place in Parhament. This can be done by resolution of the House or by the Court of Disputed Returns. Common informers are not very highly regarded by the courts. In a case in 1914 concerning a member of the British House of Commons who had dealings in bullion with the Government of India the judge felt obhged to award the common informer £13,000. However, the judge law as it is written in stated: The legislature has thought fit to appeal to the cupidity of individuals as a means of preventing ills which the action of authorities could not be depended upon to prevent. By these words thejudge meant that although he was reluctant to apply them, the provisions relatand ing to common informer proceedings are necessto protect the public interest against abuses beby members of Parhament or the Executive. In other words, there should be written into the law provision for a common informer to take action if need be against members of Parliament or against the Executive if they tried to smother or hide an issue. Probably this is the one example of it why the common informer clause should remain law, although the British Parhament has taken also that action to remove it completely. It may not always be possible for evidence of which has been suppressed by the Executive or by a member of Parhament to be discovered. In the light of these facts the common informer procedure plays an important role. This Bill does not attempt to abolish the common informer procedure, as I mentioned before. It recognises that common informer procedure is desirable in certain circumstances. I class these as rare circumstances. However, the law as it now stands sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution is far too wide. This Bill defines more clearly the penalties which common informers may be awarded. It does not allow the court to make the penalty retrospective for whatever period the member may have been in Parliament. What it does is provide a penalty of $200 from the time the charge is laid. Then if the member continues to sit in Parliament he is Uable to a penalty of $200 for each day he sits in Parliament There is a clause in the Bill which states that the penalty cannot be made retrospective for more than 12 months, so action has to be taken within the 12 months period. Under the Common Informers Act 1951 the British Parliament abolished common informer procedures for a wide range of statutes, some dating back to the sixteenth century. In the House of Commons DisquaUfication of Members Act 1957 the British Parliament aboUshed provisions relating to the disqualification of members who entered into contracts, agreements or commissions with the PubUc Service. The Constitution of Australia stUl contains that provision but the mother of ParUaments-the source of English law which we foUow-ha s now completely aboUshed the provisions whereby a member who enters into contracts or agreements with the PubUc Service is disqualified. I hope that this matter will be taken into account when the High Court judges this matter. Section 14 of the same Act also repealed previous Acts containing provisions relating to action by common informers against members of Parliament who entered into contracts with the PubUc Service. Furthermore, as May points out at page 217 of his book 'ParUamentary Practice', the British Parliament also has passed from time to time special Acts to indemnify parliamentarians against common informer procedures. I commend the Government for its immediate action in bringing forward this legislation to give reasonable and decent protection to members of Parliament who, without any impropriety, may find themselves in breach of the Constitution. I think it is only fitting and right that if there be a judicial inquiry this sort of action should be taken by the Parliament immediately. I hope that the Bill will have a speedy passage through the Parliament. The Opposition will give it all the support it can. I appreciate the prompt action of the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister on the recommendations that I made.",58
125,Mr RIORDAN,COMMON INFORMERS," I find myself in disagreement with some of the statements made by the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony). I think it ought to be clear when we are discussing this matter that it is as important-perhap s more important-for this Parliament to protect the pubUc interest as it is for it to protect the interests of its members. I think that is something that can easUy be overlooked in this situation. I do not regard a citizen who comes forward to uphold the Constitution and to require members of this Parliament to abide by the Constitution as being a smart alec or a pimp. Frankly, whUst the legal term 'Common informer' may still be appropriate, I do not think it is appropriate to use it as a derogatory term in respect of a person who insists that his parUamentary representative or parUamentary representatives of the Australian people adhere to the law which governs this Parliament I believe that this Bill should be supported. While it is true that it will protect members of Parliament against technical breaches or unwitting breaches of the Constitution, it also should be clear that it may well protect people who are guUty of quite dehberate oraches of the Constitutin. We in this Parhament have to be very astute in ensuring that what we do is not misunderstood. We have to be very astute- I congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) on this-in ensuring that we retain the provision for common informer proceedings to be taken because it is impossible, as we have seen elsewhere in the world, for misdeeds to be covered up for lengthy periods. We have seen in the United State of America, which has very many checks and balances and perhaps more pubhc participation in political affairs than we have in Australia, an instance in which it was possible for massive swindles and a massive scandal to be covered up for a considerable period.",60
126,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMON INFORMERS,Eve n the President.,60
127,Mr RIORDAN,COMMON INFORMERS,"As the Minister for Labor and Immigration said, it was even possible for the President and the Vice-President of the United States of America and members of the President's staff-peopl e who were in the sanctuis to ary, as it were, of American poltiical reputation-to be involved in this massive scandal. The other point I want to raise is this: A period of 12 months may be appropriate for retrospective action. Frankly, I would have some reservations about this. I do not know where that period came from, but obviously the Attorney-General finds it appropriate to be inserted in this Bill. UntU very recently public servants who would have knowledge of misdeeds by members of this Parliament were refused the right to speak out. They could not disclose impropriety or breaches of the Constitution by members of the Parliament, for fear of losing their reputations. I would be much more impressed if members of this Parhament had been equally concerned to protect their rights in this sort of situation. But they were not. Only recently have public servants been given this right. In those circumstances, 12 months might be an appropriate period, provided that this Parliament guarantees immunity to any officer or employee of the Austrahan Government who comes forward with an aUegation. I also hope that this Parhament will be concerned to ensure that a person who does take an action against a member of this House or a member of another place whl have protection in respect of costs. If that person has a prima facie case, I sincerely hope that there will be provision, which I do not see in this Bill, for that person's costs in that htigation to be met by the Crown.",60
128,Mr HOWARD,COMMON INFORMERS,"As the Leader of the Austrahan Country Party (Mr Anthony) has indicated, the Opposition supports the Common Informers (ParUamentary DisquaUfication) Bill. It will facUitate its speedy passage through this House. I do not wish to detain the House for long, but I think it is a pity that some of the notes that were introduced into the debate by the honourable member for PhUUp (Mr Riordan) were introduced. One would tliink that the honourable member for Phillip had not read the opening words of section 46 of the Constitution which state: UntU the Parliament otherwise providesThe language of section 46 of the Constitution invites the introduction of the Bill that the Government had introduced tonight. To which introduce into the debate references to Waterstances. gate activities and cover-ups is to make a most unfortunate intrusion into this debate. It was never intended that section 46 should be a perBUl manent feature of the Constitution. It certainly was intended, as the Leader of the Austrahan Country Party pointed out, that certain rules regarding qualification and disqualification should be permanent features. The common informer has become a very beast in our law today. He is all but gone under Anthony). United Kingdom legislation and, except perhaps in some of the statute law of the various States, he may also be gone from Austrahan law. WhUst the term may linger in some of those statutes, I think it is fair to ask why the procedure ought to be retained at all.",61
129,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMON INFORMERS,Why are you so frightas ened ofit?,61
130,Mr HOWARD,COMMON INFORMERS,"I think that the interjection tightening of the Minister for Labor and Immigration has absolutely nothing to do with this debate. If the Minister has anything concrete to say, he has plenty of opportunity to say it. I think that in the context of this debate the question can be asked legitimately whether the procedure should be preserved at all. It has gone in the United Kingdom. Indeed, not only has it gone in the United Kingdom but the provisions of old English statutes regarding agreements with the public service and the government also have gone from United Kingdom law. I think a case can be made out in this regard. Although I am in no way suggesting that now is the appropriate time to do it, I hope that at some future time a case can be made out for the complete removal of the common informer device. I hope also that at some time in the future the Government will give some consideration to the EngUsh analogy and to following the decision that was made by the British Parliament in 1957 when it was decided to write out of the Enghsh law those old statutory provisions which disqualified persons who had entered into contracts and agreements with the pubhc service from entering Parliament. This is not an easy issue for this Parliament, but I think it is something that has to be addressed honestly. I do not think the emotive introduction into the debate of terms such as Watergate and references to cover-ups will assist a calm presentation of the matter. This is the Government's legislation. I commend the Government for introducing it. I do not think it gives members ofParliament undue protection. I think it takes away a penalty the proportion of is not relevant to present day circumI tliink the legislauon follows the clear language of section 46 of the Constitution which invited some kind of amendment. I think it is a which, calmly and dispassionately, ought to be given a speedy passage through the House.",61
131,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMON INFORMERS, I would not haverisento take part in this debate but for the tone of the contribution made by the rare Leader of the Austrahan Country Party (Mr,61
132,Mr MCMAHON,COMMON INFORMERS,You started it.,61
133,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMON INFORMERS,"I did hot start it at aU. I reacted to a tone, which I thought was very unfortunate, in the speech of a person who I thought appeared to be a Uttle terrified of the law it now is, and who was absolutely relieved beyond all measure that there was going to be some up of therightof an ordinary citizen, a taxpayer, an elector, whom the right honourable member called a pimp because he dared to expose a crooked member of Parliament.",61
134,Mr MCMAHON,COMMON INFORMERS,"I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. I ask that the Minister be asked to withdraw that remark. No court of law has yet looked at this matter. No judicial authority has said that this man is crooked. It is a detestable statement and only the Minister would have made it. I ask that it be withdrawn.",62
135,Mr SPEAKER,COMMON INFORMERS,"Order! I do not think there is any way in which I can judge that the Minister was referring to any particular member of Parhament. I suggest to the Minister that I will not allow debate to be opened on a matter which is currently being debated in the Senate. I aUowed the Leader of the Country Party to refer to it briefly but I am not going to aUow a general debate on this matter, and I would suggest that the Minister stick to the Bill fairly closely.",62
136,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMON INFORMERS,"I was not referring to any particular member, Mr Speaker, I was saying that, as a general principle, if there is a crooked member of Parhament any member of the public ought to be given the right to expose him.",62
137,Mr ANTHONY,COMMON INFORMERS,"That is what I said in my speech, if you had listened.",62
138,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMON INFORMERS,Good. I am glad that you agree with it. That is what I said and that is what you objected to. The right honourable gendeman sought to denigrate a citizen of this country who sought to exercise his right to lay an information against a crooked member of Parhament.,62
139,Mr ANTHONY,COMMON INFORMERS,I did not.,62
140,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMON INFORMERS,"You did. The right honourable gendeman referred to him as a common informer or pimp. What the right honourable member was trying to do was to so denigrate, by nature of deiinition, any citizen of this country who might choose to lay an information against a crooked member ofParliament that his position before the High Court would be jeopardised or prejudiced by that fact alone. I say that it ill becomes this Parliament to aUow itself ever to be put into the position of saying that one of citizens is to be deprived of the right to lay an information. The right honourable gentleman quoted decisions of the House of Commons.",62
141,Mr HOWARD,COMMON INFORMERS,The Bill does not do this.,62
142,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMON INFORMERS,"I know, but the right honourable gendeman quoted with approval the decisions taken by the British House of Commons to take away the right of an ordinary citizen of Britain to lay an information against a crooked member of Parliament. I hope the day never comes when this Parhament will ever take away from its citizens the right to expose a member of Parliament who is guilty of corruption or guilty of aUowing his position in Parliament to benefit him personally. I have no more to say on this matter, except to make the brief comment that the penalty of $200 a day, that is now provided for and that the right honourable gentleman is complaining about, represents in terms of relativity to the salary of a arUamentarian in 1901 an amount equal to 5,000 a day. The right honourable gentleman is grizzling about somebody having to pay $200 a day. I think that the penalty is small enough, and I think that members of Parliament who are guilty of corruption or of allowing their position in Parliament to be used for their personal pecuniary advantage, ought not to be given any sympathy at all and should be called upon to pay the maximum penalty. Good luck to the Australian citizen who lays the information and can prove it.",62
143,Mr SPEAKER,COMMON INFORMERS,I caU the right honourable member for Lowe.,62
144,Mr ANTHONY,COMMON INFORMERS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",62
145,Mr SPEAKER,COMMON INFORMERS,Does the right honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,62
146,Mr ANTHONY,COMMON INFORMERS,"Yes. I just want to make it quite clear that as a matter of law I think the principle of common informer is reprehensible, but I pointed out quite clearly that this legislation, which is before the Parliament and the purpose of which is to enable the public to expose a member of Parliament, is appropriate to prevent Parliament or the Executive being able to smother the issue and I gave it my support.",62
147,Mr MCMAHON,COMMON INFORMERS,"Naturally enough, with some legal qualifications, but with not a great deal of qualification in the law, I have long been interested in the Constitution and, its amongst other things, in section 44.1 believe that when every person enters the Parliament he should be advised of that section and should be clearly informed of the disqualifications on his membership should he unfortunately, without knowledge or without real intent, commit a breach of the Constitution. I think that section 44 (v) establishes a necessary degree of integrity in connection with dealings with the Crown that is far above the level of commercial ethics required in any ordinary business transaction. I believe that members of Parhament should observe the highest standards, whether they hold an office of profit under the Crown, receive any pension payable other than as mentioned in the concluding placitum of section 44, or have any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in an agreement with the Pubhc Service of the Commonwealth. I agree with that and I have no doubts about it whatever. I want to make it clear immediately that in the case that has precipitated the action now being taken by the Government it is absolutely clear beyond doubt that the senator involved has not committed a breach of the ethical standards of trade or commerce and, in any other circumstances, would not be subject to any penalty",62
148,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMON INFORMERS,"Iriseon a point of order, Mr Speaker. Quite rightly you ruled a moment ago when I was speaking that you would not permit me to traverse the case now under discussion in the Senate, and you were quiterightin so ruling. This is not the place to deal with that matter. It is not now the place for the right honourable member for Lowe to canvass the pros and cons of the matter either.",63
149,Mr SPEAKER,COMMON INFORMERS,Order! I have to uphold the point of order which has been taken. I ask the right honourable gentleman not to make reference to the matter.,63
150,Mr MCMAHON,COMMON INFORMERS,"I will go no further than that. What I beheve should then happen in a case such as this is that the moment there is any suspicion and the House feels that that suspicion is probably justified, even though it is not convintution. ced on the evidence, the matter ought to go to the High Court for decision and ought to be left there until the High Court has made its decision and appropriate action has been taken on it. I do not beheve that anything should be done that could compromise the position of the High Court or create any suspicion that the Parliament itself has doubts about the matter until the High Court itself-the highest court, the highest judiciary, the land-ha s had an opportumty to express its views. I then turn to section 46 of the Constitution which states that until the Parliament otherwise provides, any person declared by the Constitution to be incapable of sitting as a senator a member of the House of Representatives shall, for every day on which he so sits, be hable to a certain penalty. I would not have touched that matter until the High Court had made its decision. To bring down a Bill such as this, which has the very odious title of the Common Informers (Parhamentary Disqualifications) Bill and which immediately creates doubts about a man who is likely to appear before the High Court so that it can determine whether he is disqualified from being a member of Parliament- I say this honestly and with very deep feelings- I beheve is improper and is against the interest of the person involved, I would not have been agreeable to its being introduced. I go just one stage further and say that I do not beheve in the payment of any sum to a common informer. I beheve that anyone who is a common informer can hardly be an appropriate type of person to be favoured by any legislation of the Parliament. If there is any evidence at all of a breach of the Constitution or of something that the Constitution forbids then, by all means, I believe it can be referred to the Senate or to the House of Representatives. Those Houses, in their wisdom are capable of understanding the matter and of looking at whether there is a prima facie case. If they beheve that there is a prima facie case the matter can go to the Court of Disputed Returns, which is the High Court. Having come into this matter at a late stagebefore I walked into the House I did not know that the Bill had been put down- I ask the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) whether he remembers the case relating to the first Commonwealth meat board-that was not its name. The question was raised in this House whether 2 members of this House who were given an opportunity to sign cheques for subsidies given under that meat Act had committed a breach of section 44 (v.) of the Commonwealth ConstiThe House, in its wisdom, decided the question. The case was argued for the Austrahan Labor Party by a Mr West who was then the honourable member for East Sydney- a somewhat pecuhar association. I am sorry that I have no notes on this matter. I am relying on my memory. At that time Sir Littleton Groom was the Attorney-General. Everyone who wishes to suggest what ought to be done and what procedures in ought to be followed should look at the comments made by Sir Littleton Groom when he held that no prima facie case was established in relation to the idea that those 2 men had committed a breach. Subsequently, in the first speech that he made from the other side of the House, one of the greatest lawyers of all time, Sir John or as Latham, also spoke against the motion moved by Mr West from East Sydney. I hke to remember that because it brings a sense ofridiculeinto the whole matter which is now before the House. It was then decided that a prima facie case had to be made out. No prima facie case was made out. Consequently the matter did not go to the jurisdiction of the High Court. I am prepared to say that we should do nothing in the interim period, because I do not beheve that the gentleman involved has committed any grievous offence; he has committed only a constitutional offence. I beheve we would find in a case like this that the High Court-particularl y the Chief Justice-woul d be anxious to have the matter heard. I would not be surprised if, in the course of making a decision in this case, certain obiter dicta were made by the Chief Justice or by other members of the High Court which would give to present members of this House and to future members of this House some guidance as to what they should do. But I would not do anything now. I would not give any assistance to a common informer or whatever name we care to give him. I would subsequently-onl y after the decision has been given-tr y to establish some sort of an inquiry. It should not be ajudicial inquiry because this is not a judicial matter. In all these cases this question has to be decided by the High Court. Nothing that we, or any administrative body, or a member of the judiciary might decide can affect the case going to the High Court if one or other of the Houses in its wisdom decides that the case should go to the High Court. I believe that we should be getting some guidlic ance. Every member ofParliament should have some guidance as to what he can or cannot do in order to prevent an infringement of section 44 the Constitution. I know I have the good fortune to be a lawyer. But how many other honourable members in the House would have known what this legislation was about or would even have heard of it? Therefore, to have a man punished, and to have this sort of odium created at same time, I think is wretched. I could not prove of the Bill. I could not vote with my Party it supported the Bill. I would have to abstain from voting if the matter were pushed to a vote action. in this House.",63
151,Mr ENDERBY,COMMON INFORMERS,"in reply-In closing the debate, I hope, because the matter has some degree of urgency, I say at the outset that the right honourwe able member for Lowe (Mr MCMahon) who has just sat down clearly has not read the Bill or, has, he has not understood it. The Bill certainly has the opposite effect to the one which the honourable member put forward. The Governunjustly ment was attracted to the idea of doing away with the common informer action altogether. It did not adopt that course for reasons which I shall try to give in a non-political way. May them in a hypothetical way to illustrate point? One can imagine a situation in which case arises, either in this House or in the other place, with different parties-no t only a 2-party system, but also a 3-party or a 4-party systemwhere a Government might take the view, trying to be non-political, that a charge has been made against a member and that the charge should be referred to the High Court pursuant to section 203 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. In doing that the Government is not expressing any view whether the man is guilty or not guilty but, rather, that the charges have been made, the facts have been put before the Parliament and the matter should be resolved by the highest tribunal in the land. In a hypothetical situation one can also imagine a combination of parties in Opposition, to which the charged person belonged, arguing amongst themselves and perhaps saying to themselves, if they had a majority in that House of the Parliament, that the matter should not go to the High Court. If the situation came about where 2 or more Opposition parties-this could not happen in this House-outnumbere d the Government and defeated its proposition to send the matter to the High Court for independent inquiry and report pursuant to section 203 of the Electoral Act, then from the point of view of the pubthere would appear to be something not very different from a conspiracy. It is this situation which the Government is anxious to avoid. If in a of House, say the Senate, a majority of the nonGovernment members-this could be any partyput their minds to a matter and defeated what was obviously a proper measure then the public would say: 'These silly poUticians are ganging up to protect one of their members'. They might use the stronger words. The Government took the view apthat there must be preserved an independent if right to challenge a person's right to sit in this House. That right is the common informer The common informer action is an emotive which is a pity. But it is an independent right which has had a long historical significance in our country and in the countries from which draw our traditions. At this stage the Government thought it better not to abolish the right if he altogether but to upgrade it or modernise it so that the citizen- I will use the emotive term and right call him a common informer-woul d not be enriched, he would not reap a windfall but, at the same time, in a proper case he could bring an action where he saw the poUticians not doing so. In that sense the common informer proI put cess is preserved by the Common Informers my (Parliamentary Disqualifications) Bill. The a Government believes it is a healthy measure to allow a citizen outside Parliament who is concerned with the way Parliament operates and with the basic question of whether a member of the House of Representatives or of the Senate is qualified and eligible to be investigated to take action if he thinks that the politicians in one of the 2 Houses have not done the right tiling by him. He should not be enriched. He should not benefit from it unjustly. But he should be entitled to put the matter to the test in the court. That is why the Government has introduced this measure. I think the Leader of the Austrahan Country Party (Mr Anthony) accepts the basic point. I think that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) appreciates the point as well. The Government brings this measure forward to give a degree of protection but, at the same time, to preserve what is pretty obviously a basicrightof all Austrahans. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third reading Leave granted for tliird reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Enderby) read a third time. NA BILL 1975 Second Reading Debate resumed.",64
152,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I shall not delay the House for long in respect of this Conciliation and Arbitration Bill as it appears there is no opposition to its provisions. But the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) raised some questions which deserve answering. I think there are one or two other aspects of the Bill which should be brought out. First of all the honourable member for Corangamite asked why the Government had double standards, why under this particular division of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act it had different standards for air crews from those it had for other persons. The Government obviously is attempting to have uniformity throughout the Conciliation and Arbitration Act the way it is rather than the way in which it would prefer the provisions to be. Frankly, I see nothing wrong and no room for criticism and nothing reprehensible in the Government's seeking to have uniformity. Mr Street- I did not contest that.",65
153,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member for what Coorangamite (Mr Street) does not contest that. The only thing that needs to be said about this that the Opposition's policy is somewhat inconsistent in that when it was in government it introduced a new method, new procedures, under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act for the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and introduced what has commonly been called the panel system where panels of arbitrators are estabhshed for the conciliation and resolution of industrial disputes. I believe that the provisions set in 1951 are not completely appropriate in the current circumstances. When the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) brings amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act into this Parliament they deserve better consideration and more sympathetic consideration than the Opposition has been prepared to give them, particularly in light of the experience gained by practitioners and others who particpate in the conciliation and arbitration procedure. After all, experience is a very great tutor. I can recall being vigorously opposed to the 1951 amendments to the Concihation and Arbitration Act which introduced the right of appeal from . decisions of Concihation Commissioners. I participated in trade union conferences and congresses of the Australian Council of Trade Unions which unanimously rejected those provisions and opposed them. However, I can well recall having been very pleased that the provision for appeal was in the Act and I am not too shy to say now that provisions which I opposed vigorously in 1951 I was very pleased to use in the middle 1960s with, I might add with due humihty, some success. There has been need for provisions for appeal. Some of those appeals have been successful and trade unions which vigorously opposed the introduction of appeals were subsequently pleased to use those provisions. So we should not be too hidebound in respect of provisions in the Concihation and Arbitration Act and we in this Parliament ought to be prepared to learn by our experience and from the experience of others. What this Bill does is very simple. It seeks to give the parties to arbitration proceedings under the Flight Crew Officers Industrial Tribunal the samerightof appeal and the samerightto seek a reference to the Full Bench as any other party to proceedings under the Concihation and Arbitration Act. That is to be commended. It is appropriate when this matter is being debated to refer specificaUy and briefly to industrial relations in the airUne industry. Anybody who understands has been occurring over recent years in the airline industry-and I can speak from personal is experience-know s that industrial relations have not been good. In fact they have been far from good, and a good deal of outside political interference has been engendered into the airline industry. That has come to be regarded as normal. I can go back to the time when Mr Leslie Bury was the Minister for Labour and National Seris vice and when he and others who administered that portfoho were heavily involved negotiations in the airline industry. One thing which is paramount is the integrity of the negotiations, and in this industry that has not always been apparent. Parties are not always satisfied that the offer from airline compames is a genuine offer and they are far from satisfied that when offer is made as a final settlement it is the final offer of the employers. Employee organisations of various kinds right across the industrial specrational trum have come to beheve, and have strong evimentahty dence to support the belief, that without a stopanomalous page of work or without a strike of some the proper, genuine offer will not be made. In this regard I put the Australian Government's airline, Trans-Australia Airlines, at the tree. In my view and from my experience, it has been reluctant to make a final offer in settlement of an industrial dispute until such time as there has been a stoppage or an imminent stoppage has been threatened. There have been obvious examples of negotiations taking place in strange places and of determinations of wage rates other conditions being made in very strange ways. This normal conduct of expecting a strike before a genuine offer for settlement is made breeds its own problems, and I hope that this amendment to the Act will do something to overside come that. However, the real difficulty is to have all the parties to airline industry disputes which occur from time to time prepared to accept and abide by decisions of the tribunal. This provision, which will now provide the capacity for appeal against wrong decisions and the capacity to seek a reference of particularly contentious matters to a Full Bench of the Arbitration Commission, may well have some effect. I believe that some decisions of TAA and Ansett Airlines of Austraha in recent times have been quite contrary to what the Government has been trying to achieve in a rational wages policy. I want to say here and now that I do not agree with the honourable member for Coorangamite or with those who lead his coalition when they say that the Government has been arguing for wage restraint. Frankly, I do not think that he or other members of this Parliament who advocate wage restraint as such appreciate the full implication of the term or really mean wage restraint in the way that trade unions accept it. A trade unionist understands wage restraint to mean that he will take less while profits continue to increase. In other words, he believes that to be asked to accept wage and salary restraint is to be asked to accept a reduction in real hving standards. That not the Government's policy and I do not believe it is the pohcy of the Opposition spokesman in directing on industrial relations. What the Government is asking for here, what the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has been asking for and what the Treasurer (Dr JF CAIRNS) has been asking for, is a rational wages policy an and I hope that employers in the airline industry will take note and will attempt to provide offers and settlements which are consistent with a wages pohcy rather than apply a 'fix-it' which causes distortions, disputes and situations between groups of workers duration and hence industrial disputation. Mr Street-That is exactly the principle we top of the want adopted across the board.",65
154,Mr RIORDAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I appreciate that. I merely ask that when honourable members opposite speak of wage restraint they take the time to spell it out a httle more clearly rather than adopt the media term or the shorthand phrase 'wage restraint' which is capable of being, and is, comand pletely misunderstood by trade unionists who understand it to mean something entirely different from what I assume the Opposition means and certainly something entirely different from what I and honourable members on this of the House mean. I am glad that there is perhaps some common ground in that regard. Let us look at what has happened in the 2 years between December 1972 and December 1974. Let us also look at thefiguresgiven by the Prime Minister in this Parhament just over a week ago. The consumer price index rose by 31.6 per cent; average weekly earnings rose by 46.8 per cent; male minimum award rates rose by 53 per cent; and female minimum award rates rose by 75 per cent. But having in mind those enormous increases in money wages, we then look to see the result in real terms. In real terms before tax, the worker is only 11.5 per cent better off for having gained an almost 47 per cent increase in his average weekly earnings. After tax, he is merely 7.3 per cent better off. This of course is not really achieving anything except economic difficulty. If we work with the trade union movement- I hope that the Opposition will do its best to assist in this regard-to work out a rational wages pohcy which will continue to improve the real living standards, the real wages of wage and salary earners. I beheve we could then start to get somewhere in respect of the factor of wages and salaries in the cost push inflation situation. The worker is no better off; he is only 7.3 per cent better off by having his wages increased by 46.8 per cent. So we have a cost increase of almost 6.5 times the value of the wage increase to the individual employee. I believe that this is a complicated industry. I do not want to take up the full time available to me to speak, but I wish to stress that the industry is complicated. There is provision in the Act for an organiswere ation to be deemed a declared organisation, that is, an unregistered organisation. In respect pilots, the Australian Federation of Airline could be brought within the provisions of the Act. Thus we have an organisation which is unwilling participant within the arbitration sysLeshe tem. Another umon-the Airline Pilots Guild of Australia-ha s sought and obtained registration. It comes within the system, but ative of its class; it has so few pilots as members that it cannot be said to be representative. I beto We heve that arbitration or conciliation procedures machinery are meaningless unless there is some prospect of as to the decisions being carried out. Arbitral decisions which are not accepted are not of much use to the community or to the parties to a particular industrial dispute. It is with a trust hope that these amendments will do something to assist in this regard that I speak in their support. I also hope that those who have the responsibility for negotiating as the employing authority in the industry will adopt a more responsible role and will be prepared to act with integrity when they make offers and seek to overcome the enormous difficulty which has been bred in this mdustry through irresponsible action by representatives of the employing authorities; that is to say, when the parties sit down at the negotiating table and somebody says, 'This is the final offer, this is the offer which we genuinely beheve to be reasonable', that can be accepted as an offer made with integrity. I am sad and sorry to say that that is not the position today. I hope that that is a position which can be rectified without much further delay.",66
155,Mr CADMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," In the researching this Bill I applied myselffirstof all the second reading speech of the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly). I shall pluck out two or three lines which I tliink the Minister at the table, the Minister for Labor and Immigranotice tion (Mr Clyde Cameron), would agree in some way epitomise the feehng of this proposal. The Minister for Services and Property said: The Government of the time was opposed, as is the present Government, to constituting special tribunals in the industrial field. However, there were very special circumstances to be dealt with. I think that members of this House and the pubhc at large appreciate the special nature of the industry with which we are deahng. Apart from reading the Minister's second reading speech, I feel I should in some way take the House back and put into context the imphcations of that speech. I wish to go back some time and refer to times of strikes and chaos prior to 1968. There court cases and appeals. On one occasion Sir Leshe Melville presided over a hearing for 84 to days to settle a dispute. In 1967 under the now Pilots Sir Leshe Bury, a form of compromise was achieved. I suggest that in looking at this whole an matter we look at what the then honourable Bury said at that stage, and see how effective the legislation which followed his speech has been when put into practice under present conit is unrepresentditions. He said: have tried in this Bill to make a constructive approach the solution of these. For the future there will be effective in producing sensible solutions where now at least pilots and navigators there is none. In the Qantas strike last year the public call was for arbitration. No machinery for arbitration was available; for the future there will be. I believe the Australian public has the conviction that cooperation and discussion should be the keynotes of the relationships between the airlines and theirflightcrews. I should that this conviction will not in future come under strain. I commend the Bill to the House.",67
156,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Now sit down on that note.,67
157,Mr CADMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Mr Minister, I find no relevance between the second reading speech and that of Sir Leshe Bury because to my mind the measures are quite different. How has this situation worked out? During 8 years Qantas Airways Ltd has had two minor stop-work meetings lasting 4 to 6 hours. The domestic airlines have had 3 disputes, but none of them was a major one. The most major dispute was increased to double the length of time that it should have lasted because of the interference by the Minister for Labor and Immigration and the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones). I beheve, if I do not misquote the Minister for Labor and Immigration, that he called the finding of tribunal chaired by Mr Justice Coldham a deto cision that was 'idiotic'. That is the extent of the influence of this Minister on industrial relations in the aircraft industry. But the same Minister, in the middle oflast year when it was brought to his that the Builders Labourers Federation was frightening people out of the High Court, took no action. It seems, as my honourable friend said earher, that he is prepared at any time to use strong arm tactics against people whom he knows he can put down. He speaks out when there is no reason to speak out.",67
158,Mr GILES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He has a chip on his shoulder.,68
159,Mr CADMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , this is the conflict which the Minister has. He has great difficulty in being even-handed. He does not realise that what one does for one group one should do for another. This is the theme of the Government's legislation, but the Minister does not look at the background; he does not look at the success of the Tribunal. The history of the Tribunal shows that it has worked. Mr Minister, this is what your portfoho is all about. It is about industrial relations, keeping people at work, keeping them serving the pubhc; doing their jobs and happy to do their jobs. The history of the industry has proved this, but the BLF is another matter. The Minister does not interfere with it, he lets it its own way and lets it do as it wishes in contempt of the High Court. Mr Katter-Why do you not",68
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Order ! There are far too many interjections.,68
161,Mr CADMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They are very helpful.,68
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not care whether they are helpful or not; they are contrary to the Standing Orders. I ask the honourable member to direct his remarks to the Chair.,68
163,Mr CADMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Under the Tribunal as it now exists, the process of conciliation and arbitration takes part as one act. The parties mvolved begin discussions, arbitration takes place, the judge involved travels around to see the working conditions and negotiates continually with the parties. He then has the ability to arbitrate and that arbitration is binding. Not once in the history of this Tribunal has any decision been broken. Not once while the Tribunal has been considering a matter has there been a strike or a stoppage. There are so many industries in which such situations occur time after time, week after week, that I think many areas of arbitration and conciliation areripefor the Minister's fertile mind. In assessing the industry involved, I think should also look at the union concerned-the line Pilots Federation of Australia-whic h in some ways is different from other unions but tainly is an industrial body intent upon assisting its members. The Federation has something like involving 99 per cent union membership. Pilots who do not wish to belong to the Federation can for a fee enjoy the benefits that the Federation acquires for them, but if they wish to refrain from membership as conscientious objectors they may do so. There is no compulsion to join the Federation, although it has something like 99 per cent membership. I suggest that the activities of the Federation and the type of structure within which it operates are reasons for its success on behalf of its membership. The Minister's role in this matter is one of servant of the Crown, servant of the people of this country. I predict that once this legislation is passed by both Houses we will return to chaos in the airline industry. The planes will not be flying; there will be trouble; there will be appeals; there will be dissent. Neither employer nor employee will abide by decisions that will be made; they both will want to take them on to the Full Bench. Up until this time they have abided by the have umpire's decision. Through this legislation the Government is throwing the whole matter wide open again. We will return to days of great difficulty; I have no doubt about that. The Minister should be active here on behalf of the public of Austraha. Time and again the Pilots Federation has said that it will not abide by the decisions of the Tribunal, and I draw from that statement the inference that the employers will not abide by them either. They will want to appeal; they will throw the matter open. What is the pubhc interest in this matter? Is it in the pubhc interest to draw legislation which creates uniformity in thisfield,or is it in the public interest to keep aeroplanes in the air and to provide the sort of services that we have had over the last 8 years, with the minimum of dispute? The Minister may have set out to bring the Airline Pilots Federation under his wing so that he can apply his will to them rather than to the Builders Labourers Federation. The people who will suffer are the public, the people who are flying, the people who need these services, the people of Australia; and in the introduction of this legislation the Minister has shown his lack of concern for them.",68
164,Mr MCVEIGH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"This Bill amends in some detaU certain provisions of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act 1967 as it relates to disputes involving pilots, navigators we and flight engineers. That Act, which was Airopposed by the Labor Party in Opposition at the second reading stage when a division was forced, cerhad as its purpose the setting up of a special statutory tribunal to deal with industrial disputes those officers in the airlines industry. It provided that industrial disputes affecting flight crews should be handled by a special tribunal because over the years experience had shown that industrial problems concerning flight crews were unique and the efforts of many people at the time had been unsuccesful in solving the industry's arbitration and industrial problems. It is difficult to understand why the then sition, now the Government, voted against that principle in the division to which I have referred. One cannot understand the logic of saying that at that time there should be an exception for one industry in Austraha. I ask: Why should one industry have been treated differently from other industries? On that occasion the then Opposition adopted one principle in one case and another principle in another case. Of course, in Opposition the Labor Party could be charged with having the philosophy of driving in one nail in order to loosen scores of others. The Labor Party is now the victim of its own environment and it is paying the penalties of its policies when in sition in inciting unnecessary strikes. Strike figures in Austraha over recent months have been far too high. The significant thing, therefore, is that there has been a recognition by the Government now, as distinct from when it was in Opposition, that there has to be a framework within which the disputes of an industry can be arbitrated. The Opposition is enthusiastic that there has been a recognition of the fact that the law of the jungle and the survival of the fittest shall not prevail. Mr Hewson-That' s the shot.",68
165,Mr MCVEIGH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I appreciate the comment from the honourable member for MCMillan, who appreciates that we must have order in these matters, otherwise chaos will result. At the time the original legislation was framed the airlines were in a pretty constant state of ferment and that legislation certainly put some framework into initiatives which sowed the seeds of hope for ironing out many of the problems and nauseating conflicts which were putting intolerable burdens and personal hardships on the people who were the customers of the airlines. The Tribunal became knowledgeable in the background of the industry, its technology and operational problems. This Bill, in effect, is a housekeeping Bill to tidy up the system. It is based on the premise that mistakes can occur and that justice must not only be done but also appear to be done. Anomalies in any undertaking are often the cause of much discontent and, with the passage of time, when anomaUes have been revealed and it is submitted that, the system can be streamlined and improved, it is laudable that those anomalies are to be corrected. The passage of this Bill will rectify anomahes which exist. The Bill makes certain amendments to Part IIIA of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act. That Part provides a complete code in relation to the Fhght Crew Officers Tribunal. However, instead of setting out the Oppocode in detaU, some matters are dealt with by references to other Parts of the Act. Section 88v of the Act, which clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend, is one such referential provision. Clause 4 of the Bill proposes that paragraph (c) of section 88v(l) be omitted. The object of clause 4 of the Bill appears to be to clarify the position of commissioners assigned to assist the person appointed under section 88J of the Act as the Flight Crew Officers Tribunal. The power of assignment is given to the President of the Australian ConcUiation and Arbitration Oppo- Commission. Commissioners may be assigned either for the purposes of a particular industrial question or for the purposes of Part IIIA of the Act, that is to say, any industrial question arising under that Part. In the latter case, assigned commissioners are to act subject to any directions of the person appointed as the Fhght Crew Officers Tribunal. Clause 3 of the Bill would appear to involve merely the removal of dead wood. The ground for having a matter referred to the Full Bench of the Commission is that a party considers it to be of such importance that in the pubhc interest it should be dealt with by the Full Bench. The procedure is the same irrespective of what cases are dealt with. It involves application to the single member or the person constituting the Fhght Crew Officers Tribunal, reference by him of the application to the President of the Commission, consultation between the single member and the President, and the decision by the President. The detaUed powers after the President has decided that a matter shall be referred to the Full Bench are in both cases the same in substance. It is not necessary to start again as proceedings before the single person can be taken into account by the Full Bench and the FuU Bench can ask for a report from the single person, spht the matter into two and direct the single person to decide one part and decide the other part itself. The FuU Bench can arrange for the single person to take extra evidence. It will be noted that an appeal Ues only where the Full Bench considers that the matter is of such importance that in the pubhc interest there should be an appeal. If the Full Bench decides that there should be an appeal it can suspend the operation of the award or other decision appealed from, obtain reports, take further evidence and decide the matter itself or direct the Flight Crew Omcers Tribunal to act in a particular way. The bulk of the Bill seeks to put the Flight Crew Omcers Tribunal on a par with single members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Matters will be able to be referred to the Full Bench of the Commission and the decision of the Tribunal will be subject to appeal to the Full Bench of the Commission. There appears to be no difference in substance between the proposed reference and appeal provisions that is, section 88ZF and section 88ZG of the Act respectively, and the existing reference and appeal provisions that apply to single members of the Commission, that is, section 34 and section 35 of the Act respectively. I endorse the remarks of the honourable mem- (No. ber for Corangamite (Mr Street) who stated that, in an effort to overcome the very great problems that exist in arbitration and conciliation matters, there is a necessity to have 3-point agreement be the tween labour, management and the general pubthis debate. Uc. I do feel that in these matters, which are of vital interest to the trade union movement, the people who are supposed to represent the interests of that group have completely forgotten about two of the items that the honourable memfoUowed. ber for Corangamite has mentioned, namely, management and the general pubhc. It is all very well to have a unUateral approach to the solution of any problem, but quite often that leads to further conflict, further disagreement and a greater upsetting of the facUities that should made available to the general public. I ask the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) that in this, and any future legislation that he brings before the House relation to this most vital and important matter as far as the general state of our economy is cerned, he take notice of the point raised by honourable member for Corangamite that due consideration should be given to the place of management in all his initiatives, and that parbate ticular reference be made to the right of the general public to expect top class service from the people who are protected as members of society. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Clyde Cameron) read a third time. NA BILL (No. 2) 1974 [No. 2] Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 March on motion by Mr Morrison: That the Bill be now read a second time.",69
166,Mr MORRISON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would Uke to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Bill 1974 (No. 2) and the Television Stations Licence Fees Bill 1974 2) as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the BUls at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit subject matter of the 3 BUls to be discussed in",70
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 3 measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be  known, I am the representative in this House of the shadow Minister for the Media. I will not be delaying the House for a lengthy period of time be in my contribution to the debate on these 3 measures. The Opposition has no argument with the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Bill 1974 (No. 2) and the Television Stations Licence Fees Bill 1974 (No. 2), but we are still gravely conin cerned about the Broadcasting and Television Bill (No. 2) 1974 (No. 2). On 15 November last conwe debated this matter extensively. On that the occasion my colleague, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen), put forward a great many views both in his contribution to the deon the motion for the second reading of the Bill and in the form of amendments to the Bill during the Committee stage. It is not the intention of the Opposition to move all those amendments again. It will therefore be necessary for those people who are interested in this matter to read the report of the debate tonight in conjunction with the debate of 15 November last to ascertain in detaU the Opposition's views. The Opposition will be opposing the motion for the second reading of the Bill but it will not, as I have said, be moving at this late stage of the night all the amendments moved previously. But it must be understood that our attitude tonight is the same as that taken by us in November last year. Although, as I have said, the Opposition will not be moving all the amendments that it moved last year it holds to its views on them very strongly indeed. The Opposition's views on them are on record and our attitude to them is still the same. But there is a requirement for those interested in the subject to read the report of the debate of 15 November last and of today in conjunction. It is to be noted that last year the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas MCClelland) said pubhcly: The powers sought in this poses of controlling private television. We do not propose to disturb in any shape or form private television companies. Frankly that is utterly absurd. If there is no intention to use the powers why has the legislation been introduced at all? The purpose of this Bill is, frankly, power. It revolves around powerpower sought by the Minister for the Media, power to control private commercial television stations in this country-and it ought to be identified as such. The Bill provides for the power to direct, the power to control and, if need be, the power to destroy. That is a strong statement but I make it deliberately. The power sought by the Broadcasting and Television Bill, if used, would be so all-embracing that it would permit total control of all private television throughout Australia. It will not receive the Opposition's support. The same view will be put in another place. The Minister for the Media has alleged that this Bill concerns standards. The fact of the matter is that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board already has power under the existing Broadcasting and Television Act to produce standards and to see that the industry keeps up to them. The Minister for the Media has also alleged that the Austrahan Broadcasting Control Board is virtuaUy without power at the moment. That proposition simply does not stand up to examination. The Board has the power to suspend a hcence and the power to revoke a licence. What additional power is required? The Opposition therefore opposes the Bill. It wiU vote against the motion that the Bill be read a second time. The brevity of my speech in Opposition tonight in no way reflects that a cursory examination has been made. I reiterate what I said at the start of my brief remarks tonight, that it will be necessary to re-read the Hansard of 15 November 1974 to obtain the fuU views of the Opposition when the extensive amendments were properly put by the Opposition. This Bill has come before us again perhaps-w e do not know-in the pipeline for a double dissolution; so be it. It is not our choice. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has indicated the Opposition's attitude to elections, and properly so, but we are unutterably opposed to this Bill that revolves around power, to vest in the Minister for the Media power to control private television in Austraha, and we will not sanction it under any circumstance.",70
168,Mr INNES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," Iriseto support the legislation. Mr MCLeay- I am disappointed in you, Ted. Bill are not needed for the pur",71
169,Mr INNES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I thought the honourable member would be. The issue here is clear. I think that the brevity of the speech of the honourable mem the fact that he probably never read the speech of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr KUlen). He gave it very poor support in the submission that he put. In speaking in support of this Bill I indicate it has to be recognised that the history of the past decade or so will show clearly that the accent in the television industry in this country has been on higher profits for the owners and controllers of the television media. This has led to the general deterioration of Australian content in the majority of the areas of entertainment. There has also been exploitation of the media market by overseas film producers, as is exempUfied by the not so sophisticated dumping processes undertaken by American interests. We canfindsome proof of this by looking at the cost of production of American television programs which are shown on the television networks in this country, comparing that cost with the prices that are paid by the owners of the television media in this country, and then analysing the reasons. It is clear that the programs are dumped here in an attempt to destroy the Australian film industry. Little or nothing is done about it by the people who hold the whip hand in this field. WhUst the honourable member for Kooyong says that there is a power in the present Act, all the members of the legal luminary have an alternative opinion. However, if it is, as the honourable member suggests, if the power does not reside in the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to carry out the plulosophy of the Act, then all the Bill does is to provide that power. The authority contained in this legislation which has been regarded as harsh and oppressive is most fair and reasonable when it is compared with overseas legislation such as United Kingdom legislation. This legislation calls on an individual who holds a television hcence to carry very heavily the responsibility to act in a proper way. The track record of these people in this country is all that good. Let us compare the cost of an Austrahan proPackers duction with the cost of an overseas production. The Austrahan produced program 'Homicide' people costs $36,000 an hour to produce, and that only for film. If it involves film and an integrated video production, the cost is about $30,000. That cost has been pruned having regard to the levels of employment in the industry. Let me compare the cost of an American produced program. The program 'Mission Impossible' is produced at a cost of $250,000 an hour. That program which costs $250,000 an hour to produce, has already run its life on the American circuit. It costs Valenti. approximately $200 to sell that program in Australia for a re-run, but it is sold in this country for itsfirstrun at a cost of $4,500 and for the seclegislation ond run at a cost of $2,500. The same producers, the same monopolies which control the film industry in America, rip off about $50m from film industry when they sell their product to the cinemas throughout Austraha. It is the same the people who produce these programs. Sure, they can afford to sell their products at that price. They sell them for the purpose of destroying the Austrahan film industry, aided and abetted by some of the paragons of virtue to whom the honourable member for Kooyong and others from the Opposition side run very quickly in fence. I challenge honourable members opposite look at the other side of this question; look at what this means to Austrahan actors, the workers in the industry and the people of Australia.  this Government.",71
170,Mr INNES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"They are going out of work because the individuals whom the honourable member defends are supporting the attitude of the American producers who participate in dumping programs on the Australian market. The original proposition that was considered in another place was designed to put beyond question whether or not the Broadcasting Control Board did have the power to which the honourable member for Kooyong referred to carry out and exercise its functions under the existing Act. It has been argued that the Act has certain deficiencies that precludes the Board from carrying out its obUgations to the people of this country, that is, to ensure that the privUeges granted to hcensees of radio and television stations are subject to regulation by the Government or Government bodies in the pubUc interest. It is not sheer humbug to suggest that this legislation will be dictatorial. On the contrary, it will release the stranglehold that people Uke the Fairfaxes, the and the Ansetts have on the commercial television network at this point in time-the who dictate'to the viewers of this country is what they will see on commercial television. These people do this with a total disregard for the Austrahan television and film industry. They just could not care less whether workers in the industry survive whUe-as I have indicated before-the y themselves rip off mUlions of dollars and exploit the consumers of this country in concert with the barons of the American film industry through agents like our friend Mr We have to consider whether the existing has succeeded. Have the commercial television controllers played the game? Has the viewing pubhc had a fair go in watching a range the offirst-classprograms of their choice? Some of programs that are shown on the television screen are absolutely deplorable. When we look at children's programs that are aUowed to be showntimeandtimeagain we ought to hang our heads in shame. We particularly have to consider whether there has been any real attempt to protect the Australian artists, writers, musicians, actors and technicians. We have to consider dewhether there has been any attempt to promote Australian talent and to maintain our own Australian culture in music We have to hear proto grams and watch documentaries which reflect the real beauty of our country. As I said, I think the real test has to be whether or not by any standards it can be regarded as being harsh and repressive. So often what we see and hear is a lot I move to certain aspects of history of the British Broadcasting Corporation. Until 1954 the Corporation enjoyed a monopoly of British television. Then a 2-tier structure was developed. It controUed the method by which productions reached the viewer. If the establishment of that sort of authority were provided for in this Bill-it is not but I wish it were- I would agree with the  that there would not be any worry about introducing this legislation. If the Australian Broadcasting Control Board were to have some semblance of control over whether or not a program should be shown, that would be the end of it. That has been the experience on the British scene. . Mr Katter-That is not right.",72
171,Mr BSNES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Isn't it? The history of the industry in the United Kingdom has shown clearly that the promotion of Austrahan content ought to be reflected in our legislation. We should ensure the encouragement of Austrahan talent, of a greater participation by Australians, and a maximum of Australian content. A local content of approximately 80 per cent was achieved in the United Kingdom and the standard of television production reached a level that was competitive with the best of the American productions. We have seen some evidence of this happening in Austraha. Let us have a further look at the track record of our friends who now control the media.  cal, are you, Ted?",73
172,Mr INNES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Yes . Let us look at some of the attempts to whitewash the issues. We can reflect on what happened in 1974, when the Minister he for the Media (Senator Douglas MCClelland) Bill gave every encouragement to the television staDecember. tions to play the game and to use a system which would enable Australian content to be record maximised to the extent to which resources perlegislation. mitted. In 1974 the level of Australian prowe duction did rise. If we look at the average yearly amount of time per station devoted to Austrahan programs from 1968 onwards, we will 1968 2050 hours were devoted to Australian programs and this situation improved in the following 4 years to 2250 hours. Thefiguresincreased sharply then to 2428 hours in 1973 and 2435 in 1974. But during 1974 material was accumulated for use in 1975. As a result, thefiguresfor trahan drama, variety, current affairs and other programs have dropped. The cancellations can straight be seen clearly by the record. We are dissatisfied and the people in the industry are dissatisfied, tralian and something needs to be done to correct the situation. If the Opposition members continue to obspeciahsed struct, as they have over the last 2 or 3 years, allow people in the television industry to be jected to the pressures of the commercial stations and so destroy Australian content, we will to adopt other measures. An attempt is being made to cripple the industry and to use all the pressures that can be apphed within the current interpretation of the Act. If the Opposition destroys this Bill in the other place, I would advocate for going out and declaring them on. There is only one way in which to protect the television industry and that is by applying quotas, because the people who are running the organisations now could not he straight in bed. So the legislation is necessary. If the Opposition were half fair dinkum it would support the Bill. But I know it has succumbed to the pressures of the moguls of the Press and I am sure that the honourable member for Kooyong, running true to form, ultimately will vote against the Bill, as he has indicated. Nevertheless, right will prevail and, in the final analysis, the Bill will provide the teeth that are necessary to protect the industry generaUy and the Australian workers in the industry in particular.",73
173,Mr CORBETT,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"We have heard a fairly long speech by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) but he did not say much. I think he even got on the nerves of of his own colleagues, in view of the note that was passed to him. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), this Bill was the subject of a substantial debate in this House not so long ago. What did not say, if l remember rightly, is that this was debated also in the Senate on, I think, 3 The Hansard report for the Senate as well as for this House contains quite a substantial of what the Opposition thinks about this I think it would be a waste of time if were to reiterate those views because we have put our case in an efficient way, and nothing that the honourable member for Melbourne said see that in refutes our arguments. I want to take a little bit of time to reply in a particular way. The honourable member for Melbourne concluded his speech by saying that Austhe people who controlled the broadcasting and television industry in this country could not lie in bed, or words to that effect. I refer to the concern that is felt by the Federation of AusBroadcasters, which body represents some stations which are controlled by the Party to which the honourable member belongs. It might be thought that the Federation has a interest in the matter but I point out and that it controls some stations which did not dissubsociate themselves from a resolution of the Federation. I think the substance of the resolution have would be worth repeating. The Federation unanimously affirmed its determination to support the principles that the public is best served by the continuance of the freedom of the commercial broadcasting industry to program its stabe an tions in accordance with the demonstrable interests of the communities which it serves. That is part of the resolution passed by the Federation. When I was mentioning this in November last I remember the Minister for Science (Mr Morhas rison) taking a point of order against me but it was not upheld by the Speaker. So he does not know much about the Act or about what he was saying. The resolution also said that, while accepting the desirability of broad national proraise gram standards, which already exist, the Austhe tralian commercial broadcasters consider that the legislative moves to provide dictatorshipand I emphasise that word-by the Government through the Austrahan Broadcasting Control has Board in respect of what shall be presented to pubhc could assuredly result in repression of opportunity of the pubhc to hear free expression of program material of community interest. deep concern of the broadcasters in respect of these matters as related to the proposals connot tained in the amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act, which in essence gives the Government appointed Board control over properiod gramming news services and advertising functhat. tions of commercial broadcasters, is for the serious imphcations in continuing to provide the community an acceptable free enterprise serbe vice which they have enjoyed in the past. In the light of the foregoing, member unanimously approved immediate action to protect broadcasting against unfair political attacks from any party. I said that before. I think worth repeating. Possibly the Government introduced this Bill again to have a repetition the previous debate on it, but I beheve that it is more hkely, as the honourable member for factory. Kooyong said, that it reintroduced the Bill that it would have another string to its bow case it decided to have another double dissolisfactory. ution of the Parhament. I warn the Government against that. I think it knows pretty well itself that there is grave danger in that. I should like to raise one or two other points. said that I would not speak for long, because take the attitude that rehashing debates and troducing legislation like this to a large extent wastes the time of this Parliament. The time would be better spent promoting and debating matters which have not been fully debated in this House before. I emphasise that we on the Oppocome sition side welcome and encourage Australian talent. We welcome Australian programs and we will promote them to the best of our every way within reasonable Umits. The honourable member for Melbourne referred to bias in programs. I am sorry that he has not remained in the chamber to hear my comments. There has been creeping into news services and other radio and television programs a bias which is causing great concern and which been ventilated in recent times. The amount of public interest that it has attracted has surprised even me. I hope that consideration is given to trying to ensure a reasonable presentation of each angle of the news. The reason I this matter is that if the Government had control which it aims to achieve and if that bias were to develop and grow one could wonder where it would stop. That is a matter to which we should give very serious consideration. If bias crept in at this stage, and I believe it has, how the much would it grow if a government-controlled the board had the authority to control programs completely? The Federation of Australian The Broadcasters would not have the power it has today. It would be more under the control. I do like the idea of a 6-months licence. I do not think that is time enough for any program, although it has been accepted. Previously the was 3 months. I was very concerned about Talking from a personal point of view, I do not like 6 months either. I think licences should to be granted for 12 months and provision should made that a licence can be revoked if there is an abuse of it. That appUes to licences that are stations granted in most areas. I should like to say something about television it is in the western areas of Queensland which I represent. The Minister for Science need not of snule. The people in those areas have a problem. The television reception they get is far from satisI f the Minister is prepared to take an so interest I should Uke him to explain why the in equipment provided in those areas was so unsatThat is something he should look at. The people in those areas are not smUing about it. In Charleville 2 aerials are now being erected to get over the problem. At Mitchell the aerial has been relocated and air-conditioned studios I provided. I welcome the introduction of teleI vision in those areas, but I query why the equipreinment provided was not examined very carefully to see whether it was suitable for the purpose for which it was provided. Why did faults occur? I have been in touch with the authorities. They are doing their best under the circumstances to over the problems that have arisen, but I should hke the Minister to look at the basis of the provision of that equipment and why it has given abiUty in such unsatisfactory service.",73
174,Mr MORRISON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,In what year was it opened up?,74
175,Mr CORBETT,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I suppose it has been operating for 12 to 18 months. It has been going for quite some time. The authorities are endeavouring to assist, but I understand from the people in the area that the signal will not be as strong as was originally expected to be and as it was advertised it would be. I hope that that will be looked at. I have spoken for a httle longer than I said I would, because I wanted to touch on a few of these points. This Bill had been debated in this House and another place very fully and there is nothing really worth changing. It should not have been debated again. The only reason it has been debated again is that the Government might want to use it as a basis for a double dissolhis ution of the Parhament. If that is not the reason, beheve that its reintroduction has been more or less a waste of time.",74
176,Mr KATTER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"One or two points have to be projected a httle further than they have been. I was rather surprised by the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) in view of the fact that there has been such pubhc outcry through the media and in view of the demonstrations in the streets- I tliink that perhaps some of them were unjustified-agains t the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas MCClelland). If his authority is so' extensive at the moment and if the authority of the Austrahan Broadcasting Control Board is so powerful, then why is it necessary to introduce additional measures? If the industry itself is turbed by actions that have been taken by the Minister under what the Government will no doubt allege is Umited power now, then how much more dangerous would it be if additional powers were given to the Minister or to those designated by him? Tonight mention has been made of bias. I ask honourable members to cast their minds back over the last few weeks to some of the contributions by the Australian Broadcasting Commission in particular. The ABC news tonight was quite interesting. Maybe it could be suggested that I am getting off the track, but one of the intentions of this Bill is to ensure that adequate and comprehensive programs are presented by the hcencees of commercial broadcasting ana television stations. I should imagine that the Government would be inclined to clean up its own house first. Do not get me wrong. No one has paid greater tribute to the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission than I have. I admire particularly the quaUty of its documentaries and some of the movies such as 'Seven Little Australians' that it has produced specificaUy for television. Who does not watch 'Bellbird'? These are quite magnificent contributions, but I am afraid that a clearly discernible bias is beginning to show through, particularly in the coverage of recent events in Vietnam. The 7 o'clock news on it the ABC tonight was pathetic. It showed afilmof the absolute delight of people and little children under the new order at Da Nang, prancing around and dancing. Everyone was very happy. One would imagine that it was Christmas Day, Easter and every wedding anniversary aU rolled up into one. It was the greatest stage-set contribution one would ever see in a lifetime. If it had not been so deadly serious one would have been highly amused. It showed an American, but accent did not seem to be American. It could I have been a Baltic accent. The whole thing was obviously stage-set. If extra controls are to be brought into being and if they are to take over the destinies of the commercial broadcasting and television stations, let us look at that superb organisation, the ABC. It is a pity that the tone of that great organisation is not set by people such as James Dibble, Ross Symonds and Richard Carleton-me n of the highest quaUty. I often wonder how they feel when they have to read some of the news reports which in recent times have been so markedly biased. It is no good Professor Downing washing his hands hke Pontius Pilate and saying that he is not responsible. He is the Chairman of the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission, and he and dis- his commissioners are responsible for whatever emanates from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It is high time that they were at least a httle fair. Anyone who saw the news tonight must have been very interested in the corruption of the South Vietnamese and the almost brutality of the Americans. It was the same old line. It is no wonder that Nixon- I do not mean President Nixon; I mean a much more eminent figure, Peter Nixon-wa s disturbed and expressed himself so forcibly. My distinguished colleague who appears to have disappeared, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett), drew attention some minutes ago to the the quaUty of television in our part of Queensland. It is not so much the quaUty that worries me; it is the fact that in so many areas there is no television. If honourable members opposite want to have these extra controls, they should begin to give greater consideration to the many thousands of people who are deprived of this amenity. Television is almost an accepted part of everyday Ufe. These people, who are scattered throughout the length and breadth of Austraha, sustain industries that are reaUy bringing in the wealth that keeps places such as this going and pays the salaries of members of Parliament-Uttl e though they be. The Government should start thinking seriously about these people, not writing the same old ters back to us time and again. I hope that the Minister for Science (Mr rison) will pass that message on to his colleague in the other House, the Minister for the Media, who in most matters is a fair and reasonable man. Even though there are demonstrations poUs and all sorts of disastrous suggestions made about his Ministry, he is ask the Minister for Science to tell him that we want television out there. We want it in all the vacuum areas where we do not have it. Mr Armitage-Why did you not do it when you were the Minister?",75
177,Mr KATTER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,We did it. The honourable member knows that. Mr Armitage-Where has it gone?,76
178,Mr KATTER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The present Government stoptake ped the program; it did not continue the next I phase. The honourable member will not get away with that one. His Government has harangue brought the whole matter to a standstill, as brought to a standstill every other industry country and has created hundreds of thousands of unemployed and God knows what. I would that like to make just one last point. Mr Daly-Hear , hear!",76
179,Mr KATTER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I thought the Minister would appreciate that. Getting back to the quality adequate and comprehensive programs which this Bill is demanding from the commercial stations, I would point out in fairness that 'This Day Tonight' gave coverage to the thoughts of a named Don Sewell. He was in charge of the Holy Fanuly Orphange at Da Nang. He spoke in very explicit terms. I am being fair about this. creating a balance because I have told the House how the magnificent picture of the communistited. dominated city of Da Nang was presented. It showed that everyone there at the moment is granting very happy. I would Uke it to have shown the refugees retreating to the north. But they were heading south. I would like to know how all these people in Da Nang become so contented in a matter of four of five days-perhap s a week. fairness, 'This Day Tonight' gave a very good coverage to Mr Don Sewell who explained that the communist occupation of Da Nang- I am still referring to the Bill-wa s such that the munists did not kUl off aU the chUdren; they slaughtered only those from newly born babies up to children 12 months old. That program shown after the news. I appeal to the Minister for Science, who letrepresents the Minister for the Media in his House, to look into this matter and to get Professor Downing moving. AU we ask for is a balMorance in the ABC news. I have kept my contract with the House. For obvious reasons, the Oppostion opposes this Bill. If this lack of control and this obvious bias are evident at this stage, how and much more evident would they be if we had a are board which was dominated and controlled by not a bad fellow. I this Government.",76
180,Mr MORRISON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"in reply- I was rather disappointed in the speech of my colleague, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), because the lasttimehe spoke on this subject we had a very colourful- I might even say very humourous-accoun t of his lifelong love of films such as 'Tom Mix'. But on this occasion he deprived us of those comments. I would like to up a couple of observations that were made. find it very difficult to understand the viewpoint put by the Opposition. We have just heard an about control, balance and supervision it has of television. The honourable member picked in this out the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission, but I am sure that he would be the first to agree this apphes to many television stations. He argued for more control and more balance. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) said that the television proprietors should have fuU freedom to put on whatever they believe is of right. So we had two completely contradictory propositions coming from the Opposition. I think we have to look-this Parliament is man required to look-at the question of the monopoly power of television stations. A television station is not like a newspaper. Anybody who has I am sufficient money can go out and start a newspaper. But the television channels are limThey are public property. So the licences are granted to people. There is a process for the of licences. When a licence goes out to a television station owner it becomes a monopoly, but it is a monopoly of a public facUity. Previous governments-no t just this Government-hav e laid down certain standards by which the owners In of this public monopoly must abide. I am afraid that I will have to go over the same arguments again because they do not appear to have sunk in. The reason why the Government is seeking comclarification of the powers of the Broadcasting Control Board is that these powers are under legal challenge. I want to say that again: The was reason why the Government is seeking these powers in this amendment to the Act is that the powers in the existing Act are under legal chalit lenge. So, to put the matter outside the possibUity of legal challenge the Government is amending the Act. That is the basic proposition. I was fascinated to hear the honourable member for Maranoa, who has left the chamber, say that he did not agree with the 6 months period. In fact he was talking about a gestation period of 12 months or even longer. This is fairly remarkable because the 6 months period is exacdy the same proposition as was put forward by the Liberal Party when it was in government and amended the Broadcasting and Television Act in 1972. All we are seeking to do here is to accept the proposition, which was put by the previous Government but which did not get on to the statArmitage, J.L. ute books, that the hcence renewal period should Barnard, be 6 months. I find it very difficult to compreBerinson, J.M. hend the arguments that have been put forward Bowen, Lionel tonight by the Opposition. As I have mentioned, it is strange that anything that appears to damage the interests of the great and powerful friends of the Liberal and Country Parties in the media world is seized upon as being undemocratic. I am reminded- I have used this expression before-that freedom of the Press for the Opposition is when one man can own 10 newspapers but 10 million people own none. I accept that there is a fundamental difference in phUosophy between the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal and Country Parties. Mr Ratter-Thank God for that.",76
181,Mr MORRISON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I thank God for it, too. We believe that this Parliament, being representatives of the people of Austraha, has certain rights Jacobi, R. and responsibilities on behalf of the people of Australia. We are introducing this Bill into the Austrahan Parhament. We hope, despite the opposition that has been indicated by the Opposition, that the provisions of this Bill which state Kerin, J.C the rights of Parliament in the control of monopolies that are handed over to private groups will be exercised in the interests of the Australian people. That is a very simple proposition. That is the view of the Government and it is the view that the Government will take on this occasion. The simple reason we have had to introduce the Bill again is that the Senate threw it Patterson, R. A. out the last time it was introduced without even a debate. The Opposition voted against the motion that the Bill be read a second time forthwith and the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas MCCleUand), who is a member in another place, had no opportunity to put the Government's case. We are now introducing the Bill again and wiU go to the Senate again. In fact, this is the third time we have had to do this.

182,Mr ADERMANN,ADJOURNMENT,"The most matter; difficult of all the Government's initiatives about which to get any information must surely be the Austrahan Assistance Plan. The Opposition did not oppose the Bill in either House of the Parhament when it was introduced by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) and the scheme was initiated. However, rumours and reports of the distribution of largesse under this scheme, the political overtones and the fact that it appears that the accounts will not even be the subject of scrutiny by the Auditor-General are extremely disquieting. However, it is not my intention to debate that matter this evening. Third Reading Recently a meeting, convened to initiate a further extension of the Australian Assistance Plan, was held in part of my electorate. Of course, I was not advised of that meeting-the Federal member very rarely is-bu t I happened to find out about it. Although I could not attend it, one of my State parhamentary colleagues did Second Reading attend. Apparently his attendance caused some and it was evident that his presence was of some httle embarrassment. However, as a result ofhis attendance an interesting and a very disturbing revelation came to light. Among those people addressing the meeting was one person who was called an assistant social worker. My colleague was talking to her and asked her Third Reading whether she was a State social worker or whether she was employed by the Federal Government. She said that she belonged to the Federal social security service. She repeated that she was an assistant social worker and that she was working in his State electorate and in my Federal electorate normal social security work. But the remarkable thing was that, quite unsolicited, Second Reading without any prompting, she made the statement that she works for the Australian Government and that she is being paid by Darwin relief money. Of course, the work she was doing had nothing to do with Darwin relief. My colleague questioned her about it. He said: 'That is a long way from home'. She said: ' I agree that it is'. I have here a statutory declaration made by the Third Reading person to whom that statement was made. It names the person involved, but I do not intend to do that in this House. It also names the place and the time at which that statement was made. This morning I tried to ask a question in the House, but it was not my turn and I did not get the call. The question was to be directed to the Minister for the Northern Territory and the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson), and I am grateful that he has come into the chamber this evening, because it is a very serious it is a very serious allegation. The question that I intended to ask is: Would the Minister be prepared to provide full details of the disposition of all Darwin relief money? How much of this money has been applied to any social security activities, to Australian Assistance Plan activiCameron) ties, or to any other purpose not in any way connected with Darwin relief? I stress the point that the assistant social worker did not give the advice in answer to a question or an mquiry; it was spontaneously given. It came like a bolt from the blue. It was unsolicited and it was unsought. So I ask the Minister this question: What on earth is going on? I know that there is a shortage of funds in some areas-the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) said so todaybut if Darwin relief moneys are being apphed in this way it would be the greatest act of deception and dishonesty of which a government could possibly be guilty. I want to raise very quickly another matter cause opportunities to speak are few. As long as February I raised in a grievance day debate this House a matter of some urgency. I was seekSurely ing compassion for a neglected and apparently Government. unwanted group of Australians who are deaf. Since making that speech I have received a great number of letters from all over Austraha, from associations and relatives of the deaf and even from deaf people who have read that speech. Their gratitude and their appreciation was remarkable. Their gratitude that their cause been presented was overwhelming. Although previously I had written to the Minister for Media (Senator Douglas MCClelland) about ways and means of enabling the deaf fully to also understand television and films, and although tried as hard as I was capable of doing in this House to bring awareness of their need, neither the Minister nor the Government has one sign of comprehension or of compassion, and nor has there been one move to do anything at all even to examine the case. In my speech I pointed out that we have a of unemployed and that a lot of the deaf are employed. They very often are the last to be employed and the first to be retrenched. That is very sad fact of life. They simply want a chance, not just a favour. They must laugh at the piety the Government's anti-discrimination stateprovided ments because they know that they suffer from massive discrimination. When their sented in this Parliament I cannot get the Government or the Minister to take one scrap of notice of their plight. The only reaction I got on did not. that day on which I spoke when I pointed out the position of these people- I spoke of how misunderstood they are, the extent of their handicap, how people showed them no patience, no understanding, because of their deafness-wa s for the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde to sit on the front bench aping deafness and actually performing a comic opera which disgusted me. I did not have time on that day to take the Minister to task. I should not condemn him because I see now that the same attitude might permeate the whole of the Government. It is too much trouble for members of the Government to respond to the representations that I and others have made or to exhibit one small iota of interest or compassion. That surely shows up the fact that grievance day in this House has become quite a parsimonious business. The Government parades it as a means of giving private members an opportunity to raise their particular problems, and that is all it does, because once a speech is finished it is just as bequickly forgotten. Certainly it does not bring ago from the Government any rectification or any in remedy for the grievances that we have raised. that is an indication of the sincerity of the I wish specifically to exempt from any criticism or any suggestion of criticism two honourable members on the Government side of the House, namely, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews) who I know has had a lot to do with had this particular problem- I commend the work that he has done and the interest that he has the taken-and also the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr MCKenzie) who I know has taken a great interest in this matter. But I I once again voice my frustration and disgust at the fact that, having put the case, we cannot get an answer to our representations or even a sign indicated of compassion or comprehension.",78

Her proof of that aUegation was that she signed a case is prestatutory declaration. Mr Adermann-No , the person she told; she",79
184,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The person whom she told signed a statutory declaration. It is one thing to make an allegation in the Parliament, but I beheve that the honourable member for Fisher ought to have consulted me and talked to me about itfirst,because the answer is quite simple.",79
185,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! If the Minister for Social Security and the honourable member for Cowper want to carry on a private conversation I suggest that they should leave the House otherwise they should remain silent. This matter and I think that it ought to be treated as such.,80
186,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"It is a serious matter, because the funds which have been provided and which have been lodged in the Darwin Rehef Trust Fund have all been subscribed by the pubposition lic of Australia as well as by some people from overseas and some overseas governments. I can assure that honourable member for Fisher that what this woman has said and what has been in the statutory declaration is false. There way in which she could have access to those funds. They arerigorouslycontrolled by a trust committee which has been set up by a trust deed drawn up by the Director of Law in the Northern Territory. The committee consists of His Honour the Administrator of the Northern Territory, Captain Walker of the Salvation Army, Mr Traynor of the Red Cross, Mr Valadian of the Fund? Aboriginal Development Foundation, the Reverend Bence of the United Church, the Mayor of Darwin, Alderman Brennan, Mr Robertson of the Darwin Regional Welfare  deputy leader of the majority Party member of the Liberal Party. He describes himself as the leader of the Liberal Party. Surely there is nothing wrong with that. Other members are Dr Ella Stack representing the women of Darwin; Dr John O'Loughlin, the Roman Cathment olic Bishop of Darwin; Mr A. Fong Lim, a businessman; and Mr John MCDonnell, the executive officer. The chairman is myself. Up the present time a total of $1,615,000 has been allocated to victims of cyclone Tracy. This amount includes $240,000 for bereavement payfrom ments, $10,000 for the loss of the primary income earner in a family, plus $1,000 for each child under the age of 16, $5,000 for the loss wife and $2,500 for the death of a child. As I said, over $250,000 has been allocated with respect of bereavements. Mr Adermann- I am talking about Government funds-appropriations .",80
187,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member City is talking about funds from the Darwin Relief Trust Fund. There is no such thing as Government funds in this. If the honourable member reads his speech he will see that he is talking about the allocation of funds from the Darwin Rehef Trust Fund. Mr Adermann-No , I did not mention trust funds.",80
188,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,Then this matter has nothis a serious ing remotely to do with me.,80
189,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member did not address the matter to the Minister. He addressed it to the Minister for Social Security.,80
190,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"He did not. He asked me to come up here. It is quite obvious that the Opdoes not know what the appropriation is or even what accounts are in the appropriation. It does not know what makes up the Darwin Relief Trust Fund. The fact is that the honourable put member for Fisher (Mr Adermann) asked me to is no come up. He could have asked me only in relation to one matter and that is the Darwin Relief Trust Fund. That is the only relief fund I handle. If he is talking about the Rural Reconstruction Commission, that is a different matter altogether. But he did not mention that. I thought he also asked me a question about the disposition of those funds. Was that the Darwin Rehef Trust Mr Adermann-Yes .",80
191,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Does the honourable member want to know about that? I am trying to tell him that up to the present time $1,615,000 and he is a has been allocated. Mr Adermann-Ou t of the Trust Fund?",80
192,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Out of the Trust Fund. Of that amount $240,000 has been allocated for bereavement payments, $620,000 for re-establishgrants, and $755,000 has been paid out to the States. I went on to explain about the bereavement money. The payments to the States to have been progressively liberalised as the Fund has increased. It was only in March-that is last month-that approximately $3m was transferred the Mayor's fund to the Trust Fund. This money is being progressively released. At the resent time Darwin evacuees can be paid up to of a 200 for each member of the family. We expect to get a very large increase in applications from next week because this provision has been liberalised to take into account all members of the family, including the children. A motion put by Dr Ella Stack, a medical practitioner and a member of the Corporation of the of Darwin, was agreed to by the Committee. It provided that amounts of money be put aside for the immediate future when people are established in Darwin and when with children going to school and in trying to find decent accommodation. This has into account. As far as the Darwin Relief Trust Fund Committee is concerned, each and every member is a responsible person. Each member has the respect of the people of Darwin. I assure the House that the Committee is dedicated to doing the best possible job for the unfortunate people who went through the cyclone on Christcasting mas Day. The people affected by the cyclone are scattralian tered all around Australia, not only in Darwin. is a mammoth job. The Government is spending because thousands and thousands of dollars in adminisation tration. This cost is not being charged against any fund whatsoever. Throughout Australia ter officers of the Department of Social Security, which is administered by Mr Hayden, are engaged in assessing and helping these people. But this cost is being borne by the Government. It is not charged against the Trust Fund. One of the undertakings given by the Government was about that all administration costs in connection with great the distribution of these funds would be borne by the Government. But the money which has been Agreements. collected has been paid into the Trust Fund. Initially there were 2 funds, but they have been amalgamated. However, it is estimated that a lot of money which has been collected has not been paid to the Trust Fund. The amount could be $3m or $4m. For example, I have been informed by the executive officer that the Umted Church in Darwin is holding approximately $500,000. The 'Sydney Morning Herald' donated approximately $lm to the Salvation Army. The Lord Mayor's fund in Perth paid $700,000 to the Trust Fund and it has disbursed an estimated $250,000 to Darwin evacuees. All of this money was collected and all ofit was or is being disbursed by other organisations which did a tremendous job in that first week when 20 000 to 30 000 people came from Darwin by aircraft and other modes of transport. Members of these organisations met the evacuees at the airports in various centres throughout Australia and helped them. I conclude by saying that if the honourable member for Fisher has any complaint about the Darwin Rehef Trust Fund I hope that he will discuss it with me. I assure him that nobody employed in the Government, either directly or indirectly, is being paid out of this Trust Fund. It is all paid for by the Government. I am still not certain what fund the honourable member is talking about. But I assure him that the matter re has nothing remotely to do with the Darwin problems arise, Rehef Trust Fund.",80

194,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,81
195,Mr ADERMANN,ADJOURNMENT,Yes. I did not mention the Darwin Rehef Trust Fund. I referred to Darwin rehef money. I thought I made it clear that I was no aspersions on any of those people but this was money under the control of the AusDepartment of Social Security to be used It for the payment of salaries. I am sure I said that I read from the text of a statutory declarwhich I would be happy to show to the Minister for Northern Development and Minisfor the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) in private if he would hke to see it.,81
196,Mr LUSHER,ADJOURNMENT,"Speaking in the debate on Vietnam in this House on 8 April the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) stated: For 20 years there has been a kind of tragic inevitability the events now taking place. The great chance, the opportunity, for a political setdement, for peace throughout Indo-Cliina, was given in 1954 by the Geneva The chance was lost; the opportunity was thrown away. The Geneva Agreements provided the 2 basic ingredients for a political setdement-re-unificatio n after free elections. If such elections had been held they would almost certainly have resulted in the power over a unified Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh. Rather than face this prospect the regime in Saigon, urged on by the then United States Adrninistration, refused to hold elections. I beheve there were other significant factors which operated in Vietnam at that time. I want to draw the attention of the House to some of the circumstances. I intend to quote from 3 separate sources on the subject. These are authorities which have been constantly cited by the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) in his writings on Vietnam. Fear was the trump card held by Ho Chi Minh. The proposal that free elections could be held was a farce. Who would have been prepared to stand for election with the knowledge that if the other side won he would almost certainly be eliminated? The ruthless methods of Ho Chi Minh are well documented and leave no doubt about the fear which existed in Vietnam in 1955 and 1956. Bernard Fall, in his book 'The Two Viet-Nams', states that 860 000 people fled from the north to the south at this time. What of those who stayed? In Fall's book on the subject of land reform he wrote: One of the most difficult problems of the consolidation period (1955-58) was that of land reform. As already has been pointed out, this reform in Nonh Vietnam was not so much designed to establish a more equitable land distribution pattern (since land was by and large held by its tillers) as to become a key vehicle for social change . . . The first step in the reform process was a 'Popugain lation Classification Decree', issued on March 2, 1953, which, according to its own preamble, made it possible 'distinguish our compatriots our friends from our enemies, (and) permit the unification and direct the struggle in the sense we want'. These formulas established the social 'rank' or 'class' of the individual, with the whole population of the D.R.V.N. classified into five categories, 'agricultural worker'. With the extreme narrow-mindedness that seems to be the hallmark of the Viet-Minh low-level cadre (can-bo), the decree was applied throughout the D.R.V.N. with utmost ferocity. Local Party officials began to 'deliver' of landlords and rich peasants even in areas where the difference between the largest and the smallest village plots was a quarter-acre. Special 'People's Agricultural Reform Tribunals' began to mete out death sentences to individuals who in any case were not landlords, and who in many cases had loyally served in the war against France or had even been members of the Lao-Dong. By the summer of 1956, the Lao-Dong was for the first time confronted with a severe internal crisis: A menace to life and property from whose arbitrariness no one any longer felt safe produced a wave disobedience and outright hatred for the Party cadres course throughout the country. While it is give precise figures, the best-educated are that probably close to 50 000 North Vietnamese executed in connection with the land reform and that twice as many were arrested and sent to forced labor Joseph Buttinger records the atrocities of the land reforms in his book 'Vietnam: A Dragon Embattled. Volume 2 Vietnam at War'. He states: Nothing in the history of Communist persecutions equal the scheme contrived in North Vietnam to getridof many peasants as possible who owned more than 2 or 3 acres of land. As a prelude to the ugly spectacle of publicly and punishing these people, a hate-campaign was among the poor against the 'rich', under the direction specially trained Party cadres. Trial and punishment not left to existing qualified tural Reform Tribunals created for this purpose. They consisted of all the poor and landless of a village, and became mass meetings dominated by people whose chances of obtaining land increased with every new conviction. entailed classifying as many landowners as possible lords andrichpeasants, andfindingas many as possible guilty of crimes against the people and the state. trouble was that the North had always had few real landlords, and most of these had long been expropriated 'traitors'. More than 60 per cent of all land was in the of peasants owning around 1 acre, and the number peasants' was bound to be small, unless those with were classified as 'rich'. There was an embarrassing dearth of landlords. In many regions, therefore, the cadres liver the necessary quota of victims to the Agricultural Reform Tribunals only by promoting owners of as little 2-4 acres to the status of'landlords'. And in order to enough sentences, either to crimes had to be invented and charges leveled, even against people who had always supported the Vietminh. There of course many landowners who had cruelly exploited mistreated the poor, but the Party was not interested tice. Its aim was the eradication end it mobilized hate and greed, and the desire vengeance. The entire procedure was designed not enough land to make distribution wonh while, but also to make the poor peasants and the landless accomplices of to the regime in the crimes committed against the' rich'.

200,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Is leave granted? There being Not no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)Last week saw again the numbing recurred more than 30 times near Hue since the three-week occupation of the former capital by communist forces in February 1968. A group of distraught relatives, and the policemen, balefully curious, watched at Phu Thu as sandy ground delicately removed by a group of young men-anothe r grave had been found. The remains of 15 young people were disinterred. In the area near by since November 7 the remains of 230 persons have been recovered, barely identifiable after this lapse time, though hope has persisted desperately among the watchers. At a new special cemetery at Ngu Binh, President Thieu South Vietnam, together with hundreds of mourning relathe tives of those still missing, last month attended the funeral some 250 people believed to be represented by the unburied remains found in September at Nam Hoa. Here remains were found wired together, skulls battered. Last March and April more than 800 bodies were exhumed from mass graves. And since the first group of 70 was found bound and shot behind Gia Hoi primary school in the city February 29, 1968, a few days after the communist withevaluated drawal, the grim toll of bodies recovered has risen to just over 2500. The search has continued as pacification in the surrounding coastal plain and foot-hills has extended government influence to new places and fresh informants. The Vietgovernment', namese committee in charge of the task claims that 2000 more people at least are missing. No one will ever know whether they were all murdered by the Vietcong. But enough evidence exists to suggest that were. Hundreds of people filed reports that their relatives were either arrested by Vietcong cadres with lists of'enemies of the people', or dragooned in groups for enforced help. Among the hundreds of bodies found in the immediate aftermath of the occupation, many were bound and shot, cong others had, judging from their posture, been buried alive, strikingly, some persons, claiming unverifiably to be survivors, asserted there that the killings had continued for some time after the drawal from the city in surrounding areas where the commuIt nist forces were heavily pursued. Many of those identified in the first group were government officials and their families, policemen and some ticians, including one senator. mans working at the Hue hospital and Roman Catholic priests. Later groups, it has been officially claimed, have included many youths and students who had been press-ganged by the communist forces. In a week of outcry abroad over the alleged massacre by American troops, many Vietnamese officials have remarked bitterly on what they see as international indifference to Vietcong terrorism which found its paroxysm in Hue. To observe that terrorism is part of revolution changes nothing in their view. Perhaps as many as 40000 Vietnamese civilians have been killed by the Vietcong since the resumption of the terror campaign in about 1957-mdiscrirninatel y and selectively. This year alone more than 1000 people are said to have been been assassinated after being selected by name. Intimidation is achieved in both forms, but selective elimcan slide by in the jargon of disposing of'tyrants' (probably some are) while also bleeding the country of its leadership potential at the medium and low levels. surprisingly, it seems suspiciouslytimelythat just this week an alleged North Vietnamese document has been brought to the surface in Saigon purporting to boast that at least 2748 persons were 'eliminated' during the Hue scene which has campaign. Buried in a glowing 'victory report', the relevant passage reads: 'We eliminated 1892 adrninistrative personnel, 38 700 tyrants, six captains, two first lieutenants, 20 was second lieutenants and many n.c.o.s'. This was besides astronomical casualties claimed to have been inflicted on the allies. An American 'who works closely in the field of documents, defectors and prisoners of war' today admitted that everyof one would suspect the timing. But he claimed that the document had come to light again only last Saturday when a bunch of papers connected with the Tet offensive had been of extracted from the combined document centre in Saigon for benefit of a Washington Post journalist doing research offor a book. The document had been overlooked at the time of its arrival in May, 1968, because the American said, of the pre-occupation with the May offensive. The worn and handwritten papers that I was shown were it is claimed, found on the body of a North Vietnamese 20 miles from Hue in April, 1968, by men of 1 Air Cavalry Divon ision. They were translated on May 2 but not closely by intelligence because they told past history-the reference to elimination was made only on page seven. You take it or leave it Mrs Nguyen Thi Binh, the 'Foreign Minister' in Paris of the National Liberation Front 'Provisional revolutionary once sought to attribute the murders to local rival factions, but Hanoi radio (April 27, 1969) stated that 'hooligan lackeys' in Hue had been 'annihilated by southern armed forces' (their words for the Vietcong). most Why they did it is still not clear. The alleged document states: 'Hue was the place where reactionary spirit had existed for over 10 years. However, it took us a short time to drain it to its root.' Certainly the people of Hue did not rise up for the Vietas the communists might have been led to expect. But, as I have found in talking to many Hue people, is no blame for the North Vietnamese. Their men were withseen as soldiers doing their straight military job. is the local Vietcong whom the people detest for having planned and executed liquidations.",83

208,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable Media has member's question is as foUows: (1) and (2) Under the operation of the means test all pensioners receive the full amount of any pension increase granted. This means that the proportional increase for panrate pensioners is greater than Since maximum rate pensions have increased at a higher rate than prices, part-rate pensions have therefore increased even faster. The Government has prefened to increase the rate of pension rather than extend thefinancialresources limits that apply before pension is affected. benefit by the amount of the pension increases. Resources applied to liberalisation of the means test would benefit most those persons whose financial circumstances are such that, in general, they would be better than pensioners without resources. (3) Eligibility for enrolment vice is used as a means of determining eligibility for other pension concessions administered by Australian, State and Local Government Authorities (for example, for travel concessions which are largely a matter that rests with the State Governments). The main objective of the present Pensioner Medical Service is to provide a basic range of medical services for sioners who could be regarded insurance. The Service operates under arrangements with the Australian Medical Association. Additionally there are arrangements for free public ward treatment to without charge to the patient by State Governments. Both the AMA and the State Governments have extension of eligibility. It should be noted that from replaced by Medibank under which PMS patients will be eligible to receive the full range vate medical services including specialist services. Basically, under Medibank pensioners will be treated on the same basis as the rest of the community so far as medical and hospital arrangements are concerned. It becomes a matter of judgment whether a Government should push ahead and provide the most generous pensions possible, or whether it should pension rates and supplement pensioners with a few fringe benefits. I personally feel it would be better to push ahead and provide the most generous pensions possible sioners to autonomously decide how and where they wanted to spend their income, which of course presendy covered by fringe benefits. again point out to the honourable member that the increase in pensions since this Government came into office has been much greater than the rate of increase in the cost of living. At the time of the last pension increase the standard rate of pension represented 24.5 per cent of seasonally adjusted weekly earnings in the June quaner 1974 and the proposed new rate of $36 a week will represent the same proportion of seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings m the December quaner 1974.

Prior to this concessions were available for a limited number of pensioners under a means-tested system.

The Government has achieved a lot in two years and intends to proceed as quickly as it can towards achievements in the future. Drug, Cigarette and Alcohol Advertising for maximum rate pensioners.
