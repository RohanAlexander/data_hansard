1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. G. J. Bell) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA RESERVES.",12
2,Mr HUTCHINSON,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"Yesterday the Minister for External Affairs said that the Allies were in possession of approximately five-sixths of the Dutch oil reserves and that the remaining one-sixth had been rendered useless. In a broadcast at 7 o'clock last night it was stated that Germany had seized most of the Dutch oil reserves. As these two statements are at variance, can the Minister supply accurate information on the subject? Further, can he make a statement as to the truth or otherwise of the statement appearing in this morning's press that Germany has gained possession of approximately £26,000,000 of Dutch gold?",12
3,Mr MCEWEN,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"The honourable member was not accurate in his reference to my statement yesterday. I then said that, official advice received by the Government was that of a quantity of 450,000 tons of oil in Holland, five-sixths had been destroyed and the other onensixth rendered unfit for use, before the Germans completed the occupation of north Holland. That is the official advice received by the Government, and I have no doubt that it is accurate. As to the report that the Germans have secured possession of £26,000,000 of Dutch gold, I have no information on the subject, but the Government has been informed that Dutch bullion was removed to England prior to the German occupation of Holland. Whether all of it had been removed, or whether £26,000,000 remained, I am 'unable to say. The Government has no information on that subject. INTERNATIONAL OUTLOOK. ITALIAN AND AMERICAN ATTITUDE.",12
4,Mr BEASLEY,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"Can the Minister for External Affairs inform the House of the latest authoritative news regarding the movements, or likely decisions, of the Italian Government in relation to affairs in Europe? Can he say what the attitude of the United States of America is, and whether the Government has received any information in regard to this matter through its representative at Washington ? Further, can he say whether there are any means whereby members of this House can be informed more fully of international developments, and the attitude of the Government towards them?",12
5,Mr MCEWEN,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"As to the first part of the honourable member's question, the Government has been advised daring recent weeks of what, I think, may fairly be described' as the progressive deterioration of the attitude of the Italian Government towards the Allied governments. It has heen informed by the Australian Minister in Washington that, during the last 48 hours, President Roosevelt himself has directed a personal appeal to Signor Mussolini for the maintenance of peace. I am unable to. give to the honourable member any information whatever as to the effect of that appeal in the quarter to which it was directed.",12
6,Mr BEASIJCY,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"What is the general attitude of the United States of America,?",12
7,Mr MCEWEN,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"I take it that the honourable member refers to the Government of the United States of America. The general and consistent attitude of the Government is to exert every effort that it properly can exert towards the maintenance of peace in both hemispheres. The honourable member asks whether it would not he possible for this Government to give more accurate' and intimate information to honourable members as to international relations generally. I have endeavoured to keep honourable members apprised of events, hut they will understand that it is not possible for the Government to.take.the public fully into its confidence in relation to every aspect of international affairs. ' Mr JAMES - Surely the members of this-Parliament have a right to know?",12
8,Mr MCEWEN,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,As to the general relations between the nations we cannot read in advance what is in the minds of other nations. The Government can only form - opinions in regard to many matters. NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES.,13
9,Mr JENNINGS,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"""What is the present position regarding the Dutch East Indies and also Dutch New Guinea? In view of the existing international situation, can the Minister for External Affairs say whether assurances have been received that those territories are being adequately safeguarded ?",13
10,Mr MCEWEN,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"The Government has been advised by the Government of the Netherlands that, notwithstanding what may be the fate of the Netherlands in Europe, the Governor General of the Netherlands East Indies has had delegated to him complete authority in respect of the government of those colonies, and has under his control adequate forces to maintain internal security there.",13
11,Mr BEASLEY,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,What about security from external attack?,13
12,Mr MCEWEN,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"That is a matter upon which only an opinion can be formed. The Government of the Netherlands is still intact, although at present it is domiciled in London. I take this opportunity to make it clear that the Government of the Netherlands has indicated to the governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States of America and Japan that it desires and requires no interference or help from any outside power in the maintenance of the independence of the Netherlands East Indies. Each of those governments has replied that it concurs. That is a separate and considered policy of the governments of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, as well as of the United States of America and Japan.",13
13,Mr BEASLEY,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"""Was not that the advice that they tendered in regard to Holland, which afterwards was invaded ?",13
14,Mr HARRISON,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"Has the Minister for External Affairs any information as to whether the Dutchfleet,which recently sailed for England, is to be stationed in the Netherlands East Indies, as this is a matter of vital importance to Australia",13
15,Mr MCEWEN,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"The major portion of the Dutch fleet has always been stationed in the Netherlands East Indies; only minor units have been in the home waters of the Netherlands. Those vessels are, I ' understand, now operating in conjunction with the Royal Navy. INTERNEES.",13
16,Mr WARD,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"Some time ago I asked the Minister for the Army if he would permit me, and other honourable members, to peruse the list of names of persons who had been interned at the outbreak of war; those who were subsequently released and re-interned; and also those still in custody. The.Minister said that, out of consideration for the national safety, my request could not be granted. I now ask him whether he will reconsider his decision, and advise me in what way the national safety would be affected by granting my request.",13
17,Mr STREET,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"I see no reason to alter my previous decision in this matter, and I am sure that, upon reflection, the honourable gentleman will realise that it is most undesirable that the lists of such individuals should be given publicity in any way. SOLDIERS' DEPENDANTS.",13
18,Mr HOLLOWAY,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"In view of tie congestion in the offices of the Defence Department, and the trouble which honourable members experience because of the growing number of requests by widowed parents of soldiers in the Australian Imperial Force for the same treatment as is given to married dependants, will the. Minister for' the Army take steps to ease the situation? I understand that officers of his department are awaiting a decision in this matter. The numbers of persons affected runs into some hundreds.",13
19,Mr STREET,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"It is confidently hoped that a decision in this matter will be reached some time, today. NEW GUINEA. ROAD: CAPITAL SITE.",13
20,Sir CHARLES MARR,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"Can the Minister for External Territories say whether any progress has been made with ? the building of a road to the New Guinea gold-fields? Has any route been decided upon; has work commenced, or is it likely to commence in the near future? Further, can he say whether, in connection with a committee's recent recommendation for the establishment of a new capital of New, Guinea at Lae, the Government proposes to remove the capital from its present situation at Rabaul?",13
21,Mr NOCK,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"As to the last portion of the honourable member's question, the Government decided not to remove the capital from Rabaul, but to establish a seismograph station there, so that reasonable warning may be given of probable volcanic activity. In regard to the proposed road, surveys have practically been completed, and the latest advice is that the department in New Guinea is about to call for tenders for the work. The Administrator of New Guinea was in Canberra recently, and discussed these matters with the Government. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. JUNIOR STOREMEN.",14
22,Mr MA HONEY,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"Some time ago 1 wrote to the Minister for the Army urging the appointment as junior storemen in the Army Ordnance Stores of men who had passed the qualifying Commonwealth examination, and he promised to take the matter up .with the Army Board. Can he now say what has been done in the matter, and if it is intended to make such appointments ? Further, can he say whether the head storeman has requested the appointment of junior storemen?",14
23,Mr STREET,DUTCH OILAND GOLD,"I have not seen any such request from the head storeman, but I shall make inquiries and let the able member know as soon as possible. NA AUSTRALIA.",14
24,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN," Yesterday, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Mahoney) asked me by the for information regarding the numthe ber of factories at present engaged of in building aeroplanes in tralia, the names of such companies concerned, and whether any of the factories were owned by the Commoninvalid wealth Government. At the present time, week ? aeroplanes are being built in Australia by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in Melbourne, which is engaged in the production of Wirraway aircraft, and by De Havilland Aircraft Proprietary Limited, Sydney, which is manufacturing Tiger Moth aeroplanes. Those factories are not owned by the Commonwealth. In addition, there are many private engineering establishments now actively engaged in the manufacture of aircraft parts for aircraft mentioned, as well as for Bristol Beaufort aircraft. Under agreement with the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, sections of the railway workshops in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide have been adapted to the manufacture of air frame components, required for the Beaufort scheme. They will be staffed by the Commonwealth Government, and will produce the main sub-assemblies. The final assembly of the completed Beaufort aircraft will be accomplished in Commonwealth factories at Mascot, New South Wales, and Fisherman's Bend, Victoria. Both of these factories are now nearing completion. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES .",14
25,Mr ANTHONY,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Has the Prime Minister received representations from various organizations, including many local-governing bodies, directing attention to the subversive activities of the Communist party in Australia, and suggesting that action be taken against it? If so, has the Government given the matterconsideration ?",14
26,Mr MENZIES,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Yes , I have received a number of the communications to which the honourable member refers. The wholematter is, and has been, under the conhonorsideration of the Government. INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",14
27,Mr JAMES,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"In view of the ever increasing cost of living, particularly in regard to necessary commodities required invalid and old-age pensioners, does Treasurer propose to take any notice the petitions recently presented by the Aushonorable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) and myself, signed by 14,000persons, praying for an increase of"" and old-age pensions to 30s. a.",14
28,Mr SPENDER,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"The honourable memcratic ber's question raises a question of policy, and it is not customary to give informafrom tion in such matters in reply to questions. DAYS OF SITTING.",15
29,Mr MENZIES,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Kooyong-Prime Minister) [10.49] - I move That the House, .at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next, at 3 o'clock p.m. Having regard to the urgent need disposing of certain legislative proposals now before Parliament and to enable Ministers to concentrate on their administo trative duties, I ask honourable members to sit on four days next week, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and to sit on five days in the following week.",15
30,Mr BEASLEY,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"West Sydney-Leade r of the Australian Labour party-non Communist) [10.50] - Why was not the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) courteous enough to inform honourable members this proposal earlier in the week? last announcement on the subject was it was intended to sit on three days of next week, and honourable members were told that they would be informed in course, and in sufficient time, of any alteration, so that they could make private., arrangements. I cannot underleader stand why the Prime Minister could not have told us on Wednesday last of his intention to alter the sitting days.",15
31,Mr BRENNAN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Batman) [10.51] I gather, by drawing an acute inference, rather than from the direct admission the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), that the motion now before the Chair is preliminary movement towards the early closing of this Parliament. reason-, I am opposed to it, and if I get but one honourable member to support ine in this chamber-and I think I can get more- I shall press it to a division. This Parliament has been in sessiona new one-for just over four weeks. I mot. in circumstances of great national disturbance and anxiety, and it hasboen engaged, in the discussion of matters serious importance, each honourable member endeavouring, at least, to repreattribute sent, to Parliament, and to the country, the views he holds on those matters. It is of the essence of the democratic system that. Parliament should meet and deliberate. It is opposed to the demoagainst the motion.. principle that bureaucracy, namely, the Executive, should snatch the Parliament and the people their right to deliberate and discus-*, and I intend to lend no countenance whatever to the Prime Minister's obvious desire to shirk discussion in this Parliament, and seek the repose and quietude of his office in order to apply a policy which has never been discussed by Parfor liament or approved by the people. On the contrary, insofar as the people have been tested, they have shown their disapproval of that policy. I was going say that I was profoundly sorry that my leader was not present, but I see Tuesday, that he is in the chamber.",15
32,Mr CURTIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,I have no objection to sitting an extra day next week.,15
33,Mr BRENNAN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"We recently regularized the sittings of this House in accordance with a well-established pracof tice, namely, that we should meet on The Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of that each week. However, hardly had we reverted to this practice, which has been hallowed by experience, before we are due presented with this motion, designed obviously to bring the sittings of Parliatheir ment to an early termination. My has stated that he has no objection to Parliament meeting on Tuesday of next week. I have this objection to it : That it is a departure from the rule for the sittings of the House which we only recently adopted. This departure from practice is unsettling to honourable of members who make arrangements in their constituencies in accordance with a their understanding of what the days of sitting are to be. If the Leader of the For that Opposition (Mr Curtin) takes this can motion for what it merely expresses, and has no suspicion that it presages the early rising of Parliament, then I have regretfully to inform my leader that I am less guileless in the matter than the is, and that I have no intention whatever of accepting the motion at its face value, when, as a matter of fact, I have of information, which I regard as being reliable, that the intention which 1 to the Prime Minister is the intention which he actually holds. In any case,. I propose to take no risk especially as a disturbance of existing arrangements-is involved,, and I shall vote",15
34,Sir CHARLES MARR,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Parkes) [10.55] - It is hard to understand the arguments of the honourable member for .'Batman (Mr Brennan). First, he suggested that democracy placed on the shoulders of members of the Parliament the responsibility to represent theii constituents in this Parliament.",16
35,Mr BRENNAN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,And to draw their allowances and go home again!,16
36,Sir CHARLES MARR,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"That may be applicable to the honourable member. He objected first that Parliament did not sit long enough, that democracy was being deprived of its privilege of representation in Parliament, and he suggested that Parliament should sit for a longer period. Well, the proposal of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) is that we should sit one extra day next week, and two extra days the week after. The honourable member complains in one breath that Parliament does not sit long enough iind, in the next, that it is proposed to sit too long. If this Parliament were made up of any considerable number of members following the leadership of the honourable member for Batman, it might be advisable to close it up altogether for the good of the Empire and the cause we have at heart. Statements have been made here during this week which must have shaken the faith of the electors in those responsible for them, Listening to some honourable members one would imagine that, the Empire, of which Australia is not an unimportant part, was merely going along its peaceful and accustomed way, instead of being engaged in a veritable death struggle. It is time that we awakened to the fact that we are at war. The present Government has upon it a greater responsibility than any preceding Commonwealth Government has had. The time of Ministers is fully occupied in the consideration of matters of great moment, and they should be given as much time ns possible for the performance of their duties, even if that meant the closing of .Parliament so that they might be able to concentrate on their work. We have the spectacle of unity in the Old Country. The whole of the British Isles are united. - Mr BRENNAN - The British Parliaview ment sits every day.",16
37,Sir CHARLES MARR,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"And in the British Parliament there are great Labour men-imperialist s and empire builders, not wreckers. Labour in the Old Country can show to my friends in the honourable gentleman's corner a great example of unity by combining with other parties to bring, this Emj)ire through.",16
38,Mr SPEAKER,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,Hon. G. J. Bell) Order! The honourable gentleman is not discussing the motion.,16
39,Sir CHARLES MARR,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,The proposal of the Prime Minister is one that should meet with the approbation of every member of this House. If Ministers are prepared to give another day to sit here and listen to some of the drivel,16
40,Mr SPEAKER,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,Order ! The honourable gentleman is distinctly out of order.,16
41,Sir CHARLES MARR,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,I make no charge against the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) and some of his supporters. The Prime Minister said the other day that the Leader of the Opposition had done a great job of work and we believe it. Certain honourable member? opposite have given all that they can give to help Ihe Government and . I pay my respects to the Leader of the Opposition and those honourable gentlemen for the part that they have played.,16
42,Mr BRENKAN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"If the honourable gentleman praises me, I shall resign.",16
43,Sir CHARLES MARR,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,The honourable member for Batman should take an example from the Leader of the Opposition and some of those who sit with him.,16
44,Mr CURTIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Fremantle-Leade r of . the Opposition) [11.2] - I suggest to the honourable member for Parkes (Sir Charles Marr) that, however great be his admiration here for the members of the British Labour party, if he were in the United Kingdom he would be still a conspicuous although inefficient tory. This admiration at long range does not help us at all. The motion is that the House at its rising adjourn until Tuesday next week, instead of Wednesday. I have no objection to that course. I have understood, and the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) has said today, that certain of the financial proposals of the Government are urgent and that it is from the point of of the Government desirable thai: the legislation should be completed early as the result of, not curtailment of discussion, but an increased number of sitting days next week. To that course I , as Leader of the Opposition, believing that the Opposition should not be muzzled and also that there should be the fullest possibility for consideration of government business, readily consented. When yesterday, in another part of this building, I intimated that consent to my colleagues, no objection was taken. That is an entirely different question from the closing of this Parliament. When a proposal is submitted to close this Parliament, which has not come before us at all",16
45,Mr MENZIES,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Hear , hear!",17
46,Mr BRENNAN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Is that so? If honourable member will assure me that the Prime Minister has not expressed his intention to close this House, I shall be satisfied.",17
47,Mr CURTIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"I say to the honourable member for Batman that my understanding is that the Government desires to sit one additional day next week in order that it might pass certain bills which, owing to the financial requirements of the Government, have now become a matter of urgency. I prefer that we should sit an extra day in order to deal with that programme in this Parliament without the use of the closure and the other devices to shorten debate than to refuse to consent to meet on Tuesday and thereby, perhaps, jeopardize the fullness of the debate.",17
48,Mr BEASLEY,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,Can the Government explain why we have been wasting time discussing an electoral bill? ',17
49,Mr CURTIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"I suggest that the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) put that question to the head of the Government, not to me. I am opposed to the social, economic, and financial policy of this Government just as relentlessly, and I hope a little more - consistently, than the honourable member for West Sydney.",17
50,Mr BLAIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,The swords are sharpening on the grindstone!,17
51,Mr CURTIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"That is all right. I - do not need to be told what my duty is. The moment I cease to discharge my duty to the satisfaction of those who have appointed me as Leader of the Opposition, there will be no delay in the appointment of another Leader of the Opposition. AThen the Prime Minister does intimate that he desires to lift this House, we should decide when and how this Parliament should meet. It will depend on the character of his statement. If the Prime Minister says that he desires a fortnight or three weeks for the purpose of carrying through the administrative tasks of the Government, which men of common sense must know is an inevitable part of government, I shall consider that proposal fully and weigh its merits, and then invite my colleagues to discuss with me what attitude we shall take. That position has not arisen today, and I ask the honourable member for the Batman not to press this matter to a division. He has indicated his point of view, and when the proposal for a long adjournment of this House is put forward it can he raised again in debate. One thing to be considered is the reference that has been made to the convenience of honourable members in their constituencies. That may be important, but I remind honourable members that I have a constituency, which has within it as many people as those of other honourable members. I am not able to make any constituency engagements of any sort or description. That applies to a number of other representatives in this Parliament, and they, I venture to say, apart from political obligations to their electorates, are entitled now and again to have regard paid to their domestic desires. I have a family, too.",17
52,Mr BLACKBURN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Bourke) [11.6] I did not know that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) would raise this point upon this motion, but it seems to be that he is perfectly justified in doing so. I do not understand that I gave approval to the Government's truncation of the session.",17
53,Mr CURTIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Hear , hear!",17
54,Mr BLACKBURN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"When I heard of the proposed lengthening of the sitting days for the next two weeks I took the proposal to be part of the speeding-up process, which takes place before a session comes to an end, and as the prelude to an early end of this session. I object to that very much, and agree with the spirit of the remarks of the honourable member for Batman. I approve of long sittings of Parliament. I should like see the House' sitting throughout the year. I approve of the House sitting four days next week if the object the change is to meet the Governin ment's convenience, but I do not approve when I know that the object is an rising of Parliament so that Parliament will be out of session and the able to legislate by administrative act under the National Security Act. I the force of the point made orable member for Batman. It is much easier for us now to discuss the principle whether Parliament is to come to an end at the end of a fortnight than it would be at the end of that period the motion for the adjournment of liament to an indefinite date. The stand taken by the honourable member for Batman is one which the people of Australia will thoroughly approve. It is one of which I thoroughly approve. Tn spite of the honourable member for Parkes (Sir Charles Marr), and largely because of his remarks, the people of Australia will approve of the protest entered by the honourable member for Batman. The honourable member for Parkes desires that Paidiament should be out of session in order that the vernment shall be able to do things without check. The only check that have on the abuse of power by a governBrennan), ment is the fact that Parliament is sitting. When Parliament is sitting administrative acts can be almost instantaneously criticized - by members, but, when Parliament is not sitting, all sorts of things are done against which there is continual protest. tinual protest is only effective if newspapers are with us, but we know that the newspapers are not with us, and that they will not voice orotests against government policy because they are behind that policy. I support the honmoment. orable member for Batman in his protest against bringing this session to an early close. The honourable member taken this opportunity to protest because he knows that if we wait until motion for the final adjournment of Parliament is submitted, we shall have very little chance of making our protest effective. 1.30.1",17
55,Sir CHARLES MARR,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"A personal to explanation, Mr Speaker. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) misquoted me when he said that of I desired that this House should remain recess. I did not say that. What 1 said was that the honourable member for early Batman (Mr Brennan) was having a bit both ways. I have no desire to see Government Parliament suspended.",18
56,Mr BLACKBURN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,I had no desire to see misrepresent the honourable member and by the honI accept his statement.,18
57,Mr SCULLIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Yarra) [11.11] - I suggest that we deal with things in their proper perspective. It. may be that the intention of the Government is to lift on the House the week after next. We are Parnot, in the Government's confidence.",18
58,Mr BRENNAN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,The Leader of the Opposition has so informed rae.,18
59,Mr BEASLEY,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Oh , that alters the whole thing.",18
60,Mr SCULLIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"I have no such knowledge. If this House is to be lifted in a fortnight, after a sitting of only six weeks, I shall join in the protests and vote against the adjournment, but I do not think that we are testing that matter on this motion, if it is pressed Goto a division. I support the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) in asking we the honourable member for Batman (Mr. or any other honourable member, not to divide the House on this motion, but to reserve it to the proper time when we shall divide on a motion for Parliament to go into an early recess. I have had the responsibility of leading a government and I can see' that it is important that the list of That confinancial proposals put forward by the the Government to meet an emergency, very similar to the list of proposals that my government put forward when it had to meet an emergency, should be passed by Parliament at the earliest possible",18
61,Mr BEASLEY,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,Ye t we have been has wasting time on an electoral bill.,18
62,Mr SCULLIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"I agree with the the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) that the Government has not the right to take the time of the House on a measure like that, for the delay of one day in passing some financial measures means the loss of money. It is urgent that the money ho collected. We approve of the measures in general, although we do so with certain criticism. That business should be put through Parliament as speedily as possible and only then should we deal with routine business. This Parliament should not go into recess, but we should sit four days a week, not only next week",18
63,Mr BLACKBURN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,All the year round.,19
64,Mr SCULLIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"I should not say that. There has never been a. Commonwealth Parliament, which has sat all the year round.",19

68,Mr SCULLIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"I agree that we should not allow a bureaucracy to develop, but there arc acts of administration, acts of detail,, which arc not for this Parliament, that have to be carried out. I reject the belief that this Parliament., after a long recess, should go into, recess again, having sat for only six weeks. I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition agrees with that point of view. But I suggest that this motion should be carried, that we should sit four days next week to clear up the financial business, and that then we should come to grips with this mutter of an early recess.",19
69,Mr ROSEVEAR,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Dalley) [11.15] - I propose to vote against the motion. I congratulate the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) upon his very timely objection to the procedure proposed by the Government. It is not my intention to split straws. Any member of this House who in the light of the exhibition we have had during the last couple ot days, of extensive consideration being given to matters that are of no account, professes to believe that the House is to meet on Tuesday of next week simply for the purpose of expediting the passage of certain financial proposals of the Government,, and does not see in the proposal the first step towards the speeding up of business with the idetf of closing P'arlia-: ment next Friday week, is easily satisfied with the assurance of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies). I am concerned, as are most honourable members,, with the way in which the Government is controlling the affairs of this country. We are given very little, opportunity to discuss its administration. It has often been suggested that we should follow the example of the House of Commons. We know that, during the war, that parliamentary institution has functioned more regularly than at any other period since the last war. Even though there is now a national government in Great Britain, and criticism of its activities is reduced to the minimum, the necessity is still realized for the Parliament to meet regularly and to have the last word, if it has any, in the conduct of the affairs of the country. Whether the Leader of the too Opposition (Mr Curtin) is satisfied or not with the assurance given by the Government does not concern me. What I am concerned about is the tendency in this country, particularly during the last couple of years, to establish a. bureaucracy in the Cabinet to govern the country by regulation, totally ignoring the wishes of Parliament. We shall not assist to break down that bureaucracy if we fall for such a suggestion as the Prime Minister has apparently made, that the purpose of the proposed extra sitting day is merely to expedite the transaction of certain government business. The right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) has said that this is not the proper time to protest. With his knowledge of parliamentary procedure, the right honourable gentle man must know that when the Government finally decides to adjourn it will be a. little too late to voice a protest. If the desire be to keep the House in session, and to retain in the Parliament control of the nation's affairs, this is the only fitting time for the making of such a protest.",19
70,Mr WARD,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"East Sydney) [11.19] - I join with other honourable members on this side of the House in protesting against the proposal of the Government to bring about an early cessation of the sittings of this Parliament. I believe that, in the present unsatisfactory state of affairs in this country, and because of the maladministration of the Government",19
71,Mr SPEAKER,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,Order ! The honourable member is out of order.,20
72,Mr WARD,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,Many things are happening in this country which honourable members regard as unsatisfactory.,20
73,Mr SPEAKER,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Order ! The honourable member must discuss the motion -, he is getting right away from it.",20

I am opposed to this Government being allowed to reach the haven of recess at the end of this month. The statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), that the proposal is that the House shall meet on one additional day next week and on two additional days in the following week, presages the definite intention that this Parliament shall adjourn at the end of the month.

90,Mr BLAIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"Northern Territory) [11.43] - It seems that the corroboree in the ranks of the Labour party, which the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) assisted by his remarks a few moments ago, may continue to develop into a tribal fight preceding a blood bath at the next elections. I cannot see how any honourable gentleman can reasonably object to the specific proposal of the motion, but as the honourable member for Batman was permitted to draw a red herring across the trail, by suggesting that be could read the Prime Minister's mind, or was a party to a little mental telebe pathy, and was consequently allowed to cast a slur upon the Executive of this country, I may perhaps be excused for saying a word or two concerning executive authority.",22
91,Mr BRENNAN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,The Prime Minister informed us of his intentions regarding the session. That was how I knew of it.,22
92,Mr BLAIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"I do not know much about the hypothetical or empirica 1 methods which' the honourable member usually applies, but I feel that I must support his remarks, and also those of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn), concerning the inadvisability of Parliament going into recess. That course should not be adopted. I do not' go so far as to suggest that that is what is in the Prime Minister's mind, bin I assert my right as a back-bencher to say that we, as back-benchers, have allowed the Executive to exert far too much authority. Back-benchers are either too lazy to do their work or they have allowed the Executive to steal their authority. About two years ago, when the present Minister for Air (Mr Fairbairn) sat on a back bench, he criticized the Government most caustically for its disregard of private members. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honourable member must discuss the motion.",22
93,Mr BLAIN,AEROPLANE MANUFACTURE IN,"I stand for the rights of back-benchers in this House. I am not a shadow of any other honourable member.

If the pressure of departmental work required Ministers to spend niore time in their departments, I am confident, that the Opposition would grant to them escaped my mind. pairs to enable them to do so.

A good deal of time is thus saved, because the Minister has not then to address himself to many of theclauses - with respect to which no explanation or information is needed, because honourable members, are thoroughly familiar with them.

150,Mr LAZZAKINI,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"Werriwa) [12.33]. - This clause deals with the posting of a postal vote prior to the close of the poll. By paragraph c it provides that a postal vote shall be valid if the envelope bearing the. .certificate is "" posted or de livered prior to the close of the p o l l "" . Will the Assistant . Minister Nock) explain what is meant by "" delivered"" ? One can understand that "" posted"" implies its having been placed in the post office and stamped. I am not altogether satisfied with the Assistant Minister's explanation in regard to the obliteration of the postmark. Is there any possibility of an elector who votes by post being deprived of his vote because of either faulty or dirty rubber stamping? At times, many envelopes have the postmark blurred in the .post office and it is hard to' tell where they are from , particularly when they come from country post offices, which have not the best of stamping machinery and consequently are not to blame. I take it that the meaning of "" delivered "" is, that either - an elector himself, or an individual on his behalf, must deliver the postal ballot paper to a registrar. If it were delivered to a returning officer, that gentleman would know that he had received it before polling day. Is it intended that the postal ballot-paper must be delivered to a registrar, and that he must certify that fact although he posts it after polling day, and that in such circumstances the vote would be formal?",30
151,Mr NOCK,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,Riverina-Assistant Minister) [12.35] - The meaning is clear; the postal ballot-paper must be delivered prior to the close of the poll.,30

154,Mr LAZZARINI,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"Werriwa) [12.36]. - The Assistant Minister's explanation sustains my objection. An elector could deliver a postal vote to a registrar in an area in which possibly there would be little means of scrutineering it , and that officer could keep it in his possession. There is not strict departmental control over the registrar, because in nine cases out of ten he may not be a full-time servant of the Electoral Department, The Assistant Minister has said that, so long as this officer stated that he had received the postal vote prior to the close of the r poll, it would not matter whether he re(Mr tained it in his possession for two or three days after the poll had'been taken.",30

157,Mr BEASLEY,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"West Sydney-Leade r of the Australian Labour party-non Communist) [12.37] - It seems to me that a returning officer in a subdivision could gather into his possession any number of postal ballot-papers which may have been either delivered or posted prior to the close of the poll, and keep them for seven days before forwarding them to the central electoral office for counting 9r investigation. If that be the provision, then undoubtedly in far-flung areas it would be competent for such votes to be in the possession of - persons who could very easily either alter the direction in which the vote was cast or make postal votes informal.

160,Mr NOCK,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"That is what has been agreed to. - Mr MULCAHY (Lang) [12.40] When the returning officer is posting ballot-papers to electors, he should also furnish them with the names of the candidates who are contesting the election. Many electors who are far distant from their electorates have no idea of what candidates are standing for election, and experience difficulty in indicating their choice on the ballot-paper. Their selection should be simplified by their being furnished with a list of the candidates who have been nominated.",31

If they do not do so they may get into trouble. - Mr BEASLEY - But what would happen in the case of a presiding officer who, while not forwarding the postal votes forthwith, yet forwarded them within the stipulated seven days? The voteswould still be valid. Presiding officers, like other persons in the' community, have their political opinions. In outback areas a station-owner may be the presiding officer, and his politics may be well known, as may, also, the politics uf the relatively few electors who vote at that particular pollingbooth. What E desire is that the nature of the postal votes recorded at remote polling places shall be made known to the interested parties forthwith, and shall not be left, without some check, in the possession of the presiding officers. There should be a scrutinyof such votes after the close of the poll.",32
173,Mr LAZZARINI,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"Werriwa) [2,20] T. hope that the amendment will not be accepted. If the Assistant Minister (Mr Nock) is even contemplating accepting it, I ask him how he would suggest that the provision of the principal act which precludes the counting of any votes at a polling place other than the head-quarters of a subdivision may be overcome? I believe that the provision that there should he no disclosure of the particulars of polling at subsidiary polling places was inserted in the Electoral Act years ago by a Labour government. Under our existing system, which has been in force for many years, all ballot-papers must be sent to the headquarters of a subdivision to be counted. It would therefore seem to be impracticable to adopt the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) without making a vital alteration of our counting system. The provision limiting the counting of votes in this way was made in order to prevent the details of polling at small and remote polling places from being published. As the honourable member himself has pointed out, it often happens that a station owner is the presiding officer at a remote polling place, and we have known of workers iii such places being victimized for having voted against the desires of the station owner. The Assistant Minister has .explained that under the regulations, postal votes delivered at a polling place must immediately be placed in the ballot box. It would not be possible, therefore, for a presiding officer to hold such votes for a period up to seven days. I am definitely opposed to the suggestion of the honourable member for West Sydney, and would offer the strongest objection to any alteration of the existing system which would permit votes to be counted at small and remote polling booths.  The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) has put very clearly the arguments against the amendment moved by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), and I agree with his view. What he has said would apply to a number of small polling places in my own electorate. There is another difficulty in accepting the amendment. Section 96 of the principal act providesA t the scrutiny the divisional returning officer shall produce all applications for postal vote certificates and postal ballot-papers, and shall produce unopened all envelopes containing postal votes received up to the close of the poll, and shall{a) compare the signature of the elector on each postal vote certificate with the signature of the same elector on the application for the certificate and allow the scrutineers to inspect both signatures; That .procedure could not be followed if thu amendment were accepted.",32
174,Mr BEASLEY,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"I have provided for that in the final scrutiny.  that the present practice is about as good as can be devised, having regard to all the cirsniustances. - Mr GANDER (Reid) [2.26] - I can see no necessity for altering the present system of postal voting, and I speak from a practical experience of about a quarter of a century. At present, an elector who desires to record a postal vote must make an application for a postal voting-paper on the prescribed form. This is sent to the appropriate divisional returning officer, who returns the paper to the applicant. The recording of the vote must then he witnessed by a Justice of the Peace. The returning officer finally compares the signature on the application form with the signature on the postal ballot-paper. Eor this reason, all postal votes must be returned to the divisional returning officer for counting. Under this proposal, presiding officers in remote places will be allowed to count postal votes.",33
175,Mr NOCK,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"No ; such votes can be counted only at the 'head office. Mr GANDER, - In outlying places many candidates do not have any scrutineers at all, so that there is no one to check the presiding officer when he counts the postal votes.  them, and it is not proposed that he shall do so. Mr GANDER,-If that be the position, I have no more to say.",33

If presiding officers are given the right to count votes in remote places, where there are no scrutineers, anything may happen. Even if everything were fair and straightforward, nasty insinuaof tions might he made and stigmas would attach to men who are perfectly honest. Although the present method is not pervernment fect, it is better than one which permits presiding officers in remote places to count votes. If that were allowed, not only would there be no advantage, but also unnecessary expense would be incurred. I prefer that the act shall remain as it now is.",33
177,Mr BLACKBURN,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"Bourke) [2.32] I rise mainly to admit that I was mistaken in my reading of section 92 of the act. That section does provide for the delivery of postal votes to the presiding officer, but only in exceptional cases, where there is a last minute delivery and insufficient time for the vote to reach the divisional returning officer. Only in those circumstances can an authorized witness deliver a vote to a presiding officer. The votes are placed in boxes, and the whole procedure is hedged around with safeguards, the chief of which is that no one but the divisional returning officer may open the envelopes. Section 96 provides that only the divisional returning officer may open them, after he has produced them unopened to the scrutineers. Upon the postal votes being opened, the divisional returning officer may have to make certain decisions. It seems to me that greater suspicion would be associated with postal voting if presiding officers who are not permanent officials of the electoral department, as are divisional returning officers, were authorized to open votes. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) said that the presiding officer should be allowed to open postal ballot-papers because he cannot be trusted to hold them. If he cannot be trusted to hold them, he certainly should' not be allowed to open them and make a provisional decisionupon theim The divisional returning officer is much more familiar with the act, and is far more likely to be fair and impartial in dealing with these matters than is a presiding officer who, possibly, has been engaged for the day and is probably partisan in his outlook. I trust that the honourable member for West Sydney will not persist with his amendment.",33
178,Mr BEASLEY,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"West Sydney-Leade r the Australian Labour party-non Communist) [2.34] - My point has been misrepresented. The proposal of the Goprovides for a period of seven days between the handing in of the postal vote and the time that it reaches its destination. It is because of that lapse of seven days that I think it necessary for the contents of these postal voting 'envelopes to be known at the centres where the count takes place. My amendment refers to the count. Ballot-boxes from small polling booths are brought to one centre, where they are counted. The postal vote, and its envelope, become free and detached from the ballot-box. That must be so, or else the count of the ordinary votes could not take place by the presiding officer at the counting centre. The counting centre may be a town like Inverell, where, perhaps, the ballot-boxes from six or seven small poliing booths are counted. When those boxes come in they are opened, and the postal votes taken out. Postal votes may lie on the table while in the custody of the presiding officer who is counting the votes at Inverell. Why should not the scrutineers, who deal with ordinary votes, scrutinize postal votes also, and thereby make clear what the postal vote for that centre is, instead of leaving such votes in the possession of some person who may retain them for seven' days, or such period as will enable them to reach the divisional returning officer for the district within seven days of polling day?

The only answer given by the Assistant Minister to my contention is that presiding officers are bound by regulation to forward the votes forthwith'; but he cannot deny that, so long as they reach the divisional returning officer within seven days, even though they have been held back, they are still valid votes which must be counted. My amendment deals only with the counting of the votes. The Assistant Minister says that the postal votes are placed in the box, and the inference is that they are safe thereafter; but I point out that, although they go into the box, they come out of it later. They do not remain in the box until they reach the divisional returning officer.",34
183,Mr NOCK,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,I did not suggest that. They are all put together and sent to the divisional returning officer.,34

I am not questioning the reliability of the divisional returning My point is that the votes do not reach that officer in the same form as in when they were lodged in the ballot-box we at the polling booth. I repeat that in attempting to meet the needs of remote subdivisions we have widened the scope of the law in other directions. In order a check of postal votes may be made the count of other votes is made, should provide that the interested parties should know immediately the result the postal vote at each counting centre.

Scrutineers should be able to satisfy themselves that rhe count of postal votes is known to all who are interested. By altering the existing legislation to meet conditions in remote places, we make it possible for presiding officers to hold postal votes too long. It is not sufficient that they may be liable to punishment for a breach of the regulations. The point is that votes which have been - detained are valid so long as they reach the divisional returning officer within seven days.",34

A presiding officer's mistakes cannot invalidate a vote; his duty, according to the regulations, is to forward a vote to the.divisional returning officer.

Question so resolved in the negative. .Clause agreed to -- Clause 17 -(Printing of Senate ballot papers). :. Mr NOCK (Biverina-Assistant Minis-: lev) [2-.55].^-This clause provides! that Che order-in-which the'Seriate groups-will Appear on the ballot-papers shall be determined' by draw instead of, as at present,"" by aljjhabetical calculation. The. order of the names of the candidates within a group shall, - except where those candidates have expressed a mutual desire for a particular order, 'be determined by draw; and the order of the names of the ungrouped .candidates-whic h will continue to be placed after the groups-shal l l>e-determined by dra w. ' ; 1 Theproposed method of placement will (jqualize the chances of all Senate groups so far as ballot-paper position is concerned; and also, to the extent it applies, the chances of the individual candidates: to priority-;6f position. This, it isconsidered, will provide a much fairer method of :placement than the one now im'use. It . . w i ll remove entirely any advantage - or handicap in placement derived merely from the possession of a particular name, and, in consequence, it should restrain airy! tendency, that-might otherwise develop in the selection of candidates/b'f-placing a premium on those whose names happen to commence with ii n early Tetter of the alphabet. ' Mr DRAKEFORD (Maribyrnong) [2.56] - The clause proposes a drastic change of the existing system. I believe, that honourable members will agree with me that the Assistant Minister (Mr. Nock) has failed to state any good reason why a change should be made. He has merely said that the clause proposes a fairer' method of placing names on the ballot-paper. In what way is the present method unfair? Many members of Parliament whose names begin with letters near the end of the alphabet would prefer that their names should remain in their usual positions on the ballot-papers because, under the present system, electors know where to look for the names of the candidates whom they support. Senate ballot papers are usually long and, if the 1Government's proposal were implemented, electors would be obliged to go to a great deal of trouble to find the names of their candidates. At present they know exactly where to look for the name of a candidate beginning with "" S "" or "" W "". Interested voters would not record their votes merelyby, marking the ballot-paper from begin1 ning to end in alphabetical order. The object of any amendment of the electoral law should - be to make voting more readily understandable to disinterested people^ and tocreate greater interest. According to the Government's proposed amendment, the nameof a candidate, beginning with, say, "" P "" mightoften appear, at. the head of theballotpaper, followed by an "" A , "" "",B-'-'-..or "" B"". - -' ....  ' with that? -- :.,-! -' : - Mr DRAKEFORD - Take , for example, the name of a candidate beginning with "" S"". Under the present sys.tom-:voters would know exactly i where, ; to look for his name, particularly if he; : hadcontested previous elections*: .They would have to - waste time searching:for-it if it were jumbled up with all other; names. Senate elections involve more informal votes than any other form of election in Australia. Thousands of informal votes are cast at each Senate election, and I believe that the Government's proposal would increase the number of informal votes, if it were implemented All honourable members should be opposed to .anything that is likely toincrease informal voting. So. far the, Minister has failed toprove, that anydefinite, advantage will be derived from, the Government's amendment and, unless he does give such proof, honourable mem:bers should vote against the clause. Some : honourable members may vote in favour of it simply because it is a Government proposition, but I point out that the elec-. toral reform should, be treated as a non-party matter. ",35
193,Mr DRAKEFORD,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"I think the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson) will' agree that the Government must give some adequate reason why the amendnient should be made, before honourable members should lend their support to it. What improvement; can result from this amendment? The names of candidates would merely be placed in envelopes, dropped into a box by the presiding officer, juggled about in the presence of any electors who might care to attend, and then withdrawn from the box in such a confused order that the electors wooild\ :find it difficult to record an intelligent vote.",36
194,Mr NAIRN,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,But the last division shows that this bill is being treated as almost a non-party measure.,37
195,Mr DRAKEFORD,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"It showed that the Opposition, when it sees a proposal put forward which it does not believe to be of. advantage to the electors, feels compelled to vote against it. I am forced to believe that the Government is supporting this measure for the political advantage that it will reap from it.  advantage.",37
196,Mr DRAKEFORD,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"We could have had a noivparty investigation of the electoral system and recommendations made r upon which we could agree, hut the Government did not want an investigation. It wants a bill that suits it and it is prepared to force the Opposition to accept that bill whether it is good, bad or indifferent - --This clause, introduces .into the Electoral Act a lottery. Such a thing should form no part of the electoral machinery. If the clause is agreed to there will be a regrettable increase of informal votes. .  The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford) showed remarkahle imaginative powers when he said that this bill had been introduced for the purpose of giving to the Government an advantage at the elections. This clause confers benefit on no political party. All (hat it does is give an equal chance to all candidates for election to Parliament, irrespective of initial letters of surnames. I.t will not assist the United Australia party, the Country party or the Labour party, the one more than the other. The honourable member said that good reason would have to be shown for the need for the change proposed in this clause before he would support it. The mere fact that there is today in pre-selection ballots a premium on the candidates whose names begin with the letter "" A "" is itself good and sufficient reason for altering the system in order that the man whose name begins with "" W "", "" Y or any letter other than "" A "" will have just as good a chance as the man whose name begins with "" A "" . This clause provides a good way of getting out of the difficulty, although there is still an element of chance and of slight advantage in that one group will occupy the left-hand section of the ballot-paper, the second group the middle section and the third group the righthand section. There may be an advantage to the party which is fortunate enough in the ballot to get the left-hand section, because we are accustomed to writing and reading from left to right, but the advantage will be less than now when the names are placed vertically. The system proposed is as good as can be devised to bring about the greatest possible degree of equality.",37
197,Mr MAHONEY,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"Does the honourable member know of any other country which employs a system similar to that which is proposed in this clause.  mind, hut I should not think that the honourable member would be so conservative - as to need - hundreds of precedents elsewhere before setting about a reform. I should think that the honourable gentleman would be progressive enough to move along a new track if he thought that there was an advantage in doing so. I think that there is an advantage in this clause.",37
198,Mr MAHONEY,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"For the voter or the candidate?  to no party, but it is an improvement in that it. does a.way with the premium on the initial "" A "". The mere fact that the Labour party in New South Wales at the last - Senate election nominated a team of four gentlemen all of whose names begin with the letter "" A "" is in itself significant.",37
199,Mr ROSEVEAR,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"It is funny that the Government did not wake up to that until the last Senate election.  waken now than to remain in somnolence indefinitely.

The Labour the party has recognized the special quality is the of those .whose names begin with that letter to such a degree that, before the last Senate election, it conducted a diligent by search throughout New South Wales, in the particular, and other States for likely legislators with that distinctive beginning "" bobto their names.

The proposals in a.de by ..the Government give a degree of equality to everybody. It is true, as the honourable, member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear ) has said, that, even if the proposed change be made, a man may still find himself at the top, middle or bottom of the ballot-paper; but the outstanding point of this legislation is that political knowing that there is! an. element of chance as to where .their candidates' names will be placed on the ballot-papers, instead of being sure of the top position, will look, for the best candidates, irrespective of what their names be. Therefore, I think that, by .passing this legislation, the committee would do a great service, particularly to members of the Labour party whose name does not begin with the letter "" A "". Those whose names begin with '"" S "", "" R "" or "" W "" would have equal chance of selection as Senate candidates because the position in which the names were to appear on the ballot paper would not be known. I suggest that common sense, fairness, and equality to all, dictate that the Government proceed with the legislation it is now endeavourwig to pass. Last night I mentioned that in the electorate of Richmond, 15,000 first preference votes wore cast for the Labour candidate who stood for election to the House of Representatives. man campaigned for six or seven weeks. His name was a household word throughout the electorate. He was a man of very high repute, and was held in high regard and esteem personally. But the unknown "" A's "" of the Senate team polled 17,000 votes. That is to say, these absolutely unknown candidates polled for Labour 2.000 more votes than were polled by the accredited Labour candidate for the House of Representatives. I suggest to any honourable member who cares to approach the matter from a fair, reasonable and impartial point of view, that that affords absolute evidence of the. fact that the holding of the top position on the. ballo.tMr Anthony. paper resulted in the addition of at least 2,000 to the "" A "" team for the Senate.

210,Mr MARTENS,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"The only difficulty of the Government party was that they could not select three "" Aarons"". ' The one "" Aarons "" who was selected was subsequently withdrawn, when it was found that the group could not obtain the top position. It is all ""hooey"" to say that this National Parliament should so far degrade itself .as to place names in a box, and draw to determine which, group shall occupy the most favoured position. Honourable members ought to go into a paddock with two pennies on a kip, and toss the pennies into the air, eliminating one name at a time. This is just as much a gamble as that would be. No more degrading suggestion has ever been made in any parliament than that the returning officer should be asked to place names in a box and draw for positions, the fortunate ones being placed on the left-hand side and those less fortunate somewhere else. Nothing more degrading conld be brought into this Parliament. Why not put legislation into a hat and draw it out? That would be .just as logical as this proposal, which is an insult to the intelligence of the people. I marvel at the temerity of the Government in asking us fo agree to the drawing of lots to - determine where men shall have their names placed on the ballot-pa.per. The present practice has been in operation for fifteen years, and was not questioned until in New South Wales-so it is alleged-the deliberate attempt was made to select four candidates whose names commenced, with A "". I remind honourable members that that was the first time there had been such an-occurrence, and it may be the last. Because the Government alleges that something which happened in New South Wales might happen everywhere else, it brings forward this proposal. I want to know why a man whose name begins with A "" should have that name put in - a hat, so that it may not appear at the top of the ballot-paper. I agree with the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) that in everyday life the alphabet is followed when information is being sought. I do not believe that the top of the ballot-paper offers the enormous advantage suggested by honourable members. The majority of the electors know who their candidates are. A certain number of them may go from the top to the bottom of the ballot-paper. 1 challenge contradiction of I be statement that some electors vote 1, 2, 3, for all of the groups, believing them all to be the same. It is illogical, unfair, degrading to put names in a-hat and draw then:! to determine the positions they shall occupy on the ballot-paper. It is worthy only of a government of this kind.",39
211,Mr MAHONEY,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"Denison) [3.25] - I do not think there was any need for this amendment. I believe that it would be wrong to draw names out of a box. We should continue the present custom, which has been in existence for many years. No doubt the Government became scared because the Labour party has in the Senate fifteen men who do not have to stand for election on the next occasion. Had the reverse been the case, I do not think that any alteration would have been proposed. On one occasion in Denison my opponent, whose name was MCPhee. was placed ahead of me on the ballot paper. I objected that "" M a l i "" came before "" He "" , but was ruled out by the returning officer. I consider that scheming will be possible under the proposed system. Honourable members probably know that there is a game called "" crow"", which is played to trap the simple or the unwary. A number of pieces of paper arc placed in a hat, and the member of the party who withdraws the piece on which is written the word "" crow "" has to shout drinks. The simple man is given first draw-, and as every piece of paper placed in the hat has the word "" crow "" written on it, he naturally is the victim. Gambling provides opportunities for cheating. We are not acting democratically in changing a system that has been in existence for many years. The reason for the proposal of the Government is that there was a definite swing to Labour at the last Senate elections. The Government has to win every Senate seat contested at the next elections in order to maintain its majority in that chamber. Consequently, it is resorting to a new method for the election of candidates. The alteration of the form of the ballot-paper is wrong, because it will confuse women voters especially. Those whose names commence, with. "" A "" should not be interfered with. Adam's name began with that letter, and Adam was the first man. This is a stupid proposal introduced solely because the Government, parties were overwhelmingly defeated at the last Senate elections. An attempt is being and made to confuse the people and to destroy an electoral system which has worked satisfactorily for 40 years. I strongly protest in the name of democracy against this effort to reduce the listing of names on the Senate ballot-paper to a gamble. We should not descend to the methods of the gambling houses and the two-up schools. We should think more of the prestige of Parliament. This is a vicious and villainous attempt to impair the dignity of Parliament. [Quorum formed.]",40
212,Mr SHEEHAN,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"Cook) [3.36] - We find the real reason for the introduction of this bill in the clause now before us. The Government parties have harboured the idea that the Labour party of New South Wales, by selecting for the last Senate elections four candidates whose surnames began with the letter "" A "" , obtained an unfair advantage. In my opinion, it is a purely mythical advantage. Among the 75 members of the House of Representatives, only one has a surname beginning with "" A "" , while (line have surnames beginning with "" S "". 1. have no doubt at all that the names of those nine members appeared last on the ballot-paper, but it was not detrimental to them. I am opposed to the proposal that the names of the various groups of candidates should be placed in the box and the box shaken before the names are drawn to determine their position on the ballot-paper. That procedure is entirely unworthy. I am also opposed to the appearance of the names of the political parties on the ballot-paper. We should not recognize political parties on our ballot-papers. What is to happen to independent candidates under system? Apparently they are to be classified in one group, and if the independent group should be drawn out of the box first when the order of parties is being determined, the names in that group will go on the left-hand side of the proposed horizontal ballot-paper. An independent candidate should not be forced to have his name grouped with that of other independent candidates. If the names are to be drawn out of a box, the independents should be regarded as individuals and not as a group, and if the name of an independent should be drawn out first, his name, as an individual, should go on the left-hand side of the ballot-paper with the other names following in the order in which they are drawn. It is, at any rate, quite unreasonable and unfair to group all independents together, for their policies might be very different. The adoption of these methods in the election of members of a democratic parliament is entirely undesirable, and I can see no reason why we should depart from the procedure which has served us well for 40 years.",41
213,Mr LANE,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"Barton) [3.37] - The reason why this proposal is before us is that honourable members of the Labour party who sit on the cross benches opposite have shown a remarkable capacity, and some degree of duplicity, in selecting certain persons as Senate candidates.",41

215,Mr JAMES,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,Does the church to which the honourable member belongs approve of the adoption of lottery systems of this kind ?,41
216,Mr LANE,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"This proposal is before us solely because of an unexampled demonstration of trickery by the ruling authorities of the New South Wales Labour party prior to the last Senate election. Apparently they scoured the country in order to find a sufficient number of individuals whose surnames began with the letter "" A "" to serve them as candidates for the Senate. We have not had any difficulties of this kind in elections for the House of Representatives. I recollect, however, that on one occasion a person named Gosling was chosen as a candidate.",41
217,Mr STACEY,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"And , of course, we all this Isnow another person named Gander.",41
218,Mr LANE,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"Mr Gosling's name was subsequently withdrawn and the name Donovan substituted. There is, however, no fair grounds for comparing the House of Representatives ballot-paper with that of the Senate, for we rarely have more than three candidates for one seat in the House of Representatives election, whereas in the Senate the number of candidates may rise as high as a dozen or more. I shall go so far as to say that probably 25 per cent, of the people do .not know who their Senate representatives are. I am quite sure that the honourable member for Reid (Mr Gander) took care to give the 1,500 aged men in institutions in his electorate a duplicate ballot-paper to ensure that they would vote as he desired. Possibly the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) did the same kind of thing in respect of - certain aged men in his constituency. The members of the Senate are largely to blame for the difficulties in which they find themselves. They are not well known to the general community in their respective States. In my opinion, it would be a good idea to pass a law to pel members of the Senate to do some active propagandist work between general elections in the various States which they represent. If the names of the honourable members of the other place were well known, certain difficulties which we are now facing would not arise. It can hardly be gainsaid, however, that the honourable members of the Labour party in the corner opposite know a great deal about fixing votes and elections. I believe that the selection as Senate candidates of men whose surnames began with the letter "" A "" was done deliberately. It was, in fact, a gamble which succeeded.",41
219,Mr GANDER,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"The honourable member is quite wrong. In any case, I ask him, what happened to Captain Aarons?",42
220,Mr LANE,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"I know Captain Aarons very well. I am sure that if he became member of the Labour party, he would give honourable gentlemen opposite military drill, which would ensure that they would be less unruly in the future. Apparently, the members of the Labour leagues and other Labour organizations throughout New South ""Wales were told, prior to the last election: "" You cannot hope to be selected as a candidate for Senate unless your surname begins with the letter ' A "" ' . When it came to dates with names beginning with B, C, D, E, F, G, and so on to the influence end of the alphabet, they said to the members "" Unless your name starts with ' A ' you cannot be selected"". votes. Honourable members opposite are silent. Their silence gives consent. If , for stance, the honourable member for Beid, or the other gentleman for whom selection, he is keeping a seat warm in this chamber- I refer to Mr .1. T. Langwanted to become a member of the Senate, he would be disqualified from pre-seleccil tion because his name does not begin with "" A "". I ask the honourable member for Beid if he can deny that. I hope that the committee will agree to the vernment's proposal, for then we shall have a Senate ballot-paper which is fair to all.",42
221,Mr GANDER,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"Beid) [3.46] - This clause contains the reason for the introduction of this measure. Notwithstanding that the Empire is at war against a com- deadly enemy, the Government has seen fit to introduce a bill, the object of which is to gerrymander the next federal election. I use the word "" gerrymander"" advisedly. The Government realizes that it has no chance of winning the next Senate elections, or even the elections for members of the House of Representatives, unless it resorts to some subterfuge whereby it can gull the people into voting for its candidates. I wish to correct the erroneous view held by members on the other side, including the honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane), that the Labour party in New South Wales, when seeking candidates to contest the Senate election, went around looking for men whose names began with the first letter of the alphabet. That is an entirely wrong conception of what took place."" Twenty thousand members of the Australian Labour party participated in a the pre-selection ballot. The names submitted to them totalled about 24, and some not all of them began with "" A "".",42

At the preballot Senator Amour received more votes than any candidate had ever received previously. Senator Amour has been an alderman of the Bankstown Counfor nine years. He has attended every Labour party conference, both country and city, in New South Wales, for ten years. When the timber workers were Goon strike in 1929 his home was a depot for feeding strikers. During the seamen's strike it was again a depot. Those occasions resulted in his becoming well known among trade unionists. While other honourable members said that the timber workers and the seamen should have returned to work,"" Senator Amour fed them, at the little depot in his private home. It is all very well for honourable members to laugh; but I ask them how many of them had food depots in their homes during the timber workers' strike; or when the miners or seamen were out of work. .Senator Ashley also is widely known throughout New South Wales. For seven years, he was mayor of Lithgow. He has heen an alderman of the Lithgow 7 Council for twelve years, and has attended Labour conferences regularly for many years. Honourable members opposite say that the selected members were hand-picked, but that is not so. Senator Armstrong is a brilliant young man who was a. fellow university student with the-honourable member for Macquarie (Mr John Lawson). He obtained a position with the Sydney City Council, and later, when he submitted his name to a pre-election ballot, he was chosen. Last on the list of the four selected men is Senator Arthur. Twenty years ago he contested the Nepean seat against Richard Orchard. He also contested the Hawkesbury seat.",42
226,Mr MCCALL,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,Did he win ?,43
227,Mr GANDER,MA RIB Y RNONG MUNITIONS,"No ; but he put up good fight on behalf of Labour. He behut came well known in the Nepean and Hawkesbury districts, and when an ophe portunity came to select candidates for the Senate, delegates said, "" Tom Arthur will do us "".

234,Mr NAIRN,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"Perth) [4.0] - A few months ago, the Commonwealth Government let a contract for the erection of a number of cottages along the TransAusfrralia railway line. Although work lay wholly within the States of South. Australia and Western Australia, the specifications provided that stoves of a pattern made by a Melbourne manuthree facturer, whose name was mentioned, should be installed. Objection was taken to this, and a Perth manufacturer of stoves was permitted to quote. Advice has now been received from the Commoninduce wealth Railways 'Commissioner that the tender of the Perth manufacturer was higher than that of the Melbourne facturer, so that the original specificaassistance. tions would be adhered to. It would have been much better if the original fications had made it possible for manuanother facturers in any part of the Commonof wealth to tender. It would be much better, also, if the Commissioner could realise that there are industries in Ade-. building. laide and Perth capable of supplying some of the requirements of the Commonfacilities, wealth Railways, and that those cities have a special interest in the Commontaking wealth Railways, which give them a right to be considered .when work of this kind is' being given out. On previous occasions I have had to complain of the discrimination exercised by the Commonwealth Railways against the industry and trado of Western Australia. For many years, goods from the eastern States, particularly Victoria, have been carried ovei the Commonwealth Railways to the goldof fields in Western Australia at rates materially below those charged on the State railways. In fact, they are being carried at a loss, and the industries of Western Australia are suffering very .materially from this unfair competition made .possible by dump freight rates on the Commonwealth Railways. I should to know why the head office and the central administration of the Commonwealth Railways are situated in Melbourne, 800 miles from the nearest point of the two railway systems under their : - control. The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner should be required to have his office in Adelaide, at least. In that case, his Victorian complex might be somewhat less pronounced. I trust that the points I have raised will receive duo consideration by the Government.",44
235,Mr HOLLOWAY,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"Melbourne Ports) [4.5] - I wish to refer to a matter which the is exercising the minds of a great many people in Australia at the present time, namely, the need for speeding up our shipbuilding programme. For the last years some of us have been trying to induce the Government to make the dry-docking facilities in Australia more modern, and to get the shipbuilding industry under .way. Two years ago we did the Government to introduce legislation the purpose of which was to encourage private firms to tender for the manubuilding of ships with Government After -.that legislation was passed, many persons, thinking that somespecithing would be done, canvassed one with the idea of sharing the work supplying internal equipment &c, for ships. Practically nothing has, however, been done yet in regard to shipA British expert was appointed to inquire into docking and to report upon the best, place for a big modern dock capable of a capital ship. I have no doubt - that he was the best man we could have obtained, and he duly made his inquiries and presented his report. All we have heard of the report so far is a newspaper statement that about £3,000,000 is to be expended on one dock in one particular State. It is not suggested, surely, that we should hold up our ship-construction programme until that dock is Even for the purpose ships worn out or lost in the ordinary course of peace-time trade, it is desirable that we should begin our programme without delay. Since the of war, however, so much shipping has been lost by enemy action, and such unusual demands have been made what remains, that it has dangerous for us to delay any.longer lest we should find ourselves without l,o take our j>roduce overseas. have recently been chartered from the United States of America, but such is the international situation at the present time that the United States of America will not continue to risk its vessels in this way. I trust that I shall not be called a little Australian because I honourable members that I represent an electorate which has historical with the shipbuilding industry in Australia. During the last war, many new vessels were built at WiUiamstown, many others were remodelled for troopcarrying. WiUiamstown was also the chief ship repairing port tralia. Since then, the Government has handed the over to the Melbourne Trust under certain conditions; although naval architects associated with it, very being done in the way of It is not a question now of whether we can build ships. That settled long ago. The question how long it will take complete a freighter of , say, tons dead weight, and what would be the cost a ton. The answer is that by adopting the British method of sharing the work among the engineering firms prepared to co-operate in the venture we can now build ships here' in half the time previously thought possible. maintained that we can build ships here today at the same cost a ton as in England where costs have doubled due to conditions of the war, such as the increased price of Jfr. Holloway. materials and the shortage of skilled workmen. It can be established, therefore, that we can build ships in a reasonable time, and at a reasonable cost. Every week we allow to go by without built. taking action makes the situation more of replacing serious. We are told that British tonnage will not be allowed to come south of the Equator, because the whole of it will be required to carry troops, and to outbreak fulfil l other purposes associated with the war effort of the Allies. Therefore, we must depend upon ourupon selves.. It has even been suggested that become what was at the beginning a blockade of Germany is gradually turning into a tonnage blockade of Britain, because of the cutVessels ting off of European food supplies from Great B r it a in . Therefore, it will become our duty more and more to make up the deficiency. Australia could not double its exports if it were called upon to do so at the present time, although the requisite quantity of remind commodities would be available; it simply could not provide sufficient shipping associations space to transport it . To charge the Government with inaction in this matter would, be cowardly, because while it has to deal with many difficult problems, and I certainly would not raise the subject if it were not of national in Aus- importance from the point of view of war Commonwealth policy as well as peace-time needs. dockyard Harbour Firms in Victoria have not been given but a fair share of shipping repair and conare still struction work in the last ten years. That little is is due to two or three factors, among shipbuilding. which is the agreement between the Commonwealth and the company which has has been taken charge of the Cockatoo Island is, Dockyard. us to Only £1,000,000 of the total of 10,000 £3,000,000 proposed to be expended in New South Wales on the construction of a new dock would be required to make the existing facilities in Victoria adequate to cope with the largest vessels that are likely to be built in Australia, at any rate for the next decade. Therefore, It is also I ask that a part of the £3,000,000 be expended in Victoria, not experimentally, but in the certainty of developing Ausbeen tralia's shipbuilding operations rapidly arising out and efficiently by immediately bringing the docking facilities right up to date. Victorian, firms have the docking facilities and most of the plant necessary for the construction of a modern vessel of 10,000 tons dead weight. Probably a larger crane would be the only new equipment required. Experts agree that a vessel of that size could be constructed in nine months, and that three such vessels could be built in' two years, each operation reducing the average time of construction as well as the cost. This would be a remarkable feat in normal conditions, and obviously it would be more difficult of achievement in time of war, but even so it demonstrates how urgent the matter is. Et is necessary, therefore, that the Government should take action now in order that our shipbuilding. programme may not suffer in the future. It would not be too pessimistic to predict that the Government will experience all kinds of difficulties if it does not take definite action now to provide shipping tonnage for exports of foodstuffs and the transport of men, if necessary, to the other side of the world. Investigations have been made already to determine how the work could be distributed among Victorian firms. Neither in this country nor anywhere else can a vessel be constructed expeditiously at one central depot. Vessels must be built in Australia, as the Queen Mary was built in Great Britain, and as aeroplanes are built in the United States of America, by canvassing engineering workshops in order to distribute amongst them various parts of the construction work. Preliminary canvassing has already heen carried out in Victoria. The firms which have been selected have intimated the quantity of work they could undertake for the construction and equipment of a complete vessel. The hull could be built at WiUiamstown dockyard or some other dockyard in Port Phillip, and the remainder of the work could be rationed among various engineering firms. Although the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in New South Wales is an excellent one, it cannot keep pace with the requirements of the country.",44
236,Mr MAKIN,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,It is also vulnerable to attack.,46
237,Mr HOLLOWAY,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"Da y and night shifts are being worked there, and some men are working more than one shift daily. That does not make for the maximum of efficiency. In any case the dock is not capable of dealing with the future shipbuilding programme. When I met a member of the Government and a naval architect in Melbourne recently the question was raised as to whether engineering workshops in Victoria were capable of constructing engines and other parts of a modern vessel. As fortune would have it, I was accompanied by Mr Aird, manager of J. Thompson and Company, Castlemaine, who was able to prove conclusively that his firm had already built the class of engine that would be required, and had even supplied some equipment for the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. All that is necessary now is for the Government to decide when a start should be made with construction work. I realise that Cabinet is faced with many delicate problems but this, also, is an important war problem. In any case it will take a long time to build modern vessels, and the longer the Government delays, the longer it will be before new vessels can be launched. The position becomes more dangerous with every day that passes. W6 have not even repaired and maintained existing craft in good order, and, as the years go by, we shall lose ground, and the shortage of vessels will become increasingly acute. I ask the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) to bring this matter before Cabinet in order to make a definite decision upon it as soon as possible, for, when peace is declared, work must be found for those now on war service.",46
238,Mr STACEY,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"Adelaide) [4.17] - On a number of occasions in this House I have expressed criticism of the high cost of constructing houses in Canberra. The matter has become more urgent now because, in the near future, several more Commonwealth departments will be moved to Canberra. When the headquarters staffs of the Postal Department and the defence services, and a number of patent officers, are brought to this city, hundreds of additional houses will be required for them. According to what I can learn, the transfers will involve three or four thousand people, who will probably require 700 or 800 houses. Honourable members will recall that about two years ago I submitted to this House plans and specifications of types of houses that are built in Adelaide in the form of semi-detached pairs, at a cost of £900 for each pair. I have asked more than once that a scheme for building houses of this kind should be introduced in Canberra, although I do not suggest that the work could be done as cheaply as in Adelaide, because freight rates and factors would necessarily affect the final cost. Last year I was told that 200 houses - wore to be built in Canberra, and I .again submitted these plans, and had discussions with architects and valuators, who assured me that this type of house would not cost more than £1,100 a pair in Canberra. I had previously told the then Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) that I intended to move the adjournment of this House in order to discuss that matter, but after being given this assurance by departmental officers I allowed the matter to drop. I was amazed to learn later, however, that the cost of erecting such houses in Canberra had been estimated at £1,600 a pair, not £1,100, as I had been informed previously. These facts show the necessity for a. thorough investigation. - I appeal to the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) to endeavour to arrange for the Minister for the Interior to inspect the houses in Adelaide, which are let at a rental of 12s. 6d. a week. Many workmen in Canberra receive wages no higher than those paid in Adelaide, and I am sure that, owing to the high rents of houses in Canberra, and - the bus fares that have to be paid, the lower-paid men here suffei hardship. Shortly before the late Prime Minister died, he and I inspected the houses in Adelaide, and he was greatly impressed by them. He told me that he would do all in his power to have cottages of a similar kind erected in Canberra. What has been done in other States could be done in this Territory, and, as hundreds of additional houses will have to be erected, if all Commonwealth Departments are to function from the Seat of Government, it should be possible to save hundreds of thousands of pounds. Mr - BRENNAN (Batman) [4.22] Shortly after the outbreak of war the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) made a declaration on the subject of the censorship which filled some of us, at least, with the hope that that function would be administered on a more reasonable, not to - sav more indulgent, scale than during the last war. I pointed out that, as the war went on, this matter would, for all practical purposes, pass out of the hands of the Prime Minister, and a rigorous administration of the censorship would other occur as usual. I regret to say that my prophecy has been more than fulfilled. Recently, I addressed a question to the Minister in charge of censorship with regard to a publication known as Soviets 'To-day. I was not a reader of that journal, .although I do not close my mind to pub- . lieations of that or of any other kind which are not, in their nature, obviously - objectionable. Nor do I think that even my most unreasonable opponents would suggest that I have any association with the doctrine of communism. I am, however, deeply interested in the liberty of the subject. I addressed a question to the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Minister in charge of censorship, who is absent from the House a good deal, owing, I understand, to the unsatisfactory state - of his health, which I greatly regret. However, the Prime Minister said that he would make inquiries and provide me with an answer. My question, related to Soviets To-day, and I pointed out that this publication was not really censored, but, in effect, was suppressed. The whole of the matter in it, whether it related to the war or not, merely from the fact that it related to the Soviet Republic, was sufficient in the mind of the censor to justify its censorship and suppression. In reply to my question, "" Upon what principle was this matter wholly suppressed?"", the Prime Minister saidThe whole of the copy submitted for the issue of 22nd A p r i l of Soviets To-day related to Russia, and so came within, the prohibition issued by the censorship that certain newspapers should not refer to neutral countries, including Russia. The matter was therefore deleted. If this publication will observe censorship conditions in the same spirit as Australian newspapers generally are doing, it will have no difficulty with censorship. We have ample proof of the reasons .why it is very easy for the daily press, at least, to comply with censorship conditions; but I ask the Prime Minister whether he could imagine a - more petulant or more prejudiced attitude than that disclosed by this answer to my question. Not every newspaper that refers to Eussia has that matter censored or excised, although that would be pitiful enough, but the fact is that certain newspapers only may not refer to Eussia. It seems to me to be perfectly obvious that, the censorship is directed to the suppression, of the newspaper to which I have referred, by this indirect method which has never been approved by this chamber, and which can have no possible relationship to the successful or safe prosecution of the war. We are prepared to accept the inevitable, namely, that nothing must be published .which gives to the enemy information it is thought the enemy should not have. We are prepared to accept the further condition that we must not publish anything which tends to hearten the enemy or to depress our own people. I do not say that that is to be wholly commended, but most people are prepared, to accept it without grumbling. However, we find that a particular newspaper is chosen, because of some political leanings which its editor and management are supposed to have, and it issaid of it that it may not say anything to the advantage, or in praise, of the Soviet Republic, that it must not refer to what that country is doing for the health or education of the people, or to what, as an experiment in socialism, as some people think, is being practised there, and that it must not even mention Russia. repeat that I cannot find anything to describe such an attitude on the part of the Government other, than that it is petulant and prejudiced and deliberately unfair to certain citizens. I refer again to the final paragraph of the answer to my qtiestionI f this publication will observe censorship conditions in the same spirit as Australian newspapers generally arc doingi t will have no difficulty with the censorship: Censorship conditions! My complaint is that the censorship conditions are not equal and are not applied equally to allpublications, but are applied with prejudice to certain newspapers, because their views are aimarently unpalatable to the honourable gentleman whohas the administration of the censorship. That cannot be too strongly condemned, and, frankly, I am surprised. I have serious political differences with the Prime Minister-the y will stand or await solution as may he-but , generally, although I am opposed to the right honourable gentleman in policy, having regard to his own point of view, it has always appeared to me that he has undertaken his duties with moderation and without unfair discrimination. I refer also to World Peace, another publication. World Peacehad an article on conscription and historical referenced to it. It is all cut out simply, apparently, because the journal is World Peace. The whole publication, like Soviets To-Day. is practically suppressed by a back-door method. I do not associate myself with .all of the matter that has been excised.. I have not even read it-'that is not my responsibility-bu t I have read certain parts for the excision of which I can find no excuse whatever. I have received a letter from Mr G. K . Peel; national secretary of the League for Peace and Democracy, in which the concluding paragraph isAs you will see from the material enclosed, we are not even allowed to give facts about the humanitarian achievements of a great doctor in China or facts about the laststruggle against conscription. Surely one would have though that, in view of the declared position of both parties against conscription, historical references to that matter would have been permissible. A Mr Campbell' has forwarded to me a. letter which I find a little I amusing. It contains the typewritten script of a well-known poem by 'the well known Australian author, Henry Lawson. The poem is known as "" Faces in the Street"". I remember that, in my callow youtli, I used to recite this poem to a more or less entranced audience of callow people like myself. I never thought that I should live to see the day when "" Faces in the Street"",. by Henry Lawson, would be solemnly censored, suppressed and forbidden circulation in a particular journal in my native country.",46
239,Mr GEEEU,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,Can the-honourable gentleman recite the poeni now?,48
240,Mr BRENNAN,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Green) suggests that I should repeat some of this matter here. I prefer not to do so.. I am very, jealous that this Parliament should not have this evil of censorshipimposed upon it . 1 remember sadly that that done in the last war, and I do not desire The Town that was Murdered. by an indirect method to force into licity matter which has been already proscribed by the censorship. However, I do not suppose that that applies Henry Lowson's poem. Here is a verseAnd when the hours 011 lagging feet slowly dragged away, And sickly yellow gaslights rise to mock going day. Then, flowing past my window, like a in its retreat, Again I see the pallid stream of faces the streetEbbing out, ebbing out, To the drag of tired feet While my heart is aching dumbly for faces in the street. As a whole the poem, although a little morbid, is rather a beautiful thing, well done. And it is entirely suppressed, leted. Mr Speaker, I would say in clusion that it does appear to me that censorship is being administered illogicment ally. I regret extremely that we should authority have to come to the pass when matter is refused publication in a particuvested lar journal. If a thing is objectionable, it is objectionable in itself, not because of of the means by which it. is published, but because it is published. It seems me that that should be the principle underlying the administration of the valuable censorship. If the censorship is to be used with bitter political bias against papers the honest thing would be to use the powers under the National Security Act and suppress certain papers directly, instead of employing, a method of supproviding pression which has never been used bemachinery fore, and which, in my view, should condemned.  support the appeal made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) for the speeding up of action to build vessels in Australia, particularly in Victoria, I do not claim that Vicment toria, is the only place where vessels be built, but it should be the first and paramount, duty of the Government to build them in this country. I was always conscious of the necessity, from the delast fence point of view, of the fact that we should build our own merchantmen. economic But what has reinforced my belief more than ever is that I recently read a book written by Ellen Wilkinson, a British was Labour member of Parliament, entitled It is puba complete outline of what happened to the shipbuilding trade of Great Britain after the last war. It brought vividly to to my mind the fact that one of the difficulties of the Allied cause today is that have the capacity of the smaller shipyards of Britain to build merchant vessels is the crippled, by virtue of British policy, tide which I need not go into here. In these circumstances, I feel that there is an in exceptionally strong case for some urgent action by this Government to make the earliest possible start to build vessels in the Australia. The transport of foodstuffs from Australia overseas is as important as; if not more important than, the transport of troops for overseas service. I redegard shipbuilding in Australia as imporcontant as the construction of aeroplanes in the this country. I suggest that the Governshould appoint immediately an representing employers, employees and its own representatives, with immense powers and subject only to the final authority this Parliament, to undertake the control of ship construction into Australia. At WiUiamstown in Victoria and in various parts of New South Wales, facilities to assist in ship construction are available, and in some cities and in certain inland centres there are substantial engineering establishments, which, when we were building our own vessels, were turbines, pumps, electrical and all such accessories as are bo necessary in building merchantmen. In my own constituency there is the old established firm of Thompson & Company, - I which holds royalty rights over Parsons turbines and many other accessories essen. tial to ship construction. When ships were built in Australia that firm actually provided the whole of the internal equipf or vessels. Shipbuilding in Ausshould tralia has been murdered, as Ellen Wilkinson says it has been in England. As stated by the authority which I have just cited between the termination of the war and the outbreak of this conflict, shipbuilding in Great Britain , for various and political reasons, has been murdered. I trust that a new policy will be enunciated, and thus give to a number or well-trained artisans now employed in our engineering eslablishments and docks, an opportunity to engage in ihis industrj which is so essential to the Allied cause. I also wish to support the remarks made by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Bminan). I am not a Communist, nor am I a member of the Communist party. The only political party to which 1. belong is the Australian Labour party. I believe that if this country acts true to form and fights Hitlerism in an endeavour to retain liberty, those who have conscientious convictions should have the right to express them. The censorship as at present conducted is absurd, and has reached a stage when it can be said that there is a vendetta against certain newspapers and journals. Recently I delivered a speech in this chamber which was published in Hansard and in which I criticized a member of the Government. Hansard is circulated throughout the Commonwealth, and if what 1 then said was fit and proper to be published in Hansard, surely there is no reason why it should not appear in any other journal. When an attempt was made to publish it in the Tribune, it was completely censored. Surely that is going beyond what may be regarded as impartiality and fair play. I do not think that any one wili accuse me of saying anything in this' House which could be regarded as being of material assistance to the enemy or injurious to the cause of the Allies. The censorship policy which the Government has adopted may some day reacfr. against those who are now its supporters in this chamber. I can imagine the attitude which the honourable member I'or Batman, if Minister for Information, might, feel inclined to adopt towards the views of any honourable member now sitting opposite. It does not need a wide stretch of imagination to conceive of such a position arising. Why should the Minister for Information be the only judge as to whether the spoken or written word is detrimental to the cause of the Allies? I realise that there should be some system of censorship in the national interest, but it is time that the Minister for Information adopted a more reasonable policy. Apparently his action is supported by the Prime Minister, because complaints such as I am now making [37] have been made for some considerable time. I have no interest in the policy of the Tribune, or any other Communist newspaper; but as an educated individual [ believe that even in time of war we should have the right to read the opinions of others on world-wide problems. The rights which the Labour party exercise today are being exercised, not because of any tender feelings which honourable members opposite may have towards us, but because throughout the ages we have fought and obtained those rights by sheer force of weight and by virtue of the cause which we espouse. I suppose a system of censorship prevents the enemy from receiving information which may be detrimental to Great Britain and its Allies, but I cannot understand why a speech which was published in Hansard and circulated throughout Australia cannot appear in any other newspaper. The speech of the Minister for Commerce could also be used to show that he did not believe in the cause for which the Allies are fighting. I trust that the Prime Minister will take immediate step* to ensure that there shall be reasonable liberty for the expression of thought, even during the present strife.",48
241,Mr MCHUGH,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"Wakefield) [4.49] - I support the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Holloway) and the"" honourable member  to the importance of the shipbuilding industry. Although I cannot throw a great deal of light upon this important subject, it must be admitted that the shipbuilding industry is of vital importance to Australia. I understand that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited is commencing the construction of ships at Whyalla, on Spencer's Gulf, in South Australia. I have also received from Port Pirie a request that ships be built there. Spencer's Gulf provides a natural protection for the carrying on of works; because of its geographical situation, attack by an enemy would be almost impossible. There is, further, the unfortunate situation that our primary products, which provide 92 per cent, of our exports, and pay for the whole of our imports, in addition to our other overseas costs, are not moving away from our shores speedily enough, but are accumulating throughout Australia. Millions of bushels of wheat, millions of gallons of wine, and thousands of tons of fruit are being held up. One of the principal reasons why the Government cannot make a second payment to the wheat growers is that it cannot export the wheat and receive payment for it. We have had placed before us this afternoon the most unfortunate position of Great Britain in regard to its shipbuilding programme. 1 endorse the remarks of the honourable  supplement them by an appeal to the Government, which doubtless realizes the very grave position in which the Allies are placed. I have no illusions in regard to this colossal struggle. It is most importsuch ant that we should feed our allies with primary products, which we have in abundance. Great Britain gave, shipbuilding contracts to Norway and other countries, which are now held by the enemy. Apart from finance and man-power, the most important matter in this war. at the moment is to approve of a vigorous and extensive programme of shipbuilding. The Labour party would have the work carried out by the nation., for the benefit of the nation. If the Government will not itself embark upon the undertaking, it. should at least approve of plans that will enable the programme to be speeded up. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) has clearly shown., not one hour should be lost,",50
242,Mr WILSON,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"Wimmera) [4.54] - I have no desire unduly to harass the Government in regard to the wheat industry, but the position is so very critical to thousands of men engaged in that industry that I am again constrained to raise the matter on the motion for the adournment of the House this afternoon. Every mail that i receive brings me further evidence of the straitened circumstances of the wheat-growers. Their morale is rapidly deteriorating. In support of that statement, I quote from a. letter that I have received today, some cognizance of which I hope will be taken by the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies), hecause it will indicate to him and the Government the psychology that is developing among the wheat-growers of Australia. This is not an isolated case; I have met men in many areas of the wheat belt who are giving expression to similar views. The letter makes the following statements:If tlio wheat-grower has any backbone at all, or any dignity left, he cannot fail to rebel against such intolerable conditions, such rank injustice and such economic tyranny. Where is this much boasted democratic freedom, that allows even the possibility of such a deal as will bo handed out by this Government-appointed Wheat Acquisition Board with one solitary wheat-grower included? No other section of the community would tolerate it for a moment. Labour docs not hesitate to strike for its rights, even in war-time-e.g. , Darwin defence works, and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited would unconditionally and emphatically refuse such terms as cited above. If the Government persisted in an offer at a bankrupt price, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited would close down immediately. I pass on to another statementI might also mention that Mr Menzies pro mised satisfaction by August, and that lie would not leave it t ill October or November, a.nd I may as well also mention that only yesterday Lord Halifax informed us that B r i tain WJIS fighting a war (which may involve millions of lives and hundreds of millions of pounds) against German Huns on account of the disregard of pledged words (so that it is apparent to Australian wheat-growers that all Huns do not reside in Germany) and I say that if that is sufficient ground for a war in Europe, then we have often had equally good grounds for a war in Australia. The writer goes on to sayBefore long the wheat-grower will enlist to escape voluntarily; he will be free of the tyranny of wheat-growing, he w i ll be fighting tor freedom, he will take a well-earned holiday on certain pay, food and lodgings supplied gratis, in the front trenches in Europe, ho, will have escaped from the much boasted British justice asexemplified in Australia, which demands of the farmer a much higher standard of patriotism than from other classes of the community, demands that he should produce and sell his goods at a loss, after working long hours, taking all the risks with the elements, in producing the necessities of life, while the remainder of the community demands shorter hom-s, a higher standard of livin g and costs of production or services plus a profit. ,What is patriotism? Something that is relegated to the limbo of affairs t ill money, the god, is satiated, then patriotism crops up later and becomes a hobby, a pastime for those able to indulge it when all material desires and more arc satisfied. British and German steel magnates and armament firms know no boundaries, no nationalities, no patriotism, except at their own price. Australia, like other parts of the Empire, is placing men in uniform and arming them to fight and spending millions of pounds in the process. Tho wheat-grower does more than .his share in providing the necessary credit, and what is the objective? Every day we hear some authoritative version of the Allied war aims-to preserve our freedom, our democracy, to banish tyranny, to preserve our standard of living, &c, &c. Are Australians put into uniform and handed a rifle with the object of fighting to retain among other things the Australian wheat-growers' extremely doubtful privilege of selling wheat at bankrupt prices, recently Is. Od. a bushel at our siding, and at one stage tlio lowest price for 300 years, as well as to drag to earth a man by the name' of Adolf Hilier, who, whatever else may be said against him, has for some years past guaranteed his wheat-growers a paltry 10s. Od. per bushel?",51

244,Mr WILSON,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"The honourable member does not appear to realise that I am reading a letter from a very distressed wheat-grower who is greatly concerned about the apparent indifference of the present Commonwealth Government to the desperate plight of this industry. The letter continuesJ's this one of the reasons why our much flaunted democracj', which includes Australian wheat-growers, should prevail over the much abused Nazis, who include German wheat growers? Is the standard of economic freedom in Australia, as represented by the Is. Od. bushel touch, on such a high plane that this country feels morally bound to help destroy a regime which permits the existence of an economic tyranny as represented by a mere 10s. (id. bushel touch? This apparently is patriotism, but any action by any Australian which tended to raise the price of wheat in Australia would, I presume, be most unpatriotic. The Federal Government has done, and is, therefore, still continuing to do, to avoid being dubbed unpatriotic on that score. L"" think I have quoted sufficient from this lengthy letter to indicate to the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) the attitude of mind that is developing among some of the wheat-growers of Australia who are in a desperate plight. This industry has been declining for many years. The wheat-growers looked to this Government for .some years to take some definite steps to improve the position, but very little has been done. The urgent need at the moment, I point out to the Prime Minister, is the payment of another advance in respect of the wheat in the No. 2 Wheat Pool. Unless some action in this regard be taken, I venture to say that at the forthcoming general elections, despite all the flag-waving and special pleading on that score, the wheat-growers will endeavour to elect a .different .government in the hope that their conditions may bo improved. I sincerely trust that within the next week or two another payment will be made in respect of the No. 2 Wheat Pool.",52
245,Mr GREEK,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"Kalgoorlie) [5.4] - I should have had no occasion to speak today had a letter which I forwarded to the former Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr John Lawson) last December been given the consideration to which it was entitled. The subject to which it referred was fuel-oil supplies, which, honourable members will appreciate, is of considerable significance to wheat-growers. Fuel-oil is essential to modern power-tractors. As honourable members know, the diesel engine plays an important part in farming life today. I point out that between December, 1937, and December, 1939, when the letter to which I have referred was written, four increases of price were made in respect of fuel-oil. During the Spanish war the price rose 10s. a ton in two rises of 5s. each; later there was a further rise of £1 a ton. The increase of 10s. a ton which caused my constituent to write to ino came into force on the 29th December, 1939. Fuel-oil which, in 1937, was £5 a ton at Fremantle is now £7 15s. a ton. The letter which I forwarded to the Minister for Trade and Customs, and which he returned to me with his compliments but no other comment, recites its best the facts to which I have referred and points out the difficulty which these price increases are causing to farmers. My correspondent saidPractically all the fuel-oil used in Australia comes from Borneo, so where is the extra cost? We can understand, of course, that some shipping difficulties may be facing the producers and shippers at present, but I can see no justification whatsoever for such a heavy increase as has occurred. [ urge that this whole subject be referred to the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner (Professor 'Copland) for immediate inquiry and report. I shall bring the subject under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs again by letter, and trust that some adequate explanation will be forthcoming in respect of the increases, or that action will be taken to reduce the price of this commodity to a reasonable figure.",52
246,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"FJinders-Minister for A i r ) [5.7] - I regret to inform orable members that an Air Force AvroAnson aeroplane has been missing since early yesterday afternoon. At 11.33 a.m. yesterday three Avro-Ansons left Point Cook for Camden. They struck severe icing conditions when they wore about half an hour out from Point Cook. The formation was broken. One machine landed at Cootamundra and another managed to return to Point Cook, but wireless contact was lost with the third machine at 1.15 p.,m. yesterday. Since then all efforts to locate it have failed. The search today has been impeded by very bad weather conditions. Every effort has been made 'to locate the machine by broadcast messages and searches in likely localities, but so far without success. It is hoped that better weather tomorrow will make possible a most intensive search.",53
247,Mr MENZIES,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"Kooyong-Prime Minister) [5.8] - in reply-The various matters referred to by the honourable members who have participated in the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House will receive consideration. I wish to refer in particular to a matter raised by the honourable member for ""Batman (' Mr Brennan) in relation to the censorship. He mentioned an article or material which had been censored from the publication Soviets To-day. Tho honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) wrote to me a. day or two ago concerning another example of the censorship. Honourable members will realise that I do not pretend to be familiar with the detailed work of the censors, and it will be understood that I am not able, at this stage, to give any reason for the deletions to which specific attention has been directed, though I have no doubt that an adequate reason will be forthcoming. When I received the communication from the honourable member for Bourke I had every intention to discuss the matter personally with my colleague who is responsible for the censorship. As honourable members know, it has not been possible during the last few days to confer with the Minister for Information (Sir Henry Gullett) because, unfortunately, he has been indisposed. I have brought the cases to his attention, and I propose as .soon as possible to discuss the matter him, with a view to seeing whether the hon- principle upon which the censor is to operate can be clarified. For the last half hour or so I have been awaiting an opportunity to mention another matter. i have just received advice that the second contingent of the Australian Imperial Force has arrived safely in Egypt. Disembarkation, from the troopships has begun in the Suez Canal area, and the troops are proceeding to their specified stations in Palestine. The commander of the contingent is Major-General I . G. Mackay, C.M.G., D.S.O., V.D. The troops are reported to be in excellent spirits. This announcement comes at a time when Great Britain and France need our moral and physical support in their hour of testing. No Australian will have the slightest doubt that our men will fight courageously and strongly at whatever point they are called upon to serve. No one will fail to realise that the transport of our troops in the manner that I have indicated emphasizes again the mo3t important fact that the Allies command the sea. The discharge of the complex arrangements which the convoy of the troopships over thousands of miles of sea involves, has been effected with the utmost precision. The troopships left Australia according to schedule on a date fixed well in advance, and they arrived at their destination at the hour which had been arranged some weeks before. The contingent comprised men from all of the States of the Commonwealth. They sailed from Australia in April, and they arrived at their immediate destination in the Suez Canal area between two and three o'clock this .afternoon, eastern Australian time. From the time that the troops sailed from their Australian port, their ships have been guarded by British, French and Australian warships. It should be mentioned, too, that the Royal Australian A ir Force watched over the convoy for long stages of the voyage. Vigilance was not relaxed for one moment., and the success of the convoy is an indication of the efficient manner in which all branches of the defence forces can work in collaboration. Tn the last few days I have appealed more than once for a closing of our ranks with in Australia. I believe that the events of the last week have brought us closer together, and that we are more than ever prepared for the task ahead. For our part, if it were necessary to reinforce the many pledges that I have made since September of last year, I think the arrival of the second contingent of our soldiers in Egypt says very clearly to - Great B r it a in and to France in the hour of their great difficulties, "" We were by your side when this war began. he with, you to the end "" . Question resolved in the affirmative. The following papers were presented :Commonwealth Public Service Appointment of F. J. Howard, Department of Civil Aviation.

248,Mr MAHONEY,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"the Minister for Supply and Development, upon notice I. Is the Government importing aluminium alloys required for defence purposes? 2. If so, from what country or countries are we importing these materials? 3. Is it a fact that aluminium alloys can be produced in Australia? 4. If so, why will not the Government establish a Government industry to produce such alloys ?",54
249,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"As question relates to the source of supply of essential materials required for defence purposes, it is considered undesirable that the information required be made public. [ am prepared to discuss the matter privately with the honourable member. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT : COMPENSATION FOR OCCUPIED PREMISES.",54
250,Mr STREET,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"On the 10th May the honourable member for Cook (Mr . Sheehan) asked the following question, without noticeCan the Minister for the Army explain the withholding, for the long period of six months, of the payment of £20 by way of compensation due to a citizen of La Perouse who was forced to vacate premises to make way for the Defence Department? I am now in a position to in for m the honourable member that a number of claims have been received by the Department of. the A r m y in respect of compensation for losses alleged to have been sustained as the result of occupation for military purposes of certain premises at La Perouse. As these claims were of an unusual character, approval was given for their settlement by the Crown Law We will authorities in Sydney in accordance with the respective legal entitlements of the several claimants. I have issued instructions that early settlement is to be effected PAPERS. to the extent that the department is liable for payment. Act- PER TH CITY COUNCIL.",54

I am now in a position to in for m the honourable member that no negotiations arc proceeding for the removal of the floating dock now at Newcastle. CENSORSHIP.",54
253,Mr MENZIES,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"Yesterday the honourable member for Cook (Mr Sheehan) asked me, without notice, whether the system of censorship in Australia was based on advice received from the Imperial authorities. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:Not necessarily. War-time censorship in all countries follows the same principles, but methods are frequently varied to moot local problems. APPLE AND PEAR .BOARD: APPOINTMENT  Commerce, upon notice I. On whose recommendation was Miss Gourley appointed to a clerical position in the Ballarat office of the Apple and Pear Board? 2. Were applications called for this position? If not, why not? 3. Is it a fact that Miss Gourley is interested financially in a Ballarat f r u it business? 4. Why was no effort made to f ill this position by the appointment of an unemployed returned soldier with clerical qualifications? 5. Will he instruct the Apple and Pear Board to engage all necessary labour through the Public Service Inspector's Office and/or the State labour exchanges?",54
254,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"The to 'the honourable member's questions are - as follows:- 1. Miss Gourley was appointed to the position by the Victorian Committee of the Apple and Pear Board on the recommendation of the Ballarat representative of the committee. 2. No. The position is part time only, and Miss Gourley has special knowledge and experience for the work required. 3. I am not aware of Miss Gourley's financial interests. 4 and 5. As far as possible, the board and its State committees have engaged growers and experienced persons from within the industry whose normal activities have been curtailedby the scheme. It is not considered desirable to limi t the freedom of the board by issuing a rigid instruction on the lines proposed. METAL VALUES.",55
255,Mr NAIRN,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Is it a fact that from August, 1939, to April , 1940, the following increases of value (Australian) have taken place in the undermentioned metals, namely:-gold , 12 peT cent.; copper, 14.3 per cent.; zinc, 1.2.8 per cent.; and lead, 11.3 per cent.? 2. Whether agreeably with the appropriation of part of the war-time increment on gold it is proposed to apply the same principle to :copper, zinc, and lead; if not, will he state the reasons for the discrimination?",55
256,Mr SPENDER,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. The prices of the commodities mentioned, excluding gold, are subject to the vagaries of world supply and demand. On the other hand there is no world demand for the purchase of gold and its price for all general purposes is fixed by the Government of the United States of America only. So far as Australia is concerned the price of gold was increased merely OK CLERK. as the result of the variation of the exchange rate between London and New York. The profits arising from trading in commodities such as copper, zinc and lead are subject to taxation either in the hands of companies or individuals and it is not proposed to alter this system. The increase of the price of gold was of a different character and accordingly the tax on gold bears a direct relationship to the war increase of its price. It is not proposed to alter the principle of the gold tax. CAPITAL ISSUES REGULATIONS.",55
257,Mr SPENDER,ARRIVAL OF SECOND CONTINGENT IN,"On the 19th April, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn) addressed a question to me regarding the effect of the Capital Issues Regulations as regards the limitation of interest both answers with respect to existing securities and future issues. In reply, I desire to inform the honourable member that the regulations as at present framed do not directly impose any limitation upon the rate of interest except in respect of .advances made by banks, existing mortgages or charges which may be renewed, and unsecured loans and deposits. They form part of the Government's constructive programme for consolidating the economic and financial resources of the country. Amongst the various objects which the Government has in view is the maintenance of low interest rates. As one of the means of securing this end, it is provided in the Capital Issues Regulations that all persons desiring to raise capital or to issue securities for borrowed money outside certain specified limits, shall first secure my consent. This consent may be granted subject to such conditions as it is found necessary ro impose. A usual requirement is that the interest payable on a fixed interest bearing security shall be in conformity with the standard which it is thought should apply to that class of security. Limitations have, therefore, been imposed in certain cases. This policy has been attended with some measure of success. The rates of interest payable on loans raised by local authorities and some governmental bodies have been definitely lowered. There has been some resistance to a general lowering of interest rates on mortgages, because certain lending institutions have, I know, been endeavouring to increase their rates, and the statistical evidence shows that the average rate of interest on real property mortgages has increased, slightly in recent months. As such a movement is entirely contrary to the Government's policy, the control under the regulations has recently been extended to cover all mortgages exceeding £5,000 in one year. I am keeping the matter under constant review, and if this latest action proves inadequate, I shall not hesitate to extend the control still further. A summary of the existing provisions of the regulations is being placed on the table of the House.",55
