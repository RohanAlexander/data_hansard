I made a brief statement about the interim A i r Force a week ago, when I said that the matter was receiving consideration. - No decision has been reached, but the matter is being investigated in relation to other proposed defence developments, so that Australia will have a balanced force.",14
13,Mr WHITE,NEW AND OPPOSED BUSINES S,Have sumcient enlistments been received?,14
14,Mr DRAKEFORD,NEW AND OPPOSED BUSINES S,"As no decision has yet been reached regarding the size of the force, it is impossible to say whether sumcient enlistments have been received. Many men have enlisted, and we hope that more will do so. We shall announce as soon as possible the number which it is proposed to enlist, and upon that will diepend the number of permanent commissions. Later:",14
15,Mr DRAKEFORD,NEW AND OPPOSED BUSINES S,"MaribyrnongMinister for A i r ancl Minister for Civil Aviation) - by leave-Honourable members may recall that towards the end of February, the Prime Minister announced through the press the intention to effect the retirement of certain Royal Australian A i r Force ofBcers in the older age ranges. I take this opportunity to outline briefly the circumstances associated with the decision to effect such retirements and to give the names of the Air Force personnel being retired, and details of the special scheme of compensation, as approved by the Government, to apply to those personnel. In time of war, two main factors operate to make such retirements unavoidable in the interest of the future well-being of the force. One such factor is that, with the tremendous expansion of the force in war-time corresponding increases in establishments, both in ranks and numbers, take place, 'and promotions made against those war establishments cannot possibly be maintained in full upon reversion to peace conditions. commissions The second factor is that, during hostilities, unprecedented opportunities are presented to younger and junior omcers to gain experience and seniority which the not only qualify them to hold the. senior appointments, but also render it imperative to provide continued opportunities for the acceptance by them of commensurate responsibilities. Failure to recognize this factoror to give effect to it. would inevitably lead to a form of stagnation in the force when initiative, vigour and enthusiasm, based upon recent war experience and developments, must be regarded as being of paramount, i m portance. I believe that honourable members, generally, will agree that this latter factor applies, with special significance, to an air force, having regard to the rapid and important developments in aerial warfare, strategy, ancl tactics, developments in aircraft types ancl performances generally, and the varying roles in which they are required to function. It is, perhaps, not inopportune to draw attention to the fact that the retirement of numbers of senior officers is not confined to Australia, and that the operation of the same factors I have already mentioned has resulted in similar action being taken in other countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, as honourable members will have noticed by recent press reports. Many of those officers achieved world fame during the war and a big percentage of them are of approximately the same ages as the senior members to be retired fro m the Royal Australian A i r Force, though some are younger. It would be quite out of place and embarrassing, both to the service and to the officers concerned, to enter upon a discussion of personal details. I need only state that, in approving of those retirements, the Government has been actuated by. service and policy, - as distinct from personal, considerations. A number of retirements is also being effected of officers who have reached the prescribed maximum retiring ages of their respective ranks, but the factors to which I have already referred have been the basic consideration influencing the action taken in relation to hoth categories. I assure honourable members that the Government fully appreciates the valuable services rendered to the country by those officers and I take this opportunity of expressing in Parliament our gratitude for, and appreciation of, the high standard of their work in the various important posts they have filled in both peace and war. It was by reason of their excellent services that the Government, as recently announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), has made provision for, and payment to, those omcers of compensation on what it considers to be a fair and reasonable basis. I shall refer to this later. The Royal Australian Air Eorce officers being retired before reaching the age of retirement prescribed for their subsequent substantive ranks are:-Ai r Marshal R. Williams, C.B., CBE., D.S.O., Air Vice-Marshal S. J. Goble, CBE., D.S.O., D.S.C., Air Vice-Marshal W. D. Bostock, C.B., OBE., Air Commodore W. H . Anderson, CBE., D.F.C, Air Commodore F. H . MCNamara, V . C . C.B., CBE., Air Commodore A. T. Cole^ C. B.E., D.S.O., M.C, D.F.C, Air Commodore F. W. F. Lukis, CBE., Air Commodore R, J. Brownell, OBE., M.C, M.M., Air Commodore J. H . Summers, OBE., and Group Captain J. Waters. The officers to bo retired on account of having reached the prescribed ages for retirement are-Ai r Vice-Marshal H . N . Wrigley, OBE., D.F.C, A.F.C, . Air Commodore H . F. De La Rue, CBE., D. F.C, Air Commodore A. W. Murphy, D.F.C, A.F.C, Group Captain C C. Eaton, OBE.. A.F.C, and Group Captain J. F. S. Murray, M.B.E., M.C. The special scheme of compensation approved by the Government, may be summarized as follows:(a) Accumulated Permanent Force deferred pay, including Permanent Air Force deferred - pay for any period of long service leave due. Mr Drakeford. (b) An additional amount to bring (a) up to the sum set out in the following scale:-Win g Commander, £4,000; Group Captain, £5,000; Air Commodore, £5,500; Air Vice-Marshal, £6,000. The amount payable will be determined according to the officer's substantive rank, and the sum of any deferred pay paid on the officer becoming a contributor to the Superannuation Fund will be deducted from the above amounts. (c) Half-pay up to a maximum of two years, but not beyond the date of retirement applicable to the officer's substantive rank. Halfpay will be at half the rates of active and deferred pay and dependants and living out allowances payable under Air Force (War Financial) Regulations. No credit will be allowed in respect of Permanent, Air Force deferred pay during the period of half^pay. (d) Pay in lieu of long-service leave due. (e) Half-pay and pay in lieu of longservice leave will be calculated at rates prescribed by Air Force (War Financial) Regulations and on the basis of any temporary rank held at date of retirement. In other cases the basis will - be the substantive rank. (/) Re-establishment leave, war service leave, and other concessions granted to members on demobilisation will be granted in accordance with the entitlement, of the officer concerned. (g) Where an officer is appointed to another paid position under the Commonwealth during the period covered by the payment of half-pay, the officer vvill refund or have deducted from Air his pay an amount equal to the half-pav granted for such portion of the period of 15 a Ifpay as he is employed by the Commonwealth, provided that the amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount payable in the new position. I assure honourable members that, in effecting these retirements, the Government gave full consideration to rank and age of the officers concerned and* to the appointments held and experience gained by them, as well as to appointments which will be available in the post-war A i r Force, and to the availability of full y qualified and experienced officers to fill those appointments. Finally, I would state that necessary action will be taken to ensure a smooth transition from war to peace conditions insofar as senior officer personnel are concerned, ancl for appropriately qualified younger officers with extensive war experience' and good records to occupy the senior appointments of the Service. I lay on the table the following paper:Retirement of Senior Air Force OfficersMinisterial Statement, and move That the paper be printed. Debate (on motion by Mr WHITE ) adjourned. INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. M EETING OF BRITISHPRIMEMINISTERS NA PEACE CONFERENCE. Mr 'CHIFLEY (Macquarie-Prim a Minister' and Treasurer) - by leaveHonorable members will be aware from the announcement by the British Prime Minister, Mr Attlee, on the 18th March, 1946, that a series of consultations between British Commonwealth Prime Ministers has been arranged in London at times convenient to those concerned. As Mr Attlee has explained, it has unfortunately not been possible to .arrange a meeting at which all Prime Ministers can be present simultaneously. I propose to visit London in time for the commencement of the consultations on the 23rd A p r i l , 1946, when the Minister of Finance of New Zealand, Mr Walter Nash, representing the Prime Minister of New Zealand, will also be present. The Prime Minister of South A f r i c a , Field-Marshal Smuts, will join in the discussions later in A p r i l , and the Prime Minister of Canada, Mr K in g, will be in London at a later date. As stated by Mr Attlee, the discussions will afford an opportunity for an exchange of views on other matters of common concern. The main discussion will be on matters pertaining to the Pacific. The Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) will accompany me to the conference in London and will later represent Australia at the Peace Conference to be held in Paris to decide the terms of the Peace Treaties with It a l y and the satellite Axis powers.",14
16,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIA N REPRESENTATION AT PARIS,When will the Peace Conference be held ?,16

18,Mr SMITH,AUSTRALIA N REPRESENTATION AT PARIS,"In view of the statement on Thursday last in the Adelaide Advertiser by the Premier of South Aus South Australia had not received approval from the Commonwealth for the purchase of land for the land settlement of ex-servicemen, is the Minister in a position to advise the House as to the present position in regard to this matter ?'",16
19,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIA N REPRESENTATION AT PARIS,"I have seen that statement. I am having the matter investigated, and I hope to be able to reply to the honourable gentleman tomorrow.",16
20,Mr MORGAN,AUSTRALIA N REPRESENTATION AT PARIS,"I understand that the Department of Post-war .Reconstruction is having difficulty in obtaining a suitable building in Sydney for the technical training of ex-servicemen. That being so, will the Minister for ' Post-warReconstruction further examine my proposal that the Chullora aircraft annex be used for that purpose, seeing that the works successfully trained some hundreds of dilutees in connection with the munitions programme? Alternatively, will he examine the Government factory at Lidcombe which was formerly used for the manufacture of aero engines,, but is now used to only a small extent. Whereas formerly 3,000 workers were employed at. the plant the number of employees is - now only about one-third .of that number. The works are equipped with modern plant and ' are ideally situated for the purpose.",16
21,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIA N REPRESENTATION AT PARIS,"It is true that the Department of Post-war Reconstruction is experiencing considerable difficulty in Sydney-, and, indeed in every capital city, in finding sufficient accommodation for post-war training classes. I believe that the two buildings to which the honourable member referred, have already been - examined, but, of course, they cannot be used for post-war reconstruction training until the responsible authority .makes them available to the department. How«ver, I shall see whether the honourable member's suggestion can be given effect. TARIF F BOARD REPORTS.",17
22,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIA N REPRESENTATION AT PARIS,"I lay on the table two reports of the Tariff Board on the - following subject:Plastics Industry. Ordered to be printed. NA TREATMENT OF DEPENDANTS. Air. TURNBULL - I ask the Minister - for the Army whether the military authorities are demanding from widows and other dependants of prisoners of war who died i-n the hands of the Japanese a refund of the difference - between the allotment and the subsequent pension fate? If 30, seeing that these people have suffered greatly, and that this demand is financially embarrassing to many of the widows of deceased prisoners - of war, would the Minister favour amendment of the regulations governing the matter to provide for the payment of allotments to continueup to the date of the notification of death, which in some cases occurred years before the notification ?",17
23,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,This question is similar to one asked by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White). I have insecondary quired when the answers can be furnished and I have been assured that I shall them tomorrow when I will make them available to honourable members. DROUGHT RELIEF. SOUTH AUSTRALIAN WHEAT FARMERSVICTORIAN DAIRYMEN .,17
24,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Has the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture yet had an opportunity to examine the South Australian Drought Relief Bill? If so, does the Commonwealth Government now propose to reverse its decision, and grant some assistance to South Australian wheat-growers, instead of maintaining the Pontius Pilate attitude it adopted recently?",17
25,Mr SCULLY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I have perused' the bill, and consider that the Government of Soutli Australia, has not been overgenerous in granting assistance to wheat growers in the drought stricken areas. At the first opportunity, I shall discuss the honourable member's question with the Prime Minister. - Mv. MCEWEN - Has the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture given consideration to a request by dairy-farmers in Victoria for a review of the basis of drought relief distribution as arranged by the Commonwealth and the Government of Victoria? WAR. Mr SCULLY - There was a general arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States regarding the distribution of drought relief, but the actual distribution was left to the State governments. If there are any anomalies or difficulties ' Mr MCEWEN - I explained the difficulties in this House about three weeks ago.",17
26,Mr SCULLY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I do not remember whether I was here at the time. However, I shall have inquiries made, and if there is anything unfair or anomalous in, the present method of distribution, I shall discuss the matter again with the Government of Victoria. INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT. . DECENTRALIZATION.",17
27,Mr BURKE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Did the Prime Minister read in the press an article dealing with the proposed establishment of a industry in South Australia, and a comment by the Government have spokesman that the Commonwealth Government favoured, the decentralization of industry, and the establishment of secondary industries in the less populous capitals such as Adelaide and Brisbane? Oan the right honourable gentleman assure the House that in the Government's efforts at decentralization the claims - of. other less populous capital cities, including the important city of Perth, wall not be overlooked?",17
28,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I do not'remember whether I read the particular article to which the honourable member referred, but I have made it .clear, at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, and on other occasions that this Government favoured the transfer of secondary industries from congested capital cities to (iountry districts. Failing that, the Government preferred to see now industries established in the less populous capital cities such as Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. For the sake of the economy of the less populous States, decentralization of industry would be the best policy. That comment applies par-, ticularly to South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia, which are not so favourably situated economically as are New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. Wherever the opportunity occurs, we shall endeavour to secure the establishment of secondary industries in the less populous States. Therefore, the Government welcomes at any timeproposals for the establishment of new industries in the smaller capital cities, and, if necessary, the transfer of industries from congested capital cities to other parts of the Commonwealth. The 'Secondary Industries Commission made a special investigation of the claims of Western Australia to see whether new industries could be encouraged in that State. The Government will continue to give effect to that policy. CIVILAVIATIO N. SYDNEY - ISIITGAPORE - LOND ON SERVICE NA",18
29,Mr BERNARD CORSER,EAGLE FARM,"I ask the Minister for Air whether Brisbane has been discarded as a port of call for Qantas aircraft, on the Sydney-Singapore-London service. Has the United States of America-Pacific air service [42 ] decided to vacate the Eagle Farm aerodrome at Brisbane? If so, what endeavours does the Government propose to make to prevent excessive centralization of air services in the southern States?",18
30,Mr DRAKEFORD,EAGLE FARM,"I answer ' the last question first, by saying that, under provisions that Were laid down by the International Conference on Civil Aviation that was held at Chicago last year, each nation is obliged to provide an international airport. The Government has decided thut the international airport in Australia; shall he located at Sydney. This, in my opinion, does not indicate that there is to be a centralization of all civil aviation interests at Sydney. The Eagle Farm aerodrome has. been occupied up to the present by the American Air Force, and on occasions has been used by civil aircraft. It is to be taken over again by Australian authorities, and will be used as an airport for Australian air services. The air service from London to Sydney, via Singapore, was resumed today. So far as I am aAvare, it is not intended to use Brisbane as a port of call for the present. I shall make inquiries, ancl if that is to be the permanent intention, I shall ascertain the reasons for it and furnish them to the honourable member.",18
31,Mr HADLEY,EAGLE FARM,"Is it a fact that the Department of the Interior intends selling for removal a number of homes at Eagle Farm, Brisbane, which were impressed hy the department during the war? Will the Minister for the Interior allow these houses to remain in their present position, as they are not interfering with the use of the aerodrome?",18
32,Mr JOHNSON,EAGLE FARM,"The homes impressed at Eagle Farm were, as the honourable member knows,' for the purpose of housing members of the forces. I shall have an investigation made, and the honourable member will be supplied with information later. AERODROME. TELEPHONE SERVICES. Mr CHAMBERS,- I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General the following questions:-(1 ) What number of applications for telephone installations has been received from each State since the cessation of hostilities with Japan? (2) How many new telephone subscribers have been added to the list in each State since those hostilities ceased? (3) If , as has been stated by postal authorities, the necessary equipment for the installation of telephones can be made in Australia, will the Postmaster-General ascertain the reason for the numerous complaints by business people and the general public because of their inability to obtain this very important and, in many instances, urgent service? (4) Will the Postmaster General investigate the possibility of having some of the materials that are in short, supply manufactured by private firms, if this course will help to reduce period for which intending subscribers would have to wait for this service, should the output from the postal manufacturing plant have to be relied upon to supply all requirements ?",18
33,Mr CALWELL,EAGLE FARM,"I shall ask the Postmaster-General to supply answers to the first three questions. I shall also ask him to give consideration to the suggestion that is made in the fourth question. Last week, the honourable - member for Bass referred to the number.of persons still awaiting the installation of telephones in either business premises or - private residences. I then stated that about 60,000 persons in Australia desired to have this facility provided for them. That fact furnishes evidence of the high degree of prosperity that exists in the community at the present time. This high degree of prosperity arises from the fact that the nation has a remarkably good government in office. NA NEW SOUTH WALES. SUPPLY OF WIRE.",19
34,Sir EARLE PAGE,FLOOD DAMAGE IN NORTHERN,"Recently , the Premier of New South Wales, Mr. MCKell, announced that arrangements had been made for the early release of wire and other materials in short supply. He said that farmers should lodge their orders at once with their storekeepers, who, in turn, should have, them sponsored by a field officer of the Department Agriculture. As practically all of those the matter. who last year suffered from the floods that, occurred in the northern rivers - district of New South Wales have not been able to obtain any barbed wire or fencing wire, will the Prime Minister have an inventory made of the quantity and location of wire _ that is available in Commonwealth and State departments, and publish it, sd that these persons may know whether or not there is any possibility of tlieir being able to obtain supplies in the immediate, future?",19
35,Mr CHIFLEY,FLOOD DAMAGE IN NORTHERN,"I have not seen the statement to which the right honourable gentleman has referred.' I shall, make inquiries, with a view to determining the whether it is possible to supply the information, for which he has asked. NA COMMITTEE.",19

37,Mr MULCAHY,WAR EXPENDITURE,"Can the Minister for the Army give any indication to the dependents of men who are in detention camps for military offences, a3 to when they may be released ?",19
38,Mr FORDE,WAR EXPENDITURE,"As there are about 1,000 army personnel in detention camps, I cannot give details of the periods for which the detention is to last or when it is likely that all of the men will be released. I shall obtain the information, and make it available to the honourable gentleman.",19
39,Mr CONELAN,WAR EXPENDITURE,"Severa l weeks ago I asked the Minister for the Army whether he had received a report from the committee that was set up to investigate army detention camps and courts-martial. If he has not yet received it, will he endeavour to have its delivery expedited in order that it may be presented to Parliament - before we adjourn this week?",19
40,Mr FORDE,WAR EXPENDITURE,I understand that the committee is completing its report. When I receive it I hope to he able to of recommend that some action be taken in FAT STQCK SALES IN ' . MELBOURNE.,19
41,Mr RANKIN,WAR EXPENDITURE,"As ' the meat producers of Victoria have honoured the bargain that they made, by sending normal supplies of meat to the Newmarket saleyards, does the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture propose, in his turn, to honour immediately his promise to lift the restrictions on sales?",20
42,Mr SCULLY,WAR EXPENDITURE,"Actio n was taken today to honour that promise. There has never been any reason to doubt, that it would be honoured. A legal formality has to be complied with. Notice of the lifting of the restrictions will be published in the Commonwealth Gazette, ancl they will be lifted not later than Thursday, that being the earliest date on which such action can be taken legally. AUSTRALIAN . EXHIBITIONI N LONDON.",20
43,Mr CALWELL,WAR EXPENDITURE,"Melbourne-Ministe for Information and Immigration) by leave-On Thursday last, the honorviously able member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser), quoting from a Melbourne Herald report, asked me to ascertain whether unrepreowned sentative lists of State attractions had been circulated at the "" Meet Australia "" exhibition, which opened in London on Tuesday, the ' 2nd April. I have now received a report from Mr Thomas Army Dunbabin, Director of the Australiau News and Information Bureau in Lonwill don, which indicates that, once again, the Melbourne Herald has gone out its way to ascribe to my department suitable blame which really does not belong to Mr Dunbabin reports as follows:At the opening of the Australian lists of State products, fauna, flora and other characteristics were not circulated among visitors, but appeared on glass panels each State coat-of-arms. Snakes, penguins, and wombats figured on the panels, which were designed early this year by a high Ministry of Information official. I noticed this and decided to have them altered. Pike, Agent-General for Queensland, told he disliked the inclusion of snakes on Queensland panel and we substituted copper, Queensland's other main products having already been included. The British Ministry of Information readily agreed to tliese alteracapital tions and the job was completed on Thursday morning, A p r i l 4. Apart from this and one or two other very minor blemishes which we have also had corrected, the exhibition gives a fine general picture of Australia and in the first two-and-a-half days attracted 10,540 visitors. FEDERAL GUIDE.",20
44,Mr CALWELL,WAR EXPENDITURE,"by leave-On Wednesday, the 20th - March, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard) asked whether, in view of the fact that the publication known as the Federal Guide had not been revised since 1944, I would take action to have the book brought up to date. I have made inquiries, and find that it has been decided that an appropriate time to issue a new edition of the Federal Guide would be immediately after the general elections to be held later this year. The Prime Minister has given instructions that this shall be done. REGENT'S PARK. PROPOSED RESUMPTION.",20
45,Mr MORGAN,WAR EXPENDITURE,"Is the Minister for the Army aware of proposals for the r resumption by his department of about 100 acres of land in Regent's Park, preused by the United States Army for storage purposes? The land includes about 20 acres, part of the larger area, by the Hume Pipe Company. That company has plans for the extension of its operations, which would result in the employment of several hundred men. . If the proceeds with its present proposal, the plans of the Hume Pipe Company be hindered. As there is plenty of lancl available for the Army,.while the of Hume Pipe Company cannot find other land in the area, will the Minister it. inspect the site with a view to ensuring that the proper interests of all the parties exhibition, concerned are protected? ' Mr Forde - I fully realise the imbelow portance of the Hume Pipe Company|s works at Regent's Park, and I shall give sympathetic consideration to the honorBritish able member's request. A sub-committee Mr of Cabinet, under the chairmanship of me the Minister for the Interior, has been the appointed to investigate the whole matter of accommodation for Commonwealth departments and for the services in the cities. It is the desire of the Government to vacate as many buildings as possible, so that they may revert to private owners or to private tenants. During the war, many people were dispossessed of their accommodation, and the Government wishes to return it to them. On the other hand, certain valuable equipment of the fighting services must be stored, and Commonwealth departments must continue to function. The Government has prepared a building programme for the various capital cities, which, when completed, will enable Commonwealth departments to vacate many buildings which they now occupy.",20
46,Mr MORGAN,WAR EXPENDITURE,But employment is the paramount consideration.,21
47,Mr FORDE,WAR EXPENDITURE,I recognize that.,21
48,Mr MORGAN,WAR EXPENDITURE,"""Will the Minister hold up this proposed resumption until the matter has been inquired into?",21
49,Mr FORDE,WAR EXPENDITURE,"I wish to confer with the Minister for the Interior on the subject of the Regent's Park resumption. Last week, a conference was held between' representatives of the Department of the Interior, the Air Porce and the Army to discuss accommodation for the storing of equipment. I shall go into the matter raised hy the honourable member, and furnish a reply later. MR. E. J. WARD, M.P. STATEMENT AT MELBOURNE TRADES HALL .",21
50,Mr HUTCHINSON,WAR EXPENDITURE,"Has the Prime Minister seen press reports of a speech' made by the Minister' for Transport (' Mr Ward) in the Melbourne Trades Hall one' day last week when he said, among other things, that the power of the High Court would' have to wealth, be curbed, that socialism was the aim of the Labour party and that the social servicesso far provided by the vernment were mere palliatives? the Minister speaking on behalf of' Government or on his own behalf ? If his own behalf, where does 'Cabinet responsibility begin and end so far as this Government is concerned?",21
51,Mr CHIFLEY,WAR EXPENDITURE,"I did not see the press report. As I have previously stated, Ministers speak, not on behalf of the Government, but to express their own personal views. The views of the Government are expressed by its leader. That .is time of all governments, no matter what party. I made that clear before, and I repeat it now. 'ELECTORAL ACT. AGE QUALIFICATION FOR FRANCHISE.",21
52,Mr CONELAN,WAR EXPENDITURE,"Has the Prime Minister seen a statement by President Truman advocating the extension of the franchise to those who have reached the age of eighteen years. As there is a law in Queensland giving the vote in State elections to all those who have served in the forces, will the Prime Minister give consideration to the proposal put forward by President Truman?",21
53,Mr CHIFLEY,WAR EXPENDITURE,"The matter raised by the honourable gentleman concerns government policy.

54,Mr FADDEN,WAR EXPENDITURE,Will the Minister for Commerce state the results of the action promised by him in this House some weeks ago with regard to the Brisbane meat strike? Is it a fact that the farmers are reluctantly compelled to slaughter tlieir own pigs in order to 'minimize as far as possible financial loss?,21
55,Mr SCULLY,WAR EXPENDITURE,"We did have an investigation, but the results were not very satisfactory. The dispute is confined to Queensland, and when, a move was made on behalf of the Commonwe were given to understand that ii, was definitely a State matter and that our intrusion was not welcome. We have Gokept in constant touch with the situation ; Was although we have been unable to do the anything. The situation today seems more satisfactory than it was previously. on We hope that the strike will be settled soon.

56,Mr SHEEHAN,WAR EXPENDITURE,"Is the Minister for Post-warReconstruction aware that of in America fur coats are being manufactured from Australian sheepskins? As there will be a huge demand for these products, will the Minister arrange for the manufacture of fur coats in Australia from sheepskins?",21
57,Mr DEDMAN,WAR EXPENDITURE,"I have read reports about that matter. Indeed, I have seen within the precincts of this House samples, of sheepskins treated in that manner, and it does seem to me that they are an excellent material for imitation fur garments. I understand that patent rights over the process are held by an American firm. Until that firm appoints some firm to act for it in Australia or itself undertakes production in this country, I cannot see that the Department of Post-war Reconstruction can do anything. ever, I shall have investigations made and ensure that whatever encouragement can be given to the industry shall be given if 'there is any intention on the part of the patentees to begin manufacture in this country: NORTHERN TERRITORY. RE - BUILDI NG OF DARWIN . Mi\ BLAIN - Has the Minister for the' Navy conferred with senior Naval officers to ascertain whether the Navy really requires the choice civic centre area of Darwin for the erection of workshops and administrative officers? In view of t.he fact that half the square could accommodate the offices, and that there is ample land available elsewhere for the workshops, will the Minister seriously reconsider this matter and give an assurance that the Navy will not require that civic centre as at present designed? Will he also inform the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) and the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr. , Lazzarini) that it is intended to let the Mclnnes-Symonds-Miller plan stand sub- stanti ally as it is ?",22
58,Mr MAKIN,WAR EXPENDITURE,"The honourable member will a ppreciate that Darwin must always play an important part in Commonwealth defence plans. Security must at all times take precedence over any other consideration. The workshops required for the Navy must be adjacent to the wharfs. The needs of the naval services must bemet in the most convenient manner. Naval .buildings must be erected on sites that will make for the most efficient service possible. However, I shall certainly have a further investigation made to ascertain whether anything can be done to give effect to the suggestion of the honourable member. NA SYDNEY.",22

60,Mr JOHNSON,OFFICE ACCOMMODATION I N,"I have given consideration to Mr Westhoven's report. I find that since his appointment to make the investigation the position has eased in the various capital cities. Honourable members should not imagine that with the end of the war and the removal of the fear of invasion obligations to the men responsible for victory cease. There are several Commonwealth departments that must continue to carry out demobilization and re-establishment of the armed forces. Those activities require accommodation.' The Commonwealth Government is most anxious to bring about whatever relief is possible, but it appears that no more progress cau be made than has been made in the direction of vacating premises for civil use, with the exception of a few transfers that are how being made.

Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND BEADING.",23
68,Mr CHIFLEY,EMPIRE RADIO TRAINING,"Macquarie - Prime .Minister and Treasurer) [4.0] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. Numerous requests have been made for relief from sales tax in respect of a wide range of goods. A review of these requests has been made, and within the limits imposed by the financial commit-' ments of the Government, it is now proposed to grant certain further concessions relating to those goods in respect of which the most meritorious claims have been advanced. The relief now proposed will involve an annual loss of revenue amounting to £1,400,000. It will be recalled that in September, 1945, relief to the amount of £2,800,000 per annum was granted, so that the sales tax concessions allowed during the current financial year will involve a total revenue loss of £4,200,000 per annum. A concise statement of the goods covered by the present proposals has been circulated for the information of honourable members. It will be seen that certain goods are being removed from the Third Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, thus reducing the rate of tax thereon from the maximum of 25 per cent, to' the genera] rate of 12$ per cent., with one exception. Among the goods affected are sheepskin garments, which will become subject to tax at the special rate of 7$ per cent, applicable to clothing generally. The goods affected by the proposed reduction of rate are goods which are not luxuries, and it is that the continued application of the leave- I movemaximum rate of 25 per cent, in respect of these goods would be undesirable. Exemption from tax is being restored in respect of certain goods which were exempt from tax in the pre-war period. These goods are chiefly foodstuffs, such as canned meats, canned vegetables and similar goods. A limited range of new exemptions is proposed, affecting, in the main, some items of building materials, certain goods for use in primary producported tion and goods for the use of non-profit making schools, school committees, and infant welfare centres. There .are also certain drafting amendments of the sales existing provisions for exemption of to manufacture. The most important of these is to extend that exemption so as to cover machinery and equipment leased by & manufacturer for use in manufacturing operations. The exempjust tion has hitherto been limited terms to machinery, & c , purchased, i m ported or manufactured by a manufacturer for his own use. It is proposed that the amendment extending the exemption to leased goods shall be deemed to have commenced on the 13th September, 1945, that is, the date of commencement of the exemption of manufacturers' machinery. A slight consequential amendment of the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 9> 1930-1936 is also required in this connection, and a separate bill will be introduced for that purpose. Subject to a. few exceptions which are indicated in the statement which I have circulated, the amendments will be operative on and from tomorrow, the 10th April, 1946. The bill is limited to the allowance of concessions and will, therefore, no doubt, meet with general approval. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES ) adjourned. NA (No. 9) 1946.

SECOND HEADIN G.",23
69,Mr CHIFLEY,SAXES TAXASSESSMENTBILL,"Macquarie-Prime felt Minister and Treasurer) [4.3], - by That the bill be now read a second time. As explained in connection with the bill to amend the 'Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, provision is made in that bill for an extension of the exemption of manufacturers' machinery and equipment so as to cover machinery, & c , which is leased by manufacturers in addition to that which is purchased or imby them. This necessitates a slight consequential amendment of the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 9) 19301936, which deals with the imposition of tax on leased goods. It will be proaids vided in the regulations that manufacturers who are entitled to freedom from tax in respect of their plant shall quote their certificates of registration when leasing such plant from other persons, as they already do when purchasing by its or importing similar plant. It is necessary to make a consequential amendment of the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 9) to ensure that there will be no liability fortax under that Act when the lessee quotes his certificate in respect of the leasing of the goods. This will conform to the provisions in other Sales Tax Assessment Acts which authorize freedom from tax upon the sale or importation of goods in respect of which the purchaser or importer quotes his certificate. The bill is for this purpose only, and is designed only to effectuate the exemption of machinery, & c , leased by manufacturers. It is proposed that the bill shall be deemed to have commenced on the 13th September, 1945, that is, the date of commencement of the exemption of aids to manufacture in the form of plant and machinery.

BLAIN (Nortliern Territory ) [4.i j -""When I asked leave, last Friday, to continue my remarks I had dealt only with the Constitution alteration measures which relate to the orderly , marketing of primary products and social services. I now intend to discuss the measure dealing with employment in industry. I thrashed this subject out thoroughly in this House in 1936, when I vigorously opposed the attempt then being made by the Labour, party to foist nationwide uniformit y on the community. I said then that I regarded that as a crazy idea, but I also stated that I was favourable to local or regional uniformity. The Labour party at that time, under the leadership of Mr . Curtin, Avas sponsoring a policy of nationwide uniformit y which was to be enforced by a central authority. My view was then and is now that, whereas such nationwide uniformit y is impracticable, regional uniformit y is highly desirable. I stated that I had heen successful in an effort to secure a measure of suc.li' regional uniformit y at Darwin. I pointed out that carpenters working on one side of a road in .Works Department workshops were receiving 6s. 6d. a'week less than carpenters working on the other side of the road in raihvay workshops an anomaly which naturally caused dissension. When I made representations on' the subject to the Government it was realized that the situation was ridiculous, and steps were taken to have the pay of the carpenters of the Works Department increased to the rate that was being paid to those of the Eailways Department. That is the kind of thing I have in mind when I speak of regional uniformity. On the 16th September, 1936, I asked the then Prime Minister, Mr Lyons, the following question:I ask the Prime Minister whether when proposed Constitution alterations are submitthe ted to the people for tlieir approval, he will give the electors an opportunity to say whether they wish to abolish State parliaments, have instituted in their stead new administrawas tive regions, based on voluntary effort, so that each such district will have given to greater real control of its domestic policy? This would enable the Commonwealth to had movedbecome a real federation, and enable this Parliament to concern itself with only national questions, and prevent its_ attention being diverted to domestic and local issues. His reply wasThe .intention of the Government in regard to the referendum will be disclosed to the House at a very early date. As I received no satisfaction to my first inquiry, I asked the then Attorney General, Mr Menzies, a similar question on the 12th November, 1936In view of the difficulty arising from c6ntinual State spending sprees with Commonwealth money, will the Attorney-General consider the desirability of redrawing the map of Australia on sectional lines as follows: The abolition of State boundaries and setting up in their stead regional areaswith a diversification of interests in keeping with a common geographic background; vested with regional authority to deal with (cr) domestic policy: (ft) regipnal industrial laws in keeping witli natural endowments and local economic position ? The reply of the right honourable gentleman was "" No "". My question states my attitude clearly, but unfortunately those views on the subject of Constitution alteration, do not correspond with the views of t.he Government, nor were they in harmony with the view of the Government'of that time. Pressure groups seem to have secured control of the present Government. At any rate the Ministry does not appear to be favourable to regional uniformity. I consider that if regional authorities were established the people would develop a sense of responsibility in respect of their own looal districts. The amendment of the Constitution which we are now considering would if it were accepted, tend to deaden any sense of responsibility that the people might now have in respect of either local or national affairs. For that reason I deeply regret that the Government should still be attempting to apply a policy of national uniformit y or centralization. I the consider that it should attempt to redraw map of Australia on a regional basis. I discussed this subject in this House on and . the 12th November, 1936, when. leave being sought to introduce the Constiit tution Alteration (Aviation) Bill . The then Attorney-General, Mr Menzies, That he have leave to bring in a bill for an act to alter the Constitution with, respect to air navigation and aircraft. Upon that niotion, the then honourable member for Fremantle, Mr Curtin, hail moved the following amendment:That, after the word ""aircraft"", the words "" tr.ade and commerce, industrial matters, broadcasting and television "" be added Speaking to the motion and the amendment, I said I do not support the amendment of thu Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), because I believe that it is a hopeless proposition. This continent is so vast that any centralization, of industrial powers in the Commonwealth Government, ns proposed in the amendment, would be unworkable. When we find today that it is impossible to control even a State satisfactorily from one centre, it should be patent to honourable members that the Commonwealth could not effectively utilize such powers throughout the Commonwealth as a whole. In the United States of America a situation similar to that existing today in Australia has developed. In an article in the Review of Reviews, Arthur Pound advocates that the internal map of the United States of America should be withdrawn, and offers many observations which apply to conditions in Australia, nnd of which we should take notice if we are to overcome our difficulties. He postulates, that the States in the United States of An'iericn are so weak that they cannot carry on as they exist today, and he urges that the country should be regionalized and sectionalized.. Many of his views are applicable to Australia's position in this respect. He says- Where can a balance be struck between centralization and decentralization, between the unmanageable vastness of America and the feebleness of Statehood? Government already has given the lead toward the correct answer; realignment of the nation along sectional lines. The Federal Reserve Act divides the nation into twelve districts, each under its own board, which adapts policy to sectional needs, in'acknowledgment of the cold truth that finance cannot he fairly administered from a central point. The army maintains nine corps areas. Some of the strongest Labour unions operate on a district plan, notably the United Mine Workers. Likewise the alumni association of two great universities, Michigan ancl Stanford, are districted territorially. Similarly, I contend we must realign our continent sectionalIy. It would be futile for me to suggest that State governments be. done away with, much as I believe it, because the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) would immediately reply that the}' have sovereign powers. In this matter I. think that the Opposition sliould come to the Government's rescue, ancl "" help it to pass this legislation immediately, without reservations. It shoulddo "" first things first"". It should help the primary producers as the Government seeks to do under the proposal which is to be submitted to the people in conjunction with this fresh proposal relating to the power to control aviation. It is useless for us in this couutry to concentrate powers which should be sectionalized. The concentration of powers in the States is too great already; it is foolish to accentuate it in a Commonwealth sphere. In this respect we might well copy developments in the United States of America, which is in similar trouble. Arthur Pound's article continues The primary federal responsibilities lire national defence, a postal systemcoinage of .money and control of - a ""monetary unit, preservation of free trading and travel rights throughout the union, and the adjudication of disputes between States'and the citizens of different States. Practically everything else-commerce , agriculture, labour, finance, employment, relief, redistribution of wealth,, all social legislation of every sort-migh t well be left to the several districts for solution. Those remarks are applicable to this legislation. The interests of the people should be aroused regionally, and they sliould be compelled to play their part. That, as I view, the matter, is the new order. It is nonsensical to have extreme centralization of power, the effect of which would be to place the Parliament at the mercy of the electors, making its members subject to blackmail, ancl inducing those who' are sufficiently craven. to "" cadge"" votes. I strongly stress my conviction that that is the direction in which the Parliament is d r if t in g today. Arthur Pound went on to sayVariety of social experience means progress. Uniformity over so vast a geographic expanse means stagnation. I recall those wise words because I believe that they apply just as forcefully today as they did when they were uttered. I appeal to. honourable members not to imagine that these proposals will provide a panacea for all ills. They remind me more of a juggler's box of tricks, which are accompanied by the use of the magic word, "" abracadabra "" . I believe that I express what is in the minds of ex-servicemen, who have a complete mental picture of what is occurring. Tbese proposals will not appeal to any of them. They are more strongly inclined to become, individualists today than they were five years ago. I do not believe that there will be any appeal to those who are outside the boundaries of Sydney, Melbourne, and other capital cities. The Government is not exhibiting an Australian outlook, am, I fear that it will be sternly rebuked by the people at the referendum. I? appears to think that the people are waiting to have a funny story told to them about a "" gimme "" club-in other words, the Commonwealth Government. I refuse to belong to a "" gimme"" club. I would rather go to my electors, as I can at any time, and say to them, ""Do not look to the Government for everything. Do something for yourselves. Become interested in a regional set-up, and insist that States shall be eventually abolished, but definitely not before the Commonwealth Parliament has delegated almost plenary powers to regional authorities "". I am pleased to pay a compliment to"" the Premier of New South Wales, whom I have not yet had the honour of meeting. He has been to America, and has profited by the experience that be gained in that country. I often wonder what profit has been derived by the members of the Commonwealth Government who have been abroad. Mr. MCKell visited the remarkable corporation sponsored, from Washington, but given the authority to work out its own destiny-the Tennessee Valley Authority. Already, he has subdivided New South Wales into sixteen regions. I doubt very much whether honourable members know where that regional organization is operating. The staff is located in the Premier's office in Macquarie-street. I advise all honourable members to inspect the maps wbicb tliose men are preparing. All are technical men, mostly surveyors amd other planners who have made a complete study of the matter. The .maps show the sixteen regions into which New South Wales was divided after. Mr. MCKell had learned what a wonderful job regional committees were doing in the United States of America; they are:Elcbmond-Tweed, Clarence, Oxley, Newcastle, Illawarra, Monaro-South, Coast, New England, Upper Hunter, Mitchell, Southern Tablelands, Namoi, Macquarie, Laehlan, Murrumbidgee, Upper Murray, and Central Murray. The local people are intensely intrigued at having been asked to gather and - fsollate all the available information relation to their own districts, and mould it into a local policy that can be placedbefore' the central government. fear, however, that Mr MCKell isunfor willing to pursue the matter to its logical Mr Main. conclusion. He could, and he should, advocate that eventually those regions should replace the State, after definite plenary powers had' been delegated to them by the Commonwealth Parliament. He has gone so far that he must now go farther. It is not enough to have a survey made of those regions, and to get the people interested. Already that has heen done. They are flattered at having had their services enlisted by the Government, ancl must now be given the statutory authority to express themselves practically. I hope to meet Mr MCKell next week. I shall then urge him to go farther, and not to leave the matter in a state from which it cannot be brought to fruition. If regionalism comes in, uniformity throughout Australia under a central government must go out. We must decide between the one and the other. We should strive for regionalism, and discard uniformity. The only uniformity with which I bave any sympathy is that of a regional authority. I have already stated my views in regard to the proposals relating to em.ployment and social services. Instead of telling the people that they are to be given this and that, we should increase the basic wage. We have only to go to our electorates to learn that the prices charged for commodities are either those that rule on the black market or those which the average workman on the basic wage cannot pay. Why not have a basic wage that would be comparable with the cost of living? Then, the people would be able to walk down the street with their shoulders squared, proud of the fact that they were individualists, instead of expecting the Commonwealth Government to be a "" gimme"" club. At the inception of federation, Henry Parkes gave expression to the famous phrase, "" A people for a continent, and a continent for a people"". He did not mean that we were to be a race of cadgers. What be had in mind was that when the Creator made an Australian be threw away the mould, expecting all those who in followed to be individualists and family to men who would own their own homes. I am considerably interested in the I benefits which it is proposed to provide university students. I believe that under the Australian system of education any one with the necessary will and brains will achieve his ambition, on however high a plane it might be. I am in favour of a free university, such as there is in Perth, and, I believe, in Queensland. But the trouble is that young men and women are induced to become educated up to the university standard only to find, to their sorrow, that they cannot progress any f u r ther because they lack the necessary ability. Still, I bold the view that every individual should be educated to the stage at which be will have an awareness of the things that are around him. He should bave a knowledge of geology, so that when ""he walks over a piece of ground he will have some conception of what lies underneath. He should also make a study of physics and chemistry as well as of lierature, which will enable bim to appreciate the beauty that is in nuture. He should read John Buskin in order to understand the meaning of Sesame and Lilies. Nevertheless, at the matriculation stage the culling process sliould begin. The student should then depend on himself more or less. Unless we adopt that course, we shall not be f to the students. How many persons undertake university courses, only to discover that they have not the necessary talent to continue them to the end? It is disappointing to find such persons expecting to obtain white collar jobs, when they ought to have commenced to learn a trade at the age of fifteen years and later have taken their places in the community, not as disgruntled citizens, as many of them are today, subject to all the "" foreign countries, but rather as excellent tradesmen., I have a great admiration for the crafts. I consider that only those persons should untertake university courses who have the ability to pursue their studies to the end. Nevertheless, I am in favour of free education. Many of our citizens could never have reached the heights to which they bave attained had they not won a. bursary or had free education right to the university. Many honourable members stress the very hard times which they had in their youth in attempting to obtain an advanced education. Were I to relate to the House the struggle that I had to matriculate and to pass the examinations for entrance to a highly technical profession, many honourable members would be sceptical. I have no desire to prevent the sons of workers from going to the university, as the honourable member for Premantle (Mr . Beazley) inferred. I-did not wear a boot until I was ten years of age, nor had I a sight of the sea until I was fourteen years of age. I was the youngest of eight children, and was bred in the far west of Queensland. I had to leave school, chop down trees, and work in a gravel pit on railway construction, in order to earn enough money to go to the city to study and matriculate. I mention these facts in refutation of the suggestion that I do not desire the sons of workers to obtain an advanced education. I have been right through the mill. But if we are to allow students to continue their studies, and not cull before it is too late, we shall have a community of democratic idealists and misguided intellectuals' who will be a menace to the country. The true unionist, the craftman, is ""the""salt of the earth"", but democratic idealists are poisoning the minds of the people today. (When they find that they cannot go on a i r with a university course they turn to a pseudo science, such as economics. They take up some "" ology"" which serves to conceal the fact that they are not fit to qualify for one of the learned professions. We have a whole flock of tbem in Australia at the present time, and they bave turned into soap-box orators in Hyde Park and on the Yarra Bank. The trouble with this country is that so many people seom to have gone "" cuckoo"" or isms "" fro m "" Commo "" or something.",24

The real feeling of the people in this matter will be reflected in - the votes of the soldiers when they are discharged.

73,Mr RIORDAN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Kennedy) [4.33] - I understand that a suggestion has been dum. made that a wailing wall should be erected in this chamber for honourable members to weep against on Grievance Day. I certainly think that the time has arrived when there should be erected this chamber a rail for the benefit of rail-sitters. During the last week or so, we have been treated to the spectacle the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies), and all his followers of Liberal party, sitting on the vail instead - of taking sides one way or the other garding the Government's referendum proposals. The honourable members of the Australian Country party also sat on the rail until their leader *(M.r. Fadden) returned, and launched an attack on three of the proposals.. From time to time, the Opposition has criticized' Labour Government for being subject to powers sought. caucus control. At least, we do not believe in a one-man band. It is quite obvious that the'- Australian Country party had not decided its attitude to referendum proposal until its leader turned and stated a case for them. The Le?der of the Opposition spoke about an elected convention to decide upon proposals for the alteration of the stitution, but he gave no indication the basis upon which such a convention should be elected. He did not say whether the election should be conducted on party political lines, or whether representation should be according to industry, or accordthe ing to some other method. All.he said was the Constitution should be referred to an elected convention for overhaul. have an elected Parliament now, and not - long ago a convention sat in Canberra, consisting of representatives of all parties in this Parliament, and in the State liaments. This convention reached an agreement regarding proposed alterations to the Constitution, and the State sentatives agreed to go back to their Parliaments'and to support legislation refer certain agreed-upon powers to Commonwealth. Well, Ave know what the happened. The State Premiers introduced the legislation, but they could not persuade the reactionary upper houses of State legislatures to accept it. Then thei Commonwealth Government put the proposals for the alteration of the Constitution before the people in a referenThe Leader of the Opposition, in his speech on these three bills, did not state definitely where he stood. His talk about an elected convention was for the purpose in of dodging the issue. As is well known, there are three methods of effecting alterations of the Constitution. First, the State of may refer certain powers to,the Commonwealth. Tbey were asked to do this, and the they failed to do so. Secondly, since the Commonwealth Constitution is an react of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, that Parliament could be asked io amend it. However, the Constitution itself contains provision for effecting alterations to it. so that the Parliament all of the United Kingdom would certainly tell us to use that method, and ask the the people, in a referendum, to concede the During the war, and, more particularly, since the end of the war, it has been found that the Commonwealth Parliament lacks the certain powers necessary to legislate on rebehalf of the people. Therefore,, the Government is seeking to obtain these powers, and it proposes to submit certain questions to the people on the date of the Congeneral election. The honourable member of for Fawkner (Mr Holt) said that election day bad been chosen because the Government wished to divert public attention from the failures 6f the Govern- ment. .Nothing could be further from truth. I understand that the honourable member for Fawkner is a lawyer, ancl he must know, therefore, why the We Government is submitting to the people the proposal in regard to social services. He said that the idea was to place the Opposition on the defensive. I maintain Parthat the Government has no need to do anything of the kind. I bave been in this Parliament for nearly ten years, and reprenever in all that time have T seen an Opposition so devoid of fighting spirit to as is the present one. The Leader of the the Opposition has said, ""We will fight the Government, every week, every day and every hour"", even if he did not borrow the famous phrase about fighting on the beaches, in the streets, and on the hillSj but if the performance of the Opposition during this session is any indication Of its fighting ability,- there can be no doubt of the result of the election. The Government will be returned with an increased majority. The Opposition is squealing its objection to the Government's proposals for the alteration of the Constitution because it realizes only too well that the Labour party will be in office to exercise the powers now being sought. The real objection is not to anything in the proposals themselves, but to the fact that the powers will be exercised by the present Government. Let us see where members of the Opposition stand regarding the proposals themselves. The first bill proposes that powers shall be obtained to legislate in respect of maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment and sickness benefit, medical and dental benefits, and family allowances. Has the honourable member foiEawkner not heard of an application that was made to the High Court by the Attorney-General of the Government of Victoria to test the validity of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act? The benefits under that provision were being financed through the appropriation power of the Commonwealth Parliament, but the High Court ruled that this power was being improperly used for this purpose. Tlius, the whole social service set-up of the Commonwealth was immediately placed in jeopardy. If the power sought be not granted, what do honourable members opposite think will become of the social services enumerated in the bill? They have seized eagerly on the medical and dental services in an endeavour to frighten the people into destroying the whole fabric of Commonwealth social services, including many which the people have enjdyed for a long time. TheLeader of the Australian Country party said that, if this particular power were granted, it. would lead to the nationalization of medical services, and he urged that as a reason why the people should deny the power to the. Commonwealth. I invite the Opposition to go out into the highways and by-ways, and tell the people just where they stand on sueh. issues. The right honourable gentleman fiercely 'denounced the nationalization of health services. He comes from the same State as I do, Queensland, which is the best State in tke Commonwealth. Thanks to a Labour government which has been in office there for the last 30 years, with a brief interruption of three years, there is in existence there a State bealth service which is as complete as the limited resources of a State govermnent can make it. The Leader of the Australian Country party said that, under nationalization, medical standards must decline, but we have as good doctors in Queensland as are to be found in any other part of the Commonwealth. Nationalization of health services in Queensland bas not meant the lowering of medical or hospital standards. It has had the .opposite effect. There is no dependence on charity for the maintenance of hospitals. Those are facts that cannot be denied. The squeal against nationalization of health services is made, not. on behalf of the ordinary general practitioner, but on behalf of the specialists who have been robbing the people for a long time. Those in the British Medical Association who are fighting bitterly against the introdution of nationalized health services are the specialists. They can see that their days are numbered as earners of some of the largest incomes in the Commonwealth. They can see that their incomes will be substantially reduced. The people will get a far better service from a nationalized health service than they get under the present set-up. That is borne out by what has happened iii Queensland under the administration of the State Labour Government. The honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Blain) voiced certain views about the provision ""of benefits to Students. An act wa-s placed on the statute-book for the provision of certain amounts of money to assist deserving students through university courses. I know two lads in my electorate who are doctors today as the result of their having been fortunate enough to receive that nssirfcance. One-of them would never have been a doctor but for that help, because his father could not have afforded to keep him at the universityThat legislation is an untold benefit to the very lads to whom the honourable member referred, the brilliant students who come from poor, families, but it bas been placed in jeopardy because of the High Court's decision in the Pharmaceutical Benefits case. So it behoves every honourable member wbo believes in a fair deal for the workers to support this proposal. Plati tudes have been voiced in this House and on the hustings about our need for population. "" Populate or perish! "" is the cry. This Government proposes, amongst other things, to assist men with large families but limited means to be. adequately boused in decent surroundings, in other words, it proposes to subsidize rents. In time of war the paramount duty of the Government is to ensure the defence of the country, but in time of peace its paramount duty is to safeguard the health, and welfare of the people. Tbat is bound up in the first of the three bills that the Government proposes to submit to the peopio at the referendum. I bave no doubt that the people will wholeheartedly give to the Government the powers that it seeks to provide for their social welfare. The second bill proposes that the Commonwealth Parliament shall be empowered to legislate for the organized marketing of primary products, unrestricted by section 92 of the Constitution. The Leader of the Opposition' and his fellow worker, the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott), rose in their places demanding to' know what a primary product is and complaining that the bill does not define the term. Tbat is true, but the Leader of the Opposition, who a King's Counsel, knows what the law provides in regard to the definition of a term undefined in legislation. other words, every one knows what a primary product is. and the "" primary product"" bas the given to it by common usage. So wby quibble about the meaning of a term that everybody understands? I clearly that in 1936 a bill passed through this Parliament for submission to the people at a held in February, 1937, on the subject of organized marketing. Certainly the proposal was not restricted to the organized Mr Riordmi. marketing of primary products, but the point is that a fair l y similar proposal is being opposed today by the very interests that sought to have that referendum carried. The - Leader of the Australian Country party howled, "" Conscription of the primary producers! "". I intend to tackle hint on that, too. In 1937, the United Australia party and the Australian Country party, with the support of Queensland La'bour members, asked the people to give to this Parliament power to legislate for organized marketing. The people turned down the proposal. The referendum was inspired by the Privy Council decision in 1936 in the famous James case, relating to dried fruits. Previously there had been doubt amongst legal luminaries as to bow far the Commonwealth Government was bound by section 92 of the Constitution. James took his case to the Privy Council, which decided that the Commonwealth was bound by the section, which provides that trade, commerce and intercourse among the States shall 'be absolutely free. If this Government is to continue in peace-time organized marketing of primary products, it must not be restricted by section 92. Organized marketing bas been possible since the outbreak of war by the exercise of the defence power contained in the Constitution, which enables this Parliament in time of war to do things whioh it could not do in peacetime. The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) reminded us that, as the result of organized marketing during the war the indebtedness of primary producers to bankers and other money lenders has Ibeen reduced by more than £60,000,000. Already the Shylocks, the speculators and racketeers who far m In the farmers, are moving to return to the conditions that existed before term the war. Recently in Sydney a conmeaning ference was held between the tobacco growers and the tobacco manufacturers. The growers stood pat in demandremember ing an average price for their product was that would enable .tbem to carry on their industry. The manufacturers refused to referendum give them that price, and the conference broke down. The tobacco-growers were not, prepared to allow themselves to be exploited, and the manufacturers were not prepared to give them an average price that would make it possible for them at least to pay their way. If this proposal is not accepted by the people at the referendum, once again the tobacco-growers will be at the mercy of the manufacturers, because they will be forced by their economic circumstances to sell their product at below a fair - price, whereas, with a nation-wide marketing scheme controlled by the primary producers themselves, they .would be able to protect themselves against exploitation. So, in the interests of the primary producers and of the national economy this proposal should be carried. Legislation bas been passed by this Parliament for the improvement of the standard of living of the natives in Hew Guinea. No longer will they be exploited. A new era bas dawned for them. They ai'e not to return to their pre-war conditions. Those who oppose this measure, though, want the farmers to revert to the conditions of 1939. Tbey want people engaged in some primary industries to go back to sub-peasant standards. As the Constitution stands, this Parliament normally can deal with only interstate and oversea trade. It bas enjoyed greater powers during the war as the result of the operation of the defence power. Now the fighting is finished, and the National Security Act will cease to operate at the end of the year. Therefore, unless this proposal is carried, the pre-war conditions will prevail again. So it is essential that this Parliament be given this power to enable it to ensure that the primary producers shall enjoy standards equal at least to those that they have enjoyed since the outbreak of war. If it is sound for the Commonwealth Government to have the powers it has exercised for the benefit of the farmers during the war, it is equally sound that in peace-time it shall have full power to enable it to meet national problems. In Queensland, the sugar industry provides a shining example of organized primary industry. The sugar cane-grower knowshow much he will get, t.he miller knows how much be will get, the refiner knows how much be will get, the consumer knows how much he will have to pay, and the workers bave their wages 'fixed ;by the Arbitration Court. Everything is fixed. The sugar industry bas been bowled down and screamed at, because the speculators fear an exten-. sion of the principles upon wbicb .it succeeds to other forms of primary production. That is their main objection..They cloud the issue with references to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited. That is a lot of "" hooey "". The objections to the sugar industry are raised by those who bave a vested interest in seeing that the organization of the sugar industry is not applied to any other form of primary production. Before the sugar industry was organized, it was in a sad and sorry plight, but thanks to the organization which was built up by two Labour governments, one in the Commonwealth sphere, ancl the other in the State sphere, the industry has been placed on the soundest possible economic foundation. Under present conditions, I should like to own a sugar farm. The Leader of the Australian Country party, who bas been associated with the sugar industry for many years, waved his arms and said, "" This proposal will mean the conscription of primary producers "". Honourable members opposite utter similar bowls and screams aboutthe principle of preference to unionists. But a sugar-farmer is compelled to join either the Queensland Cane Growers Council, or the Australian Sugar Producers Association.",29
74,Mr FADDEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,A sugar-farmer is not compelled to join the Australian Sugar Producers Association.,32
75,Mr RIORDAN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"He bas the option of joining one or the other. That is the first aspect of conscription. The second is this: If a candidate for Kennedy advocated the removal of limitations imposed npon the number of acres that a man may farm, or interference with the industry in any way, tbese "" conscripted primary producers"" would oppose bim strongly, and be would probably lose his deposit. At a matter of fact, State governments possess power to organize marketing within their respective boundaries. Queensland bas done it successfully. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Adermann), wbo is chairman of the Peanut Board, explained what should be done regarding the establishment of these organizations. The system bas proved very successful in Queensland, but certain limitations are imposed upon a. State government. Section 92prevents them from organizing primary producers as effectively as they desire. Notable, legal cases, including the cattle cases, have arisen because a State government has endeavoured to assist its primary producers oh a State-wide basis. Restrictions which one State may desire to impose upon the entry of goods from another State would conflict with section 92. Therefore, the extent to which a State may proceed with organization is limited. The Constitution Alteration (Industrial Employment) Bill seeks power overtonus and conditions of employment in industry, but not so as to authorize any form of industrial conscription. This power is somewhat similar to, but not so wide as, the power wbicb the Commonwealth Government sought in 1944. However, the proposal, if adopted, will enable the Government to deal on a national basis with the industrial and economic problems which lie ahead. Although this Parliament lacks those powers, the States have tbem. Ar, the Constitution convention in 1942, the Premiers and Leaders of the Opposition, of the various States agreed to cede these and other powers to the Commonwealth, but unfortunately, they were not able to persuade the old men who sit in the Legislative Councils of some of the States. The people themselves were stampeded by the cry of industrial conscription. I know, because I was visiting Civil Constructional Corp camps at that time. Mr Bowmssr - I used that argument.",32
76,Mr RIORDAN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Opponent s of the referendum proposals told the Civil Constructional Corps workers, who had been brought from the south to northern Australia--""If you vote for this proposal, you will be shanghaied to Darwin as soon as yon become unemployed. It means industrial conscription"". Those men, who were already mentally disturbed, because of the war situation, were further upset by the lies and stupid! utterancesduring the referendum campaign. Now, those conditions have disappeared. The .mere fact thatindustrial conscription cannot be imposedwill dispel that fear which existed in 1944. Instead of thinking in terms of States or Australia as a, whole, some people realise that we must commence to think internationally, especially when they consider what has happened-' at recent world conferences, bow closely we are linked with other parts of the world, and how aviation bas conquered vast distances. So there is an awakening, a realization that if theNational Parliament is to function in a. national way, and, in particular deal with the problems of employment, it must have greater powers. At present the States have tbem. They can deal with the problem up to a point, but the position is not satisfactory. One State cannot introduce a 40-hour .week, or increase itsbasic wage substantially beyond' the basic wage of an adjoining State. If it did so,, ifs people would become unemployed, because the adjoining State, having a lowerbasic wage and a longer working week, would be able to flood the shops of itsneighbours with cheap goods. Throughout the world there is a trend to raise living standards. Workers of every country,, including' Great Britain, are demanding a better way of life. Tremendous indusi.rial disturbances have occurred in the-' United States of America in an endeavour to improve the standard of living and. working conditions. We in Australia once took pride in the fact that in the industrial sphere, our conditions were, an example to other nations, but today, weave lagging, because we leave the problem. to be dealt with by the States, with their limited powers. Therefore, this Parliament asks the people to grant to it certain ' powers so that it may raise the standard' of living of its own workers, in conformity with its attitude and policy and what it has already done for the natives in Australian, territories. Years ago, the Arbitration Court of Queensland introduced a 40-hourweek. Tliat decision was applied to the Cairns brewery, for example,, because it was regarded as an industry of above average prosperity. Thecourt alsoapplied the 40-hour week at Mount Morgan,, because at that time the gold-mining companythere was making; tremendousprofits. In ' other words,; by higher' wages and improved working conditions, the court gave a greater share of the prosperity of industry to the people who were engaged in it . Australia is experiencing an era of prosperity hitherto undreamt of. More money is iii"" circulation today than at any other time Is it' any wonder that there is a demand^ not by Communists-for ' all improvement of the - standard of living and industrial' conditions? During .this debate, on'e honourable member declared, "" I shall not support this bill, because it will refwove from the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, which consists of experts, the' power to determine wages and cond-i-tioriiS'. That power will be vested in this Parliament "". Did any one every bear & sillier statement? No one suggests liha't the Arbitration Court should 1 abolished. Apart from what we read' in some newspapers, there is no suggestion that this Government, by act of Parliament, will introduce a 40-hour wepk and increase the basic wage. Mr TURNIITJLT, - There is no guarantee that the Government will not do so.",33
77,Mr RIORDAN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"The Government may, or it may not. A Labour government in .Queensland many years ago introduced legislation reducing the hours of lahour to 4'4 a week. At that time, the standard working week in other States was 48 hours. By act of Parliament, the same government also increased the basic wage to £4 5s. a week, when the basic wage in most of the States was below £4 a week. Naturally, those acts caused howls and screams from opponents, but the fact that a State government, hamstrung as I have indicated, was able to do that, is all the. more reason why the Commonwealth Parliament should do as the Parliament of Queensland had the intestinal fortitude to do. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Menzies) contended that this proposed power would conflict with section 51, placitum 35 of the Constitution, wbicb empowers the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate in respect toconciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one StateThe right honourable' gentleman said that one power deals expressly with an interstate dispute, ancl the referendum proposal will be an addition to it . My view is that the proposal will give to this Parliament authority to legislate, in the wider sense, on matters relating to conciliation and arbitration, No conflict will arise. Sir Adrian Knox, a former Chief Justice of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, in Waterside Workers Federation of Australia v Commonwealth Steamship Owners' Association statedUnder section51 (xxxv) of the Constitution the Parliament has power to make laws with respect to conciliation and .arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. This power may be paraphrased as -«. power to make laws with respect to the prevention or settlement of industrial disputes, subject to two conditions, viz., that the prevention or settlement shall be effected by means of conciliation and arbitration, and be that the disputes to be dealt with shall be confined to tliose which extend beyond the 1 limits of one State. This is the important partI t is clear that this power does not authorize the Commonwealth Parliament to regulateconditions of employment by direct legislation, e.g. to prescribe by act of Parliament theminimum rate of wage to be paid or the maximum number of hours to be worked. It is. I tliink, equally clear that the power inquestion docs authorize the Commonwealth Parliament to set up a tribunal with plenary and unrestricted power to prevent or settle two-State industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration. Therefore, this power, which the Government now seeks, will give to this Parliament the necessary authority over industrial employment. The employment and marketing powers are inter-related. If we have no markets, our people will be unemployed. In order to have full employment, we must obtain markets. I remember that in 1929-32 there were neither markets nor jobs. If the power which the Government is seeking in relation to the orderly marketing of primary products be granted to the Parliament by the people, primary producers will be assured of markets for their products and also of a reasonable standard of living. If the power be not granted, conditions may deteriorate to those which existed in 1929-32N [Extension of timegranted.""] I support these three bills. I believe that the electors will, appreciate the 1 opportunity, ori election day, to grant theadditional powers to the Parliament, for they do not desire that .the social services that they have been enjoying should be denied them by reason of an adverse High Court judgment. Unless the Commonwealth Parliament is clothed with additional power in relation to social services the people may be deprived of advantages which they are now enjoying. If the prosperity wbicb the primary producers have enjoyed for the last six years is to be assured to tbem, the Government must also be given power to provide for the orderly marketing of primary products. Primary producers should not be left to the mercy of speculators and exploiters ; otherwise the living standards which they have recently enjoyed will, in times of stress, be lost to them. The power which the Government is seeking in regard to employment in industry is necessary also to ensure that the primary producers shall bave available to tbem the best, market, which is the home market, and that the workers shall biave assured . to themreasonable working conditions and rates of pay. For the reasons that I have given I support tbese three bills wholeheartedly. It is also essential that the Commonwealth Parliament shall be clothed with the power that is being sought, if in the days immediately ahead of us we are to keep our place in the international race for markets, and to ensure the steady improvement of wages and working conditions for the people.",34
78,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"""Wide Bay) [5.18] - Unlik e most bills that come before this Parliament, the mere passage of the measures will not ensure that power that is being sought will be availduced able to the Parliament, for tbese measures' are designed merely to authorize the submission of certain questions to the people by referendum. Something can be said for the contention that we should not fear to approach the people at any time for needed additional constitutional power. During the life of this federaments tion many proposals have been subat mitted to the people but very few of tbem bave been approved. It became apparent during the war that services, the powers of the Parliament were need of readjustment, but it also became apparent, in that period, that it was dangerous in some particulars to entrust to the control of a central government the destinies of distant States. Whilst I agree, therefore, that something can be said for an increase of the power of the Commonwealth Parliament in certain directions, I am conscious, like many other persons in the community, that in the last few years a serious degree of lawlessness has become evident in some sections of the community . The people concerned bave made it clear that they intend to use every means in their power to bring about alterations in our economic structure,'by revolutionary method, if necessary. In my opinion, the bill designed to give the Parliament additional power over employment in industry bas been introduced because of pressure upon the Government by those extreme sections. The bills which deal with social services and the orderly marketing of primary products'have been introduced in the hope that they will help to secure the passage of the third bill. It is significant that this lawless section of the community advocates the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange, which is also a plank ih the platform of the Labour party. In considering bills of this description, it is proper that we should bear in mind that the present Government, or any Government, will not always be on the treasury bench, but that makes it necessary to consider these proposals in the most careful manner. We should not take the risk of inflicting damage on the primary producers of Australia in the hope that by so doing we may influence the people to show their lack of confithe dence in the Government which introthese bills. We must be big enough to be national in our outlook. The first of the three measures relates to social services. We recognize that even if the Commonwealth Parliament lacks the necessary power to legislate for certain social services the State parliahave full powers to do so, and if , some time, a High Court decision should deprive the Commonwealth Parliament of power in respect of social this Parliament could still vote in money to assist State governments to provide such services. There is, of course, no reason to believe that the Commonwealth Parliament lacks the power to provide old age and invalid pensions. These services are not in jeopardy and are not included in the powers sought because the Constitution entrusts us such power. But the bill also seeks to empower the Commonwealth Parto liament to provide unemployment, ness and hospital benefits, medical dental services, and benefits to students. The High Court bas not yet ruled that the Commonwealth lacks power' in respect of any of these matters.",35
79,Mr BEAZLEY,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,What about its decision in the Pharmaceutical Benefits case?,36
80,Mr BEENAED COESEE,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"I admit land that an order of the court gives good reason for believing that if the court to give a decision in respect of pharmathe ceutical benefits it would be adverse to the Commonwealth. The main opliament. position to tbese proposals is to. the fact that they ' represent, opinion of many people, an attempt the Commonwealth Government to nationalize medical and dental services generally. That policy could be applied if this power were vested in the Comand monwealth Parliament. An attempt being made to cause the people to believe that maternity allowances, pensions and child endowment - are in jeopardy, these services are not likely to be assailed in any way. If any authority were foolish enough to approach the High Court for a decision in regard to social services, and the decision proved to be , adverse ' to the Commonwealth,"" this Parliament could still vote money the States to enable them to provide such amenities. As a mater of fact, the Govern the ment of New South Wales bad entered this field before the Commonwealth attempted to do so. "" It is view, that the Commonwealth Parliament will never be challenged on the payment of maternity allowances, widows' penpower sions, child endowment, unemployment, sickness and hospital benefits, benefits students, and family allowances. Wby, therefore, should those matters be included in the social services bill we are considering? If a need exists put the position beyond doubt, those jects should be dealt with in a separate bill, and the power in respect of medical ancl dental services, could be the subject of a separate measure. Wby should the Government risk its position in relation to tbese matters when no suggestion of a with challenge has ever been made except when it is to influence the people grant power in relation to medical and sickdental services? Wby take the risk and of losing everything in order to gain some additional ground? It will be remembered that when the previous proposals for the alteration of the Constitu- tion were before us it was said that unless the people granted the power that was being sought it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to proceed with its settlement schemes for ex-servicemen; but we all know that such schemes bad are going forward in all States although additional power was not granted by the people to the Commonwealth ParTbe lands are held by the due States and we can, and do, find in the the money. In regard to medical by and dental services, I remind honourable members that the Government of Queensland has passed legislation which ensures free treatment for children low rates for such services for people is who cannot afford to pay the usual charges of practitioners. Hospital services are also available under similar conbut ditions. There may be ground for fear that has been expressed that the ' Government is seeking this additional power in respect of medical and dental services in order that it may obtain full control over all doctors and dentists, and in that way proceed with its programme for the nationalization of medical and to dental services. By most of these means, every facility is given to the workers in big industrial centres, but they have not been extended in sufficient degree to the country people, who are equally clear in my entitled .to them. The Government proposes to ask for to legislate to give benefits to students. We are not aware exactly of to what is intended. It must be conceded that up to the present Australia bas not lagged behind other countries in the wbicb assistance it bas given to education, to through the instrumentalities of the subStates, which have had complete control of the matter, and deserve credit for the results, that have been achieved. Primary education is compulsory and free, and the children of country parents have the advantage of free transport to their schools where possible. I applaud the granting of additional benefits to students. Eor years it bas been incumbent on the Commonwealth to grant assistance to the States for the advancement of education. If it now wishes to confer benefits on students, it could do so through the medium of the States, instead of spending money on a costly referendum which will merely cause widows ancl others to fear that they may lose the pensions they now receive from the Commonwealth should these proposals not be agreed to by the people. To-day, in this House, a Minister said in reply to a question that the Government wa3 not proceeding with certain education of ex-servicemen because the necessary buildings were not available for the purpose. The States have all the buildings, teachers and other machinery that are needed.",36
81,Mr BEAZLEY,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Tb e Commonwealth is using the facilities of the States. Mr BEENAED COESEE,-Of course ir. is. Even if this referendum were carried, it still would bave to use them. Therefore, wby not give to the States the amount which it intends to spend in benefits to students? Honourable members will agree that there is warrant for the mark I made earlier, that the proposals relation to social services and organized mnrketiug are being placed before the people in the hope that they will be the means of having the third proposal accepted. No one will lose anything, whether the proposal in relation to social on it. services be accepted or rejected. Not honourable member will contend that the payment of pensions would cease, or that any Government would be disinclined to give additional benefits to students through the medium of the States, it were not carried. Facilities were not withheld from ex-servicemen because the last referendum proposals not carried. The matter of free believed medicine has been capably dealt with the Leader of the Australian Country party, wbo used information that had been obtained from authoritative sources desirable in New Zealand. We do not want our provided people to live on pills - and drugs. A concession - such as free medicine does not provide the expected benefit iii New duct, Zealand ancl it is not free when the people are taxed to provide it. In Queensland on one occasion arsenic was supplied free of cost for the destruction of prickly pear. It was used wastefully until the Government decided to make a modest charge for it. The second proposal of the Government relates to the organized marketing of primary products. Section 92 of the Constitution provides that all trade ancl commerce between the States shall be absolutely free. On that account, much difficulty bas been experienced in organizing marketing on an Australia wide basis. At the preseut time, the States can organize within their own borders. A Commonwealth organization ean be established only under a voluntary agreement between the States and the Commonwealth, all of whom are required to pass legislation designed to that end. The 1937 referendum sought power in respect of organized marketing, but was rejected because it was not limited to the marketing of primary products. The present proposal specifies the organized marketing of primary products. The aim is to obtain power to organize marketing on an Australian basis. In order t'o be successful, a marketing scheme must be re_ Australia-wide. It has been argued that in if the powers sought be granted, the Government will be able to socialize rural industries. Were I confident that the Government desires to do that, I should 'hesitate to agree that the Parliament should have this power conferred It has been apparent to one me for many years that an alteration of section 92 of the Constitution is necessary hi the'interests of primary producers and the country generally. In 1939, 1930 and 1932, I submitted to this Parliament if motions to that effect",37
82,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,That is too far back.,37
83,Mr BERNARD COESEE,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"It proves were that I - am consistent. What I then to be necessary is now exercising by the mind of the Government. This is the motion that I submitted in 1932That, ill the opinion of this ^louse it is that constitutional a!--ratiohs be to make possible the organization of primary producers on an Australian basis with complete sectional control of the internal and external riiarketing of each primary prosuch control to"" be exercised exclusively - by. the organized producers of such commodity, - which would, enable the producers of each - commodity, to speak with one voice and authority in regard to any arrangement which may bo deemed by tliem to be necessary to conserve their interests. In 1930, I used this languageTo-day a State has power to organize keting within its boundaries, and the monwealtli has power to organize export .marketing. But there is no single legislative tion of their industry. authority with power to bring into being an Australian organization, other than one voluntary, honourable agreement between producers, or by an agreement of all States mid. the Commonwealth. Where I then stood I stand today. stand for organized marketing of compowers modities' on an Australia-wide basis, commodities when the producers so which desire, such marketing to be conBy trolled by the producers selves. I do not want it to be controlled by the Government. Parliament, having been given this power, should delegate it to the producers themselves. section 92 of the Constitution is amended, t.he Commonwealth will not have this power, which is more necessary now than ever. Without such an amendment, effecwas tive control can be obtained only hy agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, such as exists in regard system of organized marketing. to the marketing of butter. This system may be satisfactory for exportable comattempt modities, but for non-exportable commodimodity ties, such as maize, it is impossible to formed organize any Commonwealth system of marketing, with the result that there is cut-throat competition between the States in times of crisis, such as drought, and there is no authority, either State or Commonwealth, which can prevent it . No organization established by a State to protect its growers can be effective against competitbe tion from another State. Primary prof ducers should have the right to organize and control markets for the disposal their commodities, just as trade unionists have the right to organize. If the proand ducers had that power there could out be a really effective council of agriculthe ture, . which would assist the govern this ment of the day to control products and oversea markets. It bas suggested that the power now being sought might be used by some government to into effect, a policy of socialization all forms of production. That, however, is true ' of many powers now held by the Commonwealth Parliament, and, in the final analysis, the result depends upon the nature of the Parliament which the people elect. Producer-control has maradvantages for the nation as well as for Comthe producers. I do not think that the. producers would stand for the nationalizaTbe Attorney under General should make it clear without the delay that the control of the proposed six marketing system must remain with the producers. Otherwise, it will be difficult I to persuade the people to concede the asked for. The Government should of also enumerate the commodities over it is intended to assume control. agreement with the producers, a list themof commodities could be drawn up, in cluding butter, cheese, wheat, meat, f r u it and vegetables, and processed products derived from theee and many other proU n t i l ducts. The publication of such a list would give the voters confidence. Now, as always, I stand for producer-control rather, than parliamentary control. That what I desired on the three occasions when I submitted in this House motions providing for the establishment of a The Paterson butter scheme was the earliest to organize the control of a comon an Australian basis, and it the pattern for similar schemes introduced later. During the war, no difficulties were experienced in connection with the control of marketing, but we should remember that throughout that period the demand for goods was always greater than the supply. No difficulty was ever experienced in selling the own commodities, but. in. some instances, producers found it difficult to get r o m the Government some fair prices f o i their commodities. On occasions, of the Government fixed prices which were below the cost of production, then paid a subsidy to the producers of the profits which it made by selling commodities on the open market. In way the Government was able to provide cheap food for the people. We been have all heard Government supporters ranting in the Sydney Domain about the put three cardinal points of Government of policy-hig h wages, shorter hours and cteap food, but it is necessary to ensure that the primary producer, too, shall receive a f a ir wage out of the price which lie receives for his commodity. The Government's third proposal is that, the control of employment and industrial conditions should be given to this Parliament, instead of being exercised by the Arbitration Court, All parties are pledged to the support of industrial arbitration, and only recently the Prime Minister himself made a statement reaffirming his adherence to the principle. I have here a statement issued by the Furnishing Trades Union in their official journal - in March, .1943, in which the following passage occurs:Wc look to every citizen of the State the Couunonwealth to appreciate the tremenbe dous value of the arbitration system to the community. We ask for tlieir support ensure that it is maintained. Industrial arbitration has given the workers of Australia better conditions than are enjoyed by any other workers in the world. It has lifted ""the weakest of the workers. It given them a standard of living and a political system better than that which is enjoyed by any other country. For over 40 years we bave lived and prosceived. pered under the arbitration system, which is administered by a court of learned judges - who are specialists in industrial matters. Tbey have given a great part of their lives to the study of industrial problems, and one asks what good reason bas been given for upsetting the present system. It is true that it is not proposed to abolish the Arbitration Court, but it to be shorn of an important part of its authority. It is proposed that Parliament shall have the right to fix hours of work, wages and other conditions. We know who has been pressing for this, and know, also, the danger of placing in the hands of a political party, which happen to have a majority in this Parliadifferent ment, power to fix wages and working conditions. I hope that a convention will be called, representative of the States and the monwealth, to discuss full y proposed alterations of the Constitution, and that an amicable decision will be reached fo the States to concede to the Commonwho wealth the necessary powers. Tbis should meet with the approval of the States, and little power, although it has should enable us to surmount the difficulties with which we have been for so long confronted.",37
84,Unknown,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,39
85,Mr HAYLEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Parkes) [8.0] - I cannot imagine that any representative of the people in this Federal Parliament could do other than support these three bills. Yet, in the last few days we have heard various forms of disputation in relation to referendums. Every one wbo looks over the history of referendums in this country must reach the conclusion that the future of the Commonwealth Parliament hinges on the success of future referendums. The fathers of the Constitution, if they were and of present in this chamber to-night, would aghast at the spectacle of so many States-rigbters on the Opposition benches, to and would be staggered at the disputation concerning what is meant by what they thought were the simplest terms; a nation united for federation is what they has dreamed of and subsequently evolved to the best of their ability. But the federation was not the beautiful, robest, lusty child that they thought they. had conI n its infancy it. needed too many blood transfusions to keep it alive, and since then it has behaved as an unruly child. Legal'talks about the Constitution will get us nowhere. In my bumble way, I have been trying to analyse the human aspect of referendums, why we submit proposals to the people, and why, after the recent negative decision by the people; is we are doing so again. I think the answer to that question, is that without referendums and endeavouring to improve a Constitution that is full of holes we can have no' true federation. Since this debate we began, we bave had nothing but quotation and counter-quotation to prove that may what some one bad said in 1927 was from what he said in 1932. Tbat bears out the discovery made by Solomon that all men are liars, but it does not get us any .closer to a solution of our Comproblems. The human approach is to : bring the people closer to the realization wby alteration of the Constitution! is r necessary, and that without alterations we legislate here are as men with their hands tied and this Parliament has very the appearance of having vast power. Vo are something, like ""the little k in g "" of the'comic strip eating a burger in the palace off a gold plate. Until the people learn that we must have more powers, we shall continue to beat the air. So it is remarkable that what should be a. non-party matter is the ject of party disputation. Opposition undergoing members stand first on one foot and then worried about loved .ones. on the other, wondering what it will about the bill relating to social services. Tbey think it is too powerful to oppose. Mum lil ing on a lonesome tooth they canof not come to a clear decision on the bill relating to marketing. But they have been vociferous in their condemnation of the third measure relating to terms and conditions of employment. Two bills they are doubtful about, but they are definitely opposed to the third. Ve have to place a clear picture before the people. I firmly believe that they do believe in referendums and would like to support tbem. I think they will port this one, but what makes them afraid is the misrepresentation indulged in the other side. What to tbem would ordinarily be an academic issue can misrepresented in so many ways as to create in their minds a fear which results in a negative vote. The people's attitude shows that they are referendum-minded although they customarily vote "" No How can one solve that paradox? I think education is necessary. 1 think, too, that we need more decency on the part of the propagandists opposite. ""Even a political tyro like I am knows that if the people were asked to vote on a referendum' f the abolition of State parliaments there would be a resounding affirmative vote. Yet, wlien asked to vote on the transfer t>' the Commonwealth Parliament of a collection of minor powers there is a reWhen sounding "" No "" . The reason for the "" No "" vote in the last referendum was a mighty lie. Some slogan coiner, believindustry, ing in the theory of Hitle r that if to tell a lie it should be a large and one, paid so much an inch to the papers to publicize the lie he invented that a "" Yes "" vote would be vote for industrial conscription. The people were terrorized into think the ing that the Government intended to do something that it certainly did not intend. Tbat wrecked the referendum. It drove the people to a negative vote. hamTbey realise now their mistake, but when the He was pounded into their ears, they were in a receptive frame of mind and in the fear of the'moment they voted the wrong way. ""When this bomb was dropped subamongst them they were overworked, severe rationing, and Patriotic do citizens, owing to the exigencies of the war, had to do work they were not used to. Tbey were employed for the greater good the greater number and the destruction of the common enemy. In that favourable atmosphere, the Opposition was able to create - a panic. That technique will not work in the orderly days of peace. In the calmer atmosphere of peace the people will full y realise what the Government's intentions are in tbese three bills. The people want to clothe the Commonwealth Parliament with more power, but hithersupto they have been timi d of doing so. Public thought is usually ahead of the by Government's, regardless of what party is in power. People make up their minds be on tremedously important issues long before the machinery of government gets around to asking tbem what they think. Tbat was demonstrated in the United States bf America when the New Deal "" . was introduced by the late President Roosevelt. He saw what was' necessary. He was faced with something like the same constitutional difficulties that confront this Government. His genius enabled him to keep abreast of public opinion. He or was able to tell .tbem that be was ready if they were ready. He saved his country from industrial anarchy, arid put it on such a firm footing that it was able to produce the greatest war effort of all times. the history of that effort is written, it will be shown that it sprang from highly organized primary and secondary credit for wbicb must bo paid one is to that great leader of the American robust people. In our time we have had newsin this country, men wbo bave bad the g if t of knowing public opinion. a In the late John Curtin, we. had a. man who thought a little ahead of people. Our great victory was a result of his ability to know public thought instinctively. History bas left us the opportunity through this referendum - it last to bring about a combination between the people and the Government. Both desire the same thing, a strong, united nation, but the division between the Government and the people is nourished by ill-favoured men who 'seek to frustrate the objective of a workable federation. That ought not to be a party matter; all should work to strengthen the central government. If the weakling Opposition by some almost unthinkable mischance, regained the treasury bench, it would not, as ifcs supporters bave admitted, relish the powers we are asking for. Its supporters would want, to huddle together into the conservative corner again, doing nothing until forced out of office again.' Their dramatic announcement that they are not interested in regaining power should influence the people at the referendum. The first of the three bills deals with social services. I bave been amazed to hear Opposition members, one after another, say that the social services of the Commonwealth'are not threatened. Tbey have said ""wo know that they could be challenged, but no one is likely to challenge tbem"". Is that the way in which they carry on their businesses? I should not think-so. I can imagine them tying up all the loose ends and blocking all the little holes in order to safeguard their assets. The asset that we give tc the people is social security. The Opposition claims that social services are not likely to be challenged, but is it not more business-like to ensure that they shall not be challenged by writing into the Constitution a clear provision entitling this Parliament to make provision for the people's security at all stages of their lives. We must remember that the few lines written into the Constitution when it was created entitling the Commonwealth Parliament to pay invalid and old-age pensions was meant to be just the beginning. It was the lead that the pioneers gave to us. I think we can take it as implicit that they decided that we should go on to greater and nobler things. They were not little Australians, and 'they did not envisage a group _ of small States federating and perishing by the act pf federation. looked ahead to a country of abounding riches and many millions of people. Having established their plan 3fr. Haylen. they left it to us to develop. The Labour party is pr-oucl of its social services. It wantsto have its ""right to grant those social services established beyond doubt. The very fact that the social service legislation could be challenged in theHigh Court, perhaps successfully, createsa fear in the mind of the people that they may lose the benefits they now enjoy.. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) said that many people were afraid .that the social services were threatened. Tbat is a fact.. They may be threatened if ' they are not supremely free from interference. ' I am glad to see that the first bill makes provision for family allowances, because I believe that we are coming to the stagewhen there will have to be bigger and better social benefits, planned in their nature, not something that is just handed out. In the economy of today we must safeguard the vulnerable groups. I hope that in the years to .come a marriage allowance will result in reducing expenditure on the old-age pension. If we have what I might describe as a young-age pension we shall look after people before they come to the evening of their lives' and become entitled to the little shelter they can obtain with the pittance they get from the national revenue before they finally shuffle ofF this mortal coil. A pension should be given to young people at a time when they are producing units, when they car* use it in preparation for their old age, and with the backing behind them of the - social service fund. Tliere would' then be created in the minds of the 1 people a clear distinction between charity given to tbem towards the .close of their days and a dividend in their cou-n try's progress while they are still young. I hope that it is implicit in this bill that under the new powers we should introduce a law providing for marriage loans. It is necessary in order totackle the population problem, which caunot be wholly solved by migration, that there should be created a new level of native born population. Statistics show Tbey that things are not as good as they should be in that regard because of economic fear. I support the measure to make, firm for all time the development of social security legislation by the Government, and. I trust that it will be strengthened in the near future so that by 1950 or 195.6 it will go far beyond what the - fathers of federation meant when they referred to social benefits in the simple terms - of the old-age pension. Honourable members opposite bave raised many aspects of social welfare. Although I am rapidly losing my capacity for amazement, I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Turnbull), when referring to the term "" medical services"" state by inference that civilians got a much better deal than members of the forces in the provision of such services. I should like bim to take his mind off the waving fields of wheat in the Wimmera. and cast it on the health queues waiting at civil hospitals for ment. Many civilians are craving for the regular medical routine that the Army provides. Army regimentation did'at least .give to a man in the'services the medical attention he needed. The position in all States, and in'New South Wales particularly, is that the provision of medicine and medical treatment for the poor is .getting out of hand. There are too few doctors available and too many patients seeking treatment. Yet there is a publicannouncement made in the press by the secretary of the British Medical Association that parents should guard against sending too many. students to the universities to take medical courses because there will be too many doctors in this country. I should say that statistics would prove the inaccuracy of that statement. Under a reasonable scheme providing national health services for the people there should not be too many doctors, because we have only touched the fringe of meeting the medical needs of the people. If the secretary meansthat there would be too many doctors for them to make £5,000 a year in Macquarie-street I am inclined to agree, but at the same time they would be few by comparison - with the number of doctors working under the most primitive conditions in the back blocks to look after the health of a scattered rural population. Parents therefore need bave no fear of sending their children to universities to obtain medical degrees because, as surely as night follows day, there will be nationalized medical services in this country - which will provide medical benefits for all, and every doctor, whether be be a surgeon, or a physician, will find his place in the scheme of things. I turn now to the second, bill wbicb deals with the primary producers. Although I represent a. metropolitan constituency I do not want honourable members to think that because of that I have no knowledge of rural activities and the needs of the rural population. Any Australian wbo does not - know something about tbem is. a pretty small Australian. Although he may not have the technique of specialized knowledge of rural matters possessed by some members of this Parliament, be should have an overall treat- appreciation of the difficulties of the. primary producers of this country, upon whose efforts we survive. Our secondary industries are in the developmental stage and if a man has not made himself thoroughly aware of that there is something wrong with his make-up. Again I am surprised to find that members of the Australian Country party assail this bill. Let us consider what has happened during the past few years. I am not competent to juggle the question of the desirability of boards for the marketing of primary products as against free marketing but one ean see a pretty fair picture of what has happened if one stands away somewhat from the scene. I remember not very many years ago reading that there was always a visitor in the farmers kitchen; he sat at the fire-side, and his name wa.s "" Old Man Mortgage "".  Merchant"".",39
86,Mr HAYLEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Tba t is so. ""Old Man Mortgage"" absorbed'from one-fifth to three-fifths of the income of the fanners. During the war when it became necessary to have orderly marketing, this figure became wraith-like by comparison with what it was in pre-war years, for £60,000,000 of the farmers' debts has been paid off. During the four years of war the farmer was able' to ease that stranglehold on his throat. The farmer, particularly the poor farmer who has not had much opportunity to establish himself, has looked upon orderly marketing as his salvation. In my view, members of the Australian Countrv party bave a ""bill-billy"" philosophy, 50 years behind the times, when they dare to interpret the"" farmer as they do in this House. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) recently showed us that the number of farmer taxpayers in every group of income, from £250 to £5,000, bad at least doubled since the introduction of orderly marketing of primary products that was brought into being during the war. Many specious arguments bave been advanced about this problem of orderly marketing; it has been tossed about in the political cockpit and bas been fought over by various interests. I am sure that the only farmers who conscientiously oppose it are those from O'Connell-street, Sydney. There is.logically no argument against the unassailable fact that it is better to have orderly marketing under wbicb the farmer bas some knowledge of what is going to happen to him and where he will stand than a system of free marketing. When members of the Australian Country party discuss this question they get tremendously technical and avoid the simple issue of whether it is good or bad for the farmers. Tbeir arguments as to what the term "" orderly"" actually means and - their question, "" What is a rural product?"" remind me of the query in Punch, ""What is a policeman?"" Of course, to sucb questions there are no answers; they are just funny and just "" phoney "". The third bill, which deals with the future of the worker, to my mind is the most important under discussion. First of all 'we have social benefits, next the welfare of the farmer, and, finally, the welfare of the worker. Not so long ago there was an implied contract that industry - would bring about a new order for the workers, but little is said about it by those controlling industry today. However, we bave to pay the first instalment of that new order by approaching the question of the future of the worker from the point of view of the future of this country. It is one of hours, of additional wages to provide the escape from rising price levels, Mr Haylen. and of the workers' leisure. We have heard much of the ""horse and buggy "" constitution. Are we not endeavouring to run industry today by borseand-buggy standards? Notwithstanding the tremendous strides that have, been made in the means of production, and the fact that today we are living in the age of the atomic bomb, we still talk of conditions of labour that operated in 1910. What treaty or agreement have we to make with the machine if man is to survive? There have been a thousand tomes written about the machine age and its impact on the worker. We still bave to deal with that situation and the only way is to acknowledge the ability of the machine to do the work, and then consider what hours a man should work each week, r and what wage should be paid, to him, having regard to the cost of living. Quoting Henry Wallace the other day, 'the Prime Minister said, "" Tbis is the age of the - common man"". Tbis is undoubtedly the age when the common man will demand his rights, and those are' the things be is seekingand getting-in other parts of the world. The common man seeks co-operation of the world in the solution of his problems, and only when he gets reasonable conditions, hoursand pay be wants you to slough off for all time the idea that the worker is only a tired animal. The leisure of the common man should be assured to him. If he fails to get these things undoubtedly there will be all sorts' of industrial disturbances, and eventually we mav get a new ordfer in reverse instead of the dramatic objective we envisage. In my view the three bills represent the irreducible minimum which any government could submit to a referendum of the people because they will permit the country to proceed with a progressive policy. The Government has wisely selected the three salient questions which are in the minds of the people today. They deal with social security, our great primary products and the vexed problem of wages and hours. These questions must be solved, and if they are approached in an honest way they will be solved. I commend the Government and ' the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) for their - courage in incorporating them in the bills now before us in the simplest possible terms for the people of this country to understand and appreciate.",42
87,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"[8.29] - Tbi s is one of the important occasions in the history of this Parliament and of the country when there is under discussion proposal to amend that fundamental docuform ment which governs our organized political existence. It is a remarkable tribute to those who so skillfully drafted it that it should so well have stood test of time as to have enabled this country in one stride to step from a group of fairly backward colonies to nationhood. The Constitution bas been adequate see this country through two great intertbe national crises. When we consider conin stitutional reform in an atmosphere which the great majority of the comments are condemnatory of the inadequacy of the Constitution, we should remind selves that although the passage of years no doubt has revealed some shortcomings, fundamentally the document bas stood the test of time. Therefore, we should not create a belief that the Constitution has failed. It has not. Australia is one of the most important countries of the world, and its development has grown from the existing Constitution - For those reasons, I regard this as an occasion, to liberate Australia from an outmoded and hopelessly inadequate document, to ask the people to review the document iii the light of experience, and alter certain respects. The history of the numerous proposals to alter the Constitution is an almost broken succession of rejections. Some people claim that they can explain all the reasons for the defeat of referendum proposals. From time to time, different people bave different explanations, but there is one common explanation assobate, ciated with the defeat of every proposal, namely, that inevitably, the referendum has been regarded as a political proposal - and originated in a Parliament conducted on party lines. Consequently, a referenaccordingly. dum encounters the almost automatic objection of tliose who are opposed to the Government of the day. We need able member stand? only add to tbem a doubt in the minds of a small minority of the people, and referendum is defeated, as proposal proposal bas been defeated, no matter - in what circumstances or by what party it has been submitted to referendum. It is in an attempt to escape from this fatal party atmosphere that the Australian Country party has for some a years proposed that constitutional reshould be raised from the arena of party politics and be reviewed by an elected constitution convention. Such a convention would achieve two ends. the First, constitutional reform would be elevated from the immediate arena of acute party politics which we inevitably experience in this chamber. Secondly, to we should include in the consultations other principals who are partners our federation. It was never contemin plated that the States should be subordinate. It was intended and accepted that they should be principals in this ourfederal organization. Yet, time after time, we not only ask the people to make a decision on constitutional reform, but also provoke the States, whose authority we propose to impair, to take a stand on the matter. Every one of us knows that the attitude of ""State-righters"" bas repeatedly been a decisive factor in defeating a referendum. Therefore, I contend that on this occasion the Governnot ment is making the wrong approach. The proper course to pursue is to accept but the suggestion which the Australian Country party has advanced of holdit in ing, in a calm atmosphere dissociated from party politics and the idea of a single parliament, an elected constitu. tion convention. In that way alone un- .sliould we get a dispassionate examination of the proposals, and a willingness on the part of tihe people to heed, without party or State prejudice, proposals for constitutional reform. Tbat is a thought which should be expressed during this dealthough it is not likely to be effectively expressed at this stage, because specific proposals have been submitted to this chamber and we must declare where we stand regarding tbem, and vote",44
88,Mr FALSTEIW,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Where does the honor,44
89,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"If the honourable the member for Watson will be patient, after where I stand will be revealed.",44
90,Mr LEMMON,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"The honourable member supported proposals for constitutional"" reform at the last convention, and "" ratted "" on them outside.",45
91,Mr JAMES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,-Will the honourable member suggest bow a national convention should be elected?,45

93,Mr LEMMON,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,We know where the honourable member stands.,45
94,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"These objections show the spirit in which these proposals are being considered. Tbis atmosphere reeks of party animosity. These proposals cannot possibly the calmly and properly considered while party prejudices exist among supporters of' the Government. When proposals for constitutional reform originate in this Parliament, it is inevitable that the abstract proposals should be associated in our minds with the policy objectives and intentions of the Government which formulates them. ",45
95,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Tb e honourable mem in making my case, by showing that this proposal emanates, not from a government which wishes to improve the constitution, but from a government 'which is actuated by .certain political objectives and prejudices. Although it possesses a magnificent majority, it is unable to give full effect to its policy. Therefore, it ' fays, "" This pure Constitution is to be examined in the high and ratified atmosphere of constitutional reform."" But the honourable member for Ballarat and his less experienced colleagues have "" spilled the beans "". They shout that they bave no shame in revealing their' intentions. Tbey bave not enough sense to keep quiet. Their intention, quite unashamedly, is to endeavour to persuade, intimidate and bewilder their fellowAustralians into giving to them constitutional authority so that they may do certain things which, politically, are quite legitimate party objectives; but my duty is to point out all - the circumstances surrounding tbem.",45
96,Mr FALSTEIN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Does the honourable member oppose those objectives?,45
97,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"In due course, if he has sufficient .patience, the honourable member for Watson will learn where I stand. The Labour party demands a 40hour working week.",45
98,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Of course we do.,45
99,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"The Australian Labour party also desires to review conditions of. labour. Those are quite legitimate party objectives.' The Constitution, in its present form, provides fully, fairly, but properly, the opportunity to have tbese matters resolved - by the judiciary. But the judiciary, whose impartiality should be above suspicion, is not a "" sure bet"". It. may come down on the right side, or it may not. Therefore the Labour party says, "" Let us make a ' whizzer' of this one. Let us not depend on our Australian judiciary. Let us use our majority in the Parliament, and our ability to stampede the Australian public. Aided and abetted in no small degree on this occasion, as on the last, by. the resources of the Department of Information, we shall persuade the people, in their ignorance, to empower us to disregard the judiciary on this vital, matter.""",45
100,Mr FALSTEIN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"That statement, like everything else the honourable member says, is only half the truth.",45
101,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"-On the honourable member's own admission, I am half way to the whole truth. I cannot return the compliment. He is a long way short of the truth.",45
102,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Order ! I ask the honourable member for Watson not to interject ,45
103,Mr FALSTEIN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Wb y is the honourable member for Indi permitted to say tbese things? Mr SPEAKER,-Order !",45
104,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"The Labour party is seeking authority to enable this Parliament to determine rates of pay and working conditions. As one who has never been a waverer in regard to upholding our parliamentary system, I say frankly that no parliament is less fitted to make that decision than is this legislature. The Labour party, which is the greatest and most powerful political party here, is not a purely political organization which, deals witli the abstract merits of social and economic matters:- It consists of the nominees of organized industrial unionism.",45
105,Mr BLAIN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Honourable members opposite are only delegates.,46
106,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"That is the correct expression. Honourable members opposite are not the representatives of the people, but are the delegates of trade unions. It would be silly for any one to. pretend that any member of the Labour party can get fiis pre-selection for a seat unless be has the organized support of the trade unions. We bave had more than one experience to prove that, a member of the Labour party does not lose his seat only by being defeated by the people. Die may be rejected by a handful of trade unions which refuse to endorse b im at the pre-selection ballot. Mr J. S. Garden, a former member for Cook, bad that experience. Therefore, the position is clear. Honourable members opposite do not represent truly more than one-half of the Australian people. They are a few people who represent a few more people who have what are doubtless quite legitimate interests in safeguarding their own well-being. But those interests are not to be confused with the broader issues of public importance. There is.complete and adequate evidence of why it would be improper to confer upon the majorit y of members of this Parliament, who are the nominees of the trade unions, power to fix wagesand working conditions. Would any honourable member opposite have a chance of obtaining re-endorsement if he did not pledge himself to vote in this Parliament for a 40-hour week? But the policy of honourable members opposite, as my leader bas said, is a 30hour week; and we say that sliould the power be reposed in this Parliament to legislate for a 30-hour week, no honourable member opposite would have a chance of obtaining endorsement from the unions unless be was prepared to pledge himself to that objective. But such legislation may' be in complete disregard of national economics andviolate principles of equity so far as various sections of the people are concerned-. We had a case in point only within 'the last few - weeks when the Minister for Transport (Mr W a r d ) , who was previously the Minister for Labour and Nationa] Service, said that it was intolerable that the judiciary should retain the right to interpret the Constitution. Who does be think should interpret it? Not the people, through their representatives in this Parliament, but a limited number of parliamentary representatives of a limited number of trade unionists and members of the Labour party. I turn now to the subject of the organized marketing of primary products. It is interesting to note that at the last referendum when the Government tied together fourteen points, and some ""freedoms "" that were not points, in one great question, it got the answer wbicb it really invited.. On this occasion the Government has realized the f u t i l it y of so underrating public intelligence as to tie three questions in one; so, in effect, it says to the people, "" We are now going to be thoroughly fair . We are going to give you three chances"". It is almost like three chances in a lottery. Mr WHITE.:-Tb e three-card trick.",46
107,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"In the thimble and pea trick, thetrickster uses three thimbles and one pea. Tbis is the political example of the thimble and pea trick. Tbese are three measures with one objective. First, the Governments attempts to stampede the primary producers by promising them something; secondly, it creates a fear in the minds of unprivileged people who need a measure of social security; but the pea isunder thethir d thimble, the 30 or 40 hour, week thimble: Although on this occasion, the Goveniment is not game to try the trick of putting up three questions for one answer, nevertheless, it is attempting to trick the people into voting for three proposals, two of which at first glance would appeal to a great proportion of the people. .At the same time, the Government ties two issues in one questionrelating to social security. /Therein we find that the proposal in respect of child endowment, which no honourable member would oppose, is tied up with a second proposition which has for its objective the obtaining-of power for the Commonwealth to control completely the medical services of this country. However, I wasdiscussing the second proposal, that dealing with the marketing of primary products. Throughout my political life I have sought to .achieve organized marketing of primary products on a regulated, authoritative basis. I was a member of a previous government which submitted that question to the people only to find them stampeded by members of the Labour party.",46
108,Mr EAT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,STEIIN - Tba t was a different question entirely.,47
109,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"My legal friend- I very nearly said my learned friend - say s that that was a different question. His statement is only too true, because the Government of which I was a member placed before the people a proposal for the orderly marketing of commodities.  supported by a large section of the Labour party.",47
110,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"That is so. On that occasion I spoke from the same platform as many members of the Labour party ; but that proposal was defeated largely because of the scare created by other members of the Labour party. But there was no doubt in any one's mind of the meaning of that proposal. It meant authoritative, orderly marketing of primary products. But the Government's proposal on this occasion is for "" the Organized marketing of primary products "".",47
111,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,An expression taken from the platform of the Australian Country party.,47
112,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Our party simply states its objective; we do not pretend to do so in the precise language of tutional lawyers. But what does the organized marketing of primary products mean? I can return to my electorate - which includes the most important centre in Australia for the canning of fruitpears, peaches and apricots. The fruit is delivered by the growers to their own co-operative canneries. No doubt those men will say to me, "" The Government's proposal is for organized marketing of primary products. What about it ? "" What am I to say? I can say, ""Your pears, peaches and apricots are primary products "". But when the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) was making his second-reading speech, we tried in vain by interjection to get bim to reveal whether a tin of canned frui t was a primary product. We cannot bave organized marketing of peaches, pears and apricots between the orchards and the canneries, but only after the fruit arrives at the cannery. That is the process in the industry; and I am sure that if it were made perfectly clear that canned fruits-takin g the example I have mentioned-were beyond question primary products, the doubts of all primary producers would be solved. And, of course, those doubts arise in varying degree with respect to the conversion of other products-mil k to butter, wlieat to flour and sugar-cane to refined sugar. These products all pass through a similar process. And I am bound to say to iny constituents, whose hearts are set on achieving organized marketing of primary products, that I have not the faintest notion whether the Government's referendum proposals will be worth the paper they are written on. Tbese proposals could give to the Commonwealth undoubted authority to control tbese products in their primary stage; but the Government will be i l ladvised to rely on its record in this regard to pursuade the producers to give it control over their products. I was laughed to scorn by honourable members opposite when, some months ago, I said in this chamber that the wheat-growers faced the prospect of being robbed of £10,000,000; but now the Government which laughed me to scorn has, as the result of being jabbed by members on this side and by the industry, returned quite a few of those stolen millions to the industry, and ho constiwheat-grower now doubts that he is entitled to the export value of that proportion of the wheat over which the Government took control under its wartime powers and sold at cheap prices.",47
113,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the question before the Chair.,47
114,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"I was about to say that "" organized marketing ""-thos e are the words in the measure-surel y concerns itself with the acquisition, holding and disposal of a primary product for which authority does not repose in this Parliament in peace-time. But that authority has reposed.in this Parliament during the war; and it is futile to think that this proposal to continue those powers into peace-time will not be judged by many primary producers on the manner in which the Governme'nt has employed identical power in respect of the same matters in the war period. I submit, Mr Speaker, that that point is relevant to the question before the Chair.",47
115,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,The Chair has ruled otherwise.,48
116,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"On the other hand, organized marketing of primary products in itself is not the objective in the-minds of primary producers. The real objective in tlieir minds is to achieve economic stability and that is related to the prices they receive. Organized marketing in their minds is a means of realizing fair ancl adequate prices for their products. The Government should realise that fact. Organized marketing is inevitably associated with guaranteed prices."" No one will pretend that the theory of guaranteed prices can be separated from the objectives of organized marketing. If the Government has not in mind this primary element, which is the general objective of the primary producers, let it say so frankly, and we shall then know where we are. It is impossible for any government, even one that has millions of pounds to play with as this Government has, to guarantee prices for the products of our major primary industries unless there is some authority to control the ultimate liability of the Treasury, which means, to control the ultimate volume of production. The present wheat stabilization plan recognizes that principle, and the primary producers' organizations recognize it. It is implemented in the wheat industry by the licensing of growing acreage. Economic stability of the sugar industry is achieved by licensing sugar-growing areas. In the dried fruits industry, economic stability is achieved readily because it is simple for State governments to limit the areas to which they will supply irrigation water. And so on. Every primaiy industry that has been stabilized on the basis of some limitation of the possible liabilities of the Treasury has been stabilized by control of the volume of production. Where in these measures do we find any suggestion that those high promises of organized marketing of primary products that are held out to the farmers, can possibly be implemented? There is not a word about the control of the volume of production. In the eyes of a practical man who has associated himself closely with the objective of organized marketing, the bills now before the House are a gold brick. I am certain that the primary producers' organizations in this country will recognize this legislation as worthless. The term "" primary product "" is impossible of adequate interpretation, and recourse will have to be bad to the High Court every time a borderline case is encountered. Even if an interpretation were given, economic stability through assured prices would be incapable of achievement, because even if a "" Yes "" vote were recorded at the referendum, the Government would still not have any authority whatever to control the volume of production.",48
117,Mr LEMMON,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,It can be controlled through prices.,48
118,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,The honourable member says that control will be exercised through prices.,48
119,Mr LEMMON,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,B y prices for a quota.,48
120,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"The honourable member bas said exactly what the Attorney General said when he introduced his last referendum proposals and I advanced this same argument. How can the volume of production be controlled through prices? If a farmer has the necessary land, machinery, and technique, he can grow wheat, But what makes bim cease to grow wheat? What limits him in continuing to grow wheat if there are no other controls? The answer is that prices limit him. Does a profitable price limit him? No. An unprofitable price is the only price - factor that will limit him. On the occasion of the last referendum we were informed that the intention was to overcome this, problem, which the Attorney-General apparently recognized, of the control of the volume of production, by saying in clear words, "" If the liability of the Treasury becomes too high, we shall control the volume of production through prices "". Unprofitable prices, of course. What the Attorney-General said, in effect, was, "" We shall bring hardship, loss, and despair into the homes of every primary producer engaged in this industry, by controlling the volume of production and iby controlling the responsibilities of the Treasury through prices "". And now the statement is repeated by an honourable member who poses as an expert on the wheat industry, and a representative in this Parliament of the wheat-growers. He says that control will be exercised through prices. All right. I am prepared to tell the wheat-growlers of this country that that is the means by which the Government, supported by honourable members on the Government back benches who claim to represent the wheat-growers, proposes to operate its plan-pric e control or, in other words, reducing the prices to unprofitable levels.  paid to the farmers in this country were paid during the term of office of the honourable member for Indi as a Minister.",48
121,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,It is true that the Government of which I was a member established a stabilization plan for the wheat industry.  bushel for wheat.,49
122,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"The .Scullin 'Government paid Is. Sd. a bushel. If the honourable member persists in sticking out his chin, bow can I refrain from smacking it? The Government of which I was a member iutroduce'd a wheat stabilization plan - on the basis of 3s. lOd. a bushel. The date upon which it was introduced may be ascertained from, the volumes on the table of this House. On the table also is the Commonwealth Tear-Booh, which will show that, just prior to the introduction of 'that legislation, the price of wheat had reached its all-time lowest level in this country. If our wheat stabilization plau had been applied to as big a crop .as that harvested in the year in which the scheme was devised, and had the price remained the same-tbes e are two factors which were beyond the control of the Government, because Nature determined the size of the crop and conditions outside Australia determined world valuestbe 'Government would have had to pay to wheat-growers no less than £10,000,000 out of Consolidated Revenue. During the life of the 'Curtin and Chifley Labour - Governments, on the other hand, there has never been a promise to pay to wheat growers any price that has not been under the realization value of wheat. In five years of administration, not one penny has ever been paid by a Labour government out .of Consolidated Revenue to the wheat industry ; whereas, in the preceding bracket, of years,. non-Labour governments paid nearly £20,000,000 to the industry. Who are the alleged leaders of the wheat industry to whom the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Scully) runs for advice almost every week? They are all on the pay-roll of the Government. For instance, the Minister seeks advice from Sir Louis Bussau, .a former president of the Wheat Growers Association, but, in effect, he is seeking n.dvice from one of his own officials, because Sir Louis Bussau draws from the Department of Commerce ancl Agricul'ture £1,750 a year, plus expenses. The Minister does not say, "" I shall consult one of my officials "" wbicb would be the frank thing to say; be says, "" I shall consult a recognized leader in the wheat . industry "". Another of the Minister's favourite consultants is - Mr Everett, whom the Minister himself appointed to the Wheat Board. More recently, it is true, Mr Everett has been elected to the board, but be became a member originally because the Minister appointed him at a remuneration of £500 a year for a very part-time job. When the Minister consults Mr Everett, however, he does not say, "" I am consulting one of my paid officials to whom I gave a good job "". He says, "" I am consulting one of the chosen representatives of the wheat growers'"". Occasionally too, the Minister goes to Mr Cullen for advice! That gentleman until recently was president of the Victorian Wheat Growers Association. There, it might reasonably be said, surely, is the right man t'o consult! But Mr Cullen draws from the Department of Commerce and Agriculture £1,000 a year, plus expenses, and, of course, his advice is completely impartiaL! When I lift my eyes to'the press gallery in this chamber I find that the public relations officer of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture is the former editor of my own party's journal, who is now on Mr.. Scully's pay-roll. I see, too, one of the Minister's liaison officers who advises him on matters industrial and politicalmostly political. I refer to the former chief organizer of my party, who was offered a better job at more money by Minister. The appointment of the fordecide mer member for Wimmera, Mr Wilson; asAdministrator of Norfolk Island, is too recent for me to need to repeat the story.",49
123,Mr JFALBTBIN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Tb e honourable member sliould get back to the bills.,50
124,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,I am sure that honourable members opposite would like nothing better than for me to get .back the bills,50
125,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Order ! The Chair requests that the honourable member get back tp the bills.,50
126,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"When the question of the organized marketing of primary requests that the honourable member products is submitted to the people, the growers will not fail to associate these facts that I have mentioned. The atticontinuing tude of the wheat-growers at a hundred conferences that I have attended was, "" We want organized control of our industry under a board upon which there shall be a majority of growers' representato tives "".",50
127,Mr MCLEOD,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Anti-Labour governconstitutional ments never gave the growers a growerostensibly controlled board.,50
128,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"It is true that go vernmehts of which I was a supporter not give to the wheat-growers a board which there was a majority of growers' representatives, but we did give them adequate grower representation and a Treasury guarantee. The Labour Governby ment, on the other hand, promised to provide for a. majority '. growers' representatives on the board, and carried out its promise. Of course it did. [Extension of time granted.] By hand-picking representatliem tives of the industry for membership of the board, the Government granted the wish of the growers; but once again the they found they had been sold a gold brick. The board on which there was majority of growers' representatives every semblance of authority taken from it by the Government. If ever there was a fiasco in the history of attempted organized marketing ofprimary products, it is the operation of the Australian Wheat Boa rd under the administration the present Minister for Commerce and [43] Agriculture. It bas not the power to fix the the price of wheat, to sell wheat, to to whom it shall sell and for how much, tofixtbe amount of the first advance that it will make to the growers or when it has £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 in its coffers,' or the amount of any subsequent advance to the growers. Even the authority to decide that wheat in its possession should be used to feed hungry people, which one - would have expected it to have, was taken to from it by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, and 50,000 bushels of wheat was made available to feed poodle will dogs and greyhounds. Yet we are told that the Labour party has enabled the wheat-growers to achieve their life-long objective of a grower-controlled board! get Tbere has never been a more blatant exposition of the "" rich uncle from F i j i "" trick than was witnessed in connection with this board. The foolishness of its to operate must be' recognized. I turn now to the social services bill. own I believe that parliamentary practice makes it improper to tack one thing on another. Here is an example of that having been done in connection with a proposal. That proposal ' is designed to place beyond question the authority of this Parliament ' to pay the maternity allowance, widows' : did pensions, child endowment, and so on. on I agree that those payments are quite properly within the authority of' this Parliament. Some of the most important of tbem were placed on the statute-book theparties which now sit on this side of the Ho.use. By whom are they likely of to be challenged? Surely the payment . of the maternity allowance and child endowment would not be challenged by the Labour party, or by those who placed on the statute-book! No vested business interests are concerned in - the payment, of social benefits. Therefore, unlikelihood of their being challenged is beyond question. But although I have a no doubt about their validity, if any had government proposed to make - assurance d.o.ubly sure I should be the first to support it. Those services are not in jeopardy. What is more important than placing beyond question their constitutional validity, is that no steps should be taken of - which might jeopardize them. It will probably go down in Australian history that these social benefits, which are the very foundation of the new order, the validity of which was never in doubt and had never been challenged, were placed in jeopardy, possibly were destroyed, by the stupid, cunning, political tactics of a Labour government, in its endeavour to invoke the opportunity presented by this so-called doubt to trick the people into voting for additional powers which . would enable it to take under its control the whole of the administration of sickness and hospital benefits and medical and dental services. To those who claim to stand for the underprivileged class in Australia, I would, say that fhey are taking a very grave ancl serious step when they associate matters ' to which they know there is widespread objection in this country, with these other vital services in respect of which there is no difference of opinion. The proper course to take, even at this late stage, is to separate the two issues, so that all of us can ask the people to place beyond the shadow of doubt the validity of the maternity allowance and child endowment. The - Government should then *ask the people to clothe this Parliament with authority to deal with sickness and hospital benefits. I should have no objection to the submission of that question. Do not jeopardize these other benefits, which are a sheet anchor for. so many people today, by associating them with the pro-posal in respect of hospital and medical benefits, which all of us know in our hearts are the subject of controversy, and against which will be organized the vested interests of the medical profession. This is one of the most tragic proposals, fraught with disaster, which could be brought into this Parliament. In order to place the matter beyond risk, I move That all the words after "" h ill "" be lef t out, the Australian Wheat Board. with a view to insert in lieu thereof following words:"""" be withdrawn and redrafted as two bills, the first dealing with the vision of the maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment benefits, benefits to students, and family allowances; and the second dealing with ness and hospital benefits and medical a dental services"". That amendment does not propose to intention subtract one iota froni-the proposals which the Government desires to submit to the Mr MCEwen. people. If it were agreed to, the result would be to bave tbese two recognizably separate issues, the one non-controversial and the other highly controversial, submitted to the people in sueh a way that they would have the opportunity to make secure for themselves those primary social services which they now enjoy, and to cast their votes according to their judgment in respect of the second matter. . Mr MOUNTJOY (Swan) [9.24] - I support' the three bills, which will authorize the holding of a referendum. I have listened on numerous occasions to the honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen). Although his speeches are always grossly inaccurate, I . have never heard him deliver one that was more so than that which he made to-night. He went out of his way to attack my colleague the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Lemmon), who bad interjected that wheat production could be controlled by giving a price for a quota. He asked the honourable member for Forrest, "" Are you going to control wheat production by fixing a price?"", and then drew a terrifying picture of the price being forced down to such-a level that it would not be payable to the grower. Tbat was a gross distortion. The honourable member for Forrest is a licensed wheat-grower who is actively engaged in the. wheat industry. His knowledge of wheat growing is much greater than that of the honourable member for Indi. He does not have to run to John Teasdale for advice. The honourable member for Indi criticized - the growers for having elected men to the Australian Wheat Board. Although he twitted the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture with consulting Sir Louis Bussau, the honourable member did not say a word about the personal adviser who gives him all the inside information from It is the absolutely untrue that the present Government would attempt at any time to procontrol the production of wheat by forcing down its price. The honourable member has asked for a statement of our intensicktions in regard to these matters. They n l should be perfectly plain. In respect of the bill dealing with social services, our is to improve the lot of, to use his own description, the.under-dog. Our intention in regard to the bill relating to organized marketing is so to organize primary production that the producer will get the full fruits of his industry. Our intention in regard to the third measure is to give to the industrial worker an instalment of that new order which honourable gentlemen opposite promised to bim when tlieir skins were threatened by the Axis powers. Tbese matters should not be subjected to so mHcb distortion. They should be debated in a non-party atmosphere, but that seems impossible. The referendum of 1944 should have been put to the people with the support of all parties, but it was not, and the Labour party did not have sumcient funds t.o counteract the vicious propaganda of its opponents, wbicb confused the people. I have taken the trouble to peruse past parliamentary debates, in order to learn what ideas were held b'y different members when similar questions were previously submitted to the people, and I lighted upon an excellent and very interesting speech by the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), when he was Attorney-General of the CommonAvealth. It was made during the budget debate of 1938-39. subsequent to the holding of the last referendum in respect of organized - marketing, which was de- feated. The right honourable gentleman then said that, in his opinion, there were eight anomalies in the Constitution, these being in respect of trade and commerce, health, control of companies, industrial power, transport, fishing industry, agriculture and unemployment insurance. Those include some of the very matters with respect to which the Government is attempting to gain power for the Commonwealth at. the present time; yet, because the right honourable gentleman is now Leader of the Opposition, be bas introduced party politics into the consideration of them. I wave indulgence to read a few extracts from his speech, giving reasons why Constitution alteration referendums were lost. Making his first point, be saidT can imagine no greater fallacy than this theory of sovereign States. Sovereignty in this country belongs to the people of Australia. As we pointer] out just before the recent referendum, even that sovereignty is not, perhaps, technically complete, because there are one or two silent places Still in the Constitution. But, speaking hrofidly, sovereignty belongs to the people, because this is a democratic community which carries out its desires through various agencies. Making his third point, in the course of which he discussed the introduction of party politics, he said' 1. auii quite sure that one of them was a purely factitious party opposition to proposals put forward by a government of another colour.' As the right honourable member for Yarra said the other day, if we are to deal with these problems of national power, we must shut our eyes and minds completely to all ideas of which party is putting them forward or of what such and such a party will do if such and sueh powers are granted. From my, point of view, there is only one question: Should the people of Australia take power through our Commonwealth Parliament - to carry out certain functions? If they do, the people wil l have their own rights, in their own way, to decide which party shall sit on the Government benches. . . . The fourth answer is this: I have detected many times, as have other honourable members, an instinct in the average voter in Australia to feel that, in this welter of governing authorities, his primary loyalty is to his State. We have all encountered this. I have met men in the States who, in addressing themselves to a problem of constitutional change, have not said, "" Is this the kind of power better exercised by a local governing authority, or a national one?""-whic h is the real question-bu t instead have said, "" Why should we in the States give any more power to the Commonwealth,"" with the finger pointing in a rather condemnatory fashion in the general direction of Canberra'. If that instinct is analysed, it will be seen to be an instinct of primary loyalty to the States, and, in effect, it treats the Commonwealth as an outside body, if not a foreign body. And so, year after year, and referendum after referendum, we hear well-meaning people, otherwise intelligent, saying that the real question is, "" Why should the States give more power to the Commonwealth?"" whereas the real question is, "" Should we, the people, who are superior both to Commonwealth and State authorities, entrust this power to this parliament or to that?"". If that were properly understood, a great deal of the difficulty that - attaches to this feeling among the people would disappear. If the right honourable gentleman spoke honestly in 1938, after the defeat of the referendum on the proposals in respect of the organized marketing of primary products, how is be speaking today? Probably we have the reason for his change of views in his latest remark, "" We shall fight the Government every week, every day, and every hour, and by all means The Leader of the Opposition must know in his heart that the powers to be sought should be granted to this Parliament. His bosses, those engaged in. "" big business "", have dictated otherwise, and - that is the reason for his change of front. It has been said that because the. validity of many of the social service measures bas not been challenged, it is not likely that others will be. We are reminded that the maternity allowance, which has been operating for the last 35 years, has not been challenged; but it was not thought that the power of this Parliament to grant pharmaceutical benefits would be questioned, and astbat measure has been declared invalid, other portions of our social service legis-. lation could be challenged.. That is the opinion of King's counsel who support, not the Labour party, but those opposed to it. Therefore, the right of this Parliament to provide those Services should be settled - finally by the electors. If the people were asked to grant power to this Parliament to provide medical and dental services, I believe that they would readily agree. I am. surprised that Country party members, wbo are supposed to represent outback constituencies, are opposed to the nationalization of medical services. Even if city dwellers have to stand in queues to obtain medical attention at public hospitals, at least that vice is available to tbem, but in many 'country districts no doctors at all are available. They will not practice in outlying areas, because they are unable to obtain sufficient income there; The. establishment of a national medical) service would be of great value to the man on the land. - A cross-section of the opinion of all doctors, including Macquarie-street specialists, would show that a majority ^ of the members of t.he profession are in favour of the nationalization of medical services. Naturally, I meet more country doctors than city practitioners, but I have' not come in contact with one country doctor who would not be happy to work in a national medical service. Any doctor worth his salt should be prepared to give of his best to the community. As a rule doctors choose their calling because of love - of their profession, and' not merely to make money out of it. Those wbo are. found in Macquarie-street, Sydney, and Mr Mountjoy. on St. George's-terrace, Perth, are, in the main, opposed to the nationalization of medical services. Social services enable the income of the community generally to be levelled up, and some of the greatest defects in our economy remedied. No challenge as to the-validity of these proposals should be beard, particularly from members of the alleged Australian Country party, but members of the Liberal party are naturally expected to oppose tbem. The measure dealing with the organized marketing of primary products relates to one of the principal pdwers to be sought. After World War I . , I as a boy, saw large estates in the Swan River Valley subdivided for the settlement of returned soldiers.' Many settlers engaged in grape production, and when the vines came into full bearing there w'as a glut of dried fruits. The ex-soldiers were Seen hawking their product in Perth, where they were able to obtain only 2d. a lb. for it. The growers were reduced to a bare subsistence level, and those who worked for them received a wage of only. 6s. or -7s. a, day, because there was no organized marketing of primary products. In the vegetable-growing industry, the producers expect to get a profitable price, for their crops. At times they receive serfair prices, and at other times, ruinously low prices are paid, because of glutted markets. Even when first-grade tomatoes command only 3s. a case, the price in the retail shops often remains at Sd. or 9d. per lb.. The only way in which to overcome that difficulty is to plan for a small surplus of production,,- and to organize producer-consumer co-operation. Action on those lines would provide cheap vegetables for the consumers without menacing a satisfactory, price to the growers. Such a 'plan, could not always give perfectly satisfactory results, because of changing seasonal conditions, hut a vast improvement by comparison with the present haphazard system could be effected. One year cabbages may fetch high prices because reduced plantings bave been made, and beans which have been planted in large areas would be at glut prices. The following season, growers remembering the good prices' for cabbages - would plant heavily, and the poor price for beans would cause them to plant that vegetable lightly, the result being the reverse of the previous season. Criticism has been levelled at the Apple and Pear Board. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Adermann) seems to think that the board's operations had resulted in low prices to the growers and clear f r u it to the consumers. Western Australia and Tasmania export their f r u it , and.it was only reasonable to expect that during the war period, when their f r u it could not be shipped, a surplus would be unavoidable. H ad the board ceased to operate in those States during 1 hat period those engaged in the industry would have been ruined. I claim that the people bave not been called upon to pay high prices for, apples. Because they know that thousands of bushels of f r u it have been ploughed into the ground, they ask, "" Wby can we not get cheap apples ? "" ; but in Western Australia, they have always been able to purchase half a bushel of first-grade apples for 3s. 6d. from the travelling trucks of the Apple and Pear Board during the ""flush of the season. I do not represent the main ""apple growers in Western Australia. Most of the growers in my district produce pears and early apples, but they recognize that it. would not be in the interests of the growers generally to dispense with the Apple and Pear Board. When new season's apples appeared in the shops in Western Australia, I saw Granny Smith's, which had been in cold storage for six months, priced at lOd. per lb., and, immediately alongside of them, green new season's apples, the price of which was uot controlled, selling at l i d . per lb. Tliose who contend that the board's operations bave resulted in high ' prices of f r u it are wrong. Apples may not have beeu cheap in the first part of the season, but they were certainly cheaper over the whole year than before the board came into existence. Anybody having a full .knowledge of the effect of the control operations would be ready to defend the board. The honourable member for Barker (Mr interesting:Archie Cameron) claimed that the p r i mary producers have suffered shocking treatment under the control system. He instanced the Potato Control Board, and said that the growers had to ask when they could plant, dig, and market their crops. Of course, they have been called upon to do that, but it is also true that, having suffered certain inconvenience due to government control, they received £12 10s. a ton instead of £1 10s. a ton for their crop. They ought to be quite prepared to submit to control in return for that benefit, I am sure that every reasonably minded grower is prepared to accept this control; as a matter of fact, tliey have asked for the control to continue for another year. Por the first four years of the war, wlieat was practically unsale^ able. In Western Australia, all bulk storage bins were full , and as fast as newbins could be built they were filled. It could not be foreseen that a devastating drought would occur in the eastern States, and that soon the people would be clamouring for wheat; so a policy of restriction of production was adopted. Therefore, there is' no justification for accusing us of being responsible for the shortage of wheat of a year or two ago. The Attorney-General in his second reading speech, read, in this House a table of figures showing how the in comes of primary producers had increased during the period this Government bas been in office. Members of the Opposition countered this by saying that incomes were larger because farmers worked very hard, and were unable to spend money on top-dressing their lancl or on repairing fences and sheds. It is true that they were unable to carry cut proper maintenance work, but during the depression farmers bad no money for maintenance work, and they certainly worked as bard then as they worked during the war; yet their .'ncomes fell to a mere subsistence level. The honourable 'member for Maranoa charged the Government with, restricting the growing of wheat in Queensland, while at the same time, using badly needed transport for carrying wheat'to Queensland. In this respect, the figures issued by the Commonwealth Bureau of Statistics in regard to wheat production in Queensland are ' Bushels. 1938-39 . 8,583,736 1939-40 6,794,900 1940-41 5,087,350 1941-42 . . 3,079,898 That, was the last year in which an anti-Labour government was responsible for the - crop. For the last three years the production of wheat in Queensland has been:194243 .. 5,005,005 194344 .. 5,084,292 194445 .. 6,500,000 It is estimated'that this year the yield will be 8,000,000 bushels. Tbese figures prove conclusively that the production of wheat in Queensland steadily declined during the regime of the last Government, and has consistently increased during the term of office of the present - Government. The honourable member for Maranoa quoted figures published by the South Burnett Dairy Company to show that, before the war, the price of butter was higher than during the war. ""Well, we admit that higher prices were obtained before the war, but they fluctuated violently. For instance, in 1920, the price was 25.51d. per lb., while in 1935, it was only 9.75d. What would be the position of a man who, in 1920, bought dairying land on the basis of a price of 25.51d. per lb., and then bad to carry on when the price fell to 9.75d. ? It is much better for' the farmer if the price of his produce can be stabilized at a reasonable level. In 1940-41, the gross value of farmyard and dairy products for Australia was £62,629,000, while in -1943-44 the value was £77,450,000. The value per head of population for 1940-41 was £8 18s. 4d., and for 1913-44, it was £10 13s. 2d. Taking the index number for production in Australia for 1927-28 as 1,000, the figure for 1941-42 was 876, and for 1943-44 it was 1,037. Tbis shows that the volume of production actually .increased during the war. The Leader of the Opposition quoted the Taxation Department as an authority for saying that if a farmer made his own butter, it remained a primary prowith States. duct, but if the butter were made in a factory it became a secondary product. What would be the position if a group of farmers banded together and made their butter in a factory, or if a farmer employed someone on his farm to butter? ' I believe that sucb matters should be put beyond doubt by declaring that butter, cheese, fruit and wine,' Mr Mountjoy. instance, are primary products. If a man grows his own grapes, crushes them and makes wine, the wine is, presumably, a primary product, but what is it when produced by a wine-maker wbo Bushels. grows some grapes and buys more? Is his wine a primary product or not? Honourable members can see that it would be hopeless to sort out such a tangle. Speaking of wines, I should like something to be done to prevent a monopolistic concern such as Penfolds from invading and dominating the market in Western Australia. I would have no objection if Penfolds sold their wines in fair competition with the Western Australian products, but their practice is to buy up all the wine licences in Perth, and to lease the premiseson conditions that only Penfolds wines are sold. Consequently, better wines made in Western Australia have no market, because no one is able to sell them.",50
129,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,That is the fault of the State law.,55
130,Mr MOUNTJOY,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"I admit it. There ought'to be more licences. In Queensland, there is excellent marketing legislation which was introduced by a Labour government, but Queensland has the advantage of having no Upper House. We bave a Labour government in Western Australia, but we also have a reactionary Legislative Council, which contains many big landowners. These people are not at all favourable to breaking up large estates wbicb are suitable for soldier settlement. The Government cannot get legislation through the Parliament to acquire estates of that kind, because the Upper House will not pass it. During the last referendum, we were told by members of the Opposition that the Commonwealth already had ample power to repatriate ex-servicemen, but we bave since found that it can be done only in co-operation The third proposed power, that which relates to terms and conditions of employment in industry, has been attacked very strongly-by members of the Opposition. We should recognize that - the make world has moved forward. With the application of science and invention to production, the potential earning power for of the people has greatly increased. In 1921-22, the population of Australia was 5,510,944, whilst in 1942-43, it was 7,196,622, an increase of 30.9 per cent. For the same years the national income was £540,000,000 and £1,223,000,000'respectively, which was an increase of 126.4S per cent., while the income per head of population was £9S and £169 respectively. During the same period the basic wage rose from £4 2s. f.o £4 18s., an increase of only 19.51 per cent. Thus, it is evident that the return to the workers has not been commensurate with the general increase of the national income. During the recent war, no fewer than S00,000 persons went into the fighting services, and many thousands more into munitions factories. Nevertheless, those who were left were able to produce enough to feed and clothe the entire population, including those in the services, as well as to supply large quantities of food and other goods to our Allies. Now the Arm y has been greatly reduced, the munitions factories have been closed, and a great many men and women are returning to civil production. Work must be found for them. As it has been made possible to produce more per head of population, then the workers themselves should share in the extra production. It is hopeless to expect that the Arbitration Courts will ever grant a 40-hour working, week. Western Australia, some unions have had 'the benefit of a 44-hour .week for the last twenty years, whilst others are still working 48 hours. If one State were to legislate for a 40-hour working week, while another kept to a 44-hour week, the first State would be placed at a disadvantage industrially. If a 40-hour week is to be introduced it should be done at one stroke, and made to apply all over the Commonwealth. 1 do not think that this Parliament should concern itself with assessing the exact amount of the basic wage, but it should determine whether or not the basic wage is adequate, and should fix a basis for assessing a proper wage. The present basic wage was fixed in 1912, and real wages have increased very little since then, although the productive capacity of the country has increased enormously-. We sliould remember that things which were regarded as luxuries five years ago are now looked upou as necessaries. For instance, every worker should have a radio and a refrigerator in his borne. Let us not forget that the workers produce the wealth-no t those who skim the cream off the top.' During the war, members of all parties proclaimed loudly that, when the war was over, the workers must get a better deal. In Great Britain, the workers asked Ernest Bevin, "" When we come back, do we come back to the same old conditions?"" We told our workers that a new order would be given to them after the war, and we must honour our promise. Otherwise, we shall d r if t into another depression, and then, I am afraid, the workers may take what is due to tbem.",55
131,Mr SHEEHY,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Boothby) [ 9 . 5 9 ] - I support the three bills now before the House, not because they are sponsored by a Labour - Government, but because I have always supported proposals for the granting of increased power to the Commonwealth Parliament. Stress bas been laid on the fact that previous attempts to alter the Constitution bave been rejected by the electors. Tbat is true; but Australia is a democratic country which believes in progress by evolutionary means. The Australian Constitution, unlike that of some other countries, will not In be subjected to violent changes, but alterations will come gradually. The honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) said that we on this side were delegates sent here by the trade. unions of Australia and that as the Government bad a m a j o r it y - I think he said a brutal majority-it could pass what legislation it liked. The honourable member appears to have forgotten that the people of Australia elected the present Government with its majority. A fte r many years of anti-Labour rule they saw the need for a change of government. During this debate there had been much talk by honourable members opposite of the desirability of holding a convention to consider constitutional changes. I remind them that before the referendum of 1944, there was a convention, at which the leaders of all political parties in Australia discussed for a weekproposals for alterations of the , Constitution. An agreement was arrived at, but later sorr""> - f those who had accepted the agreement voted against it. Members of the Opposition advocate the holding of a convention to decide what powers should be vested in the Commonwealth, only because they wish to hide behind the people. They have not the courage to go to the people and say that they are of the opinion that this or that power should be transferred to the Commonwealth. It is also said by opponents of the Government that the decision to hold a referendum on the day of the election is a piece of political trickery. That is an admission that the Opposition expects to be defeated at the next election, and that the Labour Government will again be returned to office. By opposing the granting of additional powers to the Commonwealth opponents of the Government will indicate clearly to the electors that they do not expect to gain the treasury bench. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) said that some members now on the Opposition benches supported the last referendum. That is true, but wbo were those members? They were the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender), who were expelled from the party of wbicb the right honourable member is the leader. When the Tuberculosis Bill was before this House, .1 mentioned that Dr Darcy Cowan, of Adelaide, wbo bas a worldwide reputation in his profession, said t that the greatest tragedy in this country was. that the National Parliament did not have control of the health of the people. I agree with bim that the Commonwealth should have more control over bealth than merely the control - of quarantine. Honourable members opposite profess to believe in the maternity allowance, child endowment, ancl assistance to students, but they also advocate a reduction of taxes by 40 per cent. Tbey are inconsistent, for how can tbese benefits be continued unless money be provided to meet the cost? They claim that there is no challenge to social security, but I ask who challenged the Pharmaceutical Bill and the right of the people to social services? Did not - the challenge come from the Liberal and Australian Country parties, which sit in Opposition in this chamber ? Mr Sheehy. Should those parties be returned to power at the next election the social service legislation now on the statute-book would be in danger, because it is well to remember that the Leader of the Opposition has said that an anti-Labour government would remove it . It may be well to remind honourable members of some previous utterances by the Leader of the Opposition on constitutional matters. Speaking in this chamber on the 2nd November, 193S, the right honourable gentleman saidThe second anomaly to which 1 direct attention has relation to power concerning health. There has been an enormous growth in the last 40 years in our sense of public responsibility, not only for public health, but also for private health. This great problem is now seen by us as presenting essentially national characteristics. The result is that people who do not read the Constitution and are not acquainted with its terms instinctively turn to theComnionwealth Government whenever any great problem relating to .public health requires, attention. Yet the fact is, as 1 now. remind, not honourable members who know it, but the public, that the only power possessed by this Parliament to deal with liealth is the quarantine power. That is in the same strain as what Dr Darcy Cowan said when he referred to the lack of control by this Parliament over matters affecting the bealth of the people. The honourable member for Eawkner (Mr Holt) and the honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Blain) indulged in some criticism of the present Government. I think that the latter described government supporters as being "" cuckoo "" or "" commos "", or both, whilst the former said that they were controlled by .the Communist party. ' In order to show that the parties in Opposition, not the Labour party, are under Communist influences, I draw attention to a statement made by Mr R. Dixon, editor of the Communist Review and now assistant secretary of the Communist party, on the 3rd - September, 1939, a memorable day. Mr Dixon said that he was invited by the then Attorney-General (Mr Hughes) to discuss the merits of communism over the Australian BroadcastingCommission network. It is difficult to imagine a responsible Minister inviting an outstanding Communist to expound the virtues of communism over the national network. Was such an offer ever extended to any member of the Labour party to advocate the merits of the case for Labour? The fact is that the parties opposite were then interested, as today they - are interested, in giving publicity to communism with a view to disrupt labour ' organizations so that they would be an easy prey to their opponents. The action of the right honourable member for Worth Sydney at that time time convinces me that the opponents of Labour are definitely linked with the Communist party. Referring to the third bill, which deals with the terms and conditions of employment in industry, the Leader of the Opposition said that the proposed paragraph (xxxiv.A.) will immediately precede the existing paragraph (xxxv.). He went on to say that be expected that paragraph (xxxv.) would be repealed. That is the paragraph wbicb deals with conciliation and arbitration. The right honourable gentleman, and those who follow him. were greatly disappointed to find that paragraph retained. The greater use of. machinery in industry has done much to increase production. Industry, therefore, can afford a 40-hour week. If Australia is to step out as a nation, something will have to be done to give to the people an instalment of the "" new order"" for which Australians have fought and suffered.",56
132,Mr FRASEB,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Eden-Monaro) [10.1&]. - The arguments which ""have been successfully used against previous referendum proposals cannot validly be employed on this occasion. In the past, when alterations of the Constitution bave been sought, it has been possible to say that although the powers sought might be unexceptionable and capable of being employed to the benefit of the nation, yet the Government for whom the powers were being sought was so untrustworthy and. so villainous as even to be liable to give literal effect to Swift's "" Polite posal "", that, therefore, the transfer of powers should be refused. That argument cannot be employed on this occasion because the referendum proposals are to be submitted to the people on election day. That means that the additional powers can be used only by parliaments which will succeed this one. Although honourable members may be divided on many questions, there appearsto be unanimity that the next parliament will the led by a great Australian of outstanding energy, ability and sincerity, that his Cabinet colleagues will consist of a band of devoted servants of the nation, and that the rank and file of government supporters will be men determined to improve the lot of the people. Since there is agreement that that will be the position in the new Parliamentno one has been prepared to deny it it follows that such a government can indeed be trusted to use wisely and beneficially the powers now being sought. There can be no doubt that if they are used wisely they will be of great advantage to the Australian people. Nor can i he argument be used against these proposals that bas been used on former occasions, and they represent a dangerous and experimental extension of the proper powers of government, because the first proposal merely places beyond doubt powers that have always been claimed for this Parliament and have been consistently used by governments - representing both the party to which I belong and our opponents. The second proposal relating to orderly marketing of primary products is also in line with powers that have been employed by various governments, particularly during the war years, and have proved of practical advantage to the farmers of Australia. As to the third power to be sought-to make laws in relation to the terms and conditions of employment-ther e is nothing new in handing that power to a parliament,. because what parliament is there in the world except this one that does not already possess it? It is possessed by every State parliament in Australia, the New Zealand Parliament and the Mother of Parliaments, and no one would claim that it is not a proper power for the CommonAvealth Parliament to possess. There Procan be no claim that the provision of that power to this Parliament represents a new or dangerous extension of the authority of democratic government. Taken together, the three proposals appear to me to represent the foundation of a plan, for a nationa] minimum living standard for all the people of Australia such as we all should seek to obtain. It is argued, however, that while a power in relation to terms and conditions of employment might properly be vested in this Parliament, it would be wrong for the Parliament to employ it for direct legislation to alter hours of employment or to increase the living standards of the people. As to that, I have only to say that when tbese powers have been granted to this Parliament by the people next election day and when the Labour party has been returned to office, I hope and trust that the power sought in the third proposal will be used legislatively, if necessary, to ensure a reduction of the Standard working week in this country to 40 hours and to ensure a substantial increase of the minimum living standard of the Australian people.",58
133,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"""Barton - AttornevGeneral and Minister for External Affairs) [10.20] - in reply-Eo r the convenience of honourable members. I propose to give each of them a copy of section 51 of the Constitution with the proposed amendments inserted. It is true that the history of referendums in this country shows several trends. This debate bas certainly illustrated one of them. It is the trend towards shelving matters. When during the currency of the war we last discussed a proposal that a referendum be taken, the proposal of the Opposition was that we should shelve it until peace came, when it could be looked at - without the intrusion of the war. Now that peace has come, it bas been suggested, at any rate by some honourable gentlemen opposite, that a constitution convention should be called before we consider these three proposals at all. I agree that if we were sidering a general revision of the Australian Constitution from beginning to end in the light of the experience of the last 40 years, something might be said in favour of a convention called specifically to deal with the whole constitution on the lines of the original conventions; but what we are asking the House and the people to consider are three reforms of the Constitution, which, in our submission, are important .and urgent. aspect of the matter that bas escaped attention in connection with the suggestion that a convention be held is that in section 12S of the Constitution, which deals with the amending process, it is clearly contemplated that this Parliament will be the originating authority in connection with proposed alterations. The conventions were called before the Commonwealth was established because there ha'd to be some body representative of the six colonies that could put forward a bill for submission to the Imperial Parliament, which ultimately passed the Australian Constitution Act. That situation was entirely different from that which rules today. The Constitution provides for its own amendment, and the authority to commence consideration of amendments is the Commonwealth Parliament. Should we have an elected convention o:' a nominated convention? I do uot suppose any one would advocate a nominated convention. Every one suggests an elected convention. Would it be elected as this House is elected? If so, seats would be contested, ancl broadly we should bave representation and representatives of the same type a,? we bave in this House today. In other words, we should have in an elected convention a body constituted very similarly to the Honse. of Representa% tives. I submit that the debates in this chamber*are similar to those that would take place at a convention. Certainly, the late Mr Curtin, during the war period, ancl largely because of the emergency of the war, thought that for the-purpose of post-war reconstruction it would be a good thing to hold a convention representative of all parties in the Commonwealth Parliament ancl the six State Parliaments so that constitution altera tions could be brought forward on a non-party basis. That convention was held. conAll the State Premiers attended, as did leading memhei-'s of the Opposition in this Parliament. We agreed on formulae for the temporary transfer of certain powers from the States to the Commonwealth for five years after the termination of hostilities. All the State Premiers agreed and practically all the Opposition leaders agreed. The plan was that the States would refer those matters to the Commonwealth, as One they are entitled to do under section 51 of the Constitution. If honourable members look at section 51 (xxxvii.) they will see that this Parliament is empowered "" to ' make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to matters referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the parliament or parliaments of any State or States "". We tried to use that power, but what was the result? In four of the States, references were made, but in two of tbem the agreed .formula was not followed. In the other two States, Victoria and Tasmania, the Parliaments, in effect, made ' no reference at all. The result was that the nuatter had to come back to the Commonwealth Parliament, which then submitted it to the people by referendum. Some of those who at the vention, wbicb. was not an elected convention, supported the transfer of the powers, opposed the transfer on the hustings. Something tragic is associated with attempts to make our for m of government fit the needs of our .people. It is not the faul t of any one party, because, at various stages of our history, we have found the opposition party, whether it has been Labour, anti-Labour or non-Labour, opposing referendum proposals because they have been submitted by their poli tical opponents. In any event, I ;hink the case for a convention at this si.age to deal with the specific matters referred to in these bills has broken down. It has not been strongly pressed. The case for a reference of powers by the States tc the Commonwealth Parliament also breaks down because of the failure to have siicb a reference made on the last occasion. Tbat is wby I think the print of section 51 as proposed to be altered will help members. The real question is not what might be done under legislative powers, but whether power to legislate on these three topics will ever be given to the people of Australia acting through this Parliament. If honourable members will look at section 51, I can illustrate my point in a moment. Aa it stands, the section says The Parliament shall . . . have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to(ii) Taxation . . . Power to tax is incidental to sovereignty. What would bave been the position if at the original Constitution convention.members bad risen and said, "" Taxation! But I do not believe in direct taxation. Therefore put a provision in the Constitution giving power to impose taxation, but only indirect taxation "". That would have been supported because of the great opposition in those days to direct taxation, which existed in 1901, I think, in only one State. Others might have held'the opposing view and claimed, that the only for m of taxa'tion should be direct taxation. I ask honourable members to look down the list of powers in section 51. In paragraph (iv.) we have ""borrowing money on the public credit of the Commonwealth This Parliament can pass laws for that purpose. But the critic who. does not like Constitution reform will say, "" Ob yes, but what rate of interest are you going to p a y ? "" Some might say, "" No more than the cost of issuance"", others, "" Not more than 3 per c e n to the r s "" not less than 4 per cent."" and so forth . You might have in a situation like that- a body divided, not on whether the people should have the power over the subject-matter, but on bow the legislation should be drafted when the power is granted. The same fallacy runs through the whole of this debate. The fathers of federation did not look at the matter in that way. They said that the Commonwealth Parliament should bave power to make laws with respect to ""banking, other than State banking"". Tbat, of course, protects the interests of the States in their institutions; but if that were proposed today, you would bave the argument, "" There might be an attempt to socialize or monopolize banking. Yes, we shall give the Parliament power over banking, but so that there shall not be nationalization of banking"". Tbat would be. interfering with the discretion, not of the existing Parliament or succeeding parliaments, but of the people of Australia. Take paragraph (x i v . ), which refers to insurance. The fathers of the Constitution did not say "" The Commonwealth Parliament can deal with insurance, other than State insurance, but not so that there shall be nationalization of fire, life, marine, or any other for m of insurance "". Neither did they say that there had to. be nationalization of insurance. They left it to the wisdom and discretion of the Parliament acting in the interests of the. people of Australia - It is possible to get even more controversial topics if one examines the list of' 39 subject matters. The subject of divorce and matrimonial causes, for instance, is a fruitful field for disputation and provides the same sort of argument that we' have had here. Take, for instance, subject-matter number xxvii, wbicb deals with immigration and emigration, the great power of controlling the movements of people to. or from Australia.. We might say, "" We want to insert a provision in the Constitution that in no circumstances or at no particular time should a person of a particular race come into Australia "". That might have heen reasonable in 1901; but the Con.stitution provides that it is a matter for the Parliament to deal with. possible to give similar illustrations in - respect of every one of these powers. The - question is whether .in relation to the three topics chosen by the Government the peoples should be given an opportunity to express their will on an Australia-wide basis. Whilst debate on the possible abuse of power .is interesting and often, informative, and invaluable as a guide to the legislation that may be passed, it is not a help to us in making the Constitution. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Adermann) is well known in connection with the controlling of pools for the marketing of primary products. He knows a great deal about this work. The theme of his criticism was that orderly marketing of primary products must be under grower control, which he believes to' be a better form of control than one in which there are too many representatives of the Government or the consumers. But the very slightest consideration will demonstrate that such a limitation could not be placed on such a power. Discretion must be left to the Government in exercising the power. The right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) referred to the condition of hospitals in certain parts of the north coast of New South Wales. We accept his description of tbem, which reveals a very serious state of affairs mainly resulting from too few beds being available. Notwithstanding that that is a fact, I do Dr Evatt. not believe that is any argument against giving to the Commonwealth Parliament some authority to deal with hospital and medical services. On the contrary, 1 believe it to be an argument in favour of the granting of such authority to the Commonwealth. The authorities which, have had a practical monopoly in that regard have been the States themselves, and apparently the exercise of this power by the State of New South Wales has not been altogether successful. Tliere i? no argument, I submit, against the power which is sought here. Dealing with the industrial power ether honourable members bave said that a law might be made in this Parliament which would override a decision of the Arbitration Court. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. It is Bowden) suggested that possibility. Whilst it is a possibility, it is a very unlikely one; I cannot imagine this Parliament ever making such a law. If this Parliament is clothed with power to legislate in relation to terms and conditions of employment in industry it might, however, in an appropriate case have to inter- vene in some great .crisis. However, I suggest, that that would be just as exceptional and unlikely as intervention by a State. Parliament after a decision had been made by the Arbitration Court, or by the Industrial Commission of the State. I cannot remember a single case of that having happened in Australia. Criticism of this kind is but .another illustration of the fallacy that in order to determine whether a power should be granted to the Commonwealth Parliament one should conjure up possible abuses of such a power. Abuses could, of course, have taken place under every power vested in the Commonwealth. Under the power of taxation the Commonwealth could take away from a man everything that he owns. The Commonwealth's power in respect of taxation is not limited to income tax; it extends to the imposition of a tax on capital values. In these matters we bave to trust to the wisdom of the legislature. One of the most extraordinary argu-ments was advanced by the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott), wbo said there was something sinister in the bill relating to the power dealing with organized marketing. The honourable member saw something sinister even in the word "" organized "". Yet we find that word in the published platform of the Australian Country party of the 1st June, 1938.",59
134,Sir EARLE PAGE,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,We could supply the right honourable gentleman with more up-to-date platforms.,62
135,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Althoug h the document from which I am quoting may 'not be up to date it contains the phrase ""assistance for organised marketing"". The honourable member for New England made a great point, too, about "" primary products "", which, I admit is a difficult term to define. The honourable member and others argued that it was quite clear that butter could not be a primary product, claiming that butter made on the farm by the producer was quite different from butter made in a factory under a process more do? ' y approaching what, wo regard as manufacturing.",62
136,Sir EARLEPACE,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,It is quite different in the income tax legislation.,62
137,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"That is so, but that legislation defines, .aot a primary product but a primary producer. We are dealing, not with a person, but with a product. It cannot be claimed that butter made on a f a rm is a primary product, but that if its manufacture takes place at a later stage in a butter factory it is not a primary product. At all events tliere seemed to be no doubt in the minds of members of the Australian .Country party when the party's was drafted in 1938, because what they were then aiming at was the establishment of fair market values for butter and other primary products. Whatever the parties in Opposition may say against tbese proposals the question should be approached from the point of view, not, of the possible misuse of a power, but, whether that power is national in character and should be exercised by this Parliament. I propose to refer briefly to each of the three powers, in order to meet if I can some of the difficulties which bave been expressed by honourable members in rela-' .tion to them. The first is the .industrial power which we ask be given to this Parliament to make laws with respect to "" terms and conditions of employment in industry, but not so as to authorize any form of industrial conscription "". Tbis aim is expressed slightly differently in various proposals that have come before this Parliament; but, broadly, it is intended to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to fix terms and conditions of industrial employment. Support for such a power during the last 20 or 30 years has been very, great. It has come from persons of all parties wbo bave studied this problem and experienced the difficulties of administering the power. One of those whom I think I should mention is Mr Justice Higgins, the famous Judge who was one of the early presidents of the Federal Arbitration Court. He had vast experience in that jurisdiction, and established the codes on which the later judges built. He is famous tb rough out the world for his work in that connection. When, in 3920, the government of the day asked Mr Justice Higgins for a suggested amendment of the power, ho put forward a proposal that power should be given to this Parliament to deal with industrial matters generally, because the existing power dealt with "" conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of one State "". As the Leader df the Opposition has pointed out, almost every word and every sentence of that has led to litigation. I was looking through the cases summarized in the hook on the Australian Constitution that bas just been published, platform' and I found that they covered page after page on every clause. In these cases questions were asked as to what was meant by conciliation, what did arbitration mean, and what constituted an in dustrial dispute. It took twenty years for the High Court to lay down rules which would determine how an industrial dispute was created. In order to bring the case within the jurisdiction of the court there bad to be a dispute; the court could not deal with the matter until there was a dispute. Tliere arose out of that a system under which logs were served by one side and counter demands by the other; but that was not enough. It was often argued in the court that the logs were not pressed forward, or that there was not enough seriousness about the demands, or perhaps not enough dislocation of industry to bring the case within the jurisdiction of the court. If a strike occurred it was apparent that the dispute was real, but it was at a very late stage that the court intervened in these matters. Under the system wbicb grew up under the-existing power in 1935, disputes were very often manufactured.",62
138,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Is not that still the case',63
139,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"In connection with conciliation and arbitration, it is still the case.",63
140,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,And will continue to be the case?,63
141,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,It is still the case if that is the power which remains in the Constitution. It will not be the case if this proposed alteration be made.,63
142,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Placitu m (xxxv.) is not amended.,63
143,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"That is so, but placitum (xxxv.) does not govern the proposed new placitum (xxxiv.A.).",63
144,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Placitu m (xxxv.) will still bave the same meaning.,63
145,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"will bave an entirely broader meaning, as I shall show. Apart from Mr Justice Higgins's opinion in support pf this proposal, there is the advocacy of the right honoraible member for North Sydney, who put up various proposals with this object in view. Some of them were very nearly adopted. The most striking support of all is contained in two speeches by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) in 1933 and 1938. Those statements put the case so well for this power being jonferred upon the Commonwealth that it is hardly necessary for me to add one word to them. The riglit honourable gentleman has never said in this debate that he does not still hold those opinions. I do not twit him with having changed his opinion. I submit that he still holds that opinion, and that the case is unanswerable. After having dealt with other possible courses, the Leader of the Opposition said in 1933The third course, and, in spite of past heresies, I am today driven to it , is section 51 by giving to the Commonwealth Parliament, power to legislate generally in respect of all industrial matters. That is precisely the proposal contained in the Constitution Alteration (Industrial Employment) Bill, which proposes to alter the Constitution by inserting after placitum (xxxiv.) the following plafiitum:. (xxxiv.A.'). Terms and conditions of employment in industry, but not so as to authorize any form of iiidustrial conscription :",63
146,Dr GAHA,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"The Leader of the Opposition is not a heretic now. Vrr. EVATT - No , the right honourable gentleman was very careful not to put a different view. The reasons which he gave for the opinion cannot be answered, and no attempt bas been made to answer them, in this debate. He dealt with the argument that the. honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Blain) advanced regarding centralization. Tbat was a very important part of the argument. The contention of the Leader of the Opposition on that point wasThe immediate objection to this proposal is that it appears to involve a tremendous centralizing of ,puwer on a matter which, more tlian most matters, frequently requires local and particular treatment. The answer to that objection is, paradoxical though it may seem, that you never will be able to get a local treatment of a local dispute until you give all power to the Commonwealth. As' I have endeavoured to prove, the present sub-section (xxxv.) has almost compelled the aggregation of disputes. The matter cannot be raised in the 'Commonwealth Arbitration Court unless persons in at least two States co-operate to make an interstate dispute.",63
147,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Tba t will still be true, under the alteration proposed by the Atto r ney Gener a 1. j",63
148,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"If I make the first point good, that is the very alteration which I propose and which the Leader of the Opposition supported years ago. The right honoraible gentleman adduced arguments which have not been answered, and lie repeated them with equal vigour, and just as convincingly, in .the budget debate on the 22nd November, 1938. Consequently, we have, in support of this proposal, an imposing list of names- Mr . Justice Higgins, who founded the system nf industrial arbitration, the right to amend honourable member for North Sydney who was associated with all the great struggles in the pioneering work of arbitration in the Commonwealth and New South Wales, and the Leader of the Opposition himself, who probably has a greater working knowledge of the Commonwealth arbitration system in the last twenty years than has any other person in Australia. They all reach a similar conclusion. Why should not we accept that view? We insure a safeguard against industrial conscription, which it is reasonable to include. Why should it not be accepted? It is said, especially by members of the Australian Country party, that it would give to the Commonwealth Parliament power to declare a standard working week of 40 hours. That is quite true. It certainly would do that. The view which the Government takes is that, as a general rule, industrial disputes should be dealt with by a tribunal, but this proposal would certainly give such a power to the Commonwealth Parliament. Then we reach this extraordinary position: If we study the history of industrial arbitration, we shall find that the judges .exercising jurisdiction in dealing with standard hours have said repeatedly that they look to the legislature for guidance as to what should be the standard hoursthat the fixing of standard hours should be a matter not, for the courts, but for the Parliament. The first-judge to make thai statement was Mr J'ustice Heydon, President of the N ew South Wales Arbitra 3 tion Court, when a reduction of standard hours from 4S to 44, or perhaps some lesser number, was sought. Later, Mr. Justice Higgins adopted a similar view. A completely new light is thrown on this particular aspect of the controversy when we read, these references. In 1920, Mr. Justice Higgins, in the Timber Workers case, awarded a standard working wfek of 44 liours. Mr Maughan, counsel for the employers, who objected to the reduction said :I simply want to explain that generally my association does take the view that this matter of the change in the standard hours of work for Australia is one rather for the legislature. I do not know what legislature Mr. Maughan meant. He cpuld ,not bave meant the Commonwealth legislature, wbicb bad no power in that matter. I suppose that be meant the State legislatures. Mr Justice Higgins then said-^I shall be very glad if the Legislature would take it in hand, but as it has not done so, I must act. The difficulty is that this question is continually coming up before me. It is not merely in the Timber Workers Onion case, but it is continually coining up before me, and though I must decide only as to the Timber Workers Union I am anxious to get all the information or the light that can be thrown on it from otlier industries. In his judgment (20 C.L.R., S46) Mr.' J usti ce' Higgins said I have waited for many years for the parliaments to speak, but they have not spoken. At present, in four of the States, there is no legislation even for a 48 hours week. In Victoria, there is no limi t of liours for adults in factories other than that which may be imposed by a wages board in a particular industry. Some definite conclusion must be reached on the subject, I do not desire to be misunderstood. I am not saying that we should express an opinion now as to whether such a matter as the standard working week shou]d be dealt with primarily by the. legislature. My own opinion is that primarily, ,it is proper for the court to deal with the matter, but the legislature must possess authority over all aspects of industrial matters in accordance with its discretionary powers. The view of Mr. Justice Higgins showed that arbitration courts looked to the Parliament for guidance, and some States did pas? legislation relating to this matter. In 1920, the Parliament of New South Wales passed an act directing the State Industrial Commission not to grant a working week exceeding 44 hours except in respect of certain industries. In 1921, the art was repealed.",63
149,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"It was, after remarks by Mr Justice Higgins in 1920 that this Parliament provided that standard liours should be dealt with by the Full Court.",64
150,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"That , is quite correct.",64
151,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,It was provided that three judges should deal with matters relating to standard hours.,64
152,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"That is.true. When Mr Justice Higgins was considering a reduction of hours from 48 to 44 a week, a bill was introduced into this Parliament to prevent him from completing the inquiry unless two other judges sat with him. A lengthy debate took place in the Parliament as to whether that law should: apply to that case, and finally, it was decided that the law should not apply to the Timber Workers' case but should be the rule regarding all future cases. That .point tells against the idea that' these matters should not be dealt with by the Parliament. If the Parliament considers that standard hours should be stabilized and no reduction should be made unless three judges deal with the case, that is - an indication of the Parliament's will that, unless a strong .case is presented, no reduction shall be made. I come now to the principal point made by the Leader of the Opposition in connection with the addition of this power. Proposed new placitum (xxxiv.A.) providesTerms and conditions of employment in industry, but not so as to authorize any form of industrial conscription: When honourable members read that pa ragraph, and the conciliation and' arbitration powder at present in the Constitution, they can appreciate the argument of the Leader of the Opposition. The riglit honourable gentleman declared that there will be no power under the new placitum to deal with conciliation and arbitration except in accordance with placitum (xxxv.) of the Constitution. It will still have the limitations on conciliation and arbitration which have already been expressed. That will be, he said, the code for dealing with the subject.",64
153,Mr METTZIES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"I put ' it this way: Either placitum (xxxv.) will continue to he the only provision in relation to conciliation ancl arbitration, or it will be meanina'les.;.",65
154,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"We shall assume that it will not be meaningless, so the only Dower of conciliation and arbitration will be that already in the Constitution.",65
155,Mr WHITE,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,There is no obligation to use it?,65
156,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"That is a different point. The contention of the Leader of the Opposition is a more serious argument if it has any substance. It would be that, although we give to this Parliament power to deal* with industrial conditions generally, .we need not set up any other form of arbitration .except that contained in placitum (xxxv.). In a recent decision of the High Court in Pidoto v. Victoria (68 C.L.R., 101) I find a complete answer to that argument. The Chief Justice, Sir John Latham, said in his judgmentThe first objection to the Regulation submitted by the State of Victoria is based upon suction 51. (xxxv.) of the Constitution That is the section on arbitrationwhich confers upon the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws in respect to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. It is contended that this provision implies a - negative-that it means not only that the Commonwealth Parliament shall have power to legislate in relation to industrial disputes tliere defined Those are the interstate disputesand in the manner there prescribed That is of conciliation and arbitrationbut also that the Connnonwoalth Parliament shall not have power to deal with any otherindustrial matter or with any industrial dispute in any other manner. In my opinion this argument cannot be supported. Section 51 (xxxv.) is a positive provision conferring - a specific power.' The particular terms in which this power is conferred are not, in my opinion, so expressed as to be capable of being so construed as to impose a limitation upon other powers positively conferred. Further, if section 51 (xxxv.) were construed so as to prevent the Parliament from dealing with industrial matters exrept under that specific provision.* similar reasoning would lead to the conclusion that the Couunonwealth Parliament could not (under any legislative power) provide for the use of Soncilintion and arbitration in relation to any other matter than interstate industrial disputes. That is broadly the view of the Leader of the Oppositionl t must, I think, be conceded, for example, that the Commonwealth Parliament can, in legislating with respect to the Public Service of the Commonwealth (Constitution, section 52 (ii.), to provide for conciliation and arbitration in relation to matters such as wages, conditions and liours, whether'or not any dispute about those matters is industrial, and whether or not it extends beyond the limits of any one State. In my opinion the objection to the Industrial Peace Regulations based upon section 51' (xxxv.) of the Constitution Those were the war-time regulations passed under the Commonwealth's defence powermust lie rejected, 'because it finds no support in the words of this provision for the implied prohibition suggested. As a matter of fact, the High Court in a ease in 1930, or 1931, dealt with a somewhat similar point. The argument there was that the arbitration power could not - deal with railway disputes because of the reference to railways elsewhere in section 51; and the court, in rejecting that argument said, in substance, that it had to look at each power separately, that each was a grant of power, and the court could not read it down by reference to other powers. However, that case is not so direct to the point as the recent cdse I bave mentioned. [Extension of time granted.'] Is it not clear that the whole list of powers in section 51 are simply subject-matters of power, and that there is overlapping in many.cases? Let us look at proposed new placitum (xxxiv.A.) and placitum (xxxv.) together. One would not construe the new power, by reference to pliacitum (xxxv.) because, one reason, the new power comes into the Constitution 46 years later. It is not as though they were put in the Constitution at the one time. Therefore proposed paragraph (xxxiv.A) will do what the Leader of the Opposition advocated in 1.938, that is, it will give the Commonwealth complete power over industrial matters. And with what result? There would be no necessity to create a dispute. The court could deal with the matter whether it was a dispute within a single State or an interstate dispute. It, would enable the court to take up matters without the procedural difficulties contained in the federal arbitration system, and, broadly speaking, the Government and the Parliament would be in a much freer position to deal with the question of industrial justice, seeing that industries supported by tariffs, and financially by the Commonwealth ancl State Parliaments.",65
157,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,The Government would achieve most of that objective by deleting the last words in placitum .(xxxv.).,66
158,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"No . I admit that the deletion of tliose words would extend the arbitration power; but arbitration connotes a dispute, one party demanding something and the other party refusing it. That is not the basis pf. the State industrial commissions. They act upon a claim without any dispute at all ",66
159,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"May I put'one further question about this matter wbicb I think is not touched by either of the cases cited by the Attorney-General. I agreed in thecourse of my speech that the expression, "" terms ancl conditions of employment in industry"", taken by itself would covertbe whole gamut of the settlement of wages and conditions, and under thoseawards standing by themselves you.could set up a court, or not, according to your discretion, and could legislate direct, or not according to your discretion. I take it that the Attorney-General will agree with that? If he does so, I ask what meaning now attaches to placitum (xxxv.) ?",66
160,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"The honourable member's point is that the new power-is sowide ancl embracing that you could do what is already contained in placitum (xxxv.) under the new power. Tbat is tofor say, you might do it. There is great force in that contention. Eor instance we could,, in a system of arbitration, if we set it. up under the new power, include arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. But it is not certain that we shall deal with ' if in that way - We may not do so. Parliament might think fit not to make the exerciseof the jurisdiction dependent upon the existence cf a dispute. But we are leaving something in the Constitution which might become, unnecessary.",66
161,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Anc l the effect would: be the same in your case if you-repealed placitum xxxv. altogether.,66
162,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"I do not say that, it would, but I can see the reason for t,heare right honourable member's contention. I am not repealing it, because I do not want it to be stated for one moment that the Government does not wish to retain, arbitration. If we did that, the argument of the Opposition would be that the Government was trying to get rid of conciliation ancl arbitration, and wanted 1 to settle all industrial disputes in Canberra.",66
163,Mr FADDEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"The Government ism-e-rely ring-barking arbitration-killing : it while allowing it to stand. Dr. EVATT,--Tb e proposal to cut out. all reference to arbitration from the Constitution would be regarded as something; worse than ring-barking; it would be likechopping down a tree which, with all its faults, has grown to considerable proportions during the last 46 years. The honourable member's course, if he is in' support of the new clause, is to move to omit placitum (xxxv.). I promise that if he moves to omit placitum (xxxv.) the Government will consider the matter. However, 1 preferto retain it. I pass now to marketing. The proposed power is in relation to the organized marketing of primary products. This is covered in proposed new paragraph (i.A.); and proposed new subsection 2 of section 51 provides that that power will not be subject to section 92. What has the debate revealed in relation to that? The honourable member .for Indi (Mr MCEwen) made the point that that power does not deal with production. It assumes that there are primary products coming into existence ancl gives to the Commonwealth power to pass laws for the organized marketing of those, products. Some cornmen'; was made about the term ""organized""; but it is equivalent to orderly; that is to say, the power must be exercised so 'as to provide a system of marketing wbicb will ensure that the primary products of the country'sball be marketed in a way wbicb will produce the best possible price for the crop as a whole, or the grouDS of commodities treated' as a whole. That is what the phrase means as it is used in the platform of the Country parly, and 1 do not think that it means anylhing else according to the dictates of common sense.",66
164,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Tb e Attorney-General recognizes that organized marketing is a means to the stabilization of prices.,67
165,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Yes ; so that the farmer will obtain the best possible price for his commodity in the existing circumstances. Experience of gluts bas shown that this objective is achieved through orderly marketing. It is true, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, that in the 1'937 referendum that power was not given in this form to the Commonwealth. Alongside the Commonwealth's limited power in this respect the States had control of domestic marketing within their boundaries, with the result that co-operation between the Commonwealth ancl one, or more, of the it. State legislatures was required. If this power is granted the Commonwealth can do everything - necessary, or incidental, to the organized marketing of primary products.",67
166,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,But nothing in respect cf the prices of primary products.,67
167,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"rWhilst the honourable member is correct in pointing out that price is the important thing, this is a means to that end. If the Government were to ask for power under the Constitution to fix prices permanently, the discussion would be transferred to a field which could not be limited to primary products. The purpose of organized marketing is to obtain the best price for the pooled commodity. Members of the Australian Country party have always - striven to get the best pricethrough this system; and it will be for the representatives of that party, the Labour party ancl other parties, when the relevant legislation comes before Parliament, to make sure that the conditions of marketing will be such that the goods will be presented to the consumer in the most attractive form so that the producer will aet the utmost value for his products. It is useless to say that the proposed power does not include the fixation of prices; it does. Experience has shown us that the producers get the best prices in this way. We do not take a direct power over production.",67
168,Mr FADDEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Tb e Commonwealth has au incidental power over production.,67
169,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Tba t may be, but the essence of this power is to deal with primary products and the marketing of primary products in an orderly way, and to the best possible advantage through the system determined by the government. It may be grower-control, or governmentplus-grower control. There is nothing in any statute passed by any State with respect to the marketing of primary products which fixes the prices of any product.",67
170,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Contro l over the wheat acreage is the only control which enables this Parliament to guarantee a price for ""wheat.",67
171,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,I am not dealing with guaranteed prices.,67
172,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,That is the purpose of,67
173,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Yes ; these are the means to the end, and the end will be attained through the efficiency of the means. But there is no marketing legislation in Queensland, or New South Wales, and I do not. think in any other State, which could not, be covered by this power.. [. admit that were it a matter of guaranteeing a price and purchasing a commodity, other considerations might arise. I want the House to consider only the question whether this Parliament, ih the interests of the producers - of Australia, should have the power to pass laws, selected hy it, which will ensure that primary products shall be marketed in an orderly manner ancl be sold'to the best advantage. Would that be a good or a bad thing? Not one member of the Australian Country party can say that it would be a bad thing, because the orderly marketing of primary products has always been a plank in the party's platform.",68
174,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,I should say that it would be quite inadequate. A guaranwas teed price is an essential feature of stability.,68
175,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"There is an old French saying that "" the best is the enemy of good "". I do not claim that this is the best thing; nevertheless, it will be good the primary producer, even though it not give to him everything be wants. is a step forward towards the objective of better conditions for the primary ducers of Australia, and it is the duty every one who represents them to support it, subject to one qualification. The honourable members for Gippsland Bowden), Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) and Maranoa (Mr Adermann) almost supof ported it in this House. Tbey were paragraph puzzled in regard to one or two aspects, to but obviously were anxious to overcome f r tlieir doubts, if they could do so, particularly-if I may say so-by having a definition of "" primary products "". I do not, know whether the. Leader of the Australian Country party is irrevocably committed to the closing part of his speech, during which his rhetoric led him into some misstatements, one of which very serious, namely, that the late Ourtin had been responsible for a pamdescribed phlet dealing with the 1936 marketing referendum, from which he read a passage. I checked his quotation, and discovered that Mr Curtin bad had nothing whatever to do with it.",68
176,Mr FADDEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"It was the case for "" No"", issued on behalf of the Labour party. .",68
177,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Howeve r that may be, the right honourable gentleman was in error. Mr Curtin did not authorize the opposition to that proposal. It is perfectly true that the Labour party was divided on the matter at the time; but Mr Curtin had no share whatever in the production of that pamphlet. I hope that - the right honourable gentleman will check that statement.",68
178,Mr FADDEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,It was stated to be the . official document of the Labour party.,68
179,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Unde r the statute, it had to be authorized .by members supporting the case in Parliament, and Mr. Curtin was not one of tbem. I do not think that the right honourable gentleman a member of this House at that time. I did not attempt to embody in the bill a definition of "" primary products "". In my lack of knowledge of country matters, the 1 thought that butter was a primary product, whether it was made on a farm or in for a factory. I could not see how it could will change from a primary to a secondary It product 'because it was produced in a larger quantitj or its quality was slightly prodifferent. Having gone into the matter of very carefully, I propose to bring down in committee an amendment which will not Jimit the meaning of "" primary pro(Mr ducts "". It is in these terms Without in any way limitin g the generality the expression "" primary products"" in (iA), that expression shall be deemed include flour and otlier wheat products, butter, cheese, and other milk products, dried u it and other f r u it products, and sugar.",68
180,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"What about canned fruits ? « ,",68
181,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Mr MCCarthy, secretary to the Department of Commerce ancl Agriculture, whom I have consulted, is satisfied that those wbo put fruit in a was saleable form in cans will be covered, Mr because what they produce may well be as "" other fruit products "". I regard that as a sound opinion. [Further extension of time granted.] I do not suppose it will be suggested that wheat is not a primary product; therefore it need not be mentioned specifically in the amendment. I believe that I bave covered most of the borderline cases. I am not making provision for the obvious cases. I am sure that all the doubts of the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) will be resolved now that butter is being, formally declared a primary product. The last matter with which I want tb deal is social services. The honourable member for Indi, for some unknown reason, has submitted an amendment that the bill be withdrawn and 'redrafted as two bills. We are proposing to place three questions before the people. That is not enough for him; he wants four. He desires that the first bill shalldeal with the provision of the maternity allowance, widow's pensions, child endowment, unemployment, benefits to students and family allowances; and that the second shall deal with sickness and hospital benefits and medical and dental services. We could, o course, submit a separate question in r respect of each of the social services mentioned. I have not beard in this House any objection, even by the honourable member for Indi, to legislation directed towards the provision by the Commonwealth of the social services that are dealt with in this long list. The honourable member for Indi argued that controversy might be aroused .regarding sickness and hospital benefits and medical and dental services; therefore, they might be dealt with in a different manner. The manner of dealing with tb'em will be for this Parliament ""to determine. Eor some extraordinary reason, he wants to subtract sickness and hospital benefits from the list of social services with respect to which the Commonwealth may make provision. Wby should not the Commonwealth Parliament have the power to make - provision with respect to that matter? Why should that question be put to the people separately? I submit that there is no case for separation.",68
182,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,What I said was that powerful vested interests in the medical profession will organize opposition that proposal. Dr Evatt.,69
183,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"We shall cope, with them; and if the honourable member will assist us, we shall successfully combat them. There will be vested interests opposed to every alteration of the Constitution. As soon as the campaign begins it will be found that, as occurred on the last occasion, the case for the proposals will be misrepresented all over the Commonweath. We cannot help that. Wo must bave our case stated fairly. I believe that the honourable member for Indi means to imply that be is against the organization of such vested interests.",69

185,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Tb e honourable gentleman said that the reason in favour of separation is that vested interests will organize opposition against the second part of the proposal. I decline to separate them. All of them are parts of the system of social services. This proposal, if. accepted by the people, will not compel the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate in respect of any particular form of benefit. ' The form will be for the Parliament to determine. All of tbese matters are related to each other; all of tbem belong to the system of social services. The bill is described as a' social services bill, and there is no occasion whatever for the proposed separation. .",69

Why should it be unpopular to ask the people to give to their Parliament the power to make provision on their behalf for medical and dental services?

Amendment agreed to.",71
193,Sir EARLE PAGE,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Cowper) [11.46]. - - I move That, in proposed new paragraph (xxiii.A.), the following words bo left put:- "" sickness .and hospital benefits, medical and dental services "". I move this amendment for the reasons stated in my second-reading speech. The experience of the Government during the last four or five years shows that it cannot successfully approach the subject of a national health service in the way it is attempting. It for.ced the Pharmaceutical Benefits Bill through the House during an all-night sitting, but it has not yet been able to reach an agreement with the chemists. I have no objection to the Commonwealth having power to legislate in regard to public health, but the matter should be dealt with in an amendment covering all phases of the subject. The Attorney-General directed our attention to the list of powers con! erred on the Commonwealth by the Constitution. In that document, the powers are stated clearly and crisply. Eor instance, it is stated that the Commonwealth Parliament shall have power to legislatein respect of trade and commerce, taxation, posts and telegraphs and other like services, quarantine, invalid and old-agepensions, &c. The Government's present proposal provides that the Commonwealth Parliament shall have power to legislate forThe provision of maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services, benefits to students, and family allowances. To include such a' hotch-potch of items allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemploy- is to make a mockery of section 51. As ment, sickness and hospital the Government wonld not accept the benefits, medical and dental amendment of the honourable member for services, benefits to students and family allowances:"". Indi (Mr MCEwen), it should, at least, frame workmanlike proposals of its own in regard to public bealth. Its attempt to deal with the matter from the top downwards is stupid, and must lead to confusion and conflict. For instance, the Commonwealth bas been paying a subsidy of so many shillings a day for each hospital bed, when the fact is that we are hopelessly short of hospital beds. In fact, the need for hospital accommodation is even greater than the need for bouses. We should make a frontal attack on this problem. Amendment negatived.",71

195,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [12.20 a.m.] - I move That, in proposed new paragraph (xxiii.A.). after the word "" services "" the following words and brackets be inserted:- "" (but not so as to authorize any form of civil conscription)"". In my earlier remarks on the bill I advanced my reasons for thinking that the expression ""medical and dental services "" could very well support a proposal for the nationalization of the medical and dental - professions.. I do not want to repeat the reasons which I then gave, but as the Attorney-General (Dr E v at t ) , in his reply, did not add anything to what he had said in his second-reading speeob I wish the position to be made quite clear. The matter could easily be put beyond question. In my amendment I have taken the liberty of borrowing a form of words in the Constitution Alteration (Industrial Employment) Bill. that measure, the expression used "" Terms and conditions of employment industry hut-not so as to authorize form of industrial. conscription"". Although we have heard very little pose. about it, I have no doubt that contribution those words were put in that bill in order to allay any fears that a it broad, power might be used to produce conscription of a form to which the Godental vernment and its supporters abject. T have merely adapted the same language to this bill. I would never object to medithe cal and dental services being provided the people under some proper governof ment scheme. I bave no objection to the. sions Commonwealth having power to make proper laws in relation to medical and dental services, but so long as there doubt-anc l I entertain grave doubts on the matter-as to whether thatpower does not authorize the nationalization these two professions, their members entitled to be protected against conscripresides tion just as are industrial workers under the bill I have mentioned. This, is a perfectly fair proposition: If industrial workers are to be put beyond the danger of industrial conscription, then what good for them should be good for prohands fessional workers also.",71
196,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Barton-Attorney-Genera and Minister for External Affairs) [12.23 a.m.] - I have given consideration to the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) which was cirfessions culated some time ago. It is true, as the right honourable gentleman said, that he has borrowed certain words from the bill dealing with industrial matters, but the Government bad preamendment ? viously borrowed the same set of words from the National Security Bill introduced by the right honourable gentleman when be was Attorney-General. I that one good turn deserves another, and that if industrial workers are entitled he protected against, conscription bers of the' medical and dental professions bill. are entitled to similar protection. I , therefore, have pleasure in accepting amendment.",72
197,Dr GAHA,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Denison) [12.25 a.m.] In I am glad that the Attorney-General is, (Dr Evatt) is not upset about the in amendment moved by the Leader of the any Opposition (Mr Menzies), but I cannot see that it will serve any useful purI n my opinion, it is merely a legal to the measure which will serve no practical purpose. However, if - will give any stability to the bill and remove from members of the medical and professions any fear that they will be conscripted, it can do no harm. There appears to be a good deal of fear as to effect of this measure, but I cannot for imagine any government telling members the medical or dental profesthat they must do this or that. If that were done, what kind of service could be expected from the men affected? .Should it be proposed to is place those professions on a national basis, the people concerned will know that the time bas arrived for something to be of done. Every power proposed to be are vested in the Commonwealth already in the States, and, therefore, whether or not those powers be transferred makes little difference. I should imagine that the professions would be safer under the wider powers of the Comis monwealth than with those powers in the of the States, and, therefore, the transferring of powers is not likely to be inimical to members of the medical and l dental professions. The present keen demand for the services of medical men and dentists may not always exist; the time may come when men in these prowill ask the Government to take perfectly action to assist tbem.",72
198,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,Does ' the honourable member intend to vote against the,72

If any government did try to do that it would, . an approach entirely new to me. However, if both legal gentlemen are able, I have no alternative but to accept the situation.",72
201,Mr ARCHIE CAMEEON,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Barker) [12.31 a.m.] - Tb e honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha,), wbo I am pleased to see is getting closer to the treasury bench, says that he cannot imagine any government conscripting professional men. In Europe lately there there has been a man hunt for prowidows' fessional men. They have even been ment, kidnapped. If it were not for the proand posed amendment the honourable member family allowances. might be absent for two months without leave of absence and have to forfeit his toseat. We would not know where he was, as we do not know where he is in word regard to this amendment. Mr DALY. (Martin) [12.32 a.m.] Although the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) has .accepted the. .amendment, I adopted. do not think it is necessary in view of the fact that another bill with which we shall soon be dealing specifically provides that no class of the community, professional or otherwise, shall he subject to proposedindustrial .conscription. That provision will safeguard the medical profession. I see no reason why in the - Constitution should extend special privileges tb any section of the community. The Opposiearlier tion is drawing a red herring across the trail in order to confuse the ininds of public. It is endeavouring to whip up in this country the belief that we want powers provided for in this bill for express purpose of nationalizing medical ancl dental services. That is entirely, false. The Government wants these I - po-.vcrs so that it shall be able on to ensure a comprehensive range of social services for - the Australian people. If there should be a change the set-up of the medical and dental professions, honourable members may assured that the change will 'be made a basis of equity. We should not fall for this proposal which the Opposition has made solely for the purpose of representing the situation to the and I regret; that the Attorney-General has accepted the amendment.

Title, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments, and an amended title: report-by .leaveTHIRD READING. Motion (by Dr. EVATT)-by leaveThat the bill be now read a third timeMr MENZIES.:- I desire at/this stage to we take a point of order, concerning the ruling that, you, Mr Speaker, gave a .little on the question of the counting of the vote on these bills. Section 128 of the the Constitution provides that a proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution must, the be passed by an absolute majority of the each House of the Parliament. Thesecond-reading is not the passing of the bill any more than i= the first reading. f it be right to bave the House counted' the second reading, it is equally right to have it counted on the first reading,' because each is a stage of the bill; but of the bill does not pass until it is read a rest third time. Many honourable memberson might vote for the second reading, anticipating an opportunity in committee of, haying amendments made which would mismake it acceptable, and then support people, the third reading. We have seenthat, happen time after time. Consequently, a great deal of time will be occupied on these bills if we bave to go through the process of having tellers appointed and the House counted when a division bas perhaps not even been asked for at a stage when the bill is not passing at all. The point I make is that the bill passes this House at its third reading and that the third reading is the. only stage at which it becomes necessary to determine whether an - absolute majority of the House bas voted for it . The matter is of general interest, because it arises from time to time, and I am raising it now with profound respect for what you, Mr Speaker, said earlier, because we ought to establish once and .for all a uniform practice on this matter.",73
202,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - T think I ought to clarify' the matter. My personal view coincides with that of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Menzies) that the bill passes the House at its third reading. ' To comply with the Constitution it is absolutely essential that a count of the House take place at that stage; but there is another point of view, which I think is held by the Attorney-General (Dr E v at t ) , that at some subsequent time a point might he taken that the bill was not properly .passed, unless a count was made on both the second reading and the third reading.",74
203,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"And the first reading? Mr SPEAKER,-Althoug h I am not a lawyer, I am the custodian of the rights and privileges of this'House. As a doubt has been raised by a legal member of the Government, who, in my opinion, was entitled to suggest that, so that no technical legal point might at some, subsequent date destroy either the legislation of this Parliament or, conceivably, the verdict of the people, I consider that 1 should so direct the business of this ECouse as to overcome any uncertainty in the matter. For that reason I took sucb action as would enable me to affirm that the second reading of the bill was agreed to by the requisite majority.",74
204,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"This point was raised several years, ago. I then, ascertained that it was the view of the Crown Law authorities, based on an opinion originally given, I believe, by Sir Robert Garran, that it would be wiser to ascertain the agreement of an absolute majority in respect of both the.second and third readings of bills providing for an alteration of the Constitution. I must state frankly that my own personal opinion leans in the direction of that expressed by Mr Speaker and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies), namely, that there can be only one passing of a bill. The practice which successive Attorneys-General have acted upon is to ask for a division of the House on both the second and third readings unless some point is taken that on the motion for the second-reading the general principles of a bill, were explored and that on the motion for the third reading the subject-matter of the bill was dealt with in a slightly different way. I much prefer that the practice adopted previously be not altered on this occasion. The taking of the divisions would not very much delay the passage of the bill. ' .",74
205,Mr HARRISON,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"If the requisite majority carried a motion for the second reading of a bill ancl on the third reading the requisite majority was not obtained, that would complicate the position.",74
206,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTEBATION,"In that event both Mr . Speaker and I would put the matter to a. tribunal for decision. I recognize the force of the point made by the honourable member for Wentworth. Subject to the acquiescence of the Leador of the Opposition I believe that we should not de- part from establislied practice on this occasion. As a matter of fact, I am so pleased at the majority in favour of the second reading of the bill, that I am expecting an even greater majority to support the third reading.

209,Mr FADDEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Darling Downs-Leade r of the Australia Country party) [12.57 a.m.] - I desire to move That clause 2 be left out with a view to in.. 54 sert in lieu thereof the following clause:1 "" 2. The Constitution is altered by inserting after section 1 0 5 A the following section:105B - (I . ) The Commonweaith may at 53 the wish.of the relevant producers to be ascertained in such manner, as the Parliament prescribes make agreements with the States with - respect to the production and marketing of agricultural, pastoral, horticultural, .viticultural and dairying products. (2.) Xhe Parliament may make laws for validating any such agreement made before the commencement of this section. (3.) The Parliament may make laws for the carrying out by the parties thereto of any such agreement. (4.) Any such agreement may be varied or - rescinded by the parties thereto. (5.) Every such agreement and any such variation thereof shall be binding upon the Commonwealth and the States parties thereto notwithstanding anything contained in this Constitution or the Constitution of the several States or in any law of the Parliament of the Commonwealth or of any State. (ti.) The exercise flf the powers conferred by this section shall not be affected or limited by the provisions of section ninety-two of this Constitution. "". 5 I propose this new clause because the Australian Country party, whilst agreeing whole-heartedly with the principles of organized marketing, is of opinion that the proposal to be put before the people is totally inadequate to meet the desires of the primary producers. The Government's proposal does not measure up to the fundamental requisite of collaboration ancl co-operation with the States, in view of the fact that the States have full control of the production side of primary industries and other industries likely to be affected by the Government's proposal.",75
210,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I rise to order, I submit that the amendment is out of order. The House gave leave to introduce a bill "" To alter the Constitution by empowering the Parliament to make laws providing for the organized marketing of primary products, unrestricted by section 92 of the Constitution"". The plan embodied in the amendment is entirely different; it is something analogous to a financial agreement, and, obviously, the right honourable gentleman bas copied his amendment from the Financial Agreement Act.",76
211,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Mr Riordan) The order of leave was in respect of a bill "" To alter the Constitution by empowering the Parliament to ma'ke laws providing for the organized marketing of primary p r o d u c t s As the amendment proposes the making of an agreement with-the States for that purpose, I rule that it is out of order.",76
212,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay) [1.1 a.m.] - I desire to move That, in proposed new paragraph (i.A.) after the word "" products"", the following words be inserted:-""bu t not so as to authorize any form of - socialization of the means of production thereof"". A short time ago, the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) accepted an amendmentmoved by the Leader of the Oppsition (Mr Menzies) to prevent the conscription of members of the medical and dental professions. It is equally essential to make definite provision to prevent the socialization of primary production. That is the object of my amendment, and I hope that the Attorney-General, following the earlier precedent in this respect, will accept it .",76
213,Sir EARLE PAGE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Cowper) [1.5 a.m.] - I bave an amendment which precedes that which the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) wishes to submit. I move That, in proposed new. paragraph (i.A.), the word "" primary "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:"" agricultural, pastoral, horticultural, v it i cultural and dairying "". In connection with the proposals submitted at the referendum held in 1937, extraordinary difficulty was experienced in finding a suitable definition of primary products. The advice of many eminent barristers was taken. The Attorney General (Dr Evatt) bas, on this occasion, already referred to that difficulty ancl has forecast an amendment which deals with specific oases. That will unduly limit the field to which the Parliament desires that organized marketing should apply. The definition required should be of a most general character. 'That is the object of my amendment. The amendment forecast by the Attorney-General omits reference to sucb products as meat, peanuts, maize, barley and oats ancl their final products. Although 'the marketing of these products directly concerns only two or three States', those States require a system of .organized marketing in order to enable them to deal effectively with these products.. As my amendment will achieve that purpose it should be accepted preference to the amendment forecast by the Attorney-General which is more limited. I have no objection to the latter amendment being added after that of the Minister. Provision should be made respect of the marketing of wine which is a manufactured product sold by merchants. The marketing of wine should be maintained on an orderly as is the case now under the supervision of the Australian Wine Board.",76
214,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Indi) [1.10 a.m.] - I is. obvious that the arguments submitted from this corner of the chamber during the second-reading debate have made their weight felt on the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt). He has realized the futility of attempting to write into the Constitution the proposal as first drafted, which I am sure could only bave resulted in establishing a lawyer's paradise and a producer's .madhouse. It has been nized that "" primary production "" is inrespect capable of simple definition. For that reason, it has never been defined in proposal for constitutional reform. questionably, the Attorney-General has admitted the soundness of the arguments we have advanced. In a slapdash fashion, he proposes to provide that wheat shall include flour and other wheat products.",77
215,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Tb e honourable dairying product. member must deal with the clause, aud the amendment that is now before Chair.",77
216,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am dealing with the amendment. So as to overcome the point that was made from this corner - the chamber, which could not be overcome hy argument, because it cannot be retbe futed, the attempt is to be made to define "" primary products "", by providing that the expression shall be deemed to include flour and other wheat products, butter, millet. cheese, and other milk products, dried fruit ancl other fruit products, and sugar. product.",77
217,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Without limiting the generality of the first expression: ' - Mr MCEWEN - I do not know what may be the effect of saying "" without limiting the generality. <of. the first expression"". .",77
218,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It means that we can pass the stage of milk and deal with milk in products, that we can pass the stage of dried fruits and deal with canned fruits,, as well as, probably, wine, wbicb is a fruit product, and that we can pass the stage-of wheat and deal with other wheat in products sucb as bran and pollard.",77
219,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I thank the Attorney General for his explanation. But I fear that it really serves no more than to basis reinforce my argument and my apprehension. Had be said that the correct interpretation of the clause is that it does not limit the generality of primary prot ducts, taken in the broad sense, but includes these other products, I should bave replied that the additional commodities were being' cited as examples, if in a statute use can be made of examples so presented. But the explanation makes it clear to me that this is the total number of commodities that is to be recognized as primary products, having passed beyond their first stage of wheat, milk or recogfruit. Why should provision be made in of fruit and not of vegetables, why in respect of-butter and not margarine? a The butter industry cannot be stabilized Ununless margarine be controlled.",77
220,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Whic h of the phrases in the amendment of the right honourable member for Cowper covers margarine? I do not think it is an agricultural, pastoral, horticultural, viticultural, or",77
221,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not confining the myself to the amendment, nor am I obliged to do so. I am pointing out that neither the clause nor the amendment which, the Attorney-Generalintends to of submit goes any distance towards putting the proposal in a safe, legal form. For benefit of honourable members who are not engaged in primary production, I shall mention a few commodities that are not covered. Take, for example, broom",77
222,Mr LEMMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is a primary,77
223,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is it a primary pro- duct when it is a broom? Are the producers not to bave the opportunity to sell it in an advanced form ?' Tobacco has to - be processed; Meat is one of the greatest primary products in Australia, but a great deal of it is sold in processed form Why is it left untouched ? We deal with wheat, but not with maize. There is maize flour in the form of maize starch and maizena; it is analagous to wheat flour. An organized' marketing scheme controlled by the growers, in respect of potatoes, I remind the honourable member  the production of potato flour, and of power alcohol. There cannot be producer control of organized marketing in a form that will be worth anything to the producers, .unless it is possible for tbem to go past the first stage. One of the greatest crops in the world today is that of the soya bean. We know of the multitude of forms in which the soya bean emerges after the initial process. rJo provision is being made for the handlingof that product; yet the Government is sending men to America at great expense to investigate the possibility of introducing its production on a big scale in Australia. Then there is the humble peanut, which our friend. from _ Maranoa (Mr. Adermann) handles. As chairman of the Queensland Peanut Board, be is obliged tc handle the peanut not only in its raw form but also when it is roasted ancl salted, and when it takes the form of peanut oil and peanut butter. The scope for the expansion of the poultry industry in this country is prodigious. In America, the organized poultry industry is six times, as big as the Australian wool industry; yet under this proposal there could not be organized control of the marketing of poultry. Tbat applies also to fish and timber. It is absolutely impossible to deal adequately with this matter by stipulating a category of products. They could be stipulated in legislation, because legislation could be amended-without very great difficulty or intolerable delay. There might be the most comprehensive list of commodities, and it might later be found that fish had not been included. A referendum could not be held to make provision for it. The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) reminds me of pearlshell and pearls. Had the Attorney General adhered to his original view that "" primary products"" is a description capable of interpretation, my - opinion would not be worth anything against his, mine being merely that of a layman. But be has confessed that it is not capable of adequate and _ practical interpretation, and in a last-minute amendment is seeking to correct the position by including flour, butter, dried fruit and sugar. The issue now requires legal clarification. I am not capable of contributing to that. But I can recognize that if this proposal is passed in an ineffective form, it will not serve the. purpose that is sought to be served on behalfof the primary producers. It will certainly create a paradise for lawyers.",77
224,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Barton--Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs) ,[1.20 a.m.] - A good deal of discussion took place during the second-reading debate about the desirability of inserting a definition in order to make it clear that the term "" primary products"" was not too limited in its scope. Therefore, I propose to move later for the insertion of the following new sub-section:(1 A.) Without in. amy way limiting the generality of the expression "" p r i m a r y products "" in paragraph. (IA ) of sub-section (1) of this section, that expression shall be deemed to include flour and other wheat products, butter, cheese and other milk products, dried' f r u it and other f r u it products, and sugar. The term "" primary products"" has the meaning that would be given to it by the courts, considering the common use of the phrase in Australia. The courts migbt> refer to contemporary newspapers,' including the journal of the Australian Country party. If an attempt were made to specify all primiary products 1 do not know bow long the list might be, and I do not desire every primary product to be mentioned in the Constitution. The proposed amendment sets out that without in any way limiting the generality of the expression ""primary products"", it should be deemed to include flour and other wheat products. Obviously it would also include wheat.",78
225,Sir EAHLE PAGE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Tba t would include breakfast foods.,78
226,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall deal with that point presently. The proposed amendment goes on to mention the inclusion of "" butter, cheese and other milk products, dried fruit and other f r u it products, and sugar Products-- such as wheat, wool, skins, chickens, snails, and everything else that could be called a primary product are all covered by the definition. Wlieat products other than flour include bran, breakfast foods, macaroni, pollard, rice substitutes, semolina, spaghetti, and wheat-meal. M i l k products include dried .and powdered milk, infants' and invalids' foods essentially of . milk, sweetened full cream milk, unsweetened milk, and skimmed milk. F r u it products include canned apples, apricots, berry fruits, peaches, pears, pineapples and prunes, and also jams and marmalade, f r u it pulp, f r u it juices, f r u it salads and wines. Dried tree f r u it s include dried apples, apricots, peaches, pears and prunes, whilst dried vine fruit s include dried currants sultanas and lexias. Under the proposed definition I have included everything that could be called a primary product. The amendment submitted by the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) is too narrow. My only fear is that my proposed amendment would widen the definition of "" p r i m a r y products "" too much.",78
227,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would canned meat be included ?,79
228,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I would not say that. Are we to have organized marketing for all canned products?,79
229,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I hope that we shall have in respect of canned meat,79
230,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We should try to keep as near as possible to primary products.,79
231,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What about the processed forms of the various probers ducts enumerated?,79
232,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They appear to have been covered by my proposed amendment. I shall consider the point raised by honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Bernard Corser), but I ask the committee not to accept the amendment submitted by the right honourable member f Cowper.",79
233,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Barker) [1.29 a.m.] - The Attorney-General (D Evatt) has made a great feature of the . products of trees and vines, whether a canned or a dried condition. What is to be done about eucalyptus? It the product of a tree, but the tree does not produce f r u it . Eucalyptus is disco-operatively tilled on Kangaroo Island by men workmary ing co-operative enterprises, and it is - important constituent of. certain*, cines. These men may require rights under this bill. Under State law, the whole of Kangaroo Island is set apart for the culture of the black It a l i a n bee, and there is an important industry there sharps, for the production of queen bees, which are despatched by air mail to all parts of Australia. Is that to. be classified as a primary or a secondary industry? The bees are not meat or f r u it , but they play an important part in an important in dustry. Without leaving Kangaroo Island, we come to another industry, the productiono f yacca gum, which is a constituent of certain dyes, and is also the base for a high explosive. In another part of my electorate chicory is produced, and two mills are engaged in processing it. South Australia also produces liquorice, which is used in the making of sweets. This commodity is not the product of a tree or a vine. In fact, it is necessary to dig down into the earth for a distance of two feet to harvest the crop. Ginger is another product of South Australia, and it is also necessary to define' the place of buffalo hides and pearl shell, to say nothing of pearls themselves. These commodities should be specified as either primary or secondary products.  - There has been an attempt by the Opposition to befog the issue before the committee-indeed , to burlesque it . It is incomprehensible that honourable memopposite who represent country constituencies should have any doubt in their minds as to what is meant by "" primary products"". Neither can any intelligent the person doubt that the judiciary would . have any difficulty in deciding what the term means. For instance, no one would deny that wheat, meat, chicory, potatoes o r and livestock are primary products. There may be an element of doubt regarding such products as pollard, bran, r . processed meats and processed fruits, & c , but even if those points are left uni n decided, the general purpose of the bill will still be achieved. This is to place is in the hands of the primary producers an instrument which will enable them to control and market p r i products before they are processed. an Once that is achieved, they will be in a mediposition, with the help of legislation passed by this Parliament, to determine what shall happen to the product after it leaves their hands. For instance, the potato-growers can decide whether they will, or will not, supply glucose factories. They can say to the manufacturers that they must sell the processed article at a certain price, or supplies of potatoes will be cut off. In addition, the producers can set up processing works of their own, and they can always determine for themselves the conditions under which they shall sell products, whether it be livestock or any other, to the processing works. If the producers are able effectively to control the processing of their commodity from the tree or the soil until it is sold, they will be able to control also its disposal after sale. Here is nn example: In Victoria and New South Wales, there are well-organized r>gg-marketing boards operating under State legislation. In Victoria, and probably New South Wales also, the organization is so efficient that the board can determine how the eggs shall be processed, what agent shall handle them, and the price at which they shall be sold to the public. Tbey are not worried about the definition of "" primary products "". Obviously, an egg is a primary product. Once the producers of eggs have control oE the marketing of eggs, the control of processed eggs is a simple matter. As it is clear that the fears that have been expressed are without foundation, I ask the committee to accept the Minister's amendment.",79
234,Sir EARLE PAGE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Cowper) [1.41 a.m.] - It must not be forgotten that most of the organized marketing of Australian primary products is handled' by State or co-operative organizations. One of the objections to this' bill is that it does not contain provisions to protect and retain those organizations. The honourable  lauded their efficiency, but under the system suggested in this measure there is nothing to protect tbem. For that reason. I am sorry that the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt), wbo was prepared to extend the scope of the previous measure of social services, is not prepared to adopt a similar attitude towards this bill for organized matTxeting. I am convinced tbia't if we could have' a purely co-operative system of marketing much of the difficulty in connection with the definition of "" primary products"" would disappear. I desire to see organized marketing included in the constitutional powers of the'Commonwealth as early as possible in order to overcome - the difficulties caused by section 92 of the ' Constitution. I , therefore, ask the Attorney-General, if be ""desires the .passage of this legislation, to bave regard to what took place when this question was submitted to the people on a previous occasion. It will be remembered that, despite the fact that in this Parliament there was substantial support of the then Government's proposal by the Labour party only about ten or twelve electorates throughout the Commonwealth gave a "" Yes"" vote. .Notwithstanding that the present Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Forde) and the then Labour Premier of Queensland advocated a "" Yes "" vote, the only Queensland electorate which accepted their advice was Wide Bay. I urge the Attorney-General to take steps to satisfy the primary producers that under the proposals submitted to tbem they will get something of real value. ' If they could be convinced on that point, the consumers of Australia might be persuaded to support the alteration. No one will question that bides are a primary product; but, when processed, bides become leather, and leather is made into various articles. Where does the bide cease to be a primary product? 1 believe that, with greater co-operation between Commonwealth and State governments and cooperative bodies, most of the problems which now face us would be solved without having to define matters too precisely. We should endeavour to give to the primary producers what they desire in this connection-.",80
235,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Barton-Attorney-Genera l and Minister for External Affairs) [1.46 a.m.] - Tb e committee must have been impressed by the speech of the honourable member for Ballarat . (Mr. Pollard), who said that those wbo control the marketing of a primary product in its early stages of production can readily gain control of it at the next and succeeding stages. The honourable member's illustrations were clear and effective. In . the definition' which I propose, the normal meaning of the term "" primary products "" will apply, with the wide interpretation given by the honourable member for Balthe larat. In addition, it will be extended flour and other wheat products; butter, cheese, and other milk products; dried cluded in the definition? fruit and other fruit products; and sugar. Having consulted - with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully), I am also prepared-to add meat and meat products, although I had always thought that meat was a primary product. Even with those extensions of the normal meanmodity ing of the term "" primary products"" there will be some border-line cases; I am confident that, if this Parliament has power to organize the .marketing of primary products, there vvill be no in their marketing which cannot be handled effectively. I am obliged to mem- - Seed bers of the Australian Country party for their suggestions, and I ask them to further accept what I bave offered as an earnest of my desire to solve a difficult problem.",80
236,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"""Would the definition as extended include honey?",81
237,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Hone y is the most priinary of-primary products.,81
238,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Would it inbranches clude salt, which is a most important primary product of my electorate?",81
239,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable memthe ber for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), with his special knowledge of salt, says that it is a primary product, I am pared to accept his definition, and I sure that any court would take a similar view.",81
240,Mr FADDEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Darling Downs-Leade r ought of the Australian Country party) [1.50 a.m.] - Tb e way in which the Attorneyhonorable G-eneral (Dr Evatt) has modified previous., ambiguous definition of ""primary products"" gives iis reason to operating' bave a careful look at his proposal order that we may determine what gained primary products are included or are - deemed to be included in the definition now proposed and assess its total inadefunctions quacy. The right honourable gentleman has enlarged in his own way on the "" various aspects of processing of primary products. He bas added to the list meat and meat products, but what of maize and ing, maize products, peanuts 'and peanut prothat ducts, fish and sea shells? As honourable members know the fishing industry the shell industry are very important industries in north Queensland. I suppose fishing industry presents greater to potentialities for expansion than do many primary industries. Is fish to be inBefore the Japanese war the gathering of trochus shell, beche-de-mer and pearl shell .was most important. It is obvious that some protection must be given to those products, and other products that have hitherto been controlled by various comboards. As a Queenslander, I can speak with considerable knowledge but about. these commodity boards, which have been long' established as State instrumentalities with producer-control, stage for the purpose of orderly intrastate marketing. We bave the Canary Board, the Arrowroot Board and the Egg Producers' Council. Nothing is said about eggs and egg products. The one goes through the list, the more one realizes the total inadequacy and ambiguity of this proposal. It is all very well to say that the High Court will define what is a primary product and . what is a processed primary product or a by-product, but why should the various of primary industry have to go to the High Court for an adequate and proper safeguarding definition. This is place where legislation should be made thoroughly clear, but I submit that the proposal before the committee is far from preclear. The amendment proposed by the am Attorney-General makes confusion more confounding. Its ambiguity leaves too much open to doubt. For that reason I - submit --that the Attorney-General to give further consideration to the amendment submitted by - the member for Cowper (Sir Earle the Page). The various commodity boards in the States have to be taken into consideration and regard bas to be in paid to the knowledge that has been by virtue of collaboration between the States and the"" Commonwealth. If the Government proposes to usurp all the of' the State instrumentalities and to broaden thedefinition . of marketing "" to embrace "" production "",' there will be chaos. The Australian Country party stands for orderly marketbut not the sort of orderly marketing will result from the totally inadequate and improper definition proposed and by the Attorney-General.",81
241,Mr SCULLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gwydir-Minister for Commerce and Agriculture) [1.54 a.m.]. - This matter.must be approached in a common-sense way. The Government and the primary producers themselves are chiefly concerned with the basic primary industries. One could go on enumerating indefinitely the number of primary products that could be defined, and even then everything that could come within the definition would not be included. I think it is sufficient to define the basic primary industries as suggested by the Attorney-General. Tbat is the way in. which I look at the matter as the Minister charged with the responsibility of administering the marketing of primary products.",82
242,Mr TURNBULL,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wimmera) [1.56 a.m.] - I agree with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) that Ave could spend a lot of time defining "" primary products"" without ever completing the list. I am satisfied with what has been suggested in the comprehensive list proposed by the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt). He does not wish to exclude any kind of primary product, if it can be proved that it is a primary product. If an issue were made of the inclusion of any particular product, it would have to be determined in any case by the High Court. I do not think anything can be gained by prolonging this discussion. 1 believe that the definition suggested by the Attorney-General is satisfactory and that no primary product would be excluded if it could be proved to be a primary product.",82
243,Mr BREEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Calare) [1.58 a.m.] - In an attempt toteach an eminent lawyer his business the bushlawyers in this chamber are clouding instead of clearing the issue. The Attorney-General (Dr - Evatt) used the term "" primary products'"", but, ih an attempt to define the meaning of ""primary products'^ honourable members opposite haveexcluded from the definition one of the principal primary products, meat and meat products-. Mutton and lamb possibly come under the term "" pastoral industry but beef does not. I cite as' my authority that statement thereference in the Year B'ooJc to pastoral production "". In that publication the terminology of the word "" pastoral "" is regarded as not including [44] beef, but the shepherding of sheep, wool production and so on. It can be taken, therefore, that the term "" pastoral"" is restricted to the raising of sheep, wool production .and activities in connection therewith. One of the principal primary products that this country bas to consider in the post-war period is beef. The Attorney-General has forecast that in an amendment he proposes to move at a later stage he will include meat and meat products in the term "" primary products "". I agree with the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) that the term "" primary products"" is sufficiently wide to cover those products wbicb this Parliament will find it necessary to deal with whenit sets about devising schemes for the organized marr keting of such products. Amendment negatived.",82
244,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay) [2.1 a.m.].:- I move That, in proposed new paragraph (i.A.), after the word "" products"" the following words beinserted:-""hu t not so as to authorize any form of socialization of the means of production thereof"". An amendment expressing a similar intention in almost the same terms was accepted by the Government in respect of the other two Constitution Alteration bills. I suggest to the Attorney-General that if this amendment be inserted in the bill he will have' no trouble in having it accepted by the people. No one is more anxious than I am to see tbese marketing proposals carried and the obstacle constituted by section 92 of the Constitution removed.",82
245,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Barton - Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs) [2.3 a.m.] - The committee has taken the bill to the stage where the Commonwealth Parliament will have power to make laws providing for the organized marketing of primary products. The honourable member for Wide Bay ("" Mr Bernard Corser) agrees that the Commonwealth should have power to make laws for the organized marketing of primary products, but he adds a condition which reads, "" but not so for as to authorize any form of socialization "". Socialization of what ? Of the means of production thereof? The means of production of primary products constitute the land', the fertilizer, and the instruments of tillage; they are the thing3 with which the products are produced, and therefore to say we should have power over organized marketing of primary products but not over the means of production thereof introduces a completely foreign and unrelated topic. The honourable member's amendment has nothing to do with the marketing of primary products and therefore cannot be accepted.",82
246,Mr BOWDEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gippsland) [2.5 a.m.]. - I support the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) and am unable to accept the Attorney-General's dictum that it has no application to the subject matter of the bill. Apparently, a different attitude is to be taken in respect of this proposed amendment from that taken on the other two bills in wbicb provisos on somewhat similar lines were inserted. Why is this distinction drawn? If it is merely a matter of terminology, I am sure the honourable member for Wide Bay will consent to an alteration of his proposed amendment to conform with what the Attorney-General believes might be the correct verbiage. Honourable members opposite ask "" What is the meaning of the term ' socialization of the means of production ' ? "". If anybody should know what that means, honourable members opposite who have placed it as the first - plank in the platform of the party which they represent in this chamber should know. If . it has no meaning to tbem, it has no meaning at all. I would prefer to see the wording of the proposed amendment altered to read, "" but not so as to involve any control of production"". It is held by many authorities that marketing cannot be successfully organized without control of production. The - Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr 'Scully) found during the war that this was necessary to the - success of marketing schemes. I want to ensure that the primary producer shall not be conscripted. I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay that if anything will contribute totbe defeat of this posal it will be a fear among the people that primary producers will be conScripted for the production of primary products. I wisb to be in a position to tell the primary producers in my electorate that that is not contemplated.  - The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) has no application whatever to the bill now before us. In the first place there can be no primary production without the land on which to produce it ; in the second place, except in certain circumstances, no power is given to the Commonwealth Parliament or to the Government to resume or own land. If the Government does not own land how can it socialize the means of production?",83
247,Sir EARLE PAGE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Has the honourable member not read the Lands Acquisition Act?  gentleman knows quite well that. under the Constitution the Government may resume land only for the purposes of the Postal Department or the Defence Department, but for no other purposes. The sovereign power over land is vested entirely in the respective State governments, except for those specific purposes. The honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) is clever at endeavouring to side-track people, but his tactics do not succeed with me. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden)- said that members of the Australian Country party would be in a happy position if the Government accepted this amendment, because they would be able to assure their farmersupporters and potential supporters, if any, that the amendment would prevent, any possible danger of socialization. Whether or not the amendment is accepted, members of the Australian Country partywill tell their constituents that if they vote for the Labour party their industries will be socialized. Mr BovvDEir - What is the honourable member's objection to the amendment? .  not ashamed of its socialistic objective, and what is more, we bave never been ashamed of it. I do not see any reason pro- why the electors, when.they are ready to accept socialization, even the organized marketing of primary products, should not have the right to do so under the Constitution.' That is a matter not for this Government or the Australian Country party but for the people themselves to determine. The people of Great Britain, New Zealand, and South Africa have that right; only in this fair land are the people denied it. Members of the Australian Country party and their cohorts of the Liberal party formed an alliance in ' Sydney last week, and no doubt that alliance is one of the reasons for the Opposition's violent antagonism to this bill. The Government's proposals give power to the primary producers; they will possess even greater power if they choose socialization in order to defeat; the merchants, dealers and vested interests which will vigorously support members of the Opposition at the forthcoming election. But all the fervour which honourable members opposite displayed on previous occasions in favour of allowing primary producers complete freedom, to choose how they shall market their primary products, has disappeared. When T recall the earlier history of the Opposition parties, I reflect almost sadly upon their present fate. I am satisfied that the amendment has no application whatever.",83
248,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay) [2.14 a.m.] - The honourable member for  contradictory statements wbicb have not helped the position. He declared that the Government's proposals could not effect the socialization of the means of production because the States owned the land? He uttered a good deal of nonsense, because he knows that the policy of the Labour party includes the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. If he were honest with the farmers and the Attorney General (Dr Evatt), who asked him to speak, he would admit that be opposes the amendment because he is pledged to support the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. This amendment, will show whether the Government is preparedby adopting thif safeguard, to dispel the fear of farmers that primary production may be socialized. Dr. EVATT '(Barton - AttorneyWe General and Minister for External Affairs) [2.15 a.m.] - Tb e honourable at the point of distribution, but member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) entitled to an explanation of the matters which be raised. He fears that this power involves a power to control production. It does nothing of the kind. It simply gives to the Commonwealth Parliament power to organize the marketing of commodities after they bave been produced. Therefore, there will be no possibility of control at the point of production. That makes the amendment absolutely inapplicable to this situation. It is perfectly true that after the goods are produced, the power begins to operate in respect of them, and that enables the .producers or the Government, through a scheme of producer-control or producer plus government control, to organize collectively the , marketing of primary products. The pooling of primary products and selling them as a group through the Government or the producers' body to' the best advantage, is an example. That, in one sense, is an instance of socialization not of the means of production, but of the method of distribution. That is a part of the policy of the Australian Country party, the members of which believe in certain forms of socialization ",84
249,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Tba t is co-operation.,84
250,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , it is not merely co-operation. It involves direct Government legislative authority to do it. That is a particular aspect of the nationalization or socialization of the means of distribution in relation to one product. That is exactly what it is. Tbat is a general disquisition; - it finds a good illustration in the pools conducted in Queensland, sucb as the peanut pool. The product - is put into the pool, and the Government sells it, gets the cheque for it and distributes the money among the growers, interfering at every stage with the ordinary right of the individual to sell according to his own desires.",84
251,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Government of Queensland does not sell the peanuts.,84
252,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Tb e board consists of the representatives of the growers and of the Government. I have studied that particular act. It is completely destructive of the inalienable right of a producer to market his own goods. cannot reconcile that with complete freedom. It is a form of socialization 1 is that is what organized marketing is. Organized marketing is a part, of the policy of the Australian Country party. Tlio honourable 'member for Gippsland will be satisfied that this power does not involve control of production. It comes into existence only after the product itself has come into being. Therefore, I ask the committee to reject the amendment. Question putThat the words proposed to be inserted (Mr. BKKKARD CORSER'S amendment) be so inserted. The committee divided. (THE CHAIRMAN - MR .

Therefore, I take this opportunity to protest against the action of the Government in attempting to write such a proposal into the Constitution. A statute is comparatively easy to amend, but it is notoriously difficult to alter the Constitution, because such alteration can only be effected after, the proposal in question bas become a great public issue. As this proposal is drafted in ambiguous language, or language calculated to invite challenge, it is certain to result in a PAIRS. number of challenges which we know are extraordinarily expensive to engage in . I believe that towards the conclusion of the debate in committee, the Attorney General (Dr E v at t ) was endeavouring to meet the objections raised'by honourable members on this side with respect to interpretation.",85
255,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order 1 The honourable member must not refer to anything that happened in committee.,85
256,Mr MCEWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Nevertheless , I pay that tribute to the Attorney-General. Either the amendments were hot neceshave sary, in which event they are purposethe less; or, if necessary, they are quite adequate.

Sir EABL E PAGE (Cowper) (2,31 :i..MI.J - I desire to make my position quite clear. I a.m prepared to assist passage of this measure through the Parliament to-night, because I believe that the people should be privileged either accept or reject i.t.

The trend of the debate since the introduction of the bill provides sufficient evidence, if sucb were needed of the confused form in wbicb ihe. measure will leave this House, and be placed before the people at a referendum. Whilst we believe in orderly marketing, and urge the adoption of all means to bring it about, we are of the opinion that the best means available not been adopted in order to place matter properly and adequately beinfore the people.

263,Mr FADDEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When was it included, and why?",86
264,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I appeal for support to those members of the Australian Country party who have shown themselves really interested in a clear definition. We know who they are. There will be no challenge in the courts of this country, because the possibility of one has been excluded by the definition of "" primary products"". Had we not done as much as we have done, there might have been the possibility of that eventuality occurring. The definition of "" primary products "" covers the whole field, including doubtful cases. It will be for the Parliament to detei-mine whether it will pass a law for the orderly marketing of any commodity embraced by the definition. I am pleased that the leading members"" of the .Australian Country party intend to support the third reading of the bill. That surely implies that they believe that the power to control organized marketing in the wide field embraced by primary production should reside in this Parliament irrespective of the provisions of section 92 of the Constitution. They should be consistent, and support the proposal in their electorates. Question putThat the bill be now read a third time. The House divided. (ME . 'SPEAKER-HON . J. S. ROSEVEAB,) Ayes .. .. ..

272,Mr EROST,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"T be answers to the honourable member's question is as f o l l o w s : Yes,. Apart from the payment of war and service pensions under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act and the provision of medical treatment, including the supply of artificial limbs, surgical aids and appliances for incapacitated members of the forces, the Repatriation Commission is the prescribed authority for dealing with the following benefits under the Re-establishment and Employment Act 1945:(1) Business re-establishment loans to certain classes of discharged members of the Forces and widows of deceased members.

(2) Medical benefits, similar to those provided through the Friendly Societies, to widows and children of deceased members and widowed mothers of deceased unmarried members. (3) Grants towards funeral expenses of members who die after discharge as the result of war service or in a Repatriation institution; also in cases where a member's death is not due to war service but he dies in indigent circumstances. Grants may also be made in cases of widows, children and certain other dependants of deceased members who die in indigent circumstances. The commission is also responsible for the training and/or placement of blinded and other seriously incapacitated members who are unable to resume their pre-war occupations either with or without training by normal methods. The Ministry of Post-War Reconstruction is largely a planning and co-ordinating body, and the Repatriation Commission is represented at both Commonwealth and State levels on the various committees (comprising such bodies as the services, and the Departments of Post-war Reconstruction, Labour and National Service, Commonwealth Employment Service and Repatriation) which deal with the various phases of demobilization and rc-cstablishment of members of the forces. Under the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act pensions are paid to or in respect of members of the Mercantile Marine incapacitated or deceased in consequence of war injury, and the commission also administers the National Security (Wages of Seamen Detained by the Enemy) Regulations, which provide for the continuance of wages of mariners during captivity by the enemy. Other niatters administered are as follow:(I.) National Security (Patriotic Funds) Regulations and National Security (War Contributions) Regulations, providing for the general control of such funds and contributions. (2) Various schemes of compensation in respect of the following:-Member s of the forces not within the scope of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Ast; Commonwealth employees and representatives of philanthropic bodies attached to the forces in the field; civil aviation personnel operating in association with the forces: mariners not within the scope of the Seamen's War Pension and Allowances Act. Tho comniission acts as agent for the United Kingdom,' New Zealand and Canada in the payment of pension and provision of medical treatment and certain other benefits to members of the other country's Forces resident in Australia.

What is the qualification and amount of pension for a de facto wife? fl. How many pensions are being paid to de facto wives?",89
273,Mr EROST,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w s : 1. In the case of a widowed mother of a deceased unmarried male member, who became widowed cither prior to or within three years of the death of the member, the rate of pension varies from £2 10s. a fortnight to £G '1.0s. a fortnight according to the rate of pay of the member at the time of his death. No means test is applied to such pensions. In the case of other parents the pension varies in accordance with the circumstances of the parent and at present cannot exceed £4 10s. a fortnight. 2. A parent - cannot be granted pension at such rate as will make his or her income exceed £4 10s. a fortnight, and a parent who has property, apart from the home in which he resides, to the value of over £400 'is not eligible. 3.

(2.)' Any such pension may be allowed to any such person under this provision as well as to the widow of any member of the forces. 6. 252. INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS : SPAIN.",90
274,Dr EVATT,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Mr Archie Cameron has asked me the following questions:1. What is the attitude of the Commonwealth Government towards the Government of Spain ? 2.

What attitude, if any, was adopted by the Commonwealth Government on each of these occasions? The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Australian Government has no diplomatic .relationship with, the Government of Spain. It supports the view stated in the resolution regarding Spain adopted by the United Nations Assembly on the Oth February, 1940. The resolution recalls(a) The resolution of the San Francisco Conference according to which paragraph 2 of Article 4 of Chapiter I I of the United Nations Charter "" cannot apply to States where regimes have been installed wit h the help of armed forces of countries which have fought against the United Nations so long as these regimes are in power."" (ft) The decision made at the Potsdam - Conference not to support the request for admission to the United Nations of the present Spanish. 'Government because of the nature of its origin and subsequent record. The Assembly recommended that the United Nations should act in accordance with the letter and spirit of these statements ((a ) and 1 (6) above) in the conduct of their future relations wi.th Spain. 2 and 3. The Australian. Government has kept itself informed regarding the situation in Spain and the attitude of other Governments to the question generally.

Puni.ic SERVICE: PEHMAJ - KNT APPOINT fats, JTBST OF TliMPOKAHY OTFICERS .",95
297,Mr CHIP,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"LEY - On the 26th March, this the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) referred to the repeal of l?npna ? section 84(9) (c) of the Commonwealth Public Service Act and asked a question as to whether the Prime Minister would have the situation examined with a view to exempting from the necessity to pass li-iil'ion an examination before qualifying permanent appointments those returned members soldiers who, before enlisting, had two years' temporary service. Prior to the Bill operation of the Re-establishment and Employment Aet 1945 there was proviiir-r-nrrlnnre sion in section S4 (9) (c) of the Commonwealth Public Service Act giving an order of preference for appointment. This included returned soldiers who had been temporarily employed continuously for not less than two years. This provision did'not confer a right to appointment, and many more employees completed the prescribed period of temporary work than could be absorbed into the permanent, staff. Under the provision referred to, the order of priority for permanent appointment was based on the fortuitous circumstance of temporary employment and did not operate fairly. It gave preference to a man who happened to be on the spotand available for temporary work as against another not at the time available for a temporary job, but anxious to secure n permanent appointment and possibly much better qualified than the one who secured the priority. The provision referred to was deleted from the Public. Service Act hy thp Re-establishment nnd Employment Act, which requires that consideration be given to the length, locality and. nature of the war service of applicants for permanent appointment. The position therefore is that, in making permanent appointments tn the Commonwealth Service, the preference provisions of the Be-establishment and Employment Act must apply.
