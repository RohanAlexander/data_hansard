21,Mr WILKIE,BILLS," Officials maladministration or incompetence, and communities such outspokenness. In other words, so-called administration which needs to be allowed, whistle need to know they are doing the right reprisals. In essence, I think this bill does achieve that. It has been a very long road to get Commonwealth level, comprehensive public recommended by the Liberal chaired Senate Whistleblowing, in 1994. But it had always been up and try to progress real reform. Bills were and then by the Democrats in 2002 and in 2007. Regrettably though these were all false starts, Rudd as Prime Minister, with Senator John prospect genuinely hardened of us finally enacted. It was even more of a prospect reinforced in 2009 by the parliamentary committee Mark Dreyfus. That committee provided Commonwealth legislation. The 2010 federal election offered more good agreements with the Greens, along with the promote open and accountable government and the parliament. This bill, if enacted by the parliament, finally aspirations of Liberal, Greens and Democrats the previous Labor government. It will anticorruption action plan. But, most importantly, in this country. I am hopeful the opposition will support politics actually has a reasonable record in this in New South Wales in 1994, the Liberal and Liberal government in Western Australia reforms in those jurisdictions at that time, all bill will have the support of the whole Having said that, nothing is perfect and others for a number of amendments to be made, two potential amendments which remain unaddressed Attorney-General, who has joined us, and make two important amendments, which I know a framework for integrity and disclosure, with must have the right to disclose misconduct, must have the protection afforded by whistleblowing is an important check on public even encouraged. Those that would blow the thing and will ultimately be protected from to here on this very important issue. At the interest disclosure legislation was first Select Committee on Public Interest left to the minor parties to roll their sleeves introduced unsuccessfully by the Greens in 1993 and it was not until the election of Kevin Faulkner as Special Minister of State, that the seeing Commonwealth whistleblower legislation when the Prime Minister's 2007 commitment was chaired by the now Attorney-General, a detailed and bipartisan blueprint for news, this time in the Gillard government's members for Lyne and New England and me, to to improve the processes and the integrity of will get the job done. It will realise the senators and deliver on the promises of this and also deliver on our G20 commitment to the it will genuinely strengthen public integrity the government's bill. The conservative side of regard. In fact, it was the Liberal government National parties in Queensland in 2006 and the in 2010 which drove important whistleblowing of which gives me heart and confidence that this parliament and indeed all of the crossbench. this sure is not perfect. I have campaigned with many of which have been. I would single out and take this opportunity to speak to the one final plea that the government consider the Attorney-General is already aware of. Compensation for detriment caused by whistleblowers should be included, rather direct reprisals, which I understand the bill General to do what he can to put the power others have asked him this. It is something I believe the bill as it stands is deficient these publicly, in this place and with the Attorney-General. excludes the case of wrongdoing by members why this cannot apply to all public officials, community that members of parliament and should have been included in this bill and so is regrettable that they are not. It is a reasonable members of parliament be open to public Something close my heart is that the bill It is regrettable they have been carved out. been possible to craft this bill in a way that wrongdoing by intelligence officials. I am I was an intelligence official and spoke up about that in a way that did not disclose any sensitive country or any other country at risk. I lament the fact that this bill does not remind people, Allan Kessing was the customs 2003, wrote a very important report on security was obviously sensitive material-to the media the leak in 2007. It is something, I understand, Allan Kessing acted in the public interest by trying Sydney Airport. In my opinion, he is a good this public interest disclosure bill provides no protection back then if it had been in place. This is for at least two reasons. One, he As I have already described, intelligence material out from the protection of this bill. Second-arguably-there This is a provision in the bill where someone danger to people. I disagree, but it could be life. So there are two reasons for Nor would it pass the Andrew Wilkie test. into public life a little over a decade ago when, publicly about what I saw as the misconduct that the Prime Minister and senior ministers an unwarranted war. This bill would not have protected me at official discussing intelligence matters. I Prime Minister and ministers. I think two of institutional failures to support and protect than simply the inclusion of compensation for currently allows. I would ask the Attorneyof the Ombudsman beyond doubt, and I know we discussed by telephone only today. in a number of other ways and I have discussed It is regrettable that the bill of parliament and ministers. I do not understand because it is certainly the expectation of the ministers should not be beyond scrutiny. They too should the staff of members of parliament. It public expectation that not only should scrutiny but also their staff should be. should include intelligence officials and material. I do not think that was necessary. It would have would have allowed for the careful disclosure of thinking of my own experience a decade ago when what I saw as a wrongdoing. I was able to do information or put the national security of this pass what I call the Allan Kessing test. Just to official working at Sydney Airport who, in at the airport. That material was leaked-it in 2005, and Allan Kessing was convicted of he denies to this day. There is no doubt that to shine a light on shortfalls in security at man who was acting in the public interest. But him no protection, and it would have provided him was convicted of disclosing intelligence material. and intelligence officials have been carved was no imminent threat to life. can go directly to the media if there is imminent argued that there was not an imminent threat to it failing the Allan Kessing test. I came to public prominence and was propelled a week before the invasion Iraq, I spoke out of the Howard government and, in particular, were misusing intelligence information to justify the time because, again, I was an intelligence was also making a complaint publicly against the the most high-profile whistleblower episodes in recent years involved Alan Kessing and Andrew provided no protection to those two men. Having said all of that, we have travelled something which is substantially a good piece finally getting us to this point. It has been first steps in this place. In particular, I would this to be taken as a criticism of his predecessor, this seemed to be moving dreadfully slowly done, it was seriously deficient. The Attorney-General, process, and I think he personally deserves responsible for getting us over the line, hopefully, shortfalls in your bill, Attorney-General! I would also like to single out Dr AJ University. Dr Brown has helped a number legislation or their public interest disclosure cannot think of any other person who has integrity of public administration in this disclosure of wrongdoing goes. I want to record stage and we would not have a bill in the shape work he has done-not just with this bill but similar matter. That bill, unfortunately, will benchmark or a test for the government's bill government to see these reforms through. him. This is a significant day for me personally. whistleblowing episode. It was something money, and it was not easy. But of course my punch to be standing here in the parliament legislation through. For me this is a good speaking for thousands of whistleblowers in tough place to be a whistleblower. Most whistleblowers and little media attention. They lose their money. Some lose their minds and some even You would think that in a country such as a bit more disrespectful of authority and a power and truth to authority. Remarkably, down by the community. Maybe they are seen their mates and not being team players. I do which to be a whistleblower. That is one of need to empower people in public administration to speak up when they see maladministration do, not drag them down. We should give them should celebrate their achievement in the community. Wilkie. In both cases, this bill would have a very long road and finally got there with of legislation. I applaud the government for a long time-nearly 20 years-since we took the like to thank the Attorney-General. I do not want but there was a time in this parliament where and, from what I knew of the work that was being Mark Dreyfus, has turbocharged this great credit for that. He is ultimately very much at this last-minute-notwithstanding the Brown, Professor of Public Law at Griffith of jurisdictions with their whistleblower legislation. I would go so far as to say that I done so much single-handedly to enhance the country, in particular as far as public interest to show that we would not have got to this it is in if it were not for Dr Brown and the also with helping to draft my own bill on a not be realised, but I think it has provided a and it has helped to add to the pressure on the That was very much Dr Brown's work, so good on I was propelled into the public spotlight over a that cost me my job, many friends and a lot of story has a happy ending, and I am as proud as talking about finally getting whistleblower day, but I am not just speaking for myself; I am this country. Regrettably, Australia is a very in Australia get little public attention job, they lose their families and they lose their lose their lives or take their own life. ours, built on the foundations it is, we would be bit more admiring of people who speak truth to we are not, and many whistleblowers are dragged as dobbers; maybe they are seen as dobbing on not know what it is, but it is a tough country in the reasons we need this sort of legislation.

The fairest thing would have been the individual concerns. I do not believe believe they should have had the opportunity to do that. In the interests of certainty and in recognition where we are today, we have taken the responsible spoken with all the MPs and senators with interests were some concerns from their constituents, Australian sugar industry alliance, the ASA, cent of rural sugar milling production, Canegrowers represent around 80 per cent Queensland, with 19 offices, and Given the short time frame, we then tested regionally by speaking with Rocky Point Canegrowers, who confirmed their support for organisations such as Pioneer Canegrowers growers, and Kalagro Canegrowers Organisation, cane growers within the Burdekin region, support the reforms but have some concerns. and the new organisation will not seek views that having the levy collector and researcher interest. They are concerned that foreign organisation and marketing may not be in growers' ongoing obligation for millers to contribute, is concern that sugar research will be too enough funds to diversification and the co-benefits this it does nothing to address the long-term to mid-term perceptions of millers.

So it is important that these consultation plan, as it is appropriate for all operation of the company and to contribute to its to me that they were concerned about the to ensure that it reflects the views of the whole very seriously. This is a sensible reform, does seem to be legitimate concerns, and a good address them.

The amalgamation of sugar regional research stations like Bundaberg is not. people in my area. Bundaberg BSES is a very fine to know that that one will be dropped with Dr Mike Cox and some of his staff and it is that all those talented people are in a state of decided quickly and I urge the new board to talent is rare talent. We are a leader in the harvesting. I actually knew Harold and Colin the first inventors of mechanical harvesters, in a very enviable position. They have also running new forms of trickle irrigation and in cane-doing all sorts of important things that consolidate the industry and give it an edge lot of sugar cane is grown in countries with to be done very well. Like the car industry our cane-harvesting enterprise from Bundaberg anything much we could do about that, because was occurring in this part of the world, compared America. Nevertheless, I know what the people are going through at present. Having been through do not want to lose the scientific edge that BSES is in my electorate and I find it regrettable Many staff will be retained because there being used for plant research. But I do make in Bundaberg for the wider industry. It is paramount continuing advancement in the development and competitiveness of the industry remains. It economic viability of the industry. After speaking with the Bundaberg and Childers they support the new reforms and the formation loss of the BSES facility in Bundaberg. As Sugar Research Australia will provide a much more contribute. It will provide an ongoing strong program, development in the sugar industry are met. One of the core activities of the new body Bundaberg as part of the Southern Plant Breeding owned by Bundaberg Sugar.

I grew up in Bundaberg and remember the disease, which was a wasting disease of sugar times, in June 2006 we found a fungal disease From June to November, it moved from Childers, dreadful scourge on the industry.

As I said, the Bundaberg that that particular one is closing. is a farm owned by Bundaberg Sugar which is the plea that we keep the talent that is available to the future of the industry.
