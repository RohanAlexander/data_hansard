2,Mr ANDREW,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Wakefield) (9.33 a.m.)Mr Speaker, at the great risk of being repetitious or of telling you what you heard last night, I think I ought to trace over some of the history of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1995, particularly the comments that prompted both the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), me and I believe the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) to be anxious to participate in it. Our particular interests focus on the arrangements in this bill to allow horticultural crops, particularly horticultural plantings, to be written off over the life of the planting. As was indicated last night, this gesture by the government to allow horticulturalists to write-off new plantings over the life of the planting is a much better situation than the one that currently exists where there is no tax write-off at all for new horticultural plantings. For that reason, the opposition will not be opposing this bill; in fact, we support it and we believe that this is a step in the right direction. The great concern of those of us in this place who represent horticulturalists is that the bill not only does not go far enough but also sends the wrong signals to both horticulturalists and viticulturalists across Australia. Currently-you would be aware of this, Mr Speaker, as a result of the comments made last night-the government has an arrangement where viticulturalists placing vineyard cuttings in the ground in order to create a new vineyard have a tax write-off provided by the government over five years. That tax write-off is a result of negotiations with the wine industry when the government first proposed to increase the wine tax. The wine industry, as part of its consultation with the government, called for these tax write-off provisions. These are in place and they have been widely used by the viticultural industry, as a quick glance at any wine growing region of Australia will illustrate. You have a vast acceleration in the planting of wine grapes in all regions of Australia. What subsequently followed was a crisis in the horticultural industry, particularly the citrus industry. The horticultural task force under Senator Sherry recommended that precisely the same planting write-off provisions be provided for horticulture as had been provided for viticulture. Horticulturalists and the opposition presumed-they presumed wrongly as it turns out-that that was the direction the government was going to take. The direction the government proposes to take is contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4), which is currently before the House as part of this cognate debate. The government has proposed that, instead of writing off horticultural crops over five years, as currently exists for viticultural crops, the write-off should commence when the horticultural crop comes into production and should be spread over the estimated commercial life of that particular horticultural crop. I believe that, while this is a step in the right direction, it does not go far enough. Worse than that, it sends the wrong message to all of those in irrigated areas and all of those in viticultural and horticultural areas who are making a decision about what they ought to plant. Right now there is a real incentive for people to get into vineyard production. As a result, there is a consequent disincentive for people to get into horticultural production. That is counter to what has been the general direction of the government. As I said last night, while it would have been easier for the opposition to criticise the government for its non-interventionist policy, we have not done so over the decade. In fact, we have welcomed it. Here we have the government intervening-I suspect unwittingly-in the marketplace by encouraging people to be in viticulture at the expense of horticulture. The plea that the member for Cowper has made, the plea that I make and the plea that I would suggest the member for Mallee will make is for the government to look again at this provision and consider offering horticulturalists exactly the same depreciation schedule and tax write-off schedule as currently exists for viticulturalists. Why? Simply because there is very little difference between the cost of establishing a vineyard and a modem horticultural crop. But, even more significantly, there is frankly very little difference in the estimated life of a vine or a fruit tree. Both have a commercial lifespan of about 30 years. I guess it can be extended depending on the nature of the fruit tree or the vine. Both have a lead time; that is, the time that it takes to get into production. In the case of vines, it is probably about three years. For horticultural crops it varies from four years; in the case of stone fruit, to eight years; in the case of crops such as olives; and it goes out to even 10 years in the case of walnuts. So there really is a lead time and a commercial production time for both viticulture and horticulture. It would be appropriate for the government to ensure that the same write-off provisions as exist for viticulture are introduced for horticulture. The government will say that this has certain revenue implications, and I guess they are right. However, I do not know that the revenue implications need to be all that dramatic. After all, there is already a provision to allow those who are replacing existing horticultural crops with other horticultural crops-that is, those who are replacing existing trees in a fruit orchard-to have a writeoff for that replacement. What does not exist is a write-off for new expansion. There are great export opportunities in the horticultural industry, just as there are in the viticultural industry. It is fair to say that, in viticulture, the wine industry has been so effective in expanding export markets that its expansion has become the benchmark for other export development in Australia. It is to be commended. But there are opportunities in horticulture that should not be overlooked. As I said last night, if you look at crops such as the walnut crop or the olive crop--not crops with which I am familiar-and at the level of imports of walnuts and olives in one form or another coming into Australia, you see there is great opportunity both for import replacement and export development. The government would be well advised to offer to horticulture precisely the same incentive as it offers to viticulture. It otherwise sends excessively encouraging signals to viticulture at the expense of horticulture. It ought to be taking a crop with export potential, such as the horticultural crop, and saying, 'What can we do to offer those who are prepared to invest in this long-term industry real encouragement to do so?' The government has taken that step in the viticultural industry and taken it successfully, I point out to the Special Minister of State (Mr Johns), who is at the table. As a result, as I have said, the wine industry has become the benchmark for export development. What it is doing with the proposals currently before the House is I think unintentionally, but nonetheless effectively, prejudicing the vineyard industry in favour of the horticultural industry. That is unwise because it means the government is backing what it believes to be a winner but, even more unwisely, it means that the people represented in this chamber by the member for Cowper, the member for Mallee and myself are forced to consider whether or not they will invest in viticulture instead of horticulture when the horticultural crop may show much the same promise, but the government is offering the carrot of tax write-off which tends to mean they will focus on viticulture at the expense of horticulture. I do not believe that direction is in the government's interests or part of what the government intends. My plea is that the government look again at this and consider doing what Senator Sherry originally recommended. Senator Sherry, one of the government's own members, a parliamentary secretary, recommended that in horticulture we should offer the same write-off as currently exists for viticulture. We in the opposition are pleading for that stance from the government in this debate this morning and in continuation of the comments made yesterday. The opposition has already indicated that it does not intend to oppose the bill because, as I said in my opening remarks, what is offered is better than nothing and without this bill what the industry gets is nothing. We do not intend to oppose it. We do intend to commit ourselves to offering the level playing field in taxation that we would have expected to appeal to the government and that the constituents we represent were led to believe they would be getting. The bill fails those constituents. It may well also be failing the Australian economy because it fails to deliver the same sorts of export opportunities in the promising horticultural industry as currently exist in the viticultural industry, which has so successfully performed under the opportunities for export that are being cultivated by the government and, I must say in fairness, even more enthusiastically grasped by the wine industry across Australia. We want reflected in horticulture precisely the same opportunities as already exist in viticulture-not in order to disadvantage the viticultural industry in any way at all but to offer the same encouragement that is given to the horticultural industry and to send the same planting signals to the horticultural industry as have been sent to the viticultural industry. To do anything else runs the risks of unfairly prejudicing one industry against another and of thwarting the market signals.",11
3,Mr FORREST,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) is quite right. I take this opportunity to place on the public record my concerns about horticulture. These taxation bills which we are debating cognately embrace a whole range of proposals. Like the member for Wakefield, I wish to focus on the tax write-off to horticulture, particularly for new plantings, and to zero in on division lOF as proposed in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4). As is the case with the member for Wakefield, horticulture is an important industry in my electorate as it is associated with the irrigation from the Murray River. Hence my keen interest in this matter. A conservative estimate would probably place horticulture as an industry in value terms of probably $200 million per year, just in my electorate. So it is of vital concern to me that artificial distortions will be created by this bill, providing artificial incentives for people in that industry. We have waited quite a long time for the government's response to the task force recommendations and, whilst I was grateful for that response, I want my concerns placed on the public record in respect of the distortions. Horticulture has been asked to bear quite a lot of pain in the last decade, particularly the dried tree fruit and citrus sectors of the industry. That pain is a result of trade reform. In particular, the citrus industry is bearing the full brunt of that reform and has suffered badly as a result. The citrus growers in my electorate and that of the member for Wakefield are being asked to restructure, listen to market signals and change the varieties they produce. That requires them to invest. But the signals that this bill sends are tempting them with a carrot to move away from tree plantations to vine plantations. That is not in the best interests horticulture, which is a broad industry. It is certainly not in the best interests signals like that continue, we are at risk of losing our citrus industry. Like the member for Wakefield, I am grateful for at least a step in the right direction. I am really pleased to see that the wine industry has added its voice to these concerns. It is a sector that would benefit by a greater degree of vine plantation. But even it says that these are not the right signals. Citrus growers today are looking at threats from imported Brazilian concentrate. They have already been sent the very strong signal that producing fruit for the juice market is not their best option. They need to get into a fresh fruit market that requires them to consider new varieties. But citrus is a particularly difficult fruit to grow and investment in new genetic varieties requires a long-term view. To ask these people to consider writing off their capital investment when their crop is produced is to require them to consider that it could be four or five years after their capital investment before they can commence their write-off. I was shown some fruit a fortnight ago by citrus growers. They were new varieties which were quite unstable. Some of the fruit was quite grotesque. That is characteristic of the new varieties, which are designed to be ultimately perfect fruit. With the very early fruit-some of them quite grotesque distortions, the shape of pears-the only option is the unprofitable juice market. It would take some five or six years after the planting of these new varieties of citrus before anything like decent fruit for the fresh fruit market could be sent to markets looking for perfect fruit. It could even be up to 15 years before a profitable quantity of crop is produced. When my citrus growers see schedule 10F of this bill they are not all that encouraged to consider making a capital investment and to listen to requests to consider restructuring, because there are possibly better options with vines. These are not the correct signals to send. Whilst I am grateful for one small step, further steps will need to be taken to remove of these distortions. Like the member for Wakefield, I urge the government to consider of citrus. If taking some further steps. I truly hope that the decisions that have been made in preparing this bill are not revenue driven. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in his second reading speech yesterday stated that an implication of this bill will be a reduction in revenue of $1 million in 199798, $2 million in 1998-99 and $4 million in 1999-2000. From this perspective, the government possibly thinks that it has done very well. But horticulture deserves that forsaking of revenue by the government, and probably a great deal more than that, because of what it has been asked to bear from the government's trade reforms over the last few years. We as an opposition have supported those reformsbecause tariffs are just another form of tax, a cost to consumers-as they have been the correct direction to take. But we are talking about industries that have had to bear the full brunt of these reforms and which look for the opportunities to restructure and to compete with rigorous overseas competition. Mr Nehl-The small family farms, too.",13
4,Mr FORREST,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"That is my next point. It might be relatively easy for larger producers and larger corporations to absorb the distortions that are being created here, but most citrus and dried fruit producers are small family enterprises on small acreages-like the ones in my electorate-who can ill afford to borrow funds, make the investments and then wait many years for the benefits of having those capital costs written off. These producers and corporations, of course, are the ones we are asking to consider restructuring. At present we are asking small family operations to compete with huge conglomerates on the international market. I urge the Assistant Treasurer, who is in the chamber today, to consider taking the next few steps. If they involve revenue reduction implications, I would say that that is only fair, given what the horticulture industry, particularly the dried vine and tree fruit and citrus sectors, has been asked to bear, The member for Wakefield has mentioned the horticultural task force, and I would like to specifically refer to its recommendation of February 1994: . . . the Industry Commission recommendation that the taxation treatment of expenditure on all new horticultural plantations be revised to provide a more neutral treatment compared with expenditure on other activities. All new horticultural plantings should be treated consistently with the recent Government amendments to the ITAA to allow the costs of acquisition and planting of grape vines to be written off over 4 years from the time of planting. This is the key signal to send to prevent those horticulturalists involved with orchards, the growing of trees, from being tempted to move across to vine production. My constituents have waited a long time for the implementation of these task force recommendations. As I said, I am grateful for at least this small first step. But I have to advise that problems will be created, and it will be incumbent on the government to deal with them. The opposition, when we are next in government, will certainly be committed to removing these distortions and installing the level playing field that the member for Wakefield has referred to. The tax· treatment for horticultural expenses creates a bias towards investing in vineyards. When a write-off is not available until year five and six and then the maximum write-off period is, say, over 14 years, the length of time before the cost of a plantation is written off may well be far too excessive. Thinking ahead to what the international market signals are going to be is like anticipating a movable feast. I know that in the stone fruit industry research activity and market intelligence need to look about seven, eight and even 10 years ahead. Trying to determine, with a crystal ball at your disposal, what market signals are going to be given by consumers, particularly in Asia, what the requirements are going to be and what style of fruit will be required 10 years ahead requires an enormous step in confidence from a producer who as a result, will have to remove a variety that he thinks is not going to be suitable in that time span and then plant another. It takes an enormous amount of confidence for a grower to do that and face the prospect of a proportion of his acreage not producing, thereby reducing his cash flow for such a long time span. I think it would be perfectly normal for anybody in that position to make the decision and say, 'I may as well become a wine grape grower rather than invest in a long-term industry.' These are not the right signals. A large number of my primary producers are very concerned about these distortions. One of these sectors is represented by the Australian Dried Fruits Association. These are people who produce crop from vines, and even they are saying the decisions in this bill are not in the best interests of broad horticulture. The Australian Dried Fruits Association represents the interests of 4,000 vine fruit and tree fruit growers and believes that the new depreciation provisions will lead to a misallocation of resources in Australian horticultural industries. Expenditure incurred in the establishment of new vineyards is fully deductible over a four-year period. As I have said, this is not the correct signal, and those involved are very concerned about this. The imbalance that could result is a dangerous precedent, they advise me. For example, if a grower establishes a new tree fruit plantation, the cost of establishing this plantation will be incurred in year one. However, no assessable income will be produced until some time after that. Dried tree fruit crops can have an economic life of up to 30 years, so the depreciation as a result would only be spread over the latter half of that period. The new provisions are inconsistent with the federal government's achievement goals of competitive neutrality amongst competing industries in the economy. I do not believe this is an appropriate signal to send. Growers have expressed their concern, and I have been required to place these concerns on the public record. I hope the government is listening to the message that the member for Cowper sent last night and which the member for Wakefield sent today. It is not too late to consider taking the next step. I look forward to the government's positive response to these pleas being made in the chamber today on behalf of horticulture.",14
5,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"in reply-I thank all those who have participated in the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1995. A number of points have been raised to which I would like to respond. Firstly, there has been some general criticism of the bill. One criticism is that it is long and complex. In fact, the trust loss measures were pointed to as an example of this complexity. In my second reading speech I pointed out the reasons for the length of the measures. It is always a trade-off between fairness and size. The government is prepared to add a few pages to legislation where that achieves greater fairness. In my second reading speech I also explained that the trust measures are written in the new tax law improvement style. For example, you will find that about 10 pages of the bill are devoted to summaries and charts to lead the reader through the measures. The easy-to-read layout of the text also adds to the number of pages. The overall result, however, is to make the legislation easy to read and follow. The complexity of the amendments to the bill are also pointed out. The government made details of the measures available with the budget announcements and, as always with these measures, the government has continued to receive representations on the bill. The government has made every effort to provide the legislation as early as practicable and will also continue to examine representations made and to respond where necessary. As I said in the debate on a different bill earlier this week, we would be delinquent if we did not listen to the concerns of taxpayers when they get to see the bill, its fine detail and the second reading speech. If they were to make representations to us, of course we must take account of that, and sometimes this leads to amendments. The amendments in the bill are at times fairly complex, but this is because they deal with very complex situations. The measures relating to demutualisation of mutual insurance companies are a good example of this. We, as well as insurance companies, agree the amendments deal with very complex situations. The government has received further industry representation on these measures, and these will be examined and remedies will be worked out where necessary. The government has always been willing to listen to and resolve genuine taxpayer concerns, and that has happened once again in this bill. In relation to the retrospective application of capital gains tax to non-residents who sell taxable Australian assets, it is quite clear that parliament intended to subject to capital gains tax disposals of taxable Australian assets by non-residents. Taxable Australian assets include shares in private companies and holdings of 10 per cent or more in public companies. It is argued that sales of these shares are exempt from capital gains tax because they are used to produce income from dividends that are subject to withholding tax or exempt from withholding tax because they are franked dividends. This would mean that non-residents would not be subject to capital gains tax on the sale of any of these shares. It would make the provision relating to shares being taxable Australian assets meaningless. It is a gem ral rule of statutory interpretation that parliament does not enact legislation that is superfluous. If the amendment is made prospective, nonresidents who pay tax on the sales of these shares would claim refunds of these taxes. This would lead to a loss of revenue already collected on a fair interpretation of the law. If this retrospective amendment is not made, the effect will be to levy capital gains tax on only Australian residents who sell shares in companies. Foreigners would be free to dispute liabilities for this tax. For those reasons, it would be unfair. A question also asked was why the same business test will not apply to trusts other than listed widely held trusts. Trusts are generally investment vehicles. Some of these trusts are treated as not carrying on a business. The same business test cannot apply to these trusts. If a trust is treated as carrying on a business, it will generally always carryon a business of investment. The same business test cannot therefore apply in any meaningful way. Family trusts are provided concessional treatment in carrying forward losses. They can generally carry forward losses so long as members of the same family are the only persons who can benefit from the trust. It is therefore not necessary to provide the same business test for these trusts. Family trusts could sell the trust assets. Trust losses will continue to be available to the former trusts. These losses could be used to offset future income of the trust so long as the same family benefits from the trust. It would not be appropriate to apply the same business test in these cases. Moreover, a purchaser will not buy a part of a discretionary interest in a trust. The trust will be bought over in full. In these cases, it will not be appropriate to carry forward trust losses. I move to the compliance cost of the trust measures for losses compared with the company loss provisions. A complaint made was that different rules apply to different categories of trusts. It was said that this adds to compliance costs and complexity. The fact is that there are various categories of trusts. These differ markedly from each other and different tax rules are provided to reduce compliance costs. Some of these were the result of consultation with the trust industry. An example of the effort made to reduce compliance costs of the measures is the concessional treatment provided to family trusts. A question was raised on the denial of franking credits for international profit misallocation. The proposed measures seek to ensure that franking credits in certain circumstances cannot be used to largely negate the additional company tax payable as a result of an adjustment to correct international profit shifting or misallocation. In providing franking credits, the imputation system for company taxation is seeking to relieve a second tier of tax on company profits-that is, where tax is being paid at the company level, profits, when distributed to shareholders as dividends, carry a rebate for the tax paid at the company level if the shareholder is a resident or, if the shareholder is a non-resident, they are not required to pay dividend withholding tax on those franked dividends. Where international profit shifting or misallocation has occurred, the profits have in effect already been distributed to an offshore entity without suffering any second tier of tax. Therefore, there is no need for relief by way of a franking credit. In giving a franking credit in these circumstances, companies which have engaged in international profit shifting or misallocation may distribute other profits in a tax free form where those profits have not suffered tax at the company level. This places these companies in a more favourable position than Australian companies which have complied with arms-length standards. There is also concern expressed about the proposed measures applying to original and amended assessments irrespective of the income year to which the misallocation of profit adjustment relates. As the proposed measure seeks to ensure that revenue is not lost by the conferring of an unintended benefit which is inconsistent with the basic policy of imputation-that is, the company dividend suffers tax at one level: either at the company level or in the hands of the shareholder upon distribution-it is quite appropriate to apply to assessments which issue after the budget announcement on 9 May 1995, irrespective of the income year to which the misallocation of profit adjustment relates. There is also a claim that the proposed measure will impact unfairly on Australian multinational groups. Claims that the proposed measures will impact unfairly on Australian multinationals are based on a flawed assumption-namely, that profit shifted from Australia through transfer pricing or non-arms-Iength dealings will be returned to Australia as dividends or realised as a capital gain on the disposal of shares in a foreign subsidiary. This assumption is flawed because there is little certainty if or when profits will be repatriated. It is highly unlikely, for instance, that profits shifted from an Australian resident subsidiary to its foreign parent will be returned to Australia. Even in cases involving profit shifted from an Australian resident parent company to a wholly owned subsidiary, there is no certainty if, when or to what extent the shifted profits may be returned to Australia. It is also unclear how shifted profits could in practice be returned to Australian resident companies to put them in the same position as would have existed if the dealings in question had been undertaken on an armslength basis. A table was handed out by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) allegedly demonstrating the harsh operation of the proposed measures to deny franking credits for international profit misallocation adjustments. The proposed measures will not, in the proposed situation outlined in that table, alter the tax situation of the shareholder taxpayer. The taxpayer on the $3 million profits under the new measure will remain the same. It has been suggested that an amendment that would retrospectively deny life insurance companies both a tax rebate and imputation credit is unfair, while receiving both a deduction and a rebate in relation to the imputation credit attached to a dividend amounts to double dipping. It is clearly contrary to the intention of the dividend imputation system. This would have been known by the institutional taxpayers affected by this amendmentthat is, the life insurance companies and their tax advisers. Those companies that did claim both a rebate and a deduction for the same amount would have gained an unconscionable commercial benefit over their competitors who did not exploit the defect. Therefore, it is appropriate for the amendments to be retrospecti ve. Finally, the question was asked: why has the government not addressed another defect in the dividend imputation provisions relating to life companies? The corrective amendments already in this bill were inserted because they were relatively simple and could be made within the legislative deadlines that existed at the time. The other alleged defect is more complicated and also applies to superannuation funds. Time prevented this issue from being fully considered and any remedial legislative amendments being included in this bill. Moreover, according to representations made by the life insurance industry, life companies have been adopting a proposed interpretation of the law so that no life company has been disadvantaged by the alleged defect. This suggests that the urgency for an amendment is not as profound as the other corrective amendments that have been included in this bill. It is interesting to note that this proposed approach to interpretation is inconsistent with claims of some members of the life insurance industry that, when the defect operates in their favour, they ought to be able to rely on the plain wording of the act, even though this produces a clearly unintended result. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Clauses I to 4-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Schedule I.",16
6,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"by leave-I move government amendments I and 2: (1) Schedule 1, page 17, after item 18, insert: ""18A. After subsection 160B(1): Insert: '(1A) Subsections (2) and (2A) define listed personal use asset for the purposes of this Part.'."". (2) Schedule 1, page 17, item 20, proposed subsection 160B(2A), omit all the words after ""an asset"", substitute ""is also a listed personal use asset if the interest is covered by subparagraph (2)(a)(vii) and the market value of the asset at the time when the interest is acquired is more than $500."". Government amendments I and 2 relate to capital gains tax increase in personal use asset thresholds. These amendments relate to the capital gains tax provisions set out in part 2 of schedule 1 of the bill. They will introduce new item 18A and amend existing item 20 to ensure that, where the market value of a listed personal use asset at the time of its acquisition exceeds $500, capital gains tax will apply to any gain realised on the disposal of an interest in the asset. In the absence of these adjustments, the full $500 threshold would apply to each interest in a jointly held listed personal use asset. I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum.",18
7,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I want to remark generally on the government amendments. I am referring to the specific schedule the government has provided, which is in itself unintelligible without supplementary information such as the explanatory memorandum. I want to, in this particular case, record my dissatisfaction with the procedure that now applies. This is a general criticism as well as one applying to this specific set of amendments. That is, the government moves amendments to a bill before the House and the details are generally not known to members of the House until very close to or during the second reading debate. As a matter of practice, the government is not obliged-indeed, some might think it is prevented from doing it-to provide a supplementary explanatory memorandum.",19
8,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I gave you one yesterday.,19
9,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I know, and I am going to acknowledge that. In this case, the Assistant Treasurer was kind and generous enough to obtain a copy for me. I simply put on the record that, without us having exchanged a few pleasantries-I do mean that, and not in the sarcastic sense-in the House, that would not have been available to me to enable me to look at these amendments. I think there is something wrong with the procedure we now adopt whereby the first reading is made and that is all there is to it. It just lies on the table, for a month in the case of this bill, then comes up for discussion subsequently, when the minister makes his second reading speech. The minister said, incorrectly I think, in summing up the second reading debate that that period enables consultation and enables people to have a look at the legislation and the explanatory memorandum which accompanies it, but it certainly does not give anyone the opportunity to look at the details of the second reading speech, which I think the minister incorrectly said in summing up the second reading debate. The second reading speech, or the details of the government's thinking in terms of words-remembering their importance under the Acts Interpretation Act-is not available to interested parties. Specifically in relation to schedule 1which I believe we are discussing now-item 34, it appears that amendments have been proposed which will apply to disposal of Australian assets taking place after 19 September 1985, which was when the principal capital gains tax act came into force. But I believe also that the amendments will not apply to transactions which had been commenced, but not completed, prior to last budget day where the transactions happen to be covered by a private binding ruling issued by the Commissioner of Taxation under part IV AA of the Taxation Administration Act. I understand that a Senate committee has asked for the advice of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on these circumstances and whether the amendments ought not to apply to a taxpayer who, prior to budget night, had relied on the present wording of the legislation, although not obtaining a ruling from the commissioner. The Senate committee indicates that, pending the Treasurer's advice, it might reach a conclusion that the amendment trespasses unduly on personal rights and liberties, which would be contrary to that Senate committee's terms of reference. So I wonder if the Assistant Treasurer would care to comment on that.",19
10,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) raises a point that has been considered by the Procedure Committee. As and always, the government is keen to make sure that its legislation is exposed to the people who are affected by it so that they can comment on the legislation before it is introduced into the House for the second reading debate. There have been some recommendations by the Procedure Committee given to the government particularly in relation to the second reading speech, which is never as the member knows, until the bill is introduced in the parliament for the second readrests ing.

But I would just make where the point that the government is always keen to make sure the tax paying community has the best chance it can have to peruse the provisions legislation, the explanatory memorandum and, Justices where possible, also the second reading 1937. speech.

(2) The amendments made by item 22 and subitem (1) are to be disregarded in determining the application of Part IlIA of the Principal in relation to the disposal of assets before p.m. on 9 May 1995."". This amendment relates to non-residents and taxable Australian assets. The reason why the amendment is being moved is because we believe that the legislation offends against the principle of retrospectivity. I should say that it is not only in relation to these particular provisions but also in some other provisions of the legislation itself that retrospectivity is offended against by this bill. The principle of retrospectivity has been well set out by the courts of this country. It is a principle which is understood and ought to be understood by governments-that is, where they take actions which can penalise citizens of the country, then those actions ought not be retrospective. As Mr Justice Wells said in his often quoted judgment in the given, case of Heading v. Elston in 1980: [The statutory presumption against retrospectivity] upon the well nigh universal conviction that, if members of a community are expected and encouraged, as they are, to govern their conduct by reference to the laws in force in the community, it would be unfair to penalise someone for conduct that was not contrary to the law at the time when the second he committed himself to it. That principle was restated more recently by Justice Deane in the High Court in the case I of HeppeUs v. Federal Commissioner of House (Mr Taxation when he said: In cases where tax avoidance is not involved and the substance of relevant transactions is not concealed by artificialities of form, the basic principles of statutory construction of taxing remain those identified and explained by Rich and Dixon in their judgment in Anderson v. Commission of Taxes (Victoria) in In that case the court said: The intention to impose a tax or duty or to increase tax or duty already imposed must be shown by clear and unambiguous language and cannot be inferred from ambiguous words. It is a cardinal principle-a principle well known to the common law that has not been and ought not be weakenednamely, that the imposition of a tax must be in plain terms. Mr Justice Deane went on and said: The above principles are supported by strong Act reasons in both law and common sense. In circum7.30 stances where successive administrations have allowed the Income Tax Assessment Act to become a legislative jungle in which even the non-specialist lawyer and accountant are likely to lose their way in the search to identify the provisions relevant to a particular case. The least that such a taxpayer is entitled to demand of government is that, once the provisions are fully identified, a legislative intent to impose a tax upon him or her in respect of a common place transaction will be expressed in clear words. That principle is one which has withstood scrutiny by the higher courts not only of this land but also elsewhere throughout the course of this century. Here we have yet another example of a government saying, 'That really was not the intention of the parliament.' The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) relied upon some principle that provision in the act was not meant to be superfluous, as if that principle should override the fundamental principle of retrospectivity in relation to these measures. If for no other reason than the principle of retrospectivity, we say that the government ought to accept the amendments which have been circulated. They are amendments which are on all footing with what taxpayers and their advisers have understood for a period of time and have acted upon those. They have had no indication to the contrary from the tax office, from the government or from anyone else. Why should the government come in here today and say that we are simply going to tum around something which has been well understood upon any ordinary interpretation of the legislation? I urge the Assistant Treassituation urer to reconsider his position and accept amendments.",20
13,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I register my support for the amendment moved, on behalf of the coalition, by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). When the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) responds I would ask that he refer to the point I raised earlier-that is, whether the Treasurer's advice sought by the Senate committee about whether amendments ought not to apply to a taxpayer who, prior to budget night, had relied on the present wording of the legislation, although not obtaining a ruling from the commission. I am talking about a transaction covered by a private binding ruling issued by the Commissioner of Taxation under part IV AA of the Taxation Administration Act 1953.",21
14,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The issue ofretrospectivity has been around this place a long time. I need go no further than to quote back to the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) his own leader, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), when he was Treasurer. We all remember the retrospective legislation introduced. We always remember why he dividend introduced it, not because he wanted to because he was shamed into it on account the unfairness of the tax system. So don't to us about retrospectivity. We understand We understand that governments of both ensure political persuasions have done it. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) will be aware that in the Western Australian parliament the government of Sir Charles Court used retrospective legislation in a most ruthless way to wipe out the interests of a small Australian mining company when it had leases on claims that were correctly made but, because a multinational company came in and got to the government, the government of Sir Charles Court, retrospective legislation was introduced to wipe out its benefits. So, for the reasons I have already outlined, it is entirely appropriate that we make these moves in respect of the legislation that we have before the parliament today. The member for Curtin asked me about the of taxpayers prior to budget night. I the am told that the savings clause relating to private binding rulings or PBRs recognises that taxpayers should be entitled to rely on a ruling given to them by the commissioner. This is consistent with the intention of the PBRs. The ruling is binding on the commissioner where it is given. But, of course, it protects the rights of the taxpayer. I hope that answers the member's question on that particular measure. For the reasons I have already outlined, we will not be agreeing to this amendment. Amendment negatived.

The amendments will remove those words to that the subsection operates as intended.",21
16,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I want to speak under schedule 2 to item 160(1). It has been said that the government's bill will amend transactions entered into to the date of announcement, which of course was budget day on 9 May 1995. I can see no reason why the amendments should not be confined to transactions entered into after budget announcement. After all, that is typical for application of amendments to anti-avoid.ance provisions. Even if that proposition is unacceptable to the government, applying the amendments to assessments issued after the date of the announcement can be manifestly, clearly and unequivocally retrospective in their application in the government's proposal. ties. Typically, the amendments deal with transfer pricing reviews, and transfer pricing reviews take considerable time. The degree of time taken in negotiation between taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office is very considerable indeed. Recognising that these usually involve establishing an arms-length price is not a matter of precision. It involves both sides but particularly the Australian Taxation Office in a fair amount of subjective judgment. It is not uncommon-in fact, I suggest that it would be the norm-for people on both sides of the argument, no matter what their good intentions, to differ. The normal process involves the ATO examining documentation and records of a taxpayer. As part of the process they are expected to do an independent analysis of transfer prices. That process having been followed, the ATO then reaches certain conclusions, I presume, and offers an audit settlement on the basis of a particular price. That offer, typically again, would be examined by the taxpayer and issues are raised and further discussions with the ATO are held. I understand that almost invariably the offer made by the ATO in these circumstances would be modified either as a result of discussion, and therefore voluntary, or after a counter offer is made by the taxpayer. This is a whole process of negotiation. Sometimes agreement is reached after many years of negotiation on a transfer pricing settlement. Even when that happens, the paperwork will not issue for some considerable time after that. To allow the taxpayers and the ATO to prior come to an agreement prior to the federal budget being brought down this year, where all but the paperwork was to be completed, and then to change the basis on which that the agreement has been reached after all those lengthy processes, depending on the stage they have reached, is manifestly unfair. As a bare minimum, the government amendments to this particular section, which I mentioned earlier, should not apply to an assessment issued as a result of an agreement already reached or substantially reached by the parAmendments agreed to.",22
17,Mr ANDREWS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Menzies) (10.32 a.m.)by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos 2 to 4: (2) Schedule 2, page 68, at the beginning of subitem 160(3) insert ""Subject to subitems (5) and (6),"". (3) Schedule 2, page 68, at the beginning of subitem 160(4) insert ""Subject to subitems (5) and (6),"". (4) Schedule 2, page 68, after subitem 160(4) add the following subitems: ""(5) If and to the extent that: (a) a company which is a life insurance company furnished a return of income before 28 September 1995; and (b) the return included a claim for a deduction under section 160AR of the Principal Act; then, in relation to each year of income for which such a return was furnished, the amendments made by items 127,128, 130 and 131: (i) only apply in relation to any franked dividends paid to a shareholder in a company on or after 28 September 1995, so that such dividends are only to be ignored in calculating a potential rebate amount if paid on or after that day; and (ii) are to be disregarded in determining the entitlement of the taxpayer to a deduction under subsection 160AR(1), subsection 160AR(1A), subsection 160AR(2) or subsection 160AR(3) in relation to a trust amount or partnership amount received during the first franking year of the company that commenced after 6 December 1990 and each later franking year until those amendments commenced to apply. These amendments relate to dividend imputation and, in particular, to the denial of tion for franking rebates received by a life insurance company via a trust. The amendment here applies retrospectively. There are objections which I raised in the second reading debate in relation to that. For example, the Life Investment and Superannuation Association of Australia noted with disapproval the proposed amendments. They said that in their view any shareholder life company which may have claimed deductions on a correct interpretation of the law as written should not now some five years after the introduction of the provisions be forced to refund the tax applicable to those deductions. What has happened here is that from 7 December 1990 the plain wording of the act entitled an ordinary non-mutual life insurance company to the section 160AR deduction. There has been no indication in any bill, act, explanatory memorandum, second reading speech, published ruling or any other determination or public statement from the Australian Taxation Office or any other extrinsic material that it was the intention of the Taxation Office, the government or the parliament that a life insurance company could not claim a deduction which was specifically allowed to it under the legislation. Because a life insurance company is under a statutory fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of its policyholders, it could well have been in breach of that duty if it failed to claim a deduction to which it was entitled under the plain wording of the legislation. It has been pointed out-I believe the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is well aware of this-that at least one life insurance company claimed the deduction and also acted to its detriment by crediting the after tax earnings, including the tax saved, to its 250,000 superannuation policies on a daily basis since 1990. This is not dealing with the situation in which the company or the shareholders benefited from the tax saving. If these amendments which are proposed in this bill by the government are passed and are retrospective, the company will not be able to recoup any retrospective tax or penalties from a quarter of a million policyholders. Therefore, the company will have to pay the whole deduc- of the aggregate amount from its own resources and those of its shareholders. The Australian Taxation Office has known about the deduction claims since at least the end of last year, yet neither the Taxation Office nor the government has given any indication prior to 28 September 1995 when this bill was introduced that the deduction was not intended to be available. This is a situation where the responsibility for the defect-if there is such a defectclearly rests with the tax office and the government. Having regard to the plain wording of the act, a taxpayer cannot be presumed to know what parliament-let alone the government or the tax office-intended in the absence of any written indication to the contrary of an intention prior to tabling this bill. For these reasons, the amendments which have been circulated in my name have been moved. We believe that out of any sense of fairness to this situation the government ought to accept the amendments rather than continue with a situation which quite clearly and patently creates major problems for companies.

19,Mr ANDREWS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move opposition amendment No.5: (5) Schedule 4, page 137, Part 4, item 14, after paragraph 2(b) add the following word and subparagraph: "" and; (c) expenditure incurred after that time: (i) that was or is incurred in accordance with the terms of a finance scheme application lodged with the Industry Research and Development Board after 30 June 1994 and on or before 9 May 1995 incorporating such amendments to the terms of the finance scheme application as the Industry Research Development Board may approve at any time; (ii) that was or is incurred in accordance with the terms of a scheme approved by the Industry Research and Development Board on or before 30 June 1996; (iii) that was or is incurred under a contact evidenced in writing that is entered into within 90 days of the approval of a finance scheme by the Industry Research and Development Board and/or before 1 July 1996; and (iv) in respect of which the eligible company that incurred that expenditure had applied or will apply to the Industry Research and Development Board for joint registration with one or more other eligible companies within 90 days of the approval of a finance scheme by the Industry Research and Development Board and/or before 1 July 1996."". This amendment relates to research and development. As I indicated in my speech in the second reading debate, research and development syndicates have been a mechanism for funding by research and development companies requiring taxation shelter. Generally, these companies would not spend money on research and development in the absence of a deduction. On the other hand, companies who wish to conduct research development need funds and cannot make use of a tax deduction. A significant source of these research and development projects has come from public and private tax exempt companies. The amen-ments here are aimed at ensuring that consistent tax treatment is forwarded to expenditure, as is the case with expenditure incurred by public tax exempt entities under section 73CB. The amendments apply to expenditure incurred after 7.30 p.m. on 9 May when the measured was announced. Although the transitional rules are slightly more generous than the original transitional rules announced on 9 May, there are problems which have been pointed out because of applications which were on foot and are therefore caught by these provisions. For example, one researcher alleges that they were led by AusIndustry to believe that their submissions would be considered at a meeting in June. Another person alleges that AusIndustry officials advised all major syndicate arrangers during the lead-up to the May meeting of the TCC that private exempt syndicates would not be considered at the May meeting but the deferral would not affect their right to consideration at a later meeting. Other private tax exempt applications were considered at the May meeting and approved. As I indicated yesterday, the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney have said that the effect of this bill is that, even though they submitted a research and development syndicate application on 3 May 1995, in accordance with the legislation existing before 9 May, it will not be considered. There are details of other projects where the same complaints are made. For example, in applications relating to research and development in the agricultural sector, there is an indication that the applications were lodged in January 1995, there were approvals in April 1995 in relation to two of these matters, and then the Auslndustry officials advised the parties concerned during the lead-up to the May tax concession committee meeting that private tax exempt syndicates would not be considered at the May meeting but this deferral would not effect their right to consideration at a subsequent meeting. They say that they cooperated with this request expecting that there would be no ultimate disadvantage as a consequence, but now they find that the provisions of the bill will disadvantage these applications. Major pieces of research are involved. One, as I mentioned, relates to the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute and others relate to major agricultural research. These researchers, having entered into the process of having made the applications and acting in accordance with the rules and the provisions which they understood to be relevant at the time, are now finding that, having gone months through this process, they are cut off at a particular point and the research and development is placed in jeopardy. I hope that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has had an opportunity to look at this more carefully since I raised the matter in the debate at the second reading stage yesterday. These amendments are designed to overcome this disadvantage which these and other researchers will suffer. I again urge the government to accept the amendments that have been circulated.",24
20,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is not the researchers that the amendments propose to protect; it is the investors. The opposition proposes to protect the investors who put money into private tax exempt bodies even though that expenditure is not fully at risk. The investors the opposition want to protect will not have entered a syndicate or incurred any expenditure before the government's budget announcement, and any who have are already protected. They will not have entered into contracts to incur the R&D, and any who have are already protected. If a scheme lacks even a preliminary of finance scheme approval, no-one has a legitimate claim to the former research and development exemption. So once again it is not the researchers that are being protected by this; it is the investors. As I said, the investment money is not at risk and therefore should not attract a tax exemption.",25
21,Mr ANDREWS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is somewhat superfluous to say that the researchers will not be affected, it will only be the investors that will be affected. I am sure the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) understands that the basis of research being carried out is dependent upon the investment funds being available. In relation to two applications which I am referring to, the total estimated cost in preparing and lodging those two applications was around $250,000. Here we are in a country that prides itself on the slogan which your government put forward that, 'We ought to be the clever country. We want more investment. We want more saving. We need more research and development.' That research and development is dependent upon investment and investors coming forward and having a clear understanding of the rules and procedures which are to be followed. Here we have investors halfway through the process-having spent a quarter of a million dollars on two major pieces of research relating to agriculture in Australia, having gone through the lodgement process, having gone through the preliminary process of approval, having gone to Auslndustry, with its blessing-being told, 'No, we will not deal with it at the May meeting of the tax concession committee, but that will not ultimately be of any disadvantage to you.' For the Assistant Treasurer to come in here and say, somewhat superficially"" 'It doesn't matter, research is not going to be affected' is no way to go about increasing and enhancing research in this country. The reality is that these people have undertaken that process in good faith, on all the advice of the bureaucrats concerned to act in a certain way. The government then turns around overnight and says that it will change the rules, no matter that these people have invested a quarter of a million dollars in applications for research. For the Assistant Treasurer to say, 'It is only the investors are concerned,' is to give a funny answer. the one hand, he says that research is importword ant; on the other, he is saying not to worry about this because it is only the investors, researchers, who are losing. But, if there is investment, there will be no research.",25
22,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I did not say that we were ments in the trust. going to wipe out research and development in Australia. The member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) knows that will not happen. I did say that in the research and development field there is an opportunity for some investors to take a risk. We give tax deductions when money is at risk. We do that to encourage people to put their money at risk. We do not give tax concessions where an investment is virtually guaranteed. Why would we give a tax deduction for that? As for the other point raised by the member for Menzies, if investors had completed the process prior to budget night they would be protected.

24,Mr WILLIS,AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995 puts in place the necessary legislative framework for the sale of the Commonwealth governmake ment's remaining 50.4 per cent shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, all CBA, as announced in the 1995-96 budget on 9 May 1995. The Commonwealth's decision to sell its remaining Commonwealth Bank shareholding reflects the significant changes which have occurred in the Australian finansmall cial system since the early 1980s and the changes which have occurred in the Commonsaying wealth Bank since 1990. The deregulation of the financial system, and the increased competition within the Australian banking sector in particular, significantly weakened the case for majority government ownership of a commercial bank. The Australian banking sector today is significantly more competitive, efficient and responsive to the needs of consumers and the Australian economy in general than was the case when this government came to office in 1983. In this environment, the government decided in the budget preparation process this year that there was no longer any compelling reason for it to continue to hold a majority shareholding of a commercial bank. This was a change in the policy I announced in September 1993 that the government had no intention to further reduce its shareholding. I made that announcement in the prospectus for the public share offer of approximately 19 per cent of the bank's shares. The success of that second public share offer, which increased private ownership of the bank to 49.6 per cent, played a role in changing our minds about the government maintaining majority ownership of a commercial bank. Despite being the majority shareholder, it has been the government's long standing policy not to interfere in the commercial operations of the Commonwealth The bank operates on a fully commer1995 cial basis and has a proven track record as a successful bank operating in a very competitive industry and yielding good returns to its shareholders. This has been reflected in strong investor support for the bank. Against this background, in the budget deliberations we considered the clear budgetary advantages of selling the government's remaining 50.4 per cent stake. The sale will a major contribution to the reduction of outstanding government debt, to the benefit of Australians. The sale should allow public debt interest savings of around $400 million per annum once the bank is fully sold. Our decision to sell the government's shares will also provide an excellent opportunity for investors to buy into the bank. The bank's management has welcomed the sale, the decision will allow the bank to pursue its development with clarity of purpose and that the sale of the shares will be in the long-term interests of existing shareholders. has I now tum to the details of the bill. The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995 provides: the necessary amendments to the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 to facilitate the sale of the Commonwealth's CBA shareholding; detailed transitional arrangements for the Commonwealth guarantee of the liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Bank Officers Superannuation Corporation-CBOSC-and an on-going Commonwealth guarantee of the liabilities of the Commonwealth Development Bank, the CDB; for the conversion of the CDB and the CBOSC from statutory authorities to Corporations Law companies and for the conversion of the statutory superannuation fund of the CBOSC to a trust; that the Commonwealth Bank body, which includes the CBA and its subsidiaries, will be, as far as practicable, subject to legislation after the sale, consistent with other private sector companies and approved banks; that the Commonwealth Bank body and its shareholders are not disadvantaged under section 63A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as a result of the change in ownership resulting from the sale of the Commonwealth's CBA shares; that the CBA and the CDB will be provided with appropriate transitional arrangements regarding protected business names; for the retention, post sale, of employee entitlements accrued in pre-sale service under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973; and the necessary consequential amendments to other Commonwealth legislation. I will elaborate on some of those points. Commonwealth Guarantee Arrangements The bill provides appropriate transitional measures for the Commonwealth guarantee applying to the CBA's liabilities consistent with my budget night announcement. These arrangements ensure that the CBA's depositors, creditors and superannuation fund members are treated fairly as a result of the Commonwealth's sale of its shares. The arrangements are broadly comparable with those applying to the sale of the State Bank of New South Wales. The transitional arrangements relating to the Commonwealth guarantee of the liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank and the CBOSC commence at the 'effective date', which is defined as the time at which the Commonwealth's CBA shareholding falls to below 50 per cent, or 9 May 1996, whichever is the later. The transitional period for which the guarantee applies depends upon whether the liability is a demand deposit, a term deposit or any other liability. The transitional arrangements provide for: the guarantee of all demand deposits for a period of three years from the effective date; the guarantee, until maturity, of term deposits outstanding at the effective date or made during the three years following the effective date; and the guarantee, until maturity, of all other liabilities and off-balance sheet obligations outstanding at the effective date. The bill provides that the Commonwealth will continue to guarantee all of the liabilities of the CDB as is currently the case. The bill also provides that the Commonwealth will guarantee the liabilities of the CBOSC-or the superannuation fund-for a person who was a member, retired member or beneficiary before the commencement of the relevant provisions of the act. This section preserves for these persons the guarantee currently contained in the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959. The Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank are to negotiate appropriate accountability arrangements relating to the Commonwealth guarantee of the liabilities of the CBA, CBOSC and the CDB. These arrangements, which will be negotiated before the Commonwealth sells any of its shares, will be of a contractual nature and will be binding on the Commonwealth Bank. Taxation Issues The bill provides an exemption from the possible application of section 63A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 relating to the deductibility of losses on bad debts. This provision seeks to ensure that the Commonwealth Bank body and its shareholders are not disadvantaged as a result of the change in ownership resulting from the sale of the Commonwealth's shares. This is irrespective of whether the sale is structured in such a way that an intermediary or intermediaries are interposed between the Commonwealth as seller and the buyers of the Commonwealth's shares. The bill also exempts various transactions associated with the sale of the Commonwealth's CBA shares from most state and territory taxes, levies, fees, duties and charges. This measure is intended to enhance the attractiveness of the sale to potential purchasers. The Commonwealth, however, has indicated its in-principle support for providing relevant states and territories with an ex gratia payment compensating them for stamp duty forgone in relation to the sale. Foreign Ownership The bill does not impose any legislative restrictions on the ability of foreign interests to acquire shares in the Commonwealth Bank. Post-sale, the CBA will be subject to the same foreign investment regulatory framework that applies to other Australian banks. International investors will be permitted to participate in the public sale of CBA shares, as was the case in the 1993 sale. Foreign participation will expand the market for the CBA's shares, which is in the interests of all shareholders. It would be pointless to deny such participation when foreign investors can buy CBA shares on the Australian Stock Exchange. However, the Commonwealth Bank will remain predominantly Australian owned immediately after the sale and will have a dispersed share ownership given the application of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, the Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972 and the allocation policy which is expected to apply for foreign investor participation in the sale. Future of the Commonwealth Development Bank The proposed sale arrangements not only provide for the retention of the Commonwealth Development Bank, with its existing charter and the Commonwealth guarantee of its liabilities, but will also enhance the CDB as an independent financial institution aimed at providing specialist banking services to the small business and rural sectors. The CDB will continue to be 91.9 per cent owned by the Commonwealth Bank and 8.1 per cent owned by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will continue to pay an annual subsidy to the CDB to undertake the banking activities defined in its charter. The bill provides for the conversion of the CDB from a statutory authority to a public company under the Corporations Law with its own memorandum and articles of association. The CDB's existing charter will be removed from the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 and replicated in the CDB's memorandum of association. The conversion of the CDB to a public company with its own board of directors will enhance its position as a specialist financial institution. This is consistent with the proposed granting of a separate banking authority to the CDB. The retention of the existing Commonwealth guarantee arrangements for the CDB will ensure that the CDB can obtain necessary financing on a competitive basis. Prior to the Commonwealth's CBA shareholding falling to below 50 per cent, a shareholders' agreement will be entered into between the Commonwealth and the CBA on various matters relating to the CDB. This agreement will detail the annual subsidy determination and review arrangements and will contain an undertaking from the CBA that it will not exercise its voting power to amend the CDB's memorandum and articles of association while an adequate Commonwealth subsidy is in place. The shareholders' agreement will be made available when it is finalised. Protected Business Names The bill will provide the CBA and the CDB with a 10-year transitional arrangement regarding various protected business names. At the end of 'the lO-year period, the CBA and the CDB will no longer have any specific legislative protection of their business names. This provision is intended to provide the CBA and the CDB with sufficient opportunity to develop appropriate commercial strategies to utilise the value of their protected names. This will be to the benefit of both existing and future CBA shareholders. Conclusion In conclusion, the sale of the Commonwealth's remaining CBA shareholding will provide a number of significant benefits to the Commonwealth and the Australian people as well as existing and prospective CBA shareholders. The proposed sale arrangements will ensure that the bank's depositors, creditors and superannuation fund members are treated fairly as a result of the Commonwealth's sale of its shares. The arrangements will also ensure that the specialist banking functions of the CDB are retained to the benefit of the small business and rural communities. I commend the bill to the House.",27
25,Mrs BISHOP,AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that: (1) the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank is ill-defined in the Bill, and the Shareholders' Agreement between the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth should be included as a Schedule to the Bill; (2) the Government should give assurances that any acquisition of property that arises in consequence of the buy back of shares foreshadowed in the Bill will be on just terms under section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution; and (3) regulations under the Bill, which may under subclause 19(3) have retrospective effect, are yet to be issued and are not clearly out in the Bill, and the Government is once again legislating by regulation"". The second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill was notable for what it left out rather than for what information it gave us. For instance, I refer to his statement that the shareholders agreement will be made available when it is finalised. I relate that to part 1 of my amendment, which says that the agreement should indeed be made a schedule to the bill. But more of that in the body of my speech. I also find it interesting that-in dealing with such an important bill, for which we have been waiting for five months and we are given five days notice once it was introduced to consider it and to debate it today; in other words, we get one day of consideration for every month we have waited-the sum total of the contribution the Treasurer is able to make is 11 minutes of speech. That is not good enough, Treasurer. As I said, we have been waiting for this bill for 11 long months. It was published in the budget session-that is, last May. It was said by the bank, when responding to the announcement that the remainder of the Commonwealth's holding was to be sold, that a debate on the bill in May would 'be helpful to the maintenance of an orderly market for the bank shares and certainty of the sale and buyback process'. But, as I have often said during that long waiting period, the Commonwealth Bank sale was just another classic case of policy on the run. There was no proper planning and no proper consideration of the implications for things such as the Commonwealth Development Bank. Your speech, Minister, did nothing to allay the fears of those people who have looked at the legislation. The scenario in which this was introduced was a very simple one: the government had planned to sell off the Yellow Pages, start the breakup of Telstra-flog it off. Then they changed their mind and decided that, no, they could not do that, after talking to Telstra. So, instead, to fill the great gaping hole in their spelt budget, where they had planned for a $5.3 billion sale of assets which they would spend immediately on recurrent expenditure to give us a supposed surplus, they said, 'Wow! Let's sell the Commonwealth Bank.' I think the cabinet was told a number of hours before the decision was announced. The caucus, however, did not get to hear of it until only minutes before the announcement was to be made. Mr Truss-Too late.",30
26,Mrs BISHOP,AMENDMENT BILL,"Too late, as my colleague says; quite right. It was too late so that they could not mount a reaction to the proposed sale. Then there was the caucus meeting the other day to finally approve of this bill. I think it was carried by only six votes-hardly a resounding endorsement of your policy. Again it is quite indicative on today's speaking list in that there is you, Minister, and the poor old member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), whom you trot out at any time when there is desperation in the ranks. I think we have 10 speakers on the list. However, we will be able to vote on our motion, so we will give those people who spoke out so firmly and so fervently at your caucus meeting the opportunity to vote against the bill. I would just like to remind the Treasurer of his own promises that he made, when he was the Minister for Finance, on the Sunday program back in August 1992, when he was having a little interview with Laurie Oakes. Laurie Oakes said to him, 'There's nothing to stop you now selling the Commonwealth Bank in the same way,' referring to the previous part sale. Ralph Willis, the good Treasurer, said, 'We won't be selling the Commonwealth Bank any further.' Laurie Oakes said, 'But you could, could you not?' Ralph Willis said, 'We're not intending to.' Then in September 1993 Mr Willis reaffirmed this strong position he had taken in relation to the government's commitment not to reduce the Commonwealth's holding in the Commonwealth Bank. In a letter, which was then included in the prospectus for the sale of the second tranche, Mr Willis assured prospective investors and said, 'The government has no intentions whatsoever of further reducing its shareholding.' Of course, the Keating government have long been characterised by misleading statements promising the Australian people one thing and doing precisely the opposite without any concern for what they have said in the past or what impact it may have on things for the future. This government's track record is one of broken promises and it is known widely. It is immaterial whether you are talking about l-a-w law tax cuts, the promise not to increase the Medicare levy, the sale of Qantas, the privatisation of federal airports or the privatisation of Telstra; what is consistent in all these cases is the government's deception of the Australian people. At every opportunity this government twists and manipulates the truth in a cynical attempt to retain power at all costs. So watch for the election. It is going to be peppered. It is going to be featuring dirty tactics by the government the like of which I do not think this country has yet seen. This is a morally bankrupt government and their spectacular reversal on the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank simply confirms it, and indeed is a precursor to their intention to sell Telstra. Let us look further at their announcements. The government said that they would sell off the rest of the bank in two tranches and have a share buyback of government shares onlynot on offer to ordinary mum and dad type shareholders-that would take up $1 billion of the bank's money. And they would do all this by legislation and not need a shareholders meeting. Following a statement by Mr Willis to the bank, who wrote to all shareholders on 12 May, all shareholders were informed that there would not be a need for a shareholders meeting. This was duly reported by the Financial Review on 25 May 1995, saying that the government would do it all by legislation. The bill, in clause 20, refers to the buyback, albeit indirectly. Historically, I think it is important to look at the bank's initial response to the proposal of both the sale and the buyback. Their first reaction was recorded on 9 May in a media release. That release was very cautious on the buyback option and listed a number of conditions which must be met before they would be agreeable to it. Relevantly, the conditions included an independent expert report and shareholders approvals, including special resolution, required by the Corporations Law or the Australian Stock Exchange listing rules or considered neces!\ary by the board of the bank, for matters such as: any selective buyback; any necessary amendments to the bank's memorandum and articles of assocIatIOn which remove all special rights to the Commonwealth, apart from its right to appoint a director; dealings with the bank's majority shareholder; and any necessary approvals from regulatory authorities. Other conditions were that the bank and the government reach agreement on acceptable transition arrangements for the Commonwealth guarantee of the bank's liabilities and, importantly, that the bank and the government reach agreement on the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank. This is certainly not met. The explanatory memorandum sets out very clearly that the future of the bank remains undecided. The bank added: The board of the bank believes consideration of legislation by the parliament in the budget session would be helpful for the maintenance of an orderly market for the bank's shares and the certainty of the sale and buyback process. Well, we certainly did not get that, did we? Here we are, five months later, and we are given five days notice for consideration of the bill. At this stage, I think it is important to examine the condition the bank put on their tacit approval to the plans of the government; that was, the important point that there needed to be agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the bank on the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank. The Commonwealth Development Bank is the bank for little people. It is for farmers. It is for small business people. It is for people who cannot get money elsewhere. It has a special charter in the Commonwealth Banks Act presently which tells the Commonwealth Bank how it must carry out those lending procedures. It is interesting to note that, as stated in a document of 1993, Mr Keating's piggery group of companies had a loan of in excess of $2 million from the Commonwealth Development Bank. I think there is an obligation on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to explain to us how he was perceived to be a needy client or to be meeting the criteria of the charter to get the loan. But, of course, we have a very rich Prime Minister who does not share with us where he gets his money. The bill provides for the conversion of the Commonwealth Development Bank into a company limited by shares under the Corporations Law with the name Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia Ltd. The share capital of the Commonwealth Development Bank will continue to be 91.9 per cent owned by the Commonwealth Bank and 8.1 per cent owned by the Commonwealth, as is currently the position. The existing charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank-that is the one that is now in legislation-provides finance, where it would not otherwise be available, on reasonable or suitable terms and conditions, having regard primarily to cash flow and prospects rather than security so that its focus is on development. Tha,t charter is no longer to be enshrined in law; it is to be placed in the memorandum of association of the new Commonwealth Development Bank Ltd. However, the explanatory memorandum states, in relation to that agreement, 'The bill does not define the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank'. As I said, this is the bank that little people need to rely upon. The Commonwealth Development Bank's existing charter as defined will be repealed and replaced, as I said, in the memorandum. It further states, 'The Commonwealth will continue to pay an annual subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank to undertake the banking activities defined in its charter.' But it does not define what this subsidy arrangement will be. This, again, is left to be defined in the shareholders agreement to be entered into between the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank before the transfer time. The transfer time is defined in the legislation as 'the time at which the Commonwealth ceases to have the status of being the holder of more than 50 per cent of the shares in the bank'. It is clear that this does not meet the important condition for the board to consider a buyback, as set out in the board's media release of 9 May. If a buyback takes place, as foreshadowed in the bill, it means that the board has been rolled by the government into submission at the expense of ordinary shareholders as well small business and rural and export sectors which are dependent on the venture capital for which that Commonwealth Development Bank is unique. Indeed, the stage is set for the demise of the Commonwealth Development Bank. Specifically, the government is not bound to continue the subsidy. The bank in its 1995 report, which is yet to be tabled, uses words similar to those used in its last year's reportthat it requires the subsidy to successfully carry out the charter. Specifically in the report yet to be tabled, it says: The Bank's objective remains to achieve a proper commercial balance between the consequences of the charter and the size of any subsidy received support of it. In other words, the Commonwealth Bank is saying in its report that it relies on the subsidy to carry out the charter-not on the guarantee. Let us have a look in more detail. The explanatory memorandum states that the shareholders agreement is to be entered into between the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank and it will provide for the existing charter, as currently defined in the sections which are to be repealed by the legislation. The existing statutory provisions are to be replaced in the terms of the shareholders agreement, as I have said. Section 74A of the Commonwealth Bank Act 1959, which currently provides for a capital injection by the Commonwealth to the Commonwealth Development Bank, is also being repealed by item 27 of the schedule to the bill. The 1994 annual report of the Commonwealth Bank states that, in consetions quence of this amendment to the Commonwealth wealth Bank Act 1959, there was to be injection of $30 million to the capital of Commonwealth Development Bank, which bill resulted in the Commonwealth having its holding of 8.1 per cent of issued capital. Section 85A of the Commonwealth Bank Compression Act, which provides for the grant of financial assistance to the Commonwealth Development Bank by the Commonwealth, is being reincreasing pealed by item 29 of the schedule. The 1994 business annual report records that the Commonwealth Development Bank received a subsidy of $20 million to the year ended 30 June 1994, and the budget papers for 1995-96 show that the sum of $20.6 million has been provided for payment of subsidies to the Commonwealth Bank for the year ended 30 June 1996. In view of the significant role played by the Commonwealth Development Bank for small business and the rural and export sectors, it is amazing that the government should attempt to rush through a bill for the sale of its shares in the Commonwealth Bank without laying bare its agenda for the Commonwealth Development Bank. The government's poor planning is only matched by its ineptitude and policy somersaults in attempting to effect the sale of the in shares of the AIDC Ltd where its current policy is to acquire the minority shares disregarding its policy on full privatisation for the AIDC. No thought seems to have been given by the government to the question of whether the activities of the AIDC Ltd and those of the Commonwealth Development Bank could not have been brought under the one umbrella organisation. This would release the Commonwealth Bank of carrying out the public authority functions of the Commonwealth Development Bank on the basis of a Commonwealth subsidy promised in a shareholders agreement, notwithstanding that section 74C of the bill makes the point that the Commonwealth Development Bank, when restructured after the enactment of the bill, is not to be taken to be a Commonwealth authority or Commonwealth company. The board of the Commonwealth Bank must indeed be disappointed that its expectafor a firm policy stance of the Commonon the future of the Commonwealth an Development Bank and its annual subsidy the have not be forthcoming in tandem with this for the sale of its shares. Under the title 'Looking forward' in the 1995 annual report, the bank states: of interest margins due to increased competition from commercial banks will continue during 1995-96. To counter this the Development Bank will focus on three key elements of strategy penetration of the small and medium market, particularly manufacturing and the service sectors with export potential, increasing penetration in rural and major urban areas and reinforcing its role as a specialist bank focusing on clients' prospects for success in business. However, as noted at page 5, the future of the Development Bank is currently the subject of a review by government. The bank's objective remains to achieve a proper commercial balance between the consequences of the charter and the size of any subsidy received in support of it. Thus when the explanatory memorandum states that the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank will be retained in the memorandum of the Commonwealth Development Bank, coupled with the repeal of section 85A, providing financial assistance to that bank by way of government subsidies, it will in reality be a charter without substance because the memorandum can be amended under the Corporations Law. In the absence of a subsidy, the Commonwealth Development Bank will be compelled to do away with its specialist lending facilities and put all its loans on a strict commercial basis. This will see the end of the special role that it has met. It is true that the bill provides in clause 117(2) that the Commonwealth guarantees the due payment by the Commonwealth Development Bank of any amount that is payable by that bank to a person other than the Commonwealth. Despite the existence of the guarantee, it is clear from the stance of the board that it is only prepared to tailor its specialist lending facility to the subsidy and not to the guarantee. There might well be no alternative under the Corporations Law in view of the due diligence obligations of directors of the Commonwealth Bank. What this bill does, in effect, is enable the Commonwealth to rid itself of the shares to meet its budgetary requirements and saddle a wholly privatised Commonwealth Bank with the Commonwealth Development Bank whose charter is both without substance and lacking the specific terms of subsidy. In the absence of these terms, the directors could revert to the normal commercial terms of lending. As I said, the scene is set for the demise of the Commonwealth Development Bank. The explanatory memorandum does not indicate the terms of the shareholders agreement in so far as the subsidy is concerned. It merely states that the Commonwealth Bank will have an option to purchase the Commonwealth shares in the Commonwealth Development Bank in the event that the Commonwealth decides to sell its shareholding or if an adequate annual Commonwealth subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank was not paid. Thus it must be inferred that the shareholders agreement would not give any definite undertakings binding the Commonwealth to an adequate level of subsidy to enable the directors to carry out the terms of the charter in the memorandum. Further, the door has been left open for the Commonwealth Bank to wind up the operations of the Commonwealth Development Bank based on commercial consideration by acquiring the shares held by the Commonwealth on the grounds that the subsidy is inadequate-a very neat little plot. The explanatory memorandum also states that the Commonwealth Bank will not exercise its voting power to amend the memorandum of the Commonwealth Development Bank while an adequate Commonwealth subsidy is in place. But this poses the question: what is an adequate subsidy? With the Commonwealth Development Bank deciding to discharge its fiduciary relationships under the Corporations Law, it again means that the question of adequacy remains simply indeterminate. The terms of the shareholders agreement cannot override the provisions of section 74B(6)(c), which states that nothing in section 74A prevents a change in the structure, memorandum, articles or membership of the Development Bank. In addition, there is no provision in the bill which seeks to override the provisions of the Corporations Law regarding the effecting of amendments to the memorandum. It is therefore clear that the terms of the shareholders agreement will be crucial to the continued operations of the Commonwealth Development Bank in serving the present and future needs of small business and rural and export sectors. The government should place before the parliament the terms of the proposed shareholders agreement, including the undertakings in relation to the payment of subsidies, to clarify the future of the Development Bank post privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank-as my amendment sets out. The terms of the shareholders agreement will also be of significance to any buyback of shares held by the Commonwealth prior to the sale of the balance of the shares to the public. The buyback will deplete the Commonwealth Bank of funds which might otherwise provide for the Commonwealth Development Bank to discharge any obligations under the charter in its memorandum. Such a withdrawal of funds-a billion dollars-if not accompanied by a binding contract by the Commonwealth to pay the Development Bank for carrying out its charter would compound the position for other shareholders in the Commonwealth Bank. The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1995 inserted a new share buyback provision in division 4B. The section which did this, section 206A, states: These rules are designed to protect the interests of shareholders and creditors by: (a) addressing the risk of buy-back activity leading to the company's insolvency (b) seeking to ensure fairness between the company's shareholders (c) requiring the company to disclose all material information. Although the bill foreshadows the possibility of a buyback, it does not spell out the details. Advice I received from the bank today confirms that a selective buyback will take place and that the necessary extraordinary general meeting of shareholders will in fact take place. However, it is wise to observe that, in the new simplification law, there is a provision for exempting the need to have a shareholders meeting and that would be gained from the Australian Securities Commission. Therefore, it is necessary to address that point, particularly with the need to provide for just terms for any acquisition of property in accordance with section 51(xxxi) of the constitution. Under the provisions of the shareholders meeting, the Commonwealth, as an interested party, will not be able to vote, and it is necessary for a majority of 75 per cent of the remaining 49 per cent of private shareholders in the bank to vote in favour of the proposal. But having regard to the needs of mums and dads-who comprise the majorIty of the dispersed share ownership, other than the Commonwealth-it is necessary that their interests are protected in a buyback which may circumvent that approval. It is relevant to note that in the prospectus to the secondary share offer of 178 million shares on 24 September 1993, the government said: It is also possible for the government to initiate amendments to legislation which, if enacted by the Australian parliament, could reduce its role or increase it. There were two roles for the government to play-one, the majority shareholder and, two, the guarantor. The prospectus also said: The completion of the offer will not affect the current guarantee of all moneys owed by the Commonwealth Bank, as guarantee is made pursuant to section 117 of the bank's act as amended. The only problem is that, with the final privatisation, that guarantee will go. The prospectus also stated categorically that on completion of the offer the only change would occur in the reduction of the Commonwealth shareholding, which would not be less than 50.1 per cent. Again and again there are undertakings given to people who become shareholders that the government would remain a shareholder and, indeed, a majority shareholder and that the guarantee would remain in place. The government should provide undertakings that any buy-back, whether put to a meeting of the shareholders under section 206E(l) of the Corporations Law or whether granted exemption on terms to be set out by the Australian Securities Commission under section 206E(4) of the Corporations Law, must be on just terms in accordance with section 51(xxxi) of the constitution. The two other matters that I want to briefly deal with in the time that remains are the question of restrictions on foreign ownership and the important question of regulations, because clause 19 of the bill we are debating allows regulations to be made with a retrospective effect. Very simply on the restriction of foreign ownership under the legislation which remains in place-there are various acts that affect this-the aggregate foreign investment permissible under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act is 40 per cent. Foreign acquisitions beyond this trigger the aggregate control interest provisions requiring foreign investors and the bank to notify the Foreign Investment Review Board. Individual shareholding under the Banks (Shareholdings) Act is 10 per cent. Subsection 10(1) says that the Treasurer can give an exemption up to 15 per cent. But, once again, nothing has been learned from the Qantas privatisation, where every remedy to overcome a problem where the shareholding foreign ownership goes over the required limits is all retrospective. There is no plan in the legislation to prevent its happening. On the question of regulations, which I again address in my amendments, clause 19 enables regulations to be made regarding any savings or transitional matters arising out the Commonwealth's sale of its shares in the bank or related matters arising out of an enactment of the bill. Subclause 19(3) states that regulations can take effect retrospectively but not earlier than the transfer time. If a share buy-back takes place as a first step in the sale process, as is to be expected, the transfer time will coincide with the buy-back and the regulations could therefore cover the buy-back. The explanatory memorandum justifies the need for retrospectivity on the basis that regulations relating to savings and transitional matters may not be able to commence before the date they are notified in the Gazette, thereby potentially frustrating the sale. It is not clear whether the commercial considerations require the need for retrospectivity of regulations, which is achieved by providing that the provisions of 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act do not apply to these regulations made pursuant to section 19 and take effect on or after the transfer time. The possibility that regulations may cover the buyback is an additional reason for making provision that any acquisition of property in consequence of the buy-back be on just terms under section 51(xxxi) of the constitution. Thus, whilst not denying the bill its second reading in this House, I urge the House to support my amendment because once again we are seeing three things happen in relation to lack of planning: firstly, lack of planning means that the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank is now at the very best uncertain; secondly, lack of planning as to how the facility for small business and rural and export manufacturers could have been addressed by using the AIDC; and, thirdly, lack of planning so that we have to have retrospectivity with regard to the regulations and a backflip with regard to the need to hold a shareholders meeting when the government maintained it could all be done by legislation. I commend my amendment to the House.",31
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AMENDMENT BILL,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Truss-I second the amendment.,36
28,Mr LATHAM,AMENDMENT BILL,"Werriwa) (11.34 a.m.}-At the outset, let me express my surprise to hear the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) of all people calling me 'old'. Let me express my absolute shock to hear the member for Mackellar of all people describing other members as 'desperate'. When it comes to desperation, she has got a PhD. When it comes to her performance as a shadow minister in this place, she makes the keystone cops look like cool, hard-headed, clinical, effective public sector administrators. The purpose of my contribution to this debate on the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill is not to address the concerns of the far Right, particularly those of the member for Mackellar. Rather-I note that the name of the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) appears on the speakers list-I will be addressing my remarks to the concerns of the far Left. You can see that as ever I am taking a moderate, centrist, pragmatic approach to this sort of legislation. Mr Truss-Are you still hoping to get them on side?",36
29,Mr LATHAM,AMENDMENT BILL,"For the edification of the member for Wide Bay, let me give some of the history. On 16 August 1947, following a meeting of the federal Labor cabinet, the then Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, issued the following 43-word statement: Cabinet today authorised the Attorney-General, Dr Evatt, and myself to prepare legislation for submission to the federal parliamentary Labor Party for the nationalisation of banking other than state banks with proper protection for the shareholders, depositors, borrowers and staffs of private banks. This legislation before the House today completes the denationalisation of the Commonwealth Bank. In this regard, I am sure some members, including the member for Wills, will say that the legislation is contrary to Labor tradition and, as such, it should be opposed. I am very strongly convinced that the legislation is consistent with Labor Party traditions-those that emphasise goals instead of methods and those that emphasise ends instead of means. It raises the issue of party tradition and its relevance to contemporary policy making. It is self-evident that tradition should never be seen as an end in itself. Tradition is at its most useful when it is guiding the goals and objectives of a party and is not leading to confusion between goals and methods or between ends and means. I maintain that the Labor Party's goals in 1995 are no different from those in 1947. We still want a more equal, a more tolerant and a more independent Australia. We still want the public sector to play a liberating and equalising role in our society. It is just that our methods, our means and our policy tools throughout this period have sensibly changed in response to social and economic changes not just here in Australia but throughout the civilised world. There is no sense in clinging to tradition for tradition's sake. There is no sense in clinging to tradition if the very purpose of the traditional approach to policy has changed, and I want to demonstrate this point in two ways. First, I want to talk about Chifley's proposal for bank nationalisation. Let us go behind the romance of the history. Let us go behind the myth making that has been so prominent from that period. Chifley' s nationalisation announcement was in response to a decision by the High Court of Australia to declare constitutionally invalid the government's banking bills. The purpose of those bills was to regulate and to supervise the operation of private banks to ensure, as much as possible, they operated in the public interest. Those things are already in place. Ironically, those things were achieved by the banking legislation of the Menzies government in the 1950s. We have a licensing system for private banks, which was one of Chifley's purposes. We have minimum deposits that need to be held by the private banks. I refer to page 40 of the recent annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia, which states: In line with internationally accepted standards, Australian banks are required to maintain risk weighted capital ratios of at least eight per cent including at least four per cent in the form of tier I or core capital which comprises items such as ordinary shares and retained earnings and provides depositors with the surest protection against losses. There is absolutely no doubt that the central purpose of Chifley's legislation with regard to the supervision of private banks is in place. It is supported, I would assume, on both sides of the House. There is no dispute about these matters. The recent report of the Reserve Bank also refers to developments in supervision. It states: Prudential supervision of banks continues to evolve in response to local and international developments. Major activities during the past decade have focused on: (1) ensuring that banks maintain capital buffers commensurate with the risk in their business (2) encouraging banks to establish and maintain sound risk management systems and (3) strengthening mechanisms for the early detection of potential problems. The regulations are in place. The public risks are being covered. This raises the point of the need for vigilance with regard to bank regulation. I know many members have been concerned about fees and charges. This is an area where the government needs to take a strong hand. Regulations and legislation need to be closely examined. We need to recognise that banking in the 1990s is an essential part of life. People cannot survive these days without banking, just as they cannot survive without food, clothing or shelter. There is room for a government mandated approach, room for legislation which provides a basic low cost package in the banking sector. Regulations are in place already, but there is always the need to update the approach across time. The core lesson of this is that governments do not have to own banks to govern their operations; they do not have to own banks to supervise the operations of the banking sector. No-one in this House-absolutely no member of this parliament-can pretend that in recent years the Commonwealth Bank, with its commercial charter, has operated any differently, any more in the public interest, than the private banking sector. One only needs to look at the record on fees and charges to find the best proof of that proposition. Let me return to Chifley's nationalisation announcement. The second purpose of that proposition was to establish a central bank function to ensure government control of monetary policy. This was a logical response at the end of the 1940s to the establishment of the Bretton Woods agreement for fixed exchange rates and the establishment of a new world economic order. Chifley's Commonwealth Bank Bill established the words later repeated in the Reserve Bank Act 1959, ironically introduced by the Menzies government. Let me quote to you the words in Chifley's legislation, in his Commonwealth Bank Bill: It shall be the duty of the Commonwealth Bank, within the limits of its powers, to pursue a monetary and banking policy directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia and to exercise its powers under this Act and the Banking Act 1945 in such a manner as will best contribute to(a) the stability of the currency of Australia; (b) the maintenance of full employment in Australia; and (c) the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. This today remains the charter of the Reserve Bank of Australia. I urge all members to go to the recent annual report and open up the front cover. On the inside they will find that those words are repeated chapter and verse. The purpose of Chifley's banking reforms in the late 1940s have been fulfilled. So we should be celebrating the fact that Chifley's goals have been satisfied without the need for nationalisation or Commonwealth ownership of the Commonwealth Bank. Chifley's goals, his central goals in the late 1940s, have been satisfied without tying up scarce public resources which could be better used elsewhere-for education, reskilling, infrastructure and social equity programs-in the 1990s. I seriously believe that Labor's goals have been fulfilled in the banking sector, the goals that Chifley himself established in the late 1940s. In 1995 we can celebrate not only Chifley's success but also that of Andrew Fisher who, in 1911, established the Commonwealth Bank. Let me quote from the then Labor Prime Minister and Treasurer in his second reading speech on the Commonwealth Bank Bill 1911: This will be a bank belonging to the people and directly managed by the people's own agents. It will ultimately become the bank of banks rather than being a mere money lending institution. Our chief aim is not to make profits but to ensure safety and security to depositors. The first of his two goals in the second reading speech for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank has been long satisfied by the banking standards that we have in place in Australia. The bank of banks, the central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, is effectively controlling monetary policy in Australia. The second objective, to ensure the safety and security of depositors, has been satisfied. There is absolutely no question that that goal has been satisfied in the 1990s. One can logically conclude out of this that public ownership of the Commonwealth Bank cannot enhance either goal-the role of the Commonwealth Bank as a bank of banks, as a central bank, and the safety and security of depositors-because the Commonwealth Bank for many years has been operating with a commercial charter. We need to appreciate that the so-called Labor tradition in this area was a response to the collapse of the financial sector in the depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s. Labor's response was a crude instrument of public ownership. Today, our response is much more sophisticated, adept and relevant. Labor's policy on banking, as shown in this legislation, recognises the globalisation of financial markets. Let me give some statistics, and I hope that the member for Wills is taking note. In 1975, the international bank lending volume was $265 billion. By 1994, it had increased by a factor of 16 to $4,200 billion, or $4.2 trillion. In 1980 the total stock of financial assets traded globally was $5,000 billion. By 1992 this had increased sevenfold to $35,000 billion, twice the GDP of the OECD nations. MCKinseys have forecast that this market will increase to a massive $83 trillion by the year 2000. The big challenge for left of centre parties is how to respond to the globalisation of capital. I would argue that international cooperation is the only effective means by which national governments can respond to the internationalisation of capital-the only effective means by which governments can playa countervailing role in supervising and regulating the movement of capital and in supervising and regulating the financial sector-all in the public interest. I find the response of leftist economic nationalists, like the member for WiIIs, totally inadequate. They are trying to defy the internationalisation of capital, and defy it in a way that is totally unrealistic and totally This biII asks: why should the Commonwealth maintain its $4.5 billion stake in the Commonwealth Bank in an attempt to influence a $83 trillion industry? The statistics are so overwhelming. Why should the Commonwealth government, with an opportunity cost in its investment, try to maintain its $4.5 billion investment in the Commonwealth Bank in an attempt to influence a $83 trillion international industry? When you look at the proportion of that investment to the global market, the percentage is 0.00542 per cent. That is, the Commonwealth government's half holding in the Commonwealth Bank is 0.00542 per cent of the international financial market. What sort of influence can you have on those sorts of figures? What sort of countervailing role can the government play through public ownership? It is an absurd, completely irrelevant and unrealistic proposition in the 1990s. Some would say that the Commonwealth Bank has a role to play with regard to symbolism-symbolism of what Labor governments used to do. In my experience, particularly in my working-class electorate, symbolism is a middle-class luxury. I would caution anyone in the Labor Party or those on the broader Left of politics to be most careful about the way in which they look at the symbolism of the money power. Things evolved in Labor history through fear of the money power. It was an ideology that wove together issues of nationalism, imperialism, monopoly, democracy, class and race into a grand conspiracy theory. It served as a populist tool in the national debate. But like all populist tools, the money power thesis had its scapegoats. It was deeply and irreversibly anti-Semitic. That extended from left wing members of the Labor Party in the 1920s, like Frank Anstey in Victoriasomeone the member for Wills would describe as a good bloke-to the Right in New South Wales, like the Auburn plute, Jack Lang. I urge members to read Jack Lang's writing about the money power. It is deeply and irreversibly anti-Semitic. This is hardly an enlightened or progressive tradition. It is, more likely, racist and primitive in its apuntenable. proach to public issues. Symbolism has an opportunity cost-the opportunity cost of how the public investment could be used elsewhere. The Commonwealth's 50.4 per cent share in the Commonwealth Bank has a market value of $4.5 billion. It is a part of the 1995-96 budget strategy to recognise that the macro impact of a $4 billion fiscal tightening has the same effect as a one per cent tightening of interest rates. The denationalisation of the Commonwealth Bank thereby reduces the Commonwealth's call on financial markets. It has a positive impact downwards on interest rates in Australia. Further to the issue of symbolism, I would like to apply the Claymore test. Claymore is a public housing estate in my electorate, an area that is genuinely struggling to find employment and the social and economic skills required in our post-industrial society. Quite truthfully, public ownership, by the Claymore test, counts for little. I recently distributed 30,000 survey sheets to electors in Werriwa. There was not a single mention in the responses of the denationalisation of the Commonwealth Bank. But the mainstream issues for left-of-centre parties in the 1990s are very clear from working-class opinion: they are all about finding employment, getting a job; they are all about getting a good HSC result; they are all about the first generation in working families taking out a university degree; and they are all about acquiring economic and social skills-not ownership-for the information age. I would rather spend $4.5 billion on education reform, on tackling the education disadvantage in working-class areas by linking the home learning environment to the school learning environment through new forms of information technology. I would rather spend $4.5 billion on providing extra public sector jobs in low skill, low demand regions, like the south-west of Sydney. I would rather spend large slabs of public resources on the redistribution of government facilities to areas of greatest need. I would rather spend $4.5 billion on public housing renewal, on labour market programs and on the introduction of universal case management for disadvantaged parts of our community. I would rather spend $4.5 billion on refashioning the effectiveness of the welfare state, in response to an information based society. A lot of these reforms are expensive and intensive in their administration. Reformist government-government interested in social justice in the 1990s--cannot bear the opportunity cost of having billions of dollars of public resources locked away in areas of ownership when these genuine equity tasks are outstanding. There is an old saying that if you are not a socialist at 20 years of age you have no heart. I am sure that applies to the member for Mackellar at any age. The saying goes on that if you are still a socialist at 40 years of age you have no head. The combination of those two things applies perfectly to the member for Wills. That is not to suggest that he is not genuine. The member for Wills is genuine in his goals, but he is confusing goals with methods and confusing ends with means. That is the sign of a confused thinker, someone who is not clear on the sorts of goals and relevance that we require for public sector administration. The Labor Party's goals are still the same. The strong in our society have a responsibility to help the weak. Active government can play a positive, equalising and liberating role in our society. It is just that our methods and our means have altered. Public ownership no longer satisfies equity goals. Public ownership is not an end in itself; it is not satisfying the sorts of social justice objectives the Labor government has and should continue to have in the 1990s.",36
30,Mr CADMAN,AMENDMENT BILL,"I respect very much the opinion on economic matters of my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who has just resumed his seat. He is one of the people in the Labor Party who argues a consistent line. I watched him when he was Chairman of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, taking in nine councils of the western part of Sydney, and I know that he has a very authentic view about economic management. He has been consistent prior to his entry into parliament and since being here. One of the problems, however, is that the ducking and weaving of the Labor Party, to eventually come to a position that he has endorsed at the very beginning, is destructive and distracting for the whole of the Australian community. The fact that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) is prepared to issue a letter in the prospectus signing off on further sales of the Commonwealth Bank has damaged the investing confidence of hundreds of thousands of small investors. I know of people who used their life savings, $5,000, to buy shares in the Commonwealth Bank, expecting that this would be their one and only chance. Having made that purchase-and they are lifetime clients of the Commonwealth Bank; there are hundreds of people in these circumstancesthey find that the government is going to catch them on capital gains tax, and they cannot afford that. They are looking at this package of $5,000 as something to pass on to their families. Not only that, but the government then dilutes the whole process by moving for a further sale. I have no objection to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, but the uncertainty, the toing and froing, the sudden gaping holes in budgets, the inability to manage and plan ahead that the government has demonstrated, are completely at odds with the consistent line that has been run by the honourable member for Werriwa. I think it is a tragedy that there is not a better sense of direction and management. One has only to look at the broad accounts of the Commonwealth to realise that Australia is in desperate circumstances. We are running a massive deficit, one of the largest of any nations in the world, yet we have got massively increasing taxation, in a period in which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is claiming that taxation will be kept to a minimum and he will promote massive changes relating to the needs of middle income earners. He has not done that. Taxation has increased as a percentage of gross domestic product. At the same time, we have had to enter into the sale of what amounts to the Australian silver. This is one of the last remaining institutions to be sold by the Australian Labor Party. The next one will be Telstra, and they will sell it after the election, if they should win the election. There is no doubt about that; they have to plug the hole. The profligate spending that they have gone on with has been to no advantage for most Australians. They will keep saying that it is not the Commonwealth that has a problem with the foreign debt; it is not the Commonwealth that has borrowed money. But they cannot explain away the fact that there is a $9 billion interest bill in every budget to pay the interest charges on the funds that we have borrowed. Every year, that is ticking over. It is as big the education or health budgets. We are borrowing at the same time, and we are selling assets at the same time. If we were a private company run by any of the great businessmen who are friends of the Prime Minister, we would not only be called before the stock exchange but we would be disbanded as a nation. The member for Werriwa has argued a consistent line, so I have got no problems with many of the things he said about privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank; that is his view. But I know he would also be concerned about the fact that the debt is so large that we are hitting Australians with high tax rates and we are flogging off the silver at the same time. I do not know where the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, thin-s Australia is going to finish, because there IS always the promise of turning the comer, but we never quite get there. There is always the promise, but next year you sell a bit more, or next year you increase taxes somewhat, or next year the interest charges go up, or next year something else will be sold. It just goes on and on, getting worse. All that seems to be of concern to the parliamentary secretary and members of the Australian Labor Partybarring the member who has just resumed his seat-is to retain office. They do not care where they lead Australia as long as they appear to be in front. I think President Chirac said something very significant yesterday when he said that you are followers and not leaders. All you do is stay in front of the opinion polls. to retain your popularity and let the Australian community rumble you along in any direction that the whim of the day happens to take them. You do not go below the surface and find the distress there is at the size of the foreign debt and at the fact that we no longer own Australia and foreigners have us captive to their economic circumstances. You do not go below the surface. All you do is rumble along in front of an opinion poll driven attitude to government. President Chirac was exa-tIy right in summarising the attitude of the Pnme as Minister this morning. He said, 'They are not leaders; they are followers.' That is the problem with the leadership in Australia today. This latest effort, the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995, is the final part of the process. There are a number of issues that are of concern to the opposition, but my major concern is what the government is going to do with the Commonwealth Development Bank. That bank, with a charter and history of support for primary industries, small industries and manufacturing, has been the very core of prospects for new and dev-lop!ng businesses and for carry-on and consolidatIOn funds for established businesses. The farms of Australia are littered with tractors and equipment bought through the Commonwealth Development Bank. There are factories full of machinery and equipment purchased through the Commonwealth Development Bank. There are small businesses running today that would not be there if it were not for the Commonwealth Development Bank. There are medium and large businesses which were established by loans from the Commonwealth Development Bank. But here you are again coming into this House with a framework of legislation that is devoid of detail, devoid of regulation and devoid of the very essence of your intentions and you expect the House to accept, once more, the proposition that the Commonwealth Bank be sold, regardless of the circumstances or the future of the Development Bank. The Commonwealth Development Bank, one of the great establishments and institutions of this nation, has played its role in this nation's development from a pastoral, grazing, farming and cropping economy to a diverse manufacturing and tertiary industry. That role has been most significant. This government and successive governments have had all sorts of schemes to assist farmers and to assist small businesses and manufacturing industries but none of them have worked the way the Commonwealth Development Bank has or with the success it has had. I cannot understand why the Labor Party caucus would walk away from what must be one of the institutions of Australia simply for the sake of making a sale because the Treasurer and the Prime Minister need the dough to pour into the coffers. That is the principle you as a party are prepared to sell out on in relation to the Commonwealth Development Bank. You are not prepared to request them to provide the detail. You are not prepared to hold things up until there is certainty not only for both those who have borrowed and the long-term borrowers of the Development Bank but also for the future of further borrowers. What is the position now for small business and farmers seeking to establish a firm understanding of their financial commitments, opportunities, prospective expansion and prospective consolidation of both farms and factories if they do not know whether or not there is going to be a Commonwealth Development Bank? The whole process that you have used is typical of the Qantas sale, typical of the airports sale and now typical of the Commonwealth Bank sale. They are all a standard-a hopeless standard. The whole thing you guys have done is to be prepared to sell out Australia no matter what the conditions and circumstances are. Where are the commitments from the government in regard to these matters? You are going to sell the remaining 50.39 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. You are just going to roll that out. You are going to sell to whoever comes along. You have some caveats on foreign ownership. For goodness sake, this is not what Australians expect you to do with one of their great assets. I can imagine what the cries would be from the Australian Labor Party if it were a Liberal government making this sale. There would be accusations of mates in high places and of deals done with foreigners to sell this bank. Yet we have the Australian Labor Party, driven by the Prime Minister, prepared to sell the Commonwealth Bank-but it is not even to take the care and proper caution in the retention of the Commonwealth Development Bank. We know that in your party room this is a matter of contention and that those who are concerned about the Commonwealth Development Bank were narrowly rolled in a division. The difference between our parties is that if there is that sort of contention in our party room we stay there and talk until we can get a resolution. We make decisions by consensus; we do not vote like you guys. You have almost 50 per cent of your party disagreeing with this legislation. You have almost 50 per cent of your party concerned, as we are concerned, about the future of the development bank; yet the number-crunchers and those who want to suck up the benefits of the sale and tip it into the budget-they do not gain any permanent benefit from it-have driven this thing until the Commonwealth Bank is finally sold. Now you have completed the plan for the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. There was a letter from the then Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, included in the prospectus to investors in September 1993. He said: The Government has no intention whatever of further reducing its shareholding.",40
31,Mr COBB,AMENDMENT BILL,A man of his word!,43
32,Mr CADMAN,AMENDMENT BILL,"Oh, yes! We have the best Prime Minister money can buy. If you can find $20,000, you can talk to the Prime Minister any time. This is the way these guys operate. Here is Mr Willis saying to shareholders, the hundreds of thousands of small investors who invested in the Commonwealth Bank, 'We've changed our mind. We're going to sell the remaining 50.39 per cent.' The same sort of thing occurred in relation to Qantas. On 20 May 1986 the then Minister for Transport and Aviation, Peter Morris, in response to a question, said: I can assure the honourable member that the Government's policy is that both Qantas and Trans Australia Airlines will remain in full public ship. Where is it 10 years later? Gone. I do not understand the way in which you make these decisions. Furthermore, Qantas is generally owned by British Airways. So there is Australia's flag carrier out the door along with the Commonwealth Bank. What about the Federal Airports Corporation? The Labor Party's position in the 1991 platform was: . . . Labor will ensure the Federal Airports Corporation remains in full public ownership, operate on an efficient basis and continue to develop along competitive lines and establish similar publicly owned undertakings, where appropriate ... The Airports (Transitional) Bill 1995 and the Airports Bill 1995 went through this parliament just last week. The Federal Airports Corporation is privatised. So, time and again, despite the statements and the promises to the electorate, this Labor Party is prepared to go back on its promises and renege on everything it has made a commitment on. Telstra is the next one. I remind the House that in February 1993 the Prime Minister, in the Investing in the Nation statement, said: The Keating Government will retain full Government ownership of Telecom. But on Lateline in June 1994-only 18 months later-Kerry O'Brien asked: So it doesn't matter whether it'sthat is, Telecompublicly owned or privately owned? Paul Keating in response: Not of its essence, no. So within 18 months we see a backflip in his attitude to Telecom or Telstra. That is the next thing to be sold. I warn the Australian community and those workers in the unions that have so actively supported the government in Telecom.",43
33,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AMENDMENT BILL,It is your policy.,43
34,Mr CADMAN,AMENDMENT BILL,"We are not talking about our policy. We are not in government; you are in government. You are making commitments that have a legal status for the Australian community. You are in government. You are signing off on legislation, you are signing off on international agreements, you are owner- signing off on financial commitments for the Australian people and it is important that your record is fully understood by the Australian people. The Australian people need to understand that in relation to all of these-the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas, FAC and Telstra-you made a firm commitment not to sell them. You have sold all of them except Telstra. And now we see today the final sale of the Commonwealth Bank.",43
35,Mr COBB,AMENDMENT BILL,Australia Post is next.,43
36,Mr CADMAN,AMENDMENT BILL,"Australia Post before Telstra? That is a speculation. I wonder who would buy that. I think that would fit in with one of the communications magnates. Maybe they could see benefits in the combination of television, radio and newspapers plus postal services. Then we can add in Australia Post and Telstra, when that comes on the marketMrs Bishop-We are not selling Australia Post, but they would.",43
37,Mr CADMAN,AMENDMENT BILL,"I am reminded correctly that we are not selling Australia Post, but the Labor Party will. They will sell anything. They will even sell the Prime Minister. They are selling him for $20,000 a time. You can buy Paul Keating, an hour at a time, for $20,000.",43
38,Mr COBB,AMENDMENT BILL,No-one thinks he is worth it.,43
39,Mr CADMAN,AMENDMENT BILL,"I am sure you would not mind if I run a little auction here with the people in the galleries to see what they are prepared to bid for an hour with the Prime Minister because that is what it is going to get to. We should get the press gallery. Maybe they will pay $40,000 for one of their proprietors for a scoop story. It depends, I guess, on the quality. We have had much speculation on what people are prepared to spend or give for a meeting with the Prime Minister and other ministers. The fact of the matter is that their attitude to Australia's great institutions is the same attitude they have to their senior ministers: 'We will flog them if it is to our advantage. We will sell the Prime Minister's time. We will sell the Deputy Prime Minister's time. We will sell the time of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.' What does that imply? It implies the same thing it implies with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas, FAC, Telstra or anything. It implies that you are prepared to give over the control of that ministry or that person's responsibility to somebody else. It means that the Prime Minister is captive to those sponsors or purchasers for the time he is with them. Purchasing access is the ultimate in the sale of Australia's great institutions. I understand the intellectual argument. I do not disagree with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. But to leave it stranded after saying that you are not going to sell it, to leave the Commonwealth Development Bank in circumstances where nobody understands its future and where nobody knows who is going to lend to small businesses, farmers or manufacturers in the future, is the height of irresponsibility. You are prepared to rip the Commonwealth Bank out of the financial system and dump it on the open market. Not only that; you tear the very essence and the heart out of that Commonwealth banking system and just throw it away. You count it of no value. You are not prepared to place any value on the work of past generations in that banking system. (Time expired)  government is tired, cynical and corrupt. The sale of the Commonwealth Bank embodies all of these things perfectly. If one wanted a perfect demonstration of the bankruptcy of this government, not just in financial terms but in morality and principle, it would be hard to beat this legislation we are debating today. First, there is the financial bankruptcy. The Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) have told us that the sale of the government's remaining 50.39 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank is a vital part of the 1995-96 budget. This year's budget technically delivers a surplus of $718 million-and the crucial word here, of course, is 'technically'. When all the clever accounting tricks are seen through, when all the one-off items are discarded, the figures actually show a budget deficit closer to $8.5 billion-not, of course, that the government will have any of this. Again the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance rushed to assure us that, once the two tranches of the Commonwealth Bank shares have been disposed of, around $4.5 billion will have been raised. In other words, the sale of the final part of the government's share of the Commonwealth Bank is just part of a financial sleight of hand trick-and not a very convincing trick at that-designed to give the government a notional surplus at the bottom of its budget papers. Today's bill is part of the asset sales program that the government is using to fudge its budget figures. But we should also remember that in the past the government's successes in achieving its budgeted asset sales figures have been abysmal. We should remember that the government has only received $5.8 billion, or a paltry 53 per cent, of the $11 billion worth of projected revenue from asset sales it has written into budgets since 1987-88. In this year's budget the government has outlined plans to increase proceeds from asset sales from $55 million last financial year to $5.4 billion-an optimistic jump in anyone's language. It is lucky, perhaps, that they have such blue-chip offerings to sell such as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. Quite a few members of the ALP are not all that happy with what the government has put on offer. After all, the Commonwealth Bank, the people's bank, has been a Labor icon for so long-and this is where the moral bankruptcy comes in. When the Liberal Party suggested disposing of the bank a decade ago, many of the people who are putting out the 'for sale' sign today were scathing in their response. Ten years ago selling the Commonwealth Bank was derided as being one of the ultimate New Right heresies. Today, for just the same lot, it is simply a matter of good public policy. The 1890s, like the 1990s, were a time of recession for Australia and, like today, it was ordinary Australians who were hardest hit. The idea of a people's bank, a bank that was more than a mere money lending institution, became an important goal to the nascent labour movement. When Andrew Fisher's Labor government, the first ALP government with a majority in both houses, legislated to establish the Commonwealth Bank, the then Prime Minister told the House: . . . this will be a bank belonging to the people, directly managed by the people's own agents ... our chief aim is not to make profits, but to ensure safety and security to depositors. Something fairly dramatic must have happened in Labor's approach to banking over the years. In the 1980s and early 1990s, state banks run by Labor governments in Victoria and South Australia cost ordinary Australians billions of dollars. It was, of course, to pay off massive debts run up by the failure of the Victorian Labor government to properly govern its state bank that the first shares in the Commonwealth Bank were sold. Even then, Labor's attachment to state banking remained strong. Joan Kirner, the then Premier of Victoria, rejected a higher bid from Westpac to take over the State Bank of Victoria. Back then, the Prime Minister said: Mrs Kirner believed that the benefits to Victoria of having a publicly operated bank take over the business of ... the public state bank of Victoria, was worth more than $55 millions in terms of state interest. In other words, a state Labor government in desperate financial straits was prepared to go without $55 million of much needed asset sales just for some ideological point. Today that ideological point is going. When the sale of the bank was announced, the co-convener of the Left-the parliamentary secretary's own faction-Senator Bruce Childs, ran through all the predictable bits and pieces of Labor nostalgia. He said: We're not very happy about it. But then he told the truth. He said: I suppose I'd have to say that the Commonwealth Bank hasn't helped in recent times because there's been a great deal of criticism of the Commonwealth Bank behaving much more like a commercial bank in recent times, and there's certainly a fair bit of evidence of that. Of course there is, Senator. The Commonwealth Bank is run like any other bank. This government has a keen appreciation of history. It knows the value of tradition, particularly in times of rapid change. That is why it has stressed Labor icons like the Commonwealth Bank in the past. But when it needs cash all this goes out the window. The Commonwealth Bank is being sold, and and everything to do with its sale is a grand exercise in hypocrisy. When British Labour leader Tony Blair spoke to the News Corporation leadership conference in Queensland last July, he at least was honest enough to admit: There will, inevitably, be overlap between left and right in the politics of the twenty-first century. The era of the grand ideologies, all encompassing, all pervasive (and) total in their solutions ... is over. This should not have come as a surprise to any of us in Australia. Nick Greiner was talking about 'post ideological politics' half a decade ago. But the pragmatists of the ALP have developed a habit over the years of suddenly becoming old style class warriors when they think there might be a vote or two in it. When the British Conservative Party launched its big ticket privatisations of government bodies such as British Telecom and British Gas in 1985-84, Tory grandee and former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan warned against selling the family silver. Twenty thousand kilometres away, it was a cry the Australian Labor Party, then firmly convinced of the evils of privatisation, was happy to take up. Of course, since then, it has learnt that privatisations are not necessarily all bad. Privatisations and the notion of privatisation are not all bad in themselves, but how and why they are carried out can certainly be. Some of the initial privatisations carried out by the British Conservatives after 1979 when employees of small state enterprises were allowed to take over businesses that should never have been in government hands have been amongst the greatest privatisation success stories worldwide. There was much to be said for the notion of a share owning democracy, where small consumers would still have a significant say in the operation of largely privatised utilities, and with the proper regulatory framework and competition policies in place this could have worked. It has only been in its later privatisations, such as the break-up of British Rail, that the British Conservatives have slightly lost their way. The only beneficiaries of these seem to have been the consultants from large accounting firms. It is interesting to contrast the approach of the Tory Party to privatisation and the attitudes of the ALP that have led to today' s bill. The Conservatives were motivated by the absolute necessity of cutting back a state that had reached an insupportable size. They were motivated by the desire to give people a real interest in the companies they worked in and in the directions of the services they used. They may not have succeeded in all these things, but we should remember the intent. Here in Australia, under this government, the story has been entirely different. There has only ever been one reason for privatisation-extra cash. The Labor Party has been happy to use Macmillan's words when criticising the idea of privatisation but, when it has put the idea into practice this is exactly what it has done. The coalition does not oppose the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, but we believe there is a good cause for disquiet over how it is being sold. There are legitimate concerns over the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank over whether acquisition of property that arises as a consequence of the buyback of shares will be on just terms under section 51 (xxxi) of the constitution and over the retrospective effects of the regulations under this bill. We are also concerned as to why it is being sold. If the truth be told, it is clear that Labor has never had any coherent plan for privatisation nor any real motivation. Privatisation under the ALP has been an exercise in trickery and ad hoc politics. The government has simply sold off bits and pieces here and there to fund whatever grand design it has been promoting at the time. When the first big part of privatisations like Qantas were announced, the government felt obliged to call special party conferences to reassure its members of its commitment to majority public ownership and to try to convince them that at least some respect was being paid to party rules and traditions. As I said earlier, those of us on this side of the House do not oppose the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. The only real opposition comes from my colleague the member for Wills (Mr Cleary), who seems unable to progress from that paradigm of the first half of this century which saw the growth of the state as the provider of services. That does not mean that all the members opposite are happy with what their ministers have decided. After all, we should remember that the ALP national conference has voted to retain part of the bank in public hands. People like the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) have expressed their concerns. I again quote Senator Childs: In this case, I suppose we're saying that some of that debate took place, a very vigorous debate took place when the initial moves were made to privatise or partially privatise the Commonwealth Bank. We've been very vigorous in our opposition in those days. This is the culmination once you start going down that privatisation route ... we have a Budget decision and we're obviously not terribly happy about it, but because it has been made a Budget decision, there's little we can do about this. Their shame is obvious when you consider that only one has had the guts to speak to this bill. They have been steamrolled. Their party's traditions, not to mention policy making rules, count for nothing. To the Left, there is no point in fighting any more. It is not surprising that so many members of the government feel this way. Labor has no ,reasons for privatisation other than revenue raising. Privatisation is to the ALP what the local pawnshop is to a mug punter. It has been a quick and relatively easy way of grabbing a bit of cash. When the last batch of the Commonwealth Bank shares was sold in 1993, the then Minister for Finance wrote to all-investors reassuring them that 'the government has no intention whatever of further reducing its shareholding'. Eighteen months later, as Treasurer, he is flogging the lot off to produce a phoney budget surplus. The government has not privati sed to help consumers. It has not privati sed to make government enterprises more competitive. It has not privati sed to encourage share ownership or to give consumers a greater say in the services that they use. It has privatised because it needs the funds. Despite all its protestations, that means privatisation has not been an exercise in investment or economic reform. All it means is that privatisation has been a desperate struggle for extra cash. Privatisation under Labor has been a textbook example of privatisation as selling the family's silver. This bill, like the government's whole approach to privatisation, is an exercise in botched economic reform. It is a demonstration of the government's failure to solve, let alone adequately tackle, the central dilemmas of contemporary politics. We are at a crucial stage in the development of society in government. Capitalism-large scale industrial capitalism-is a fairly recent phenomenon. It was born in England at the end of the 18th century and has been widespread for only the last 100 years. Those years have been paralleled by another phenomenon: the emergence of rapid economic growth that has made our world so different from the famine-surplus cycles that have plagued nations in the past. Finally, there has been a third phenomenon: the growth of government. One hundred and fifty years ago, great nations like Germany did not exist. But, as the enormous economic growth of the 19th century pushed local and regional economies together, councils and governments merged to create our modem states, our nations. In the 1990s, we are witnessing a change of equal significance. Growing global technologies, computers and telecommunications are exerting upward pressures and forcing upon us an internationalisation that will have a deep impact on our traditional notions of the state. Today's bill is part of the adjustment process to this trend, but it is an inadequate response. The head of the Economist Intelligence Unit, Nico Colchester, writing in the London Spectator earlier this year, spoke of the great inversion of roles that is taking place across the world, claiming governments are accustomed to setting the context within which elites and markets operate; while now it is the elites and markets that set the limits within which governments govern. He quoted the World Bank's latest report on global economic prospects, which states that one effect of globalisation is to expand the options available to private individuals and firms while reducing those of the policy makers. As has been all too clear in Australia, people look to government to protect them from change, from competition and from cultural intrusion. But Colchester argues that international leaders are now answering to an international meritocracy. The Spectator article suggested governments can react to the power of these floating elites in three waysby revolting, acquiescing or adapting. Revolting, according to its author, is trying to put the genie back in the bottle. A country as large and self-sufficient as America or as small and authoritarian as Singapore might have a chance. A country like Australia would be out in the cold. Instead, Colchester recommended a mixture of acquiescence and adapting, of accepting that competition between systems of government in a global market is not necessarily a bad thing. He suggested that the reach and control of late 19th century governments was probably an historical aberration, where for a brief period of time national government harnessed forces of technology to impose itself, which has now risen above government and demoted it. When the Labor Party initially liberalised its platform in 1990 to allow the privatisation of Qantas, it did so because of budgetary stress. Budget demands are the excuse for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. However, the demands of globalisation, internationalisation and the new challenges facing governments are equally significant reasons for this change in policy. The nanny state has proved a total failure. Government everywhere has been proved to be unable to run community and society and voters everywhere have revolted against its futility, burdens and bureaucracy. But the counter theory-the teachings that were first formulated by people such as Friedrich von Hayek and culminated in the neo-conservatism of the 1980s-has also not been proven. The nanny state has not shrunk; instead it is growing even faster. By now it has become clear that developed countries can neither extend big government nor abolish it and return to some imagined 19th century state of innocence. The government we need will have to transcend both groups. Merely taking an axe to government will not work. Instead, we need to rethink government. Every agency, every policy, every program and every activity of government should be confronted with the questions: what is your mission? Is it the right mission? Is it still worth doing? If we are not already doing this, would we now go into it? We need to know what results should be expected of government. We need to know what nongovernmental ways there are of doing things that governments do not and cannot do effectively. We need to ask what the proper functions of government might be and could be and what results governments should be accountable for. We need effective government. In this environment flogging off the Commonwealth Bank for a quick revenue fix is appalling policy. It shuns all the real questions needed for genuine economic reform. The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill is legislation from a failed government that has lost its way. The light on the hill is a very low watt and all it will draw tonight is a few bogong moths.",44
40,Mr CLEARY,AMENDMENT BILL,"What a momentous occasion this is. Who would have thought that a federal Labor government-a government for the battlers and true believers-would be today moving a bill to sell the final 50.3 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. Only yesterday the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) was lampooning the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) for suggesting that Telstra should be broken up and flogged off. He is a member of the New South Wales Right and there he was, nailing his public enterprise colours to the mast and bemoaning the coalition's alleged support for foreign ownership of Telstra. The fact that Murdoch-the bloke who reckons the Keating government is not looking after the battler-is the great beneficiary of Telstra's communications infrastructure is never acknowledged by the minister. The fact that publicly owned infrastructure will be exploited by Murdoch's Foxtel to ultimately disadvantage viewers, all in the name of competition, is consistently ignored by the minister. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), whose cliched textbook soliloquies about competition have become compulsory listening for House of Representatives insomniacs, really wants a bit each way. On 23 October, in a speech subsequently supported by his ideological mate the member for Warringah, he shed crocodile tears about possible Murdoch-Packer control of Rugby League and Rugby Union. What he did not mention was that control of our sporting culture by the media moguls is because of, not despite, government policy. As Ken Davidson nc .ed on 15 April 1995, Murdoch did not even have to go through the public tendering process to win supply of the black box pay TV signal decoding mechanism to Telstra. If the minister for communications was on the speakers list for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank he would be saying exactly what his mate from Werriwa had to say. He would tell us that we had no reason to hold on to a public asset of this kind because the market is a better deliverer of outcomes when it comes to banking and that it was only established and then defended by the old plodders-King O'Malley, Ben Chifley and the like. This, however, is exactly what the member for Warringah, his leader and the rest of the coalition believe. The truth is, as the member for Werriwa will tell you any time you bother to ask, that the ALP, as with the coalition, is totally committed to privatisation, except when you are struggling to distinguish yourself from the opposition and you desperately need to score a political point, as we saw yesterday with the minister for communications. I thought I might start with a Sale of the Century or Pick-a-Box approach to this question. See how you go on this score. It is a bit of shame that the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) is not with us because I am sure he would get the answer to this question as quick as a flash. Here it is: who said, 'What in the name of reason is the justification for breaking up and selling off the great and efficient national assets like the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom, TAA and Qantas?' To make it a bit easier, I will give you a hand: it definitely was not King O'Malley; it was not John Curtin; it could not have been John Hewson; and, although John Howard has discovered his working-class roots of late, it was not him. It was too easy really, wasn't it? We all know that the person responsible for this affirmation of ALP principles was none other than the former Prime Minister and member for Wills, Bob Hawke. Of course, he was not on his own. In 1985, the year the friend of the battler made that statement, they were lined up in support. The present Prime Minister, Paul 'Labor to the bootstraps' Keating, in his previous life as Treasurer, was adamant. He said, 'We are as protective of the ABC's public position as we are of the Commonwealth Bank.' In 1990, after the part sale of the Commonwealth Bank, the then Treasurer waxed lyrical about the Commonwealth Bank's 'unique quality as a government owned bank'. After the decision in 1993 to sell 49.9 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank, the present Treasurer, the Hon. Ralph Willis, told the faithful: We've made it quite clear in the legislation that went through the parliament that we would not go below the 50.1 % mark. Now the deregulation and competition freaks in the party can argue all they like about the efficacy of the government holding on to the Commonwealth Bank. They can follow the Prime Minister's line that 'there's no policy reason why it should remain a publicly owned institution' all the way up the slippery pole. But that does not the alter the fact that this government has lied and continues to lie to true believers about its attitude to public assets. Given the series of broken promises by prime ministers and treasurers in relation to the Commonwealth Bank, why would anyone believe that Telstra or Australia Post are safe? Why would anyone believe that? Let us have look at the government's record on privatisation. In 1987 it sold the defence services loan authority. In 1991 the ALP conference approved the sale of 49 per cent of Qantas and 100 per cent of Australian Airlines. In 1991 the government announced plans to sell 49 per cent of ANL. In 1992 the ALP conference approved the sale of 49 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. It merged Australian Airlines with Qantas and announced plans to sell off 100 per cent of Qantas. In 1993 British Airways bought 25 per cent of Qantas. In 1994 the ALP conference approved the sale of the airports and 100 per cent of ANL and a number of other utilities. Of course the airports were not a sale, only a 99-year lease. In 1995 the government decided to sell off the Commonwealth Bank and the rest of Qantas. As the present Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) said in this House, the ALP does have a proud record on privatisation. Public assets-those that are left-will be safe only when people in the Labor heartlands vote for progressive alternatives opposed to rampant privatisation. If anyone has ratted on the Labor Party it is the Prime Minister and the new breed of technocrats who dominate the upper echelons of the ALP. Sadly, the only way the Left will regain the ascendancy is for the party to be in opposition. The likes of the member for Reid, Laurie Ferguson, will supersede the rightwing bandwagon merchants-and they know who they are-if the party goes into opposiAct, tion. In opposition, those on the Right will become liabilities as the party attempts redefine itself along interventionist lines. Paradoxically, it is the ALP's embracing of privatisation and free market policies that threatens its future and enables the coalition, which is hardly a party of the working class, to actually flag the question of who is looking after the battlers. The fact that a party which consistently blames trade unions for Ausinterest. tralia's economic problems can actually away with flagging its commitment to the called battlers is possible only because ALP's drift to the Right. As they say in northern and western suburbs: if the ALP goes down, it will have gotten its right whack. So what about the arguments for privatising the Commonwealth Bank. As John Quiggin points out: By selling the Commonwealth Bank and using proceeds to repay debt the government makes long ownership. term saving in interest payments, but it loses the profits that the bank would have earned. The problem is to compare the gains and losses. The facts are, as members of this House know and John Quiggin points out, the Commonwealth Bank in 1993-94 made a profit of $682 million, half of which is the government's share. Quiggin argues that savings on debt interest in pri vatised enterprises in Australia, New Zealand and Britain have been less than profits forgone and that privatisation has reduced public sector net worth. I suppose the $100 million to $250 million of revenue lost by the government's sale of the Commonwealth Bank is chicken feed compared with the $5 billion windfall this sale will accrue the government. As is typical of this government's approach to ownership and national sovereignty, there appears no desire to keep the bank in Australian hands once it is floated. By repealing section 27L of the act, which requires that the I government has majority control of the bank, foreign control is no longer out of the quesposition tion. As for suggestions, in the absence statutory regulations, that the Treasurer might act to deny foreign ownership beyond the 40 per cent aggregate threshold allowed under the 1975 Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers I can only say: I'd like to see that. The idea that this government would act on the to grounds that further foreign ownership is contrary to the national interest is laughable. When I asked the Prime Minister whether he would use the Foreign Investment Review Board powers to stop a French nuclear company purchasing United Energy in Victoria, his answer revealed no commitment ideologically or practically to protecting the national In a slap in the face to the Australian get government, the French government forced sothe withdrawal of Electricite de France from of the the tendering process. As I recall, Jack the thought the Kennett government's posturing on the question of French nuclear testing was humiliating. We should not forget that the Keating government is already supporting moves within the OECD for a multilateral agreement on investment to comprehensively open up national borders to foreign ownerthe ship, or movements of capital for foreign All of this comes at a time when foreign investment in Australian companies is increasing and payments of profits and dividends to overseas investors are rising. In the last financial year, interest and earnings to overseas banks and companies accounted for $18.4 billion of the $26.9 billion current account deficit. The days of the ALP using privatisation as a weapon against the coalition, as the minister for communications did yesterday, must surely be over, finished, dead, gone. To see the minister waving the finger at the member for Warringah and declaring his commitment to Telstra is about as galling as it gets. As the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the member for Petrie (Mr Johns), said on 7 September 1993, in response to allegations by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) that the government was a reluctant privatiser: think it is far more accurate to say it is a careful privatiser but it does not have an ideological that is either for privatisation or against it. of It is about time the people of Victoria, in particular the Public First Organisation, had a good hard look at statements such as this. Anyone who believes that a party which has no ideological opposition to privatisation would protect state public utilities needs to think again. John Brumby and Theo Theophanous do not want the Public First Organisation to defend public utilities. They want it to attack Jeff Kennett. That, I am afraid, is only half the equation. We have all heard ad nauseam about the beauty of competition from the deregulation freaks. But when the Commonwealth Bank was jacking up its prices in the market, wasn't it instructive to see the Treasurer forced to act like the owner of the bank and shoot around for a quick meeting and a word of advice? No matter how much the minister for communications crows about competition, the facts are that telephone charges, as Ken Davidson pointed out in the Age in April 1995, are about eight per cent above the OECD average and are set there by Austel to ensure the survival of Optus. It is an interesting dimension to the free market approach. When the money shufflers are out of step with the Prime Minister's view, he is the first to want to stick his bib in and interfere with the market. So it was the case with the Treasurer who, fearing an electoral backlash, had to Ilse his government's controlling interest the bank as a means of pressuring the Commonwealth Bank to reduce its charges. Wasn't it delightful to see the likes of the Glimmer twins attacking bank charges when, under their government's policies-policies they support to the hilt-the truth is that the ordinary punter has no protection from the banks. If deregulation and the free market are all they are wrapped up to be, why do we need intervention by the Prime Minister or the Treasurer? Who will be the guardian when the Commonwealth Bank is sold and the market truly rules? In an interview with Monica Attard on 20 June 1995, Anthony Albanese, a bloke who is replacing a woman, Jeannette MCHugh, as the candidate for Grayndlermaybe the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and the like ought to think about that-was puffing out his chest and advising the Left to act independently. He had this to say: Well, I think that that's why it's necessary, when something like the Commonwealth Bank is privatised, it is necessary for the Left to come out publicly and oppose it because it is simply an inappropriate decision out of touch with Labor's rank and file. And I think that there's a need for the Left to take a very vocal opposition to decisions such as that. I think that, in general, the general free-market approach to economic policy decision making needs to be turned around and I think that the parliamentary Left have a role in changing that. Where is the parliamentary Left today? Who have they sent in? What joker have they sent into defend the sale of the Commonwealth Bank? Yes, the whippet from Werriwa, the extreme Right of the Labor Party. I cannot see one member of the Left. I really do feel sorry for the Left, but at some point they have to nail their colours to the mast. I have really got to ask the Left why they continue to be bullied by the New South Wales Right. The fact that the Commonwealth Bank has not behaved like a people's bank in recent times is no reason to sell it off. Make it work like one. As John Quiggin asks, why is the government making a final commitment to deregulation when many people are suggesting the policy has not lived up to expectations? I am sure the member for Fraser (Mr in Langmore) would ask the very same question. He wants to put a tax on international financial transactions. Deregulation in the banking system now means that the bottom end of town, the unprofitable battlers, are being driven out. As Ken Davidson points out, because of its origins the Commonwealth Bank has more of these battlers than the other banks. That is the kind of tradition that the member for Werriwa ought to be thinking about. He ought to understand what that means in the ALP tradition. Now we find that even the member for Werriwa is suggesting that we should be regulating the banks. When the market does not give the right return, when it does not behave properly, you send the minister around to tell the banks how to behave. But you will not be able to do that after today. The member for Werriwa, who is the only person I can talk about on that side of town because no-one else is here to make a speech-I do not want to spend time talking about him because he is totally obsessed with me anyway-advocates greater government expenditure in working-class areas where, he argues, people are unemployed because they do not have skills. He is telling working-class people they are unemployed because they are unskilled. What absolute arrogance! This, despite the fact that the federal government cut $1.2 billion from its Working Nation jobs program in the last budget. This, despite the fact that the federal government has consistently reduced government outlays, and is proud of it. This, despite the fact that the federal government wants to lay claim to our being one of the lowest taxed OECD countries, and is proud of it. Working-class people in Werriwa must be sick of their member's patronising, technocratic nonsense. Why can't the Commonwealth Bank set the pattern and look after those people who are being driven out of the system? The fact that people, supposedly, did not cite banks as a problem in a mickey mouse survey conducted by the member for Werriwa proves absolutely nought. Low income people are always complaining about the banks. If they were not, the member for Werriwa and his right-wing mates would not be shedding crocodile tears and flagging regulation in this House. Ken Davidson, some time ago, said: The federal government has a duty to impose a regulatory regime on the banking system which ensures that it remains genuinely open to all, given that its sale of the Commonwealth Bank has abolished competition in banking as effectively as the sale of the ABC would effectively abolish program diversity in broadcasting. This debate is not about symbolism only and it is not simply about tradition, but there is symbolism in this. If members of the Labor Party think that symbolism does not mean anything, then I wait until the next time the Prime Minister talks about being Labor to the bootstraps and evokes the memory of the light on the hill to see those members over there who do not support symbolism stand, laugh and condemn the Prime Minister. But they will not condemn the Prime Minister because they think that tradition, a set of values and a set of coherent ideas are worth something and that those traditions spur people on to make policy about social justice. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), talks about social justice all the time. The Commonwealth Bank issue is one of social justice. That is why the Left are not in here talking about it-because it is about social justice and it is about fairness, equity and a more egalitarian society. Are the banks really delivering that fairness and those egalitarian principles to Australia's society at present? Not a chance! People are being driven into credit unions. Can credit unions maintain their ability to look after people at the bottom end of town? This nonsense about confusing ends with means that the member for Werriwa trots out every day is nothing but a smokescreen. Ends are ends. Ideals are ideals. Goals are goals. Principles are principles. They actually mean something. If they did not mean anything, then the Labor Party would not attempt to contrast itself with the coalition. But the Labor Party consistently contrasts itself with the coalition on the grounds that the coalition is a party without principles, that the coalition does not believe in anything. If that is the truth, then the member for Werriwa and the like cannot come into this House squealing about the concept of principles and saying, 'I am a pragmatist.' Being pragmatic is simply a means of jettisoning your principles. This is not about Frank Anstey and antisemitism. What a lot of nonsense. Is anyone who opposes the banking sector, complains about the banks or talks about justice in the banking system anti-Semitic? The revisionist history that is written by the ALP is absolutely disgraceful. (Time expired)",48
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AMENDMENT BILL,"I did not want to interrupt the honourable member for Wills when he was in full flight. Sometimes, ;in the heat of the moment, we refer to members by nicknames and, usually, we are called to order. Mr Cleary-Which one was that?",52

43,Mr VAILE,AMENDMENT BILL,"The debate on the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill has certainly been interesting thus far, albeit with an absolute lack of appearance from Labor Party members. The Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia (Mr Willis) and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) have spoken on the legislation this morning. Not one other Labor Party member has spoken on the bill today. It is because they are dead scared of it. Their rank and file are absolutely horrified at what the Labor Party has done. The taxpayers of Australia should-and will-hold the Labor Party accountable for its duplicity. Just remember that word. We hear about it every day when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stands at the dispatch box ranting and raving about the opposition. In all the statements that have been made by ministers, prime ministers and treasurers of this government-past and present-we read about what they were going to do about privatisation and the public assets that they were not going to sell. We have seen this arrogant government tum its back on those statements, tum its back on what its ideology or beliefs are supposed to be and head down this path. The coalition has never stepped away from its core beliefs in this area. The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), who is at the table, yesterday tried to drive a few wedges in, but they have no track record with regard to sticking to what they have said to the people of Australia. I refer to Qantas, the FAC and Telstra. The minister was talking about Telstra yesterday and has been challenged as to what the government is going to do. It is about all that is left to privatise. by any quirk of fate, the Labor Party is returned at the next election, there will not be any publicly owned Telstra left. But the minister at the table would get up now and tell us there would be. When I did some research before speaking on this bill, I pulled out a couple of comments that were printed in the media earlier this year when the announcement was made with regard to the privatisation and the sale of the balance of the shares in the Commonwealth Bank. I refer to an article in the Canberra Times headed 'Factions revolt against bank sale'. It reads: The Government has been forced to quell a backbench revolt over the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. A third of the members at yesterday's regular Caucus meeting voted against the Government's legislation to sell the 50.4 per centI think it is 50.1 per centof the bank which it still owns. ... backbenchers John Langmore, Chris Haviland, Garrie Gibson and Barney Cooney, all from the Left and Independent factions, spoke strongly against the motion. Mr Langmore argued the sale was a breach of previous promises to Caucus and the bank's shareholders. He is one of the few honest members in the Labor Party today, one of the few honest members on the government benches today. I repeat: he argued that the sale was a breach of previous promises to caucus and the bank's shareholders. That is why nobody from the Labor Party except the member for Werriwa-the robot who got trotted out today-spoke in support of this bill. They left the Treasurer high and dry to try to argue the case as to why the government was selling the bank. What about all the promises and platitudes they trotted out to the people of Australia as to what they were going to do? They said, 'There's no way we'll ever sell the remaining shares in the Commonwealth Bank.' I refer to something which makes matters unbelievably worse-and the people of Australia must be made aware of this. If the media in this country do not report this debate If, today, highlighting some of the arrogance and duplicity of the government on this issue, they are not doing their job properly, either. When John Langmore argued that the sale was a breach of previous promises to caucus and the bank's shareholders, what he was referring to was the public letter which the then Minister for Finance, Ralph Willis, issued to the shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. This was highlighted in an article written by Tom Burton in the Financial Review when this privatisation exercise relating to the Commonwealth Bank that we are debating today was first announced in the budget. I would venture to say that many government backbenchers found out about the privatisation of the balance of the Commonwealth Bank shares at the same time as members of the opposition found out-on budget night when the Treasurer announced it. I will read from the article by Tom Burton regarding that letter-that commitment which the then Minister for Finance, the present Treasurer, made to the people of Australia and the shareholders when the government was selling the other half of the Commonwealth Bank. It is headed 'Ralph's share of this dread letter day'. It reads: Would you buy a used car from this lot? Twenty months ago, the then finance minister, Ralph Willis, signed off a letter about the partial sale of the Commonwealth Bank. It was no ordinary letter. It was what is known as a comfort letter, a document designed to give potential investors confidence over any matters which might be worrying them. Having already sold 30 per cent, Canberra was selling off another 20 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank and Willis was trying to allay any concerns new investors had that the Government would sell off the rest of its 50.1 per cent shareholding. Having the Government hold its shareholding was important to new investors. First, it capped the number of shares, thereby ensuring investors an important scarcity value in a sector where there is no shortage of stock. This would ensure investors a premium in the value of their shares, with the price held up by the need for institutions to keep an appropriate weighting in CBA shares. Second, as long as the Government had a majority shareholding the bank's debt was Government-guaranteed. It was not a promise that the shares would be guaranteed, but with the Federal Government protecting all debt it did mean the bank would get the best financing rate availablenot a bad asset if you are in the borrowing and lending game. Reacting to this concern, it was decided Willis should personally write a letter to be inserted prospectus. In the good old days a prospectus was about as reliable as a letterbox advertising flier. The shenanigans of the Bonds and Skases of the world forced Canberraforced the Labor governmentto get serious about laws which stopped the puffery and outlandish predictions, as well as a new national regulator to administer them. The new laws tried to restore the reputation of corporate Australia by ensuring investors could rely on a prospectus. Ironically, having insisted business clean up its act, the government exempted itself from the prospectus provisions of the Corporations Law. But, as the Commonwealth Bank of Australia prospectus noted: 'The government has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information in the prospectus is accurate and not misleading.' . . . Moreover, Willis was not writing on behalf of some entrepreneur with an obvious single interest to maximise profit. As he noted, he was writing on behalf of the Commonwealth government which, as the representative of the pUblic, is required to model its behaviour on the highest standards of probity. In his letter Willis could not have been any more emphatic: 'The government has no intentions whatever of further reducing its shareholding.' Just to make sure no-one missed the message he added: 'The government is proud of the Commonwealth Bank's record and looks forward to the Commonwealth of Australia continuing as the bank's majority shareholding in future.' Later in the document Mr Willis said: The government has no intention whatever of further reducing the Commonwealth of Australia's shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank below 50.1 per cent. The article continued: To make the point even stronger, the prospectus noted that the law was being changed to require the government to retain at least 50.1 per cent of the voting power in the Commonwealth Bank. 'Further, neither the Commonwealth nor the Commonwealth Bank will be allowed to do anything to cause or contribute to the Commonwealth no longer holding or controlling the Commonwealth Bank shares carrying the right to exercise at least 50.1 per cent of the total voting rights in the Commonwealth Bank.' And when was that? Only 20 months ago the then Minister for Finance and the Commonwealth Government of Australia gave that guarantee in writing to the shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and to the in the people of Australia. Then all of a sudden, in May this year, they have done an absolute backflip. This government will go down in the history books of this nation as being the perpetrators of the greatest hypocrisy that this nation has ever seen. They have blatantly lied to the people of Australia about what they propose to do with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. When going to the last election, they used as a great political tool the coalition's proposition to privatise Telecom. What has happened since 1993? Nothing but a litany of privatisation of publicly owned assets. They are the greatest hypocrites this country has ever seen. It is unbelievable. This week we have seen a further step which goes beyond the realms of anybody's imagination: the privatisation of the cabinet, the executive government of this country, selling the Prime Minister's time at $20,000 an hour. It is an absolute disgrace. They are not just privatising the public assets of Qantas, the FAC and ANL, which have not been completed-the handling of which is an utter disgrace-they are now privati sing the executive government of this country. It is absolutely disgusting. If the media in this nation do not make the people of this place aware of what this government is about, they should be held accountable as well. They have a responsibility to make it clear to the people of Australia what this government is all about. The bill that we are debating today is doing exactly what the then Minister for Finance said would not happen. We have to have this piece of legislation to overrule and to overcome what was done by the government 20 months ago. The government guaranteed to the people who raced out and bought shares in the Commonwealth Bank that the Commonwealth of Australia was going to maintain a 50.1 per cent ownership of the bank. That is just unbelievable. The member for Wills (Mr Cleary), who spoke before me, referred to how often the Prime Minister and his cronies on the government benches invoke memories of the great icons of the Labor Party and the people who established the Commonwealth Bank. It is interesting to note that the Commonwealth Bank was established in 1912 by the Fisher Labor government by means of the Commonwealth Bank Act of 1911. In his second reading speech, Andrew Fisher, the then Prime Minister and Treasurer, said: This will be a bank belonging to the people, and directly managed by the people's own agents. ... It will ultimately become the bank of banks rather than a mere money-lending institution. ... Our chief aim is not to make profits, but to ensure safety and security to depositors. There is a Labor Party of that ilk no more, and I am sure that a lot of Australians who pay their dues to the Labor Party each year would be absolutely ashamed. I am sure that members must go back to their branches and say, 'We won't do this; we won't do that,' and then they get back after they have done it and say, 'We had to do this. The Prime Minister forced us to do this. The Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Finance, forced us to agree to this sale. We had to do it for Australia's sake.' Government members stood on street comers at the last election, guaranteeing the people of Australia that they represented the party opposed to privatisation. What a lot of rubbish! We have never heard so much garbage and arrogance in this country's history. They went to the last election as the party opposed to privatisation. As I said before, Minister, if by any quirk of fate you win the next election, I will guarantee that we see you privatising Telstra. I will guarantee we see it. Mr Lee-What is your view on that?",53
44,Mr VAILE,AMENDMENT BILL,"You know what our view is on Telstra. You know what our view is on the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. You know what our view is on the privatisation of Qantas, FAC and ANL .. - he people of Australia know that the coaittlOn has been brutally frank and honest with them about what we are going to do. We said at the last election that we would sell Telecom. We have not lied to the people of Australia. We have put our cards on the table as to what we are going to do. It is the Labor Party that has lied to the people of Australia about what it proposes to do. In this bill I just want to highlight one concern that I have with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, which is what is happening to the Commonwealth Development Bank. We do not believe that the government has given enough attention in this bill to the Commonwealth Development Bank. Speaking as a member of the National Party and one that represents regional Australia, I remind the House that as a lender of last resort the Commonwealth Development Bank has played a major role in the development of regional and rural Australia. I do not believe that the government cares too much about this anymore because when this bill goes through-and we presume it will go through the Senate-the Commonwealth Development Bank will be left in a fairly precarious situation. It concerns me that in Australia we are going to be left without an institution that is a lender of last resort, that is there to assist the development of industry, small business, farmers and primary producers, and to assist in difficult times when all the other institutions, because of their lending practices, cannot and will not assist. In those circumstances in the past, applicants who have been knocked back by their regular bank have had the opportunity to go to the Commonwealth Development Bank as a lender of last resort and have not had the usual commercially strict lending criteria applied. So we have seen people who have been prepared to have a go in Australiasome in parts of Australia, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, that you represent-develop vital industries and progress to be great producers of wealth in our economy, particularly our export economy. The government has not paid enough attention to that in this bill. That is why an amendment has been moved by the shadow minister. It states, in part: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that: (1) the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank is ill-defined in the Bill, and the Shareholders' Agreement between the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth should be included as a schedule to the Bill; The Commonwealth Development Bank is a very important institution which has helped develop this nation. It might be worth referring at this stage to another unbelievable muck-up that has highlighted the government's inadequacy because of its ad hoc decision making process on privatisation. It seems that the government is now going to start buying back the minor shareholdings of the Australian Industry Development Corporation after making a decision to privatise it. So that institution is in a state of flux at the moment. It is unbelievable t Let the people of Australia know about the hypocrisy and the duplicity-I use that word because it is one that is often used by the Prime Minister-of this government on the issue of privatisation, not to mention its absolutely appalling track record on it. Again, the situation with ANL at the moment is unbelievable. We have seen the government kicked from pillar to post by its mates in the ACTU and the Maritime Union of Australia over the ANL. We have seen the government kowtowing to the Maritime Union of Australia. We have seen the Commonwealth-that is the taxpayers of Australia-drop so much money into ANL. We have seen the Labor mates-Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull-benefit to the tune of up to $1 million. What have we got for that money since the board of directors of ANL were sacked by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and were replaced by Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull? The taxpayers of Australia forked out nearly $1 million to pay Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull and what have we seen? We have seen the net worth of ANL decline. It has gone down. These were the great saviours who were going to get this shipping line up and running and then sell it. That is how they were going to be successful in privati sing ANL. And now they cannot sell it. They cannot sell it because the Maritime Union of Australia has not one leg rope on the government, but two. It has the Prime Minister's bootstraps tied together. That epitomises the failure of the Labor Party in government on the issue of privatisation. It is something the Labor Party stepped away from by a million miles at the last election. It said, 'No, we are not going to be privatisers.' Now we have ministers coming in here and proudly bragging about their record on privatisation. Then there is this disgusting effort by the Treasurer and the then Minister for Finance guaranteeing in a prospectus to the commercial world that the Commonwealth would remain the owner of the remaining 55.1 per cent of the shares in the Commonwealth Bank. Yet here we are today debating a bill which shows how he has done a complete backflip in 20 months on selling those remaining shares in the Commonwealth Bank.",55
45,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,AMENDMENT BILL,"I have great pleasure in rising to make a contribution to the debate on the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995. The aspect of this legislation which I am most concerned about is the changes to the status and role of the Commonwealth Development Bank. This bill provides for the conversion of the Commonwealth Development Bank into a company limited by shares under the Corporations Law, with the name the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia Ltd. This sale of the Commonwealth Development Bank has many far-reaching consequences. Chief among them is the impact this sale will almost certainly have on the nation's rural and small business people-the people who are most reliant on the Development Bank. This bill represents another slap in the face from this government for those people and families who have plunged ever deeper into financial and social crisis under the 13 years of Labor government in this nation. The original charter for the Commonwealth Development Bank was spelt out in the Commonwealth Banks Act of 1959. Section 72 provides that the functions of the Development Bank are, firstly, to provide finance for the purposes of primary production and, secondly, to provide finance for the establishment or development of industrial undertakings, particularly small business undertakings. An important aspect of this financial assistance is that it is available as a last resort: that is, it is available when other finance is either difficult or impossible to get. The Development Bank's focus was on development needs, on long-term success rather than short-term security. For these reasons it was appropriate for rural and other small businesses with high capital costs and low short-term profits. It has provided an invaluable source of revenue for many people in small business, for many primary producers and farmers right across this nation who have long-term financial needs and cannot provide the short-term security that is required by major commercial lending institutions. These specialised functions of the Development Bank were extended in 1993 by the passing of the Commonwealth Bank Amendment Act. This amendment enabled the Development Bank to provide finance where some, but not all, of the finance would be available from other sources. In other words, the 1993 amendment authorised the Development Bank to provide finance in situations where finance could not be raised on commercial terms. This amendment was made only two years ago. Given the specialised charter of the Development Bank, it is little wonder that it was extremely popular with rural producers and small business people. It satisfied a very real need in the rural finance sector by filling a gap in the market supply of capital. It played a very real role and could continue to provide a very real role in regional development. The bill before us today repeals that very valuable bank charter and replaces it with a newly named memorandum of the Commonwealth Development Bank. I think it is reasonable to suspect that, along with the repeal of the Development Bank's charter, a much more fundamental change is going to occur with the operation of the bank. This remains the case even though the charter is said to remain in the memorandum. The reason for this suspicion is that there is no guarantee that the government will continue its funding role of the bank. The key to the operation of the Development Bank's special charter lies in the government's financial commitment to the Development Bank. Without this subsidisation, the bank could not afford to perform the role it does. But the continuation of this financial commitment is under threat, for a variety of reasons. The first reason is that the future role of the Development Bank is completely unknown and unspecified. As the explanatory memorandum to this bill states very clearly: The bill does not define the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank. That is quite clearly spelt out in the explanatory memorandum. This is confirmed in the Commonwealth Bank's 1995 annual report, which states: The future of the Development Bank is currently the subject of review by the Government. The people in small business out there, the primary producers of this country, deserve an answer on that review before the next federal election. The primary producers of this country want to hear before the next federal election what the government is really thinking on this issue. In the annual report of the Commonwealth Bank for 1995 it is spelt out quite clearly that the Commonwealth Development Bank is currently the subject of review by the government. Therefore, we are all left in a state of uncertainty as to what future role of the bank and the government will be. This is particularly unfair for those people who are highly dependent on the Commonwealth Development Bank for their present or future livelihood. There are many people out there in drought ravaged rural Australia, either on the land or in small businesses, who currently use the Commonwealth Development Bank's facilities for their financial needs. Their uncertainty is made worse by the fact that this bill does not specify the Commonwealth's annual financial obligation or commitment to the Commonwealth Development Bank. Under the existing legislation the Commonwealth provides the Commonwealth Development Bank with capital injections. That subsidy or financial commitment, which is critical to the operation of the Commonwealth Development Bank, is currently worth about $20 million a year. However, while the explanatory memorandum to this bill says that the Commonwealth will continue to pay an annual subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank, the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill does not define what this annual subsidy arrangement will be. The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill repeals section 85A of the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 which provides for that Commonwealth assistance. All we are left with is the statement in the bill that these important subsidy arrangements will be defined in a shareholders agreement, to be entered into when the Commonwealth sells its majority shareholding in the bank. We have this thing called the shareholders agreement, something so important that it will define the future subsidy arrangements of the Commonwealth, yet we do not know what it is going to contain. This level of uncertainty is completely unacceptable, particularly in view of the special needs of those families-many of whom live in rural areas-who are dependent on an adequate subsidy arrangement. The question needs to be asked: why is the government so intent on rushing this bill through before it has specified the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank? Could it be that the government has decided the to give up its role in the Commonwealth Development Bank and surrender it completely to the market? Quite clearly, the Labor Party have a secret agenda planned for the Commonwealth Development Bank, and they should spell it out. They should come clean and tell the people of Australia just what their policy is on the Commonwealth Development Bank. Why will they not come out and tell the people of Australia? We cannot be blamed for suspecting that the Labor Party people have a secret agenda when it comes to the Commonwealth Development Bank because they will not spell it out in this bill. The repeal of both sections covering the special charter in Commonwealth assistance leaves the Commonwealth Development Bank open to fundamental restructuring. By transferring the Commonwealth Development Bank's special charter to the memorandum, the charter really loses its substance because the memorandum could easily be amended under the Corporations Law to which the bank will be subject after the sale. Because the Commonwealth's financial commitment is critical to the operation of the Development Bank's special charter, the absence of this financial commitment will compel the Development Bank to terminate its specialist lending facilities and put all loans on a strictly commercial basis. This will see the end of the special role of the Commonwealth Development Bank as we know it. This is the case even though the bill in section 117 provides that 'the Commonwealth guarantees the due payment by the Development Bank of any amount that is payable by the Development Bank to a person other than the Commonwealth'. The annual report of the Commonwealth Bank says that the board is prepared to tailor its specialist lending facilities only to the subsidy and not to the Commonwealth's guarantee. In other words, it is not enough for the bank to have a guarantee from the Commonwealth; it wants to see the money first. But if this money is not forthcoming, then under the Corporations Law it will have no choice but to operate according to commercial demands. The result will be that we lose the specialist lending facilities of the Commonwealth Development Bank. This is not the end of the bad news. We have even more reason to believe that the government is preparing to terminate the special operation of the Development Bank. The basis of this belief is that the explanatory memorandum to the bill makes an allowance for the Commonwealth Bank to purchase the Commonwealth shares in the Development Bank 'if an adequate annual Commonwealth subsidy to the Commonwealth Bank is not paid'. This statement clearly leaves the door open for the Commonwealth to terminate its subsidisation of the Development Bank. Why would the explanatory memorandum put in this clause if a Commonwealth subsidy was guaranteed? It is also reasonable to assume from this statement that the forthcoming shareholders agreement does not intend to bind the Commonwealth to an adequate level of subsidy to enable the directors of the bank to carry out the terms of the charter in the memorandum. The upshot of all of this is that there appears to be no effective guarantee that the Commonwealth Development Bank will continue its specialised services to rural Australia and to small business. This government quite clearly is prepared to give up on many rural and small businesses dependent on the bank, for the sake of meeting its budgetary requirements. Is this what the Labor Party has to do to pay its bills? Does this not demonstrate clearly the degree of economic mismanagement of this administration? Does it not also demonstrate the government's hypocrisy concerning the Commonwealth Bank? I know that there are many rank and file members in Labor Party branches who remember Bob Hawke saying that he would defend the Commonwealth Bank with every ounce of Labor blood in this country.",57
46,Mr REID,AMENDMENT BILL,What a joke!,59
47,Mr BRUCE SCOTI,AMENDMENT BILL,"What hollow words! What ajoke! The Labor Party is a joke when it comes to these sorts of issues. Government members say one thing to the people of Australia at election time out on the hustings and do exactly the opposite when they are returned to power in this parliament-such as when they promised to legislate l-a-w tax cuts. It is little wonder that the people of Queensland are telling the Labor government that it has lost touch with them; it no longer represents them. It won by a mere nine votes, and the Court of Disputed Returns may mean that the new minister from Queensland will find that the government in Queensland will not be there very long. I am sure you were never a supporter of the tollway that travelled through your electorate, Minister. It seems that they were not even listening to you. Mr Sciacca-They have changed their minds since.",59
48,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,AMENDMENT BILL,"They changed their minds, and they said, 'We have listened to you now.' Quite clearly they say one thing to the people of Australia at election time, but it is another story when it comes to acting on their commitments-it is only hypocrisy and more lies. It is also interesting to recall some of the things that were said back in 1993 when the government sold some of its shares in the Commonwealth Bank. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), in responding to concerns that the Development Bank may be moving away from its special charter, said quite clearly, 'That will not happen.' This is the Assistant Treasurer, on the benches of power today. The Assistant Treasurer knew at that time how dependent the small business and rural sectors were on the Development Bank. He admitted it in his speech. Yet we see before us today the likelihood that this government will tum its back on those very same small business and rural people, despite the fact that it knows how valuable the specialist services of the Development Bank are. I cannot believe that a government could do this to the people of Australia. If we know anything in this place, it is that the people in rural and regional Australia are doing it extremely tough at this time. Farm debt levels are extraordinarily high; they are at record levels. The total amount of farm debt in Australia is a massive $17 billion. The average farm debt is $145,000. That same farm is recording a business loss of $13,700 each year. To get some idea of how bad it is in some parts of Australia, one only needs to look at the situation in Queensland. In my own electorate in the south-west of the state, the average cotton farmer has a debt of $876,000. The average grain producer is doing almost as badly with an average debt of $422,000; and the average beef producer has a debt of $401,000. In the last decade 10,000 family farms have vanished; this is a tragic figure. The sale of the Commonwealth Bank, and of the Commonwealth Development Bank in particular, threatens to make these problems worse. For many people the Commonwealth Development Bank is the thread that is keeping them from going completely under. Therefore it is essential that the government make known its plans for the Commonwealth Development Bank before the next federal election. I call on the government to do this, and to restore certainty to those people who depend on the Commonwealth Development Bank. And I call on the government to define the contents of the shareholders agreement between the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank.",59
49,Mr REID,AMENDMENT BILL,"The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995 amends the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 to provide for the sale of the Commonwealth government's remaining 50.39 per cent shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank. The explanatory memorandum states that the Commonwealth's equity, based on recent share prices, has a market value in the order of $4.5 billion. One of the major issues to come out of this year's budget was the decision by the Labor government to sell the Commonwealth Bank of Australia-the icon of the Australian Labor Party. They decided to sell it without consulting anyone in the party; there were only about six people who knew. Caucus was not consulted, and first knew of this decision almost at the time when it was announced in parliament. I understand that the ripples are still going through the Australian Labor Party as a result of this decision. If the history of the Commonwealth Bank is traced it is apparent that there are many commitments from the Labor Party that the bank would not be sold. I want to remind people in this House that in September 1993, and this was included in the prospectus, the then Minister for Finance, Mr Ralph Willis, stated: The Government has no intention whatever of further reducing the Commonwealth of Australia's shareholding . . . That was written into the prospectus for the Commonwealth Bank. There have been a lot of comments about the proposed sale of the Commonwealth Bank and some of those comments have included such remarks as, 'John Curtin and Ben Chifley would tum in their graves if they knew that the government was selling the Commonwealth Bank.' But to trace the history back a little further, look at what happened with a state Labor government in power in Victoria. That government also said that the State Bank of Victoria, another Labor Party icon, would never be sold. However, that bank was sold also. The state government gave into the pressure put on it by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Commonwealth Bank took over the State Bank of Victoria at a bargain basement price and now the Commonwealth will sell off that part of it as well. In the interim period, staff numbers have been reduced from more than 55,000 people down to 35,000-plus. That means that 20,000 people have lost their jobs with the Commonwealth Bank. A big percentage of those people are former State Bank of Victoria employees. Relate that back to the statement by Ralph Willis, the then Minister for Finance: The Government has no intention whatever of further reducing the Commonwealth of Australia's share holding ... You simply cannot believe any statement that the government makes. In the same year, in February 1993, the Prime Minister stated that the Keating government would retain full government ownership of Telecom. Yet the government have already moved towards corporatising Telecom. You simply cannot believe anything that they say. As I said, the caucus members in the Australian Labor Party knew nothing about the sale of the remaining 50.39 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. Not disclosing that fact typifies the way this government operates, with executive power running rampant. Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, I am sure that you would have been outraged, absolutely outraged, at that decision being made without your knowledge. I want to refer to a particular aspect Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill and that is the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank. In this House in September 1993 I raised this matter in a debate on the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1993. In my contribution on that debate I raised the issue of the Commonwealth Development Bank which is so very important in providing finance for small business and particularly for rural pursuits. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and it provides finance to small business where it would not otherwise be available on reasonable terms and conditions. In other words, it is a lender of last resort. I put it to the government that I trusted that the government would continue that role as laid out quite clearly in the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959. Clause 72 refers to the first and primary objective of the Commonwealth Development Bank as: (a) to provide finance for the purpose of establishing, acquiring or carrying on business (including businesses related to primary production), in particular small businesses, in cases where, in the opinion of the Development Bank, the provision of finance is desirable and the finance would not otherwise be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions; That is a very important aspect of the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank for people from within my electorate, particularly in the rural sector and also in small business where they have recourse to the Commonwealth Development Bank for finance as a lender of last resort. Subclause 72(b) of the Commonwealth Banks Act further outlines the functions of the Development Bank: (b) in accordance with policies approved by the Treasurer, to participate in businesses of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) in cases where, in the opinion of the Development Bank, participation is desirable and other persons would not be prepared to participate on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions; Again, it spells out its role as a lender of last resort to farmers and small business people. That is a very important role. I particularly forced that issue in the House, seeking a statement from the minister at the table at the of this time, the then Assistant Treasurer, now Special Minister of State (Mr Johns). I kept pushing the point about trusting the government to continue the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank as a lender of last resort, and I want to read to the House what the minister responded to me following my request to him and my continued pushing of that issue on 7 September 1993: Mr Johns-I agree. I give you that assurance. What he was referring to was the continuing role of the Commonwealth Development Bank as a lender of last resort under the two clauses that I have mentioned, subclauses 72(a) and (b) of the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959. No ifs, no buts, no maybes-'I agree,' says Minister Johps, 'I give you that assurance.' Quite obviously that minister was being trampled on by cabinet and the executive just the same as the Labor caucus were trampled on in this particular issue-no explanation, no nothing. He gave a categorical assurance in this House that the Commonwealth Development Bank would continue its role as a lender of last resort in providing finance to small businesses and primary production. That is just like the statement from the then Min!s-er for Finance and current Treasurer (Mr WIllIs) in September of 1993 that the governm-nt had no intention whatever of further reducIng its shareholding. You cannot believe anything that they say. There we have a categorical assurance from a minister of the Crown: 'I agree. I give you that assurance that the Commonwealth Development Bank will be continuing as a lender of last resort.' I have raised this issue of the Commonwealth Development Bank on a number. of occasions in this House because of the Important role that it does play in providing support finance to small busine-ses; rural industries and agricultural pursuIts In my electorate and right throughout Australia in rural areas. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have heard members that have spoken before me speak on this important role and you will probably hear speakers following me speak on this role because it is an essential element of the borr-wing pattern of people in country areas. I understand that the extent of that loan capacity of the Commonwealth Development Bank has been somewhere near $500 million per annum-a not insig!lificant - mount, particularly when you consIder the crIse.s th-t have gone through the rural community In this past year. My own electorate was badly affected by drought, probably the second worse drought in central Victoria's history, and it received no assistance whatsoever, absolutely nothing, from the federal government. There was no financial support under any drought relief packages-none at all. It was left entirely to the Victorian state governown ment to come up with some support for those people who were going through the sec-nd worse drought in the history of the BendIgo and central Victoria region. There was not one dollar from the Commonwealth. It was an absolute disgrace. The government is talking now about taking away the lender of last resort to that rural community. The Commonwealth Developm-nt Bank has played a significant role in provIding finance to people in rural areas and on those farms. Whilst the people in my electorate have had some good rains in the last week or so and it looks as though they might be having a reasonable season with cereal c-ops, it has been virtually 12 months of 011 or virtually no income during that period. They have been through an extremely difficult time, unaided by the federal government. The Keating government turned its back on them and would not give them help in any shape or form, and they have had to battle on. They have probably extended their loan facility from the Commonwealth Development Bank to tide them over that 12 months period. Most of them will have virtually no income until December, January, February of next year, and then they have to meet their repayments of any borrowings that they may have made from whatever financial source. One of the financial sources, the one that I refer to as being in this bill, is the Commonwealth Development Bank, the lender of last resort to many rural industries throughout Australia. Yet we have had categorical assurances from ministers of the Crown in this House, at the dispatch box where the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is currently sitting, 'I give you that assurance that it will continue as a lender of last resort'. They have obviously broken that promise; they have told a story to the Australian community that is not true, just the same as the statemen- - y t-e then Minister for Finance, Ralph WIllIs, In September 1993. It is just a continuation of that: 'Tell them anything and then, if we get re-elected we will just change our mind anyway.' They have been caught out on this one. I understand that within the government's ranks-last Tuesday, to be exact-at the Labor Party caucus meeting, the matter was raised of the Commonwealth Development Bank and the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. This has been simmering for some time, I understand, and it was recommitted to debate. It has been simmering in the government's caucus meetings and it blew up last week in caucus. There was a motion put up to overturn that decision and it was defeated; I understand the margin was about six votes. So the caucus itself is pretty evenly divided about it. I say to the members of the Labor Party who voted to defeat that motion, 'Come over and support us, particularly on the issue of the Commonwealth Development Bank because there have been so many promises made about the role of this.' Obviously there is a lot of feeling in the Labor Party ranks. I do not know where the minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, stood on that issue. He would be aware of the difficult conditions that farmers and small rural businesses are going through at the moment, and the need to maintain the Commonwealth Development Bank in the role as a lender of last resort. I understand that there has been some sort of deal brokered behind the scenes and that there has been some agreement about it. Hopefully, the Labor caucus can put some more pressure on the government to see the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank continue in a form such that it will be of assistance to small business and to rural interests. This saga has been going on for an extended period. I have raised it on a number of occasions. The budget speech and the budget delivery was probably one of the most traumatic times for the Australian Labor Party in this House--except for some people, I think, they did not know until about half an hour before the budget speech was made that they were going to sell that great icon of the Labor Party, the Commonwealth Bank. What it means is that they will do anything, say anything, to achieve their ends. The Labor Party caucus recognised that last Tuesday, when the issue was again raised in the caucus meeting in an effort to overturn that decision. I am not privy to the full debate on that issue, but a number of members of caucus have spoken to me about it. They are concerned about the way that decision was made and the effect that it will have, particularly in terms of the role that the Commonwealth Development Bank plays. However, it follows a very similar pattern to what happened in Victoria. I referred earlier to the Labor government in Victoria and the shocking mess that it made of the financial affairs of the state, and its ultimate decision to sell the State Bank of Victoria-another Labor Party iconto the Commonwealth. It was more of a gift than a sale if the huge assets of the State Bank of Victoria are taken into account. I want to refer to that, if you will just bear with me, because it was a very significant issue at the time. The Commonwealth Bank got this bank at a bargain basement price. It actually took over the State Bank of Victoria for $1.6 billion. That may sound like a lot of money, but just have a look at the assets that the bank had. It had 3If2 million account customers. If the proposition were put to any of the retailing giants that something had 3If2 million account customers, I am sure they would evaluate that into a very significant sum of money. The State Bank of Victoria also had a huge amount of property assets in land and buildings throughout the state. In fact, it touched every comer of the state of Victoria. When the Kirner government decided that it would hand over the State Bank of Victoria to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Bank got the benefit of that state bank with all those customers and assets. Now we find that the Commonwealth Bank is in a position to sell the remaining assets which it got at a bargain basement price. The Commonwealth Bank is now able to on-trade what it has not disposed of in terms of asset sales and property sales and the dismissal of 20,000 employees. It is now able to on-sell it. I refer to the comments that I received in September 1993. Probably the most significant part of the whole case for the continuance of the Commonwealth Development Bank is the fact that it provides a facility for rural businesses and farmers as a lender of last resort. I requested that the government continue that role. I got a solid assurance from the Assistant Treasurer at that time, Mr Johns, who said, 'I agree. I give you the assurance that the Commonwealth Development Bank will continue as a last resort lender.' I will be interested to hear the response from the minister handling this bill, the Treasurer, when he comes back to the table, to find out whether he is giving that assurance and whether that facility will continue as a lender of last resort. I will have further words to say during the committee stage of this bill.",60
50,Mr COBB,AMENDMENT BILL,"What a day this must be for the Labor Party. Some 83 years after it set up the people's bank, the battlers' bank, in 1912, the Labor Party is finally repudiating its charter, so to speak. It has sold this bank off to private enterprise. It is absolutely unbelievable. The members of the Labor Party must be ashamed because, apart from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), who is on duty at the table and who was forced to be here because the government has to have one person in the chamber, there is not one member of the Labor Party in the benches opposite. Look at the speakers list. How many speakers has the government had? Only one speaker from the Labor Party has snuck in here and apologised for his party's position. It is indeed an extraordinary day for the Labor Party. Its members should be ashamed to their bootstraps about what they are doing, because they are doing the very opposite of everything they have preached over the decades. Of course, they repudiated, rejected and laughed at privatisation when it was first mentioned, some years ago, by the coalition. But then they dipped their hands in the cookie jar, so to speak, and they have not had their hands out of it ever since. They have sold just about everything that one can name, except for Telstra and Australia Post. Already, they are setting up Telstra, to sell it straight the election. Australia Post, no doubt, will not be far behind. We have reduced this parliament to the state where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is even privatising himself-selling himself off at $20,000 an hour. Surprisingly, he has not had any takers yet! But that is what this government is reduced to, and that is what this Prime Minister is reducing himself and that high office in this country to. It is a day of shame, duplicity and hypocrisy for the Labor Party. Since the government came into office, it has sold off over $11,100,000,000 of government assets, trying to desperately get its fingers on some money to pay the incredible debts that it has been racking up in the decade or so that it has been in governmentsince 1983. Of those $11.1 billion, this Prime Minister, who has been Prime Minister only for a few years, has been responsible for $8.676 billion. In other words, over 80 per cent of the government assets that have been sold off have been sold off under this Prime Minister. It is interesting to have a look at the list of Commonwealth assets which have been listed for sale from 1992-93 to 1995-96. It is quite a list. It includes AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Ltd. As for ANL Ltd, what a farce that is. It appears the government are going to use taxpayers money to pay people to take it off their hands. That is absolutely extraordinary. It is a disgrace and a shame beyond belief. Ordinary Australian people shake their heads in disbelief at the sheer incompetence of the minister-the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton)-who has handled that. Next is the ANZAC rifle range. Australian Airlines-remember them? As for the Commonwealth uranium stockpile, no doubt that went to France. The list goes on: the Commonwealth airports; CSL; the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which we are debating here today; Cockatoo Island; Dasfleet; Housing Loans Insurance Corporation; MCLeod Repatriation Hospital in Melbourne; the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline; Newington Armament Depot; Qantas; surplus land at Brisbane airport; shares in AIDC Ltd; after Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Ltd; and the war services land settlement scheme. There is a list as long as your arm and a little bit more of things that this government has sold off or listed to sell off since this Prime Minister has been in office. The remarkable thing about each asset that the government has sold is that, before selling it, the government has gone to the Australian people and told them that it will not sell it. The government has promised them that it will not sell it. Mr Nehi-Alllies.",64
51,Mr COBB,AMENDMENT BILL,"It was all lies, indeed. It is an extraordinary record of duplicity and hypocrisy, as I have said. That bears repeating often. I do not know how they can live with themselves. If they have got to sink to this to retain the government benches, how do these guys sleep at night? How do they live with themselves? If one has got to do that, one really has to question whether the office is worth it. By contrast, the coalition has been quite honest and open. Coalition members have told the people beforehand-before the electionswhat they intended to do. The government members, in every instance, have knocked them, abused them and promised to do just the opposite, yet they have ended up selling off these assets themselves. Not only do the government promise not to sell and then go ahead and sell but they even do it piece by piece. No better example is there of this than the Commonwealth Bank, which we are debating here today. Initially, the government said they would not sell it. Then they sold 30 per cent of it. When Kerin put out the prospectus for that he said there would not be any further sale of the Commonwealth Bank, but what did they do? Mr Nehl-They sold it.",65
52,Mr COBB,AMENDMENT BILL,"They sold it, as the honourable member for Cowper says. They sold another 20 per cent of it. That brought what they sold up to 50 per cent. What did we then get from the government? Surprise, surprise! Promises that they would not sell any more. I have here in my hot hand a letter from the present Treasurer (Mr Willis) dated 24 September 1993, when he was Minister for Finance. This letter went out in the prospectus. In it Ralph Willis says: Dear Investor, On behalf of the Commonwealth Government, I am pleased to be able to offer you the opportunity acquire shares in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Following the Commonwealth Bank's success in raising equity capital from the public in 1991that is the first 30 per cent they sold offthe Government has decided to offer approximately 178 million of its shares for sale. This will reduce its shareholding in the Bank to not less than 50.1 per cent. The Government has no intentions whatever of further reducing its shareholding. There you have it. What more unequivocal commitment could we get from a senior cabinet member, a senior government officer, than 'The government has no intentions whatever of further reducing its shareholding'? That is the pledge that the Treasurer signed. If his word is worth anything at all, he should abide by that or, at the very least, apologise to the Australian people for overturning his faithful promise. He goes on to say in this letter: The Government is proud of the Commonwealth Bank's record and looks forwardmore duplicity coming up to the Commonwealth of Australia continuing as the Bank's majority shareholder in future. There is another lie. What else could we call it? It was a blatant misleading of the Australian people in writing and signed by the then Minister for Finance, the present Treasurer, of this country. He goes on: In these circumstances, the obligations and liabilities of the Bank will continue to be guaranteed by the Commonwealth of Australia. This is another promise they have broken. Further on in the letter he says: The proceeds from the salethis is the 20 per cent that he is selling off herewill go to the Government and be credited to Consolidated Revenue. That is the nub of it all-getting their grubby little hands on this money and not letting go of it. Here we are today, barely two years later, debating whether to sell off the other 50 per cent. The ink of the Treasurer's signature is virtually not dry and he is breaking all those promises. He did not make just those to promises; he made further promises. The prospectus in which this letter was inserted states: The Government has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information in the prospectus is accurate and is not misleading. What a joke that is! After that, we cannot believe a word this government says. It goes on: In doing so, the Government has had regard to the prospectus requirements of the corporations law. I put to the House that, if any citizen of Australia outside a senior government member had misled the Australian public in such a blatant way, they would be hauled up before the courts andMr Nehl-They would be in gaol.",65
53,Mr COBB,AMENDMENT BILL,"They would be in gaol, as the member for Cowper says. Mr Nehl-Rightly so.",66
54,Mr COBB,AMENDMENT BILL,"And rightly so. The prospectus went further by saying in the additional information section: The Government has no intention whatever of further reducing the Commonwealth of Australia's shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank below 50.1 per cent. So there it is again in the prospectus, repeating what he had said in the letter. It was not as if he had said it once and had made some mistake in writing; he had repeated it again. The prospectus noted that the law-I suppose this is another form of l-a-w law was being changed to require the government to retain at least 50.1 per cent of the voting power in the Commonwealth Bank. It went on to say: Further, neither the Commonwealth nor the Commonwealth Bank will be allowed to do anything to cause or contribute to the Commonwealth no longer holding or controlling the Commonwealth Bank shares carrying the right to exercise at 50.1 per cent of the total voting rights in the Commonwealth Bank. There it is again. The government has written it in plain, simple English, and it is signed off by the Treasurer, or Minister for Finance as he was then. He has broken this commitment, this solemn promise, to the Australian people time and time again, yet he roams free on the streets of Australia. If it had been Joe Bloggs, an ordinary citizen from any electorate in Australia, he would be behind the clanger today, as the member for Cowper said earlier. I do not know how the Treasurer, whom we all think in this place has been an honourable man in the past, can lie straight in bed at night when he signs that and then does what he does. He had a chance to recant on it a month later. Ralph Willis, the then Minister for Finance, was on the Nine Network's Sunday program. In response to a question he was asked, he said: We've made it quite clear in the legislation that went through the Parliament to authorise this sale, that we would not go below the 50.1 per cent. So there it is. He has said it yet again a month later, and he breaks the promise again. He was asked whether-unlike the last time, when John Kerin had broken the commitment, the one I had spoken of earlier-he could give an ironclad guarantee that this was it, draw the line in the sand, make no more broken promises and there be no more misleading of the Australian people. What was his reply to that? He said, 'Absolutely, yes.' You cannot simply believe a word of what they say. What other conclusion can you come to? Where are the government members in here answering these things? This is the most blatant breaking of promises, misleading of the Australian people and lying to the constituents of Australia that I think has ever been demonstrated in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. It is absolutely extraordinary . Mr Nehl-They think everybody's a mug.",66
55,Mr COBB,AMENDMENT BILL,"They think everybody is a mug. They treat the Australian people with contempt. Nothing could more clearly and absolutely demonstrate it than these words I least have read out today-these very words from the present Treasurer. At the last budget for this last sale, when did they put it to the cabinet? I am not talking about the caucus; I am talking about their own cabinet. When did the inner group-the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and goodness knows who else; I presume the present Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley-put it to their own cabinet? When did they trust this information to them? Ninety minutes before the budget was delivered. Can you believe it! They even deceived their own cabinet. One can only guess when the caucus heard it. I guess most of them heard it when it was read out here that night. It is beyond belief. They treat their own members with contempt, not just the Australian people. They are condemned out of their own mouths. Just on that alone they deserve to be thrown out of office for their duplicity and misleading of the Australian people. We might well ask: why are they selling off the Commonwealth Bank? The answer is simple: the government is broke. When they took over the reins of office in 1983, the current account deficit in this country was very small. This year it is $27 billion-a record. The overseas debt was of the order of $23 billion in 1983. Today it is in excess of $180 billion and rising fast. Savings in this country are at an all time low. Mr Sciacca-What about the $200 billion in superannuation-greater than the foreign debt. An all-time low?",66
56,Mr COBB,AMENDMENT BILL,"Savings in this country are at an all-time low. That is an indisputable fact. This government is the highest taxing, highest spending government this country has ever seen, particularly so under this present Prime Minister. Total government revenue since the present Prime Minister came to power, which is not all that long ago, has increased by 30 per cent from $95 billion to $124 billion. These are absolutely irrefutable facts. Revenue is estimated to increase over the next three years of government by a further 21 per cent, with tax revenue increasing by 23 per cent. When is it going to stop if this mob is returned again? The Commonwealth's own debt-I am excluding the states from this-has risen during the time of the present Prime Minister by 130 per cent. These are absolutely staggering figures indeed. For the first time in the 13-year history of this government, 1995 will see this government run down capital. We are going to have negative outlays. In 1995-96, under the present Prime Minister, capital outlays will be minus 2.8 per cent of total outlays. By any standards, it is a record that I think they should be utterly and thoroughly ashamed of. In the short time remaining to me, I express some particular concerns about the Commonwealth Development Bank. In their haste to sell off the Commonwealth Bank and break every solemn, faithful, absolute promise they made about that, the government have left the Commonwealth Development Bank hanging out on a limb with a most unclear future. That is of great concern to people, particularly in country areas. I represent a country area myself. Many of my constituents, small business and farming people, have loans with the Commonwealth Development Bank, many of them because they cannot get these loans anywhere else. The Commonwealth Development Bank has a history of lending to small business and farmers-as a lender of last resort, if you like. They have been receiving a subsidy of $20 million a year from the Commonwealth government. Now it is going to be transferred. The explanatory memorandum states that one of the main purposes of this bill is to provide for the conversion of the Commonwealth Development Bank from a statutory authority to a Corporations Law company. Item 28 of the explanatory memorandum states: Item 28 provides for the conversion of the Commonwealth Development Bank into a public company limited by shares under the Corporations Law ... the Commonwealth Development Bank will become a registered company ... In other words, the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank, which was as a lender of last resort, will be transferred to a memorandum. This memorandum can be subsequently amended under the Corporations Law. The Commonwealth Bank as we know it will become just another bank and will disappear into the sands of time, I guess, in the future. The government does not seem to care about that. We have the Prime Minister out railing about superannuation investment managers not investing in non-blue-chip stocks while here is a bank that is prepared to lend money and the government is letting it go. What hypocrisy! (Time expired)",67
57,Mrs SULLIVAN,AMENDMENT BILL,"Moncrieff) (2.13 p.m.)I am aware that I am the last member listed to speak on the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill today. In that context, I reiterate what was pointed out by the member who spoke before me, the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb); that is, there has been a total absence of government members from the chamber in this debate. Apart from the second reading speech, we have had one backbench member, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), speak up in defence of the government's decision on this matter. The decision by the government to sell its remaining 50.1 per cent share in the time Commonwealth Bank surely illustrates a very low point indeed in Australian politics. This decision was made apparently in a matter only a couple of days before the delivery the actual budget by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis). decision was conveyed to cabinet 90 minutes before the budget speech was read to the nation in this parliament. I concur with the public. previous speaker, the honourable member for Parkes, in saying that it appears that the first government members knew about it was when they heard it in here. Let us get something very clear: it has been the coalition's policy to sell the Commonthe wealth Bank-and that decision was made and announced some time ago. However, there is a world of difference between our actions on this and the actions government. Firstly, we made it public that it was our intention to privatise the Commonthan wealth Bank, and we went to an election on the that issue. Secondly, we said sell the bank, and likewise other government assets, for only one purpose: to retire debt. In other words, the privatising of publicly owned facilities was to take place only to retire public debt and was to be an investment, in that sense, in this nation's future. We were also, I repeat, totally up front about it. Contrast that with the Keating government's behaviour and actions on the privatisation the Commonwealth Bank. This privatisation has taken place over a period of time. Everybeing one-particularly all those who work in this building-is aware that that has been a painful process for the Labor Party from day one. Public ownership of the national bank, namely, the Commonwealth Bank, has been to an article of faith with the Labor Party for decades, for longer than many of its present members of this parliament have been aliveprior to their birth. The Commonwealth Bank has been a central article of faith with the Labor Party, and there was vigorous and bitter opposition to any privatisation of it. I said a minute ago that no-one would be more aware of that than anyone who has been an occupant of this House since the process started. There was a when, as you walked along the corridors of this Parliament House past the offices of private members, you would see displayed, in of the clear glass window next to the external of door to members' offices, posters condemning the government's decision to sell any share in The the Commonwealth Bank-and these were the offices belonging to none other than Labor Party members. It has been that bitter and that As has already been pointed out, but as I must point out again because it is so central to judging the government's action in this: senior government people have made absolute declarations in the recent past with respect to privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank, as late as two years ago when the prospectus of the secondary share offer of 178 million shares was issued by the government. And the of the Keating statement was made: Apart from the reduction in shareholding to not less 50.1 per cent, no other changes to the current relationship between the Commonwealth Bank and government will occur as a result of the comthat we would pletion of the offer. That is, as a result of the completion of the share offer made in September 1993. It has been pointed out here over and again that the government itself put statements in writing. When this sale was announced in May, a series of questions were directed to the Treasurer on the subject of how the decision was made, what did it mean in relation to him of personally that these statements could have been made over signature and here it was just ripped up. Of course Mr Willis had to fob it off. Why? I come to the second significant difference between the government and the coalition on the matter of the sale of the bank: the government needs the money, not retire debt, not to invest in the future of this nation-the term the Prime Minister emphasises all the time-but simply to pay its ongoing bills. The Keating government has banked on its assumption that the Australian electorate is economically illiterate, that it does not understand the significance of selling major assets to go towards balancing the budget rather than capital investment, for example, retiring debt. But nobody in Australia was foolednobody. Government members would know very well by now, because they would have had the same reaction from their constituents as I have had, that people are aware that this is reckless, profligate economic management. I recently undertook a survey of all constituents in my electorate. I Ietterboxed my electorate with a questionnaire. One of the things that was on that questionnaire was 12 headings of political issues. I asked my constituents, if they wished to respond to this survey, to indicate which of these 12 issues they considered the four most important. Interestingly, the second most important was size of government-a quite sophisticated response, I would think. Ranking also very highly was the subject of economic management. The electorate is not stupid. The people of Australia are not economically illiterate. They do see what happens and take note of it and they consider what government does is important. As I have said, my constituents reacted very strongly at the time of the budget to the announcement that this money from the sale of the remaining 50.1 per cent of shareholding would go towards deficit reduction. This is the same as selling the family car to pay the local authority rates. Everybody knows the significance. If you sell a capital item in order to pay a current debt and a recurring debt, then next year you will be faced with the same problem. If you sell the family car in order to pay your local authority property rates, in 12 months time you are going to get another property rate notice. The difference is you are not going to have the motor vehicle available to sell again to pay that bill. That is the economic fix this government has got itself into. It has to sell an item worth billions of dollars in order just to partially pay its ongoing expenses. Those expenses will be here again next year. It is reckless economic behaviour and it fools no-one. Everybody knows that the government is being profligate in its behaviour, that it is incapable of good economic management, that it has to sell off public assets just to pay its current bills and that next year that problem will not have gone away. The decision to sell the bank was, of course, the result of an election year budget. The government made this decision in desperation. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister came to their decision in desperation so they could go into an election saying, 'Aren't we good economic managers,' hoping that, given the budget was last May, the election was sufficiently far enough away for this behaviour to have been forgotten. Well, it has not been forgotten and, in its own ranks, it will not be forgiven. I wish to refer to a couple of small newspaper reports in the press last week. Like many other people, I have been waiting with some interest to see the legislation for this bank sale-I have been waiting to see just how it would be handled. We were told that exposure drafts would be available during the budget session, but the first we saw of this bill was when it was introduced into the House of Representatives last week, and here we are debating it this week. This proposed piece of law is very, very complicated and profound. The shadow minister for privatisation, the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), outlined quite a number of those difficulties when she responded on behalf of the coalition at the beginning of this debate. Here we are, as I said, only a few days after seeing the bill and we are debating it. Government members are stunningly conspicuous in their absence from this debate, because they do not want to speak on it. They do not want to have any words on the record that can be quoted by any of their political enemies on this subject, and I am not talking about Liberal Party and National Party political enemies. I am talking about their enemies on this issue from within-and they are many indeed. The Labor Party pursued a quite extraordinary process last week. After having treated cabinet-much less the backbench-with contempt in letting it know how this legislation was to be handled, the Labor Party followed a very different process to the norm with its caucus. The Labor Party prides itself on having extremely democratic systems-its branches, its organisation and within parliament. Everybody gets a go-they get a chance to have their say. The normal process of handling a bill like this would have been to put it through the caucus economics committee, for those members to thoroughly consider it and make a recommendation to caucus. Caucus always holds the right to change government decisions, and it has done that. It changed a number after the last budget was announced. In that instance, caucus prevailed on the government to change a number of its decisions, but this time caucus was not going to get the chance-the reason being that the parliamentary leaders of the Labor Party knew they had trouble on their hands. Newspaper reports outlined this in little detail. I congratulate the managers of the Labor Party on being able to hold this issue as close as they did. Only two newspapers reported it-one was the Herald-Sun and the other was the Canberra Times. I was surprised that the issue appeared to go right over the heads of the rest of the press gallery. I guess the reason is that we have waited too long and the issue has been able to fade from public sight-not least from the sight of the press, who are not vigilant to the significance of this bill. Nevertheless, these reports told us that there was a backbench revolt and, significantly, it took the form of a motion on procedure. Motions on procedure generally do not bind members of factions. That motion on procedure-which was a motion to make cabinet follow the normal party procedure; that is, consideration by the caucus committee prior to consideration by caucus-was put to a vote and missed being carried by only six votes. The vote was 40 to 34, which shows how deep the divisions are. We are told that the government prevailed on the grounds that if this was carried, it would cause enormous embarrassment to the government. We are told that the member for Canning (Mr Gear), the Assistant Treasurer, argued that the legislation had to be accepted because it was crucial to the budget and that the chairman of the caucus economics committee, in a classic act of betrayal, not only of his party but of his caucus committee responsibilities-namely, the member for Lilley (Mr Swan)-argued the same. But a number of backbenchers thought otherwise. I wonder where the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) and the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), for example, are today. They spoke vigorously against going ahead with the bill at all, much less through the caucus when the matter was before caucus last week. According to the story in the Canberra Times, that vote of 40 to 34 was interpreted as a show of opposition by caucus members who abound by their faction support for the bill to show how they really felt. In other words, they were not going to go against their faction but they did want to demonstrate to the government how strongly they felt. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), in his typical way, went out and said that there was strong support for the budget in caucus when, in fact, there was nothing. The Deputy Prime Minister gets away with that sort of misleading of the press time and again. He thinks he can go out with a smile and in a jolly way say anything he likes against the facts and that it will be swallowed. Apparently, it was swallowed by quite a few because, by and large, the press overlooked the significance of this. The Labor Party itself will not. The great legacy to the Labor Party in the time ahead will be not whether it had a backbench revolt, not whether it was so clever that it got this measure through its own party and through the parliament with a minimum of fuss and attention, but what it is going to do to its own supporters' attitude towards to the government come the election. We have as many indications as the government does that morale is extremely low in the organisational wing of the Labor Party at the moment. It is actions like this which will mean that they are in trouble with their own when it comes to the election day. Whilst this bill is imminently going to pass the House of Representatives, the day of reckoning is yet to come for the Labor Party. It will come where it matters most-in the ballot box in the forthcoming election.",67
58,Mr WILLIS,AMENDMENT BILL,"I wish to say a few words in conclusion of this second reading debate. Clearly, the opposition has been annoyed very much by the fact that the government has seen fit to change its mind in relation to the sale of the rest of the shares in the Commonwealth Bank and to proceed with such a sale. They obviously do not like us doing that and would prefer it to be something that was left to them. We had lots of gratuitous advice about how this is in conflict with Labor Party policy and ethics, et cetera. I think we are ones who are better able to judge what is suitable to Labor Party policy. We will certainly stand up and defend the actions that we have taken in this regard in all our party councils or anywhere else. It is not in conflict with our party policy, nor has there been any suggestion from anyone within the party that it is in any way in conflict with party policy. There has been some point made by a number of speakers about the government's change of mind on this issue and the fact that this is somehow a heinous thing for it to do. There have been suggestions of total impropriety because statements have been made about no intention to sell further and then the decision was made to do so. The most important of those statements was the one I made as Minister for Finance in the prospectus, where it was stated clearly in the letter to investors that there is no intention of the government to sell down further. The important thing is that that was an absolutely true and accurate statement of government intention at that time. That is what the prospectus is about. The prospectus is about saying what the conditions are at the time when the prospectus is issued. Clearly, if there had been an intention by us to do something else at that time and we were saying that there was no such intention, then that would have been a totally misleading statement. But that was not the case. It was subsequently well down the track that we made the decision to go ahead with the sale of the rest of the shares. Any suggestion that this has meant some detriment to investors is a complete and utter nonsense. There is no sign of any detriment to investors in the bank. The share price on budget night was $9.51 and the share price last night was $10.26. If there was some terrible imposition on the shareholders by this announcement, one would have expected that that would have shown up in a walking away from the asset. But, on the contrary, we have seen a much higher price. In fact, the price has been as high as $10.90. There has been plenty of opportunity since budget night for people who did not like the sale to sell off at a considerable profit, get out of that investment and go the somewhere else where they would be happier. Clearly, the overall position of the market is one of support for the Commonwealth Bank. Since the announcement, it has made good payments of dividends and it has also had a higher share price. This has been a very good buy for investors. The smaller investors who bought shares in 1993 did so at a price of $9.35 and the institutions paid $9.60. They have all shown a capital appreciation since that time. There can be no suggestion that there has been any damaging impact on the shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank in respect of either the dividends paid, which have been very good; the performance of the bank in terms of its profitability; or the share price, which reflects those factors. There have been a number of suggestions that somehow the Commonwealth Development Bank arrangements were less than satisfactory. The second reading amendment which is before the House reflects that. It says that the shareholders agreement should be included as a schedule to the bill. We are very concerned to ensure that the Commonwealth Development Bank is maintained as a substantial institution to provide concessional finance to small business and the rural sector. It has been very much part of our determination in shaping this sale to ensure that that was the outcome for the future. The proposed sale arrangements-that is, the bill and the shareholders' agreement as a package-clearly define the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank. The bill will enact various provisions which are fundamental to the future of the development bank as an independent financial institution providing specialist banking services. As I advised the House, the bill will provide for the conversion of the development bank from a statutory authority to a public company under the Corporations Law and will provide an ongoing Commonwealth guarantee of its liabilities. In addition, the arrangements will ensure that the existing ownership is retained at 91.9 per cent for the Commonwealth Bank and 8.1 per cent for us; that an adequate annual subsidy is maintained; and that the charter is retained. In addition, by providing the development bank with greater independence with its own banking authority, the development bank can market itself more effectively to the benefit of its customers-that is, the small business community and the rural sector. We see no need for the shareholders' agreement between the Commonwealth and the CBA to be included as a schedule to the bill because the agreement, which does not exist at this stage, will be a contractual arrangement binding the CBA and the Commonwealth to certain undertakings regarding the development bank. The CBA has already provided an undertaking that it will not walk away from the development bank or exercise its voting power to amend the development bank's memorandum or articles of association or to change the opment bank's charter as long as an adequate annual subsidy is provided. It is our intention to provide an adequate annual subsidy because we want the development bank to continue to perform the role that it has performed in the past. Given the importance of the specialist services provided by the development bank, the Commonwealth will provide an adequate annual subsidy and, therefore, under this government, the future of the development bank is quite assured. The CBA board and the management are happy with the proposed sale arrangements, including those relating to the development bank. In fact, I am advised that the CBA chairman, speaking at the annual general meeting of the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney this morning, said that the bill 'incorporates to the bank's satisfaction all the arrangements anticipated at the time the government announced the sale of its shares'. So there are no qualms on the part of the bank about these arrangements. In relation to the buyback of shares by the Commonwealth Bank, I refer to the second item in the second reading amendment, which reads: ... the Government should give assurances that any acquisition of property that arises in consequence of the buy back of shares ... will be on just terms under section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution ... The buyback of shares by the Commonwealth Bank does not involve the acquisition of property by the Commonwealth. It involves acquisition of property by the Commonwealth Bank. As a consequence, it is not relevant for the purposes of section 51 (xxxi) of the constitution. The opposition does not understand the whole nature of the buyback. We are not buying back. We are the seller. The buyer is the Commonwealth Bank. It is buying back the shares because it has excess capital and, by buying back these shares and extinguishing them, it can effectively utilise its reserves in a way which improves the capital assets of its shareholders. That is not an unconventional thing to do. Other banks are looking at doing something similar, I understand. This is a highly appropriate way for the Commondevel- wealth Bank to operate on behalf of its shareholders and it is certainly suitable to the Commonwealth's purposes as a part of the overall sale. The buyback of shares will only occur with the approval of a 75 per cent majority of the private shareholders voting at a special shareholders meeting. So clearly they have to decide overwhelmingly that they see it as being in their interests. The buyback will be structured in such a way that satisfies the requirements of the CBA management and the private shareholders. The possibility of a buyback is still being considered by the bank and the government. We have foreshadowed that as something which we both think looks good. That is something that we will refine as we come to the sale process proper. I tum to the final aspect, that the savings provision in the bill regarding the regulation making power is intended to facilitate the smooth implementation of the sale process. The smooth implementation of the sale process is in the interests of all existing and prospective Commonwealth Bank shareholders. I commend the bill again to the House. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mrs Bishop's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. [2.47 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - M. A. J. Vaile) Ayes ...............

59,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"1 inform the House that the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, the Hon. Gordon Bilney, will be absent from question time this week. Mr Bilney is overseas on government business. I will answer questions today on his behalf. NA Inflation",74
60,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister. I ask the Deputy Prime Minister: after running massive deficits over the past few years, with mortgage interest charges rising by 25 per cent over the past 12 months and your own tax increases contributing a full half of a percentage point to inflation over the last year, as revealed in today's figures, isn't it the case that the main cause of higher inflation over the last year has been your own government and its high spending, high taxing and high interest rate policies?",74
61,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to that is no, of course. I also point out that these figures are well and truly within government expectations in light of the figuresMr Howard interjecting Mr BEAZLEYYou-moralising on the subject of inflation rates! This is an inflation rate which is, on the underlying rate, one-third the rate that you presided over when you left office as Treasurer and less, on the headline rate, than one-half the rate you presided over. The difference between the situation now and the situation then is that we were in the depths of a savage recession when you left and we have had 16 consecutive quarters of growth. At the end of 16 consecutive quarters of growth, when there usually is, through the cycle, a little bit of inflationary pressure around the place, we have a set of figures that are well within our anticipation when we look at the Reserve Bank Governor's detennination of what ought to be the inflation rate over the life of a business cycle, which is about two per cent to three per cent. There are a series of one-offs in this. They relate to some extent to a rise in Commonwealth indirect taxes, to a rise in franchise fees from the states, and to one-offs like the end of the rebate that the NRMA had operating in New South Wales and the ACT for some time which has reduced car insurance in New South Wales I think by 11 per cent and in Canberra by some 18 per cent. They cannot keep paying out that rebate; they have paid out something like $300 million. By any comparison with the situation in Australia's past and by any comparison with the record of the honourable member who just asked that question and who presided over a truly appalling inflation rate at a time of very high levels of unemployment, the position is, as I have said, reasonable and, as I have also said, well within the expectations that the government laid down during the last budget. Special Intervention Program",74
62,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Is the minister aware of recent media reports about the special intervention program? What is the government's response to these reports?",75
63,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of a report, which I must say was a huge beat-up, that appeared on Sunday in the Telegraph Mirror. I am particularly disturbed that, in writing the story, they did not even seek any comment from me or my office. Yes, it is true that under the special intervention program the Commonwealth has committed $160 million this financial year. But 90 per cent of that funding goes to English as a second language programs particularly designed in recognition of the fact that non-English speaking background people face a real barrier to getting into employment. The ESL program and literacy and numeracy programs account for 90 per cent of this $160 million. A further 10 per cent is devoted to the homelessness issue-and the member for Hinkler would understand fully the importance of this initiative, because he has currently got an application for funding under this heading-as well as to skill development and personal development. So far as the beat-up in the newspaper is concerned-this so-called '$160 million in perks': CES pays for car repairs, diets and dental; in other words, specific financial assistance-only $1 million, or 0.6 of a per cent, actually goes to programs which were emblazoned in that headline. In all of the examples quoted in the article, everyone who got assistance under that specific dimension also got a job. So, in other words, the special intervention program is successful and it does complement the case management approach which we have to the labour market programs in that it can more specifically target the sorts of measures that are needed. Over the last year alone the special intervention program has helped 28,000 people get into a job. I also thought that we had something like bipartisan support for the special intervention program. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition in his fair go speech, or whatever it was, to ACOSS the other day said: We must always ensure that our social welfare system contains effective incentives for responsible behaviour, independence and self-help ... That is what these programs provide. In the speech he went on to say: We have a duty to ensure that newly arrived migrants are able to acquire the language and vocational skills needed to participate fully in the labour market. In Iobsback itself, the special intervention programs get continuing support from the opposition, on paper at least, because they provide programs in basic literacy, numeracy and presentational skills. But, when you look at the article, who was it out there inflaming the opposition to this very successful program-a program which, on paper, the opposition supports? None other than 'Dr Darkness' over there, the shadow minister for employment, education and training. He was summoning up all the sullenness that he could gather in his attack on this program on Sunday. He said that it was a 'big waste of money'. He said that it was creating training, not jobs. He said that it was a program open to abuse because we had now made the guidelines too flexible. Those comments are very interesting, because I have in front of me a letter-and I will table this-from the same person, the shadow minister for employment, education and training, to me on 24 July this year. In the letter he asks me to relax the special intervention program on behalf of one of his constituents who could not get access towait for it-not a job, but a training program. So he is out there attacking in the newspaper the fact that this program is a waste of money, but then he wants to say to me, 'Let me spend more; let me bend the rules more.' This is complete duplicity and it demonstrates the real problem that those on the other side of the House have when it comes to these programs. The Leader of the Opposition goes along to ACOSS and makes all of these reassuring noises about how they will not cut the programs. He goes along to FECCA and says, 'We will keep those programs in place.' But when they get the opportunity, they say, 'These programs are a waste of money.' In other words, if you elect the Liberal Party at the next election, these programs will be cut. The simple fact of the matter is that the opposition in relation to these matters is mean spirited and deceitful. We will be making sure the various groups that benefit from these programs continue to understand that it is only under Labor that they will get this support. I table the document. Interest Rates",75
64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Deputy Prime Minister. With inflation rising more than expected for the third quarter in a row and underlying inflation now above the Reserve Bank's target of three per cent, will you now concede that you were deliberately misleading the mortgage holders of Australia when you and the Prime Minister falsely claimed that interest rates were about to fall? Is it not now an undeniable fact that struggling home buyers, whose average home repayments have increased by more than $120 in the last year, will not see the interest rate cut that you and the Prime Minister promised?",76
65,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This comes from a bloke who, when he left office, had a rigid ceiling on home loan mortgage rates that was, nevertheless, 2Y2 percentage points above where the home loan rate is at the moment. Vastly fewer people were capable of obtaining a home loan in those days with those rigid figures. With repayments on those figures impossible to sustain, people were obliged to go around and cocktail loans up to three or four percentage points higher than that. When you have come through with all of that, you come and criticise us for the contemporary level of home loan rates! What people have now in home loan rates is a wide variety of choice-from 10.5 per cent down to, in the case of some of the new lenders, a figure of around about eight per cent or 8Y2 per cent. By any comparison of the situation now with that of Australia's past, that is a good position for people to be in. What we have had and what they have enjoyed now for a substantial period of time is stability in their rates. We, of course, do not predict any particular direction of movement at any particular time, except to say that the budget policies we have put in place and the policies we have put in place for superannuation are going to enable us to sustain the type of interest rate regime that Australians did not experience during the 1980s, nor were they capable of experiencing during the period of time that the opposition leader was Treasurer of this nation. There is no threat to that position whatsoever from these figures. Minimum Wage",76
66,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is it possible for an award worker in Queensland to be paid $250 per week? Are any workers covered by clause 9 of the federal metal industry award, which includes a minimum wage of $238.10 per week? If not, why not?",76
67,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Oxley for his question, especially as we saw yesterday the member for Flinders shoot himself in the foot when he said that the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission operates a minimum weekly wage of $250. This is untrue. This is not the case. In the case of Queensland, the $250 figure is but one component of wages, not the total wage paid to the employee. The award rate paid to employees includes a margin on top of Mr Reith's $250. I am advised by the DIR that not only are there no full-time adult award employees in Queensland being paid $250 per week but also it is impossible to do so-impossible to do so. That is the advice of the DIR. It was not only one foot that the honourable member shot yesterday, though, because he joined the fray later in the afternoon with a press release in which he alleged that, in the federal jurisdiction, it is legal to pay workers $238.10 under the federal metal industry award. That was his assertion yesterday afternoon. The truth is that the lowest rate in the metal industry award is not $238.10 per week; it is $341.10. Okay? Did you get that? No full-time adult worker is paid less than that amount.",77
68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Clause 9!,77
69,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me tum my attention to clause 9. Clause 9 of the metal industry award, to which the honourable member has just referred, is an obsolete hangover, let me say, from a system that existed between the years of 1907 and-guess when?-1967. It is not really surprising that the honourable member would make this mistake, because his industrial relations policies all belong to this era. He has always been about IR 1960s style. Under the Industrial Relations Reform Act, the industrial parties are required to review all awards and identify obsolete provisions and take the necessary steps to have them removed. Let us listen to what the parties have determined here. They have identified clause 9-and it does not apply to anyone; it has not applied since 1967. The Metal Trades Industry Association and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures have resolved that it should be removed-not to mention the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. They have all said that, seeing as it has not operated for more than 25 years, it should be removed. Just like most of the press releases of the member for Flinders, his latest effort was nothing but a cheap stunt, combining no facts whatsoever and 25 years out of date. I have to say this: the lack of understanding of the shadow minister on all matters industrial relations and how these things operate is positively breathtaking. You could not credit that someone who holds himself out to be the next Minister for Industrial Relations in this nation could be so inept and so iII informed. But there again, perhaps it is quite understandable, given their track record of ripping away award protections and attacking the conditions of all Australian workers. So eager have they been to support the Western Australian minimum-that minimum that we have rightly condemned of $317 per week-that they have failed absolutely and most miserably to notice the stark differences, between their approach and our approach. That Western Australian minimum that John Howard embraced as his template is a real minimum. It is one which employers can impose without any regard to penalty rates, without any regard to overtime, without any regard to hours of work or to annual leave loadings. It is a figure set at the political whim, at the stroke of a pen, by John Howard's model IR minister-Graham Kierath. He gets to set it. Nothing could be further from our system-a federal system of protections with comprehensive award underpinning; one with guaranteed entitlements for everyone for overtime, for penalty rates, for hours of work provisions and leave loadings. Estate Mortgage Group",77
70,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Has the minister received representations concerning the plight of pensioners affected by the failure of the Estate Mortgage group in 1990? What action is the government taking to assist those pensioners?,77
71,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that he, the member for Calare and a number of others have been very concerned about the impact of the collapse of the Estate Mortgage group and the impact that subsequent developments have had on people's pension entitlements. I am pleased to be able to advise the honourable member that the government has decided to take some specific measures to address this problem. By way of background, the Estate Mortgage group failed in 1990. Global Funds Management took over the six funds of the group in October 1990 and consolidated them into one trust, the Meridian Investment Trust. This trust was listed on the stock exchange in December 1993. This listing meant that the trust falls under the so-called rate of return method for valuing managed investments in the pension income test. Honourable members would be aware that the government legislated to that effect some time ago. The price of the stock for most of the period since then has either fallen or been fairly static, so the impact on people's pensions has been minimal. With the September bulk update that the department does-a regular quarterly bulk update-there has been a rather sharp rise in the value of these units. That has produced a marked effect on some pension incomes. The rate of return methodology is yielded at some 30 per cent to 40 per cent, in that order of magnitude. There are a number of special circumstances relating to this problem that need to be taken into consideration. As a result of the collapse of the Estate Mortgage group, the remaining units ended up being valued into the new consolidated arrangements at $1 per unit, which reflected little more than the net asset backing of those units. Litigation is under way by which the unit holders are seeking to achieve some restitution for the losses they suffered. So there is a real sense that the people holding those units are locked in as a result of the fact that litigation is progressing and has not yet reached a conclusion. It was my view and the government's view that there was a case for special treatment to be provided to this group. What the government has decided to do is proceed by way of an ex gratia payment, which will have the consequence of effectively bringing this particular group under a regime similar to the new tiered deeming arrangements that will come into effect from July this year. In effect, we will be providing an ex gratia payment that means these people's pension entitlements will be set as if the tiered deeming arrangements, which come into effect in July, are operational. The difference between what the unit holders are entitled to under the current legislation and what they will be entitled to under the tiered deeming arrangements will be, in effect, an ex gratia payment. We expect about 8,000 DSS and veteran pensioners to benefit from this concession. This decision was announced earlier today. I have spoken to a number of key people affected, and they are very happy with the announcement we have made. It was a vindication of the government's decision to proceed to the new extended deeming arrangements from July of next year under which arrangement this sort of problem would not have arisen in the first instance. Minimum Wage",78
72,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Minister, you have been scathing about the $317.10 minimum award wage in Western Australia. Is it not true that the minimum award wage for an employee working in the tenpin bowling industry in Western Australia under a federal award is less than $317.10 a week in nine categories? Is it not true that under the commercial industrial artists award in Western Australia the award minimum in that state is below $317.10 in two categories out of five and as low as $271.10 in one of those categories under a federal award? Is it not true that under the theatrical employees award respondents in Western Australia can be paid less than $317.10 in a whole raft of still categories in that federal award and can be paid less than $317 in other federal awards? Is it now clear that you and the Prime Minister have misinformed the Australian public and you should withdraw your recent statements and your misleading advertisements? ",78
73,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When will they ever learn? When will they ever learn the difference between a system that is based upon comprehensive award underpinning and - ne where there is no guaranteed award and which only involves minima-inclu-ing their minimum of $317 per week? Ours IS a system in which overtime, penalty rates, leave loadings and hours of work are all sacrosanct. No agreement can be made without .th- indepe?dent Industrial Relations CommIssIOn puttmg the ruler over the circumstances of that worker and determining that the worker is not worse off in the totality of the worker's entitlements. That totality involves all of the allowances, all of the penalties, all of the loadings, superannuation and hours of. work. This is like taking candy from chIldren, really. Let me tell you what it means in terms of hours of work. Under our system we have hours of work in the award. But under your system, under the system in W7stern Aus-r-lia with $317.10 per week, there IS no provISIon for overtime-no provision whatsoever. There is no provision for annual le-ve loadi-gs and no provision for superannuatIOn. That IS your system. That is why it is so - bhorre.n- to Australian workers. It allows theIr condItIOns to be taken from them. It allows an employer to take someone on and say, 'You get the $317 per week or you do not get the job.' Under the federal system they have to be paid all of the entitlements of a comprehensive award system. You fail absolutely to understand the difference. Ours has comprehensiveness, ours has protection; yours has miserly minima. You have proudly boasted about it. At a federal level you have not even said that there will be a minimum weekly rate. You have said that there will be a minimum hourly rate and that there will be two weeks sick leavewhich in the Tweed Valley case the member for Flinders said he was quite happy to see traded away and criticised me for attacking itMr Reith-That's not true.",79
74,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is exactly with you said. Don't tell me that we a.re ready for another backflip. You are not gomg to come out now and say that you do not believe sick leave should be traded in, are you? I feel another sudden change coming on now that the truth has been revealed. That is all they have put down, plus the fourth - inimum miserly condition of 12 months unpatd parental leave. The conditions are four weeks annual leave and two weeks non-cumulative sick leave. If you have an award at the moment where you are entitled to accumulate your sick leave, under your declared policy it goes-it is finished. 'Y-at do y-u get? You get miserly, stingy mInIma. I. - Ill welc?me every question from the opposItIOn that g-ves me a chance to contrast the comprehensIveness of our approach, the inclusionary approach that we have always taken, one that guarantees no worker can be worse off at - he end of the day, with your approach which would trapdoor all workers down to miserable minima. Let us think for a moment about Australian industry. Let us think about those workers who you say would be able to keep their awards, who would not be worse off because you say that they would have to .opt out rath-r than opt in. Think about them m a competItive marketplace. Think of the restaurant worker with a restaurant down the street set up in competition. You - ay that, - n-er you, the existing employer wIth the eXlstmg employee would be protected with the award. But the competition would be able to go. for the miserable minima. What you have IS a policy for industrial mayhem. The fact is that 43 per cent of all Australian workers have faced a new employer over the last three years. That is an undisputed fact. For those 43 per cent of workers, you would trapdoor them to the bare minima. They would have no award protection at all. For the 57 per cent who are left, you say, 'You will be right under us, trust us' - as the Victorians were supposed to trust Jeff Kennett when he said, 'Everyone will be all right; noone will be worse off,' or as the Western Australians were supposed to trust their Premier, Richard Court, when he said, 'I'm no Jeff Kennett.' That is what he said: 'I'm no Jeff Kennett; trust us.' This is what the 57 per cent would be faced with. They would be faced with the competition to their employer being able to undercut their wages package. What would that mean in a competitive marketplace--one with an unfair dismissal process that you are pledged to gut? It is not 43 per cent of the Australian work force who would be insecure; it would be a full lOOper cent under your miserable policies. Nuclear Weapons",79
75,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer the minister to page 86 of Senator Gareth Evans's book Australia's Foreign Relations in which Senator Evans says: The ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament is one to which Australia and nearly all members of the international community have long subscribed. Why is the Prime Minister trying to present Australia's support for nuclear disarmament as a new initiative when Australia has supported this goal for the last 40 years?,80
76,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Basically because he has a whole series of new initiatives to implement it. That is what he was talking about yesterday; he was talking about a process that involves the foreign minister going to argue before the International Court of JusticeMr Downer interjecting,80
77,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If that is your level of sophisticated understanding of this, then it is even lower than I had hitherto anticipated, which is pretty low. What Senator Evans is doing at that court is making sure, in so far as he can, that no decision is reached by the court which would in any way, shape or form legitimise the use of nuclear weapons, or, if he can go one better, get them to actively outlaw nuclear weapons. Those two propositions are what he is sent there to argue for. There is also a set of propositions from the Prime Minister on a series of multilateral initiatives to build upon the success that we have enjoyed in arms control negotiations as a country in the chemical weapons area, where we have played a leading role in beginning to get in place a comprehensive approach to prevent the spread of chemical weapons and the proven capacities of this government diplomatically in the exercise undertaken a couple of years ago in Cambodia. We will apply that and our substantial activities in regard to the comprehensive test ban across the board to a range of activities, including the comprehensive test ban and also the opportunities for interlinking South Pacific nuclear free zones with other southern hemisphere nuclear-free zones. In other words, it is a comprehensive approach to putting in place a range of arms control agreements in relation to nuclear weapons. This government has, as the honourable member points out, for a very long time had a commitment to active measures to eliminate nuclear weapons. The practical activities of this government in the comprehensive test ban area and in the nuclear weapons free zone area contrast markedly with the opposition, which has for a substantial period of timefor strategic reasons that they have argued, even though they believe ultimately in the elimination of nuclear weapons-been put on a very long spoon with very little practical activity underneath it, except to vilify this government, particularly in the area of South Pacific nuclear free zone efforts that we made back in the early 1980s, as the chap who has been heckling me throughout the course of this answer well knows. AMH Meatworks",80
78,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations and concerns an agreement known as the AMH Guyra Meatworks enterprise agreement. Wrat are the features of that agreement and how does it affect the workers of that facility? Also, does AMH employ a Mr Bruce Townsend at its Rockhampton works? What activities has Mr Townsend been undertaking at that location?",80
79,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for her question. I can tell the House that I am aware of the Guyra Meatworks enterprise agreement. I am aware of it despite the secrecy that cloaks it. It is thoroughly the sort of agreement that the Mudginberri manMr Tim Fischer-It's under your system.,80
80,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me correct you: no, it is not under our system at all. Mr Tim Fischer-Yes, it is.",81
81,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it is under the New South Wales Liberal system. Mr Tim Fischer-Wrong!",81
82,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member says I am wrong. Let me repeat and make it absolutely clear that it is under a system introduced by a conservative government in New South Wales in the failed industrial relations reforms of John Fahey. That is the system. Of course, it is a system in which all agreements are confidential and are not subject to any public scrutiny. That is why I know it is not one of ours, because ours are all transparent; ours are all before the Industrial Relations Commission; ours are there for all to see; ours have the right of unions to appear; and ours have a very open process. But that is not the case under the system which to the credit of Jeff Shaw is currently being reformed in New South Wales. That is the Guyra Meatworks enterprise agreement system. It is not just a system admired by those sitting opposite with the member for Mudginberri. The member for O'Connor said the other week in his staunch defence of the Court government's first and second wave of reform that he 'particularly welcomed the move not to allow union inspections of non-union members' employment records'. They do not want any inspections because they love secret agreement making. When you have a look at the provisions under the New South Wales Liberal model, you see why they love secrecy so much. This is an agreement which is absolutely insidious. It is an agreement from a company called Australian Meat Holdings, which have been the subject of a great deal of adverse criticism as to their industrial tactics of late. Under this agreement, workers are effectively denied representation. Mr Anderson interjecting",81
83,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the National Party interjects. He has been in all the media in the last week saying how rotten it is of me to question AMH's approach to industrial relations. You would have all of these workers duffed up without any protection at all. That is what you would do. Under the Guyra Meatworks agreement, not only are workers effectively denied representation but also there is a provision that says that union officials cannot join the works consultative committee. Under the agreement, the company can at any time declare items of discussion confidential, preventing members from getting outside advice. Not only is the union locked out but also under the agreement the workers can be prevented by the bosses from seeking outside advice from their union. Under this agreement, only the consultative committee is allowed to negotiate enterprise agreements, and it must do so minus union representation and with the company retaining the right to veto any outside discussion or any outside assistance. It is true that there is some provision for private mediation, because private mediation of disputes is allowed, but there is a little catch attached to it. The workers are forced to pay half the cost of mediation. So the unions are locked out, the private mediators come in under this agreement, and the workers have got to pay half the cost. Only after that mediation can the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission intervene. The workers have no access to the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission until after they have paid for the mediation. What a wonderful agreement! The Leader of the National Party had the hide to say that this was a federal agreement under this government. Nothing could be more disgraceful than this insidious agreement. Let me say this: AMH has a mighty lot to learn about industrial relations. No Australian worker should be denied the right to representation or denied the right to outside assistance. If I could say a word or two about outside assistance management style, I am advised that AMH has used outside assistance at its Rockhampton plant and it has used it to secure a majority of votes for its disputed EFA. It has used a good deal of outside influence. I can confirm that a Bruce Townsend has been working for AMH at its Rockhampton plant, and I can inform the House that this is the same Bruce Townsend who was last seen working to break the strike at APPM in Burnie just before the last election, three years ago.",81
84,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Big deal!,82
85,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'Big deal,' says the Leader of the Opposition. 'What a coincidence,' you say. That was in Tasmania just before the last election. This is a man with qualifications and a licence for crowd control. Here he is bobbing up on the eve of this election at AMH. On the 7.30 Report last week, Mr Hughes, AMH's personnel manager, admitted that the company was videotaping workers on the picket line. He made that admission on national television. I now understand that the videotaping was far more extensive than just the picket line. I think Mr Townsend's presence at Rockhampton raises a number of questions, not the least of which is: what was he and a number of others doing on the AMH payroll? That is a very fair question. AMH has much to explain about his role, what he has been doing at Rockhampton, when it fronts the commission in its current hearings-the hearings that we have called on and are intervening in. I want to make it absolutely clear in this House today that there is no place in Australian industrial relations for professional strike breakers, for secret surveillance or the videotaping of industrial disputes. Just so you get it straight: there is no place for professional strike breakers, no place for secret surveiIlance and no place for videotaping of picket lines or anything else. The government is committed to enterprise bargaining being pursued in this industry, but we want to see it pursued in an atmosphere free from coercion. The objects of the Industrial Relations Reform Act make that absolutely clear. We want outcomes that benefit both employers and employees. We want to see improved productivity and we want the proceeds to be shared between all the industrial parties. International Affairs: D·Notices",82
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the minister representing the minister who normally represents the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I think that may be the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer the minister to reported discussions between the government and various media outlets over the possible reintroduction of the D-notice system. In the light of these discussions, can the minister confirm that the original intention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to introduce legislation to jail journalists in certain circumstances has now been abandoned for the authoritarian and utterly illiberal proposal it has always been?",82
87,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I must say that in all the deliberations that we had on these matters, we thought we had discussed these things through with your relevant spokesperson and there was a bipartisan approach. There are various things, various attitudes and possibilities, which we would never attempt to secure without a reasonable anticipation on our part that there would be a bipartisan attitude. I do not know what the state of play is currently in discussions between the foreign minister and representatives of the media in this area. I will attempt to discern where they are up to and let you know in due course. Social Security Recipients",82
88,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I address my question to the Minister for Social Security. Can the minister advise the House of the steps his department takes to ensure that social security recipients do in fact receive their entitlements?,82
89,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Department of Social Security has dealings with a very large number of Australian individuals and families. It is obviously a matter of serious concern to ensure that the system operates in such a way that the public can have confidence in its integrity. That means ensuring that people get their correct entitlements. It means ensuring that they are not paid when they are not appropriately entitled to be paid, and it also means ensuring that people who do have an entitlement receive their correct entitlement. In pursuance of that, the department, in 1994-95, conducted 2.2 million reviews, most of which were generated, in the first instance, by data matching activity. The outcome of that was that 8.7 per cent of those reviewed experienced a cancellation or reduction in payment, which saved the taxpayers some $37 million per fortnight. But 29,000 of these reviews, which is 1.3 per cent, actually resulted in an increase in payment. So it is not purely a one-way street here. We are about ensuring that people get their correct amount. There are other measures that the department has pursued in this respect, to ensure that people get what they need and what they are entitled to. We have an access and equity strategy, which was praised recently by a Senate committee which has been looking at this issue. We have a comprehensive appeals system. In the great majority of cases, the departmental decisions are upheld. Nonetheless, 37 per cent of appeals are upheld and that is obviously a very important feature of the system. Positive data matching-which is opposed by the opposition, of course-has been used to find people who do not appear to be receiving their full entitlements. That has to over 12,000 families being contacted. The result of that has been 3,400 people receiving extra amounts of additional family payment. So there are very clear beneficiaries from process. In conclusion, the most recent initiative the department in this regard has been to produce a consolidated publication on family assistance, which honourable members would be familiar with. It is the You and Your Family booklet, which has been mailed to all families receiving family payment. This has been an extraordinarily successful initiative. It represents a consolidation of a number other information products of the department, bringing them together in one easy to read form. It has been highly successful, as indicaton ed by the research conducted after the publication was distributed. But the most tangible evidence of the success of this initiative is that, as a result of it, around 50,000 families are estimated to have applied for and been granted additional payments. This is a measure which the opposition were cynical about and were critical of. They dismissed it as government propaganda. The concrete impact of this measure is that there are about 50,000 families who are now materially better off than they were before. It is very much consistent with the government's philosophy of trying to make sure that people are aware of and understand their entitlements and that they get what they are entitled to. Industrial Relations",82
90,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the minister for Industrial Relations and it refers to his last answer. Given his condemnation of the alleged conduct of certain people in Queensland in the AMH dispute, will the minister equally condemn the practice reported in Workforce on 6 October, wherein Tony Cook, the WA TLC secretary, said that the unions in Western Australia intend to use hidden tape recorders as a means to gamer evidence against employers in that state?",83
91,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, Workforce would be the last publication that one should absolutely rely upon as a source to establish led facts in respect of such matters. I have not heard of the allegation that the honourable member refers to. But let me say that this is the same member who, last week, was saying this that the whole of the dispute in Western Australia resulted from the involvement of this government in Canberra and was all a of plot to score a few points in the run-up to the next federal election, when the honourable member has known full well the whole time that the dispute in Western Australia is a very legitimate one. The second wave-which the Leader of the Opposition went to the Liberal Party conferof ence two months and two days after its release and said was his model, his template-that he discussed with Richard Court the Friday before last, when Richard Court said that the Leader of the Opposition was very happy with the first and the second waveMr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order understanding order 145: this was a very specific question on a matter which the minister has nominated to be of great concern. The question to him concerned whether or not he either acquiesced in or condemned the actions reported in Western Australia. It is as simple as that. He should answer that question and not show his obvious acquiescence in these actions by departing from the question.",83
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Flinders asked the Minister for Industrial Relations a question about the industrial dispute in Western Australia, and he is talking about that issue.",84
93,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The problem I have is that I do not want to add any credence to what has been stated because the last four or five things that have been stated as matters of fact by the member for Flinders have been proven to be demonstrably false. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I have this document, which I will quietly pass across to the minister.",84
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Resume your seat.,84
95,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the member who stated that workers in Queensland were receiving a total of $250; this is the member who, according to a press release he put out yesterday afternoon, was $100 short of the mark in respect of metalworkers-and he wants me to endorse his assertion, reported from Workforce, of some practice. Let me make this clear in conclusion: I believe that the industrial processes should be fair, proper and transparent in every respect, and that is the system that we have designed under the provisions of the Industrial Relations Reform Act. If anyone has any evidence of any illegal activity whatsoever, they have a responsibility to take it forward to the appropriate authorities. Ozone Layer",84
96,Mr CHYNOWETH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. It concerns his department's role in environmental management. What action is being taken by your department to protect Australians from cancer caused by a hole in the ozone layer?,84
97,Mr W ALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. Mr MCGauran-Ferguson' s not happy.,84
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,84
99,Mr W ALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am so glad that the opposition is interested in questions on holes in the ozone layer. My department is doing a great deal. Opposition members-Hal,84
100,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Opposition members may laugh, but the department is doing very well. Mr MCGauran-Ferguson never forgets.",84
101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Gippsland. Enough is enough.,84
102,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Centre for Environmental Management in my department has been recognised this week with a highly prestigious international award for achievements in this very important international area. The National Halon Bank, which is operated by DASCEM, has been honoured by the United States Environmental Protection Agency with this prize, which is awarded to individuals and organisations around the world who break new ground in their efforts to protect the ozone layer. It recognises that Australia is leading the world in this area. The halon bank oversees the collection and safe destruction of halon gases, which are up to 16 times more damaging to the ozone layer than CFCs. It is found in those old yellow fire extinguishers, which have to be handed in by the end of this year when they become illegal. DASCEM established an Australia-wide network to collect the gas. It is associated with the development of technology to do two things with the gas: firstly, to extract the gas from those containers without spilling any; and, secondly, to use a plasma system of destruction of the gas. Both those systems are unique in the world and lead the world in this technology. They have been very successful. The bank has collected 840 tonnes of halon gas from individuals, businesses and corporations. That will be converted into an environmentally safe by-product very soon. As I said, by the end of the year this gas will be illegal. It helps to raise it in the parliament today to point out to people with yellow fire extinguishers around Australia that they must hand them into fire stations by the end of this year. At the moment, the halon bank has turned from halon gas to CFCs. They are used extensively in the air conditioning and refrigeration industry. The bank has now signed a contract with the industry's ozone depleting substances reclaim fund to store and dispose of CFCs which cannot be recycled or reused. I congratulate the team from DASCEM for their effort and success in winning this prestigious international award, in which all Australians should have some pride. European Fruit Fly",84
103,Mr KA TTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Is he aware that the AQIS inspection regime on exports, paid for by the farmers themselves, is vastly more stringent-a total inspection cost of $80 an hour plus travel and accommodation-than the simple, random spot checks on imports which has allowed the European fruit outbreak to occur, jeopardising the $300 million horticulture industry of North Queensinclude land? Does the minister accept that AQIS protection mechanisms have not only failed miserably in allowing the papaya fly into Australia but also that its sentinel posting failed, only discovering the presence of papaya fly after it had infested over 200 kilometres of coastline? In light of the petence of this federal government instruinspect mentality, can the minister give assurances that adequate compensation will be provided to farmers, who are faced with ploughing or having to destroy their entire annual income? Further, will the government provide immediate financial assistance for treatment tives. of fruit in the southern capital city markets? Finally, could the minister assure the industry, in light of successful programs such as sterilised male release, that it will provide funds for the launch of an immediate program for the eradication of the papaya fly? Mr Truss-This is an important question.",85
104,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a very important question. It is obviously quite appropriate the honourable member to raise these issues. Even if I do not necessarily agree with some of the more tendentious elements of his aircraft, remarks, nevertheless he is raising an importTorres Strait. ant issue for his constituents. In relation to the concerns of the honourin able member, I will deal first with the issues of competence. I am advised that in 1993 the fly was detected on five islands in the Torres Strait. It was eradicated on two in 1994 but not on three northern islands where eradication is impracticable because of their close proximity to infestation in Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea. QDPI carried out suppression activities on these three islands. AQIS and QDPI did cooperate in the eradication program. Earlier this year, the fruit fly was detected again on the same two islands from which it was previously eradicated and on two others. A major eradication attempt is already under way up there, and AQIS is contributing half of the total cost. Over the last few years, I am advised that quite substantial efforts have been made by AQIS in the Torres Strait Islands area and in fly North Queensland to come to grips with potential quarantine threats. Those measures the introduction of survey and monitoring programs in the region, and the Topwatch program, which has raised community awareness of quarantine issues, includhas ing the fruit fly, to very high levels in the the Torres Strait and northern peninsula communities. AQIS assisted inspectors on the larger incomislands and at Bamaga on Cape York to for movements of fruit fly host product. AQIS has established an FM radio network across Cape York which broadcasts in quarantine awareness messages as well as a weekly radio broadcast in the Torres Strait and a range of other public awareness initiaThe principal regional airlines servicing the region, Sunstate and Flight West, issue ticket wallets with quarantine information printed on all pages. There are 12 AQIS staff located in the Torres Strait and at Bamaga and a further five in Cairns who have responsibility under the northern Australia quarantine strategy for quarantine issues in Far North Queensland for and the Torres Strait. AQIS has recently installed a detector dog team at Cairns airport to further improve quarantine surveillance of including those that originate in the So a very substantial effort is being made the quarantine area, and rightly so, to deal with a variety of quarantine problems. Many of those that I have just read out are obviously of direct relevance to the issue of the spread of fruit fly. So I would not automatically accept the view implied in the question that, in some form, incompetence was a factor in the situation that is now confronted by farmers in the region. You asked a series of further questions on financial assistance for treatment of fruit in the southern capital city markets and also on compensation to farmers who have to plough in their crop, and you made one or two suggestions about how all that might be done. I will refer those questions to the relevant minister and get him to give you an answer. But, as I am sure you would be aware, there is a very heightened level of concern in regard to all this in Queensland. There is strong cooperation between the Commonwealth service and its Queensland counterpart, and a very considerable effort is being put into deal with it. Missing Persons  directed to the Minister for Social Security. relates to missing persons. Opposition members-Where's the Prime Minister? Mr Bevis-Where's Wilson Tuckey?  able for the member for Tangney. Is the minister aware of the agonies endured by relatives of missing persons? Is he aware of the inordinate difficulties they often have in securing information about missing loved ones, even when such information is held by Commonwealth government departments? I ask the minister: what action is the Department of Social Security taking to assist people in this situation? Is he able to say what action other federal departments can take to help relatives ascertain whether missing loved ones are dead or alive?",85
105,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know the honourable member for Shortland has a real concern about this matter, and I am very happy to provide some information in regard to it. I fully understand the anguish experienced by people who have a missing relative and the comfort that would be derived from at least knowing that the person concerned is alive and safe. I am pleased to advise the honourable member that the Department of Social Security can assist in this regard in some circumstances. Where a person in this situation contacts the department and it turns out that the missing person is in fact known to the department, the department will provide the supposedly missing person with contact numbers or addresses. This allows the person being sought to choose whether or not to contact the relative or friend. In addition, the department provides a post office type facility which allows relatives and friends to write to missing persons and the department will pass on that information. Again, the decision on whether the customer wants to receive a letter from the sender is left in the hands of the individual concerned. Where people are reported missing to the police and the police seek the department's assistance, we ask the customer concerned to contact the appropriate police missing persons agency. Moreover, the department is authorised to inform the police agency as to whether It the person is known to the department. The police agency can then inform the concerned relative that the individual is alive without identifying their social security status. For missing young people under 18 years of age, as a result of initiatives announced last year we can go further and advise parents directly that a young person is alive and well. That is a consequence of the tabling of a new privacy instrument under the Social Security Act that took place in December last year. In conclusion, there is obviously an important balance to be struck here between the privacy of individuals and the genuine concerns of loved ones to be assured of their safety. I think we have found that correct balance. I am very pleased to say in response to the honourable member's question that we can be helpful in a number of these circumstances. I probably should not comment too much on what the position is in regard to other government departments you.",86
106,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Not on this particular occasion. I suggest that might best be directed to the relevant minister.,86
107,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Photographs in Chamber",87
108,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My question concerns the last division, which took place on the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill. As a result of that division, I found myself on this side of the chamber surrounded by tories. Mr Speaker, I am sure that you and others would appreciate the enormous personal distress and anguish that that caused me, although I know it was members of the coalition who crossed the floor and not us. I also know the record of that division will permanently appear in Hansard, and I would not seek to do anything about that. What I am concerned about, and this is the reason I am directing this question to you, is that it is very likely that cameras were used at that time and photographs were taken which, in the absence of any action on our part, may cause a continuing visual record to be kept, which would cause continuing personal embarrassment to me. Mr Speaker, is there anything at all we can do to request, prevail upon or require the photographers to destroy any photographs that may have been taken?",87
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Putting to one side the way in which the honourable member for Charlton raised the issue, it is appropriate the photographers to take photographs in here only during question time. That is the arrangement which applies. At other times, special permission must be sought with the Speaker. That was not done on this occasion and I would take a dim view of photographs appearing that were not of question time. NA",87

118,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,87
119,Dr KEMP,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), in his answer to a dorothy dixer today, misrepresented my comments and my position on the special intervention program in several respects. In the first place he said that, in a letter to him on behalf of a constituent in which I drew attention to the constituent's wish for a broadening of the special intervention program guidelines, I was contradicting public comments I had made. This is not the case. I have consistently argued that excessive rigidity in program guidelines has been a problem of Working Nation and that a greater focus on outcomes combined with proper acfor countability was needed.",87
120,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The honourable member is now debating the issue. Just say where you have been misrepresented.,87
121,Dr KEMP,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The letter was fully consistent with that position. The second misrepresentation is that the minister clearly implied that I had opposed the English as a second language and the literacy elements of the special intervention program which, as he said, comprised some 90 per cent of the expenditure. This again is not the case. When asked specifically about this component of the program, my response was not reported in the press, in the report the minister referred to. My only comments about the need for such training were positive. Thirdly, the minister is therefore wrong in his claim that the coalition is opposed to the purpose of the special intervention program. The press report he read out is misleading in this respect. Mr Crean-You said it.",87
122,Dr KEMP,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have just told you that this report is misleading in this respect. I have, however, consistently expressed concern over the lack of employment outcomes of these programs and the special intervention program",88

I would suggest that if any photographs are taken I would be quite happy for you to send them to me. Beyond that, I would like to know on what grounds you would object to photographs being taken during the division. Would you have objected to a photograph being taken had the photographers asked you whether a photograph could have been taken? That really gets to the nub of the matter. If it is such that you would object to a photograph being taken, one could argue that that is interfering with the democratic process.",88
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I think I have got a pretty reasonable record in trying to open up this parliament to reasonable scrutiny. I think the Leader of the Opposition knows I am all right on that. Mr Howard interjecting,88
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Damned with faint praise. I say to the member for Wills, however, that, in respect of the still photography, I would have no objection if on occasions, as in the past it has actually occurred, when the press gallery asks for permission to do so they be granted that. It is just that, as the guidelines are now, it is only during question time that those photographs can in fact be taken.",88
133,Mr CLEARY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Can I suggest that that be revisited? It really obscures the democratic processes because the only time divisions occur is outside question time, so the public is not in a position to see.",88

But I will look at the issue. NA  Speaker, I seek your indulgence to extend to the member for Tangney a humble apology. It was a grievous error on my part. My intention was to refer to the member for O'Connor. NA Photographs in Chamber",88
137,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I think the member for Wills raises a very important issue of democracy. I ask you in the context of that preamble whether your permission was sought during the Tasmanian privacy legislation when many photographs were taken as it was considered an historic turning point in Australia. Some of us were embarrassed at that time, but we did not have the luxury of being able to have photographs destroyed just for a political purpose.",89

142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The sudden and belated discovery by the Prime Minister of the need to eliminate nuclear weapons. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",92
143,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mayo) (4.18 p.m.)Yesterday afternoon during question time, we had a bizarre announcement by the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that somehow Australia had decided it would oppose the existence of nuclear weapons. This was presented by the Australian Prime Minister as though it were some sort of grand initiative. It was part of the Keating vision. The government suddenly had a new strategy on the issue of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The fact is that this particular proposition, put forward by the Prime Minister, is a proposition that was put forward as long ago as 1970 by John Gorton when he was Prime Minister. Even Sir Robert Menzies had argued that in an ideal world we would be able to eliminate nuclear weapons. The Australian government since 1970, whatever its party political complexion, has always argued for the elimination of nuclear weapons. Every government has always argued that-the Gorton government, the MCMahon government, the Whitlam government, the Fraser government and the Hawke government. But we can assume, I suppose, on the basis of the Prime Minister's statement yesterday, that the Keating government did not support the elimination of nuclear weapons until the Prime Minister made the statement he made yesterday. In other words, I am really saying that the Prime Minister's statement yesterday was nothing short of a cheap political stunt designed to try to woo the youth vote and win back a few Green preferences which have been burnt off by the government's abominable handling of the forest industry policy. This is just another example of what we have seen from the Prime Minister ever since he assumed that office-the strategy of rewriting, distorting and ignoring history in order to try to prop up his own position. There is an old saying coined by Henry Ford, which is often quoted-history is bunk. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister agrees that history is generally bunk. He believes that historical facts are bunk. What he thinks is useful is to write his own history, ignore all the achievements of the past in this country and try to create the impression he is doing something new and something creative. We had the Prime Minister saying that the constitution of Australia was written in the British Foreign Office. Nothing could be further from the truth. Every member of this parliament knows the history of our constitution and that that is untrue. We had the Prime Minister the other day saying that Australians during the First World War were not fighting for Australia; that it was not until the Second World War that Australians started fighting for Australia. What about the Emden-the first military naval engagement by an Australian ship? That was not on behalf of Australia? What about the mining of the Pacific by the Germans during the First World War? What about the whole historic context of the First World War and the power balance that existed in the world at that time-all completely eliminated by a Prime Minister who wants to try to rewrite history. We had the Prime Minister saying that the British apparently chickened out in the Malayan Peninsula during the Second World War. The latest creation before this nuclear speech was the idea that somehow the Keating government came along and was the first government in Australian history to show any interest in engagement with Asia. This really has to be one of the more absurd propositions that this country has had to listen to from a Prime Minister. In 1934, Sir John Latham, who was the leader of what is now the Liberal Party, a late Chief Justice of the High Court, argued that it was inevitable that the relations between Australia and the Near East would become closer and more intimate as the years passed. In 1939, Menzies was saying that the focus of Australian foreign policy had to be the Pacific. Your predecessors were all calling him 'Pig-iron Bob' because he was selling pig-iron to Asia and you were objecting to it. The simple point is that the Prime Minister continually rewrites history under a pretence that so much of what he does is a new initiative, is part of a creative government. It is nonsense. This speech yesterday was just the latest in a long line of similar sorts of nonsensical statements made by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. It is part of what is a sinister approach to politics, a kind of Orwellian approach to politics, where the party writes the history in order to promote the interests of the party. It is only the party leader's version of history which is right, which is comprehensible and which is permissible. Let us have a look at the embarrassment I believe the Prime Minister has caused himself. Senator Gareth Evans, when he did an interview this morning on the AM program, was clearly taken by surprise by the Prime Minister's statement yesterday. Mr Gibson-Rubbish!",92
144,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Senator Evans had thought all along that Australian government policy had been for decades to support the elimination of nuclear weapons. The member opposite says, 'Rubbish!' It does not matter who Senator Evans talks to because he never stops talking. He talks to everyone all the time no matter what. Let us have a look at what he got the department to write in the book he produced under his own name called Australia's Foreign Relations, for which he is winning a prize. I would have thought that prize should be shared with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.",93
145,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Steve Waugh shares his prizes.,93
146,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Steve Waugh does. I was not aware that Steve shared his prizes. I would have thought Gareth Evans at least should acknowledge the role of the department in producing this book. Page 86 of the Gareth Evans book Australia's Foreign Relations says: The ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament is one to which Australia and nearly all members of the international community have long subscribed. The Prime Minister announced yesterday that Australia was going to support the elimination of nuclear weapons. The revised version of this book was published earlier this year, with the original one being published two or three years ago. When Senator Evans was asked about this issue by Ellen Fanning on the AM program this morning he responded, needless to say, in the prolix way Senator Evans always does, with a lot of talk about how he had been thinking of writing articles about this-which is his code for getting the department or Andrew Mack to write an article and then publish it in his name. And excuse me if I am being a bit harsh, but the truth sometimes has a place in public debate. In relation to the elimination of nuclear weapons, Senator Evans said, 'It's something that I have been believing has been on the agenda, sensibly, for some time.' In other words, it is not a new idea. It has always been around and it has been around, as Senator Evans and all of us know, for decades. The Prime Minister is trying to kid voters, as an election approaches, into believing the issue is something new. I mentioned earlier the work of the Gorton government. The Gorton government negotiated the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for Australia. The negotiations began in 1968, and Australia signed the treaty in 1970. Members on the other side of the House believe that treaties are sacrosanct-and, quite rightly, if you sign a treaty, you should mean what you say. Australia signed that treaty. Amongst otper things, it is worth remembering that the treaty speaks of: Desiring to further the easing of international tension and the strengthening of trust between States in order to facilitate the cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons . . . The treaty goes on: . . . the liquidation of all their existing stockpiles, and the elimination from national arsenals of nuclear weapons and the means of their deliveryThat is what the nuclear non-proliferation treaty says. In other words, we signed that in 1970. Not every country in the world, unfortunately, has signed it but most have. So most countries in the world agree that the elimination of nuclear weapons is something that the world should set as an objective. Members opposite may recall that, at the Reykjavik summit between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1986, Ronald Reagan announced to Mikhail Gorbachev, 'What we have to achieve is the elimination of all nuclear weapons as quickly as possible.' Gorbachev agreed and that was the beginning of what was known as the START negotiations. The START negotiations aimed to reduce nuclear stockpiles in Russia and the United States from 50,000 weapons to 7,500 by the year 2002. This has all been going on, but what has the current Prime Minister been doing during this time? We know what he has been doing. He has been flying over Asia on his way to the clock shops of France. He was not too concerned in those days about Asia. He was not concerned about nuclear non-proliferation or the elimination of nuclear weapons. There is a test which can be used to determine concern, and all members should remember this. As your political careers wear on, people will look your name up using the computer search in their offices and find out what you mentioned on certain issues in years gone by-in other words, how much did you care about these issues? So you look up 'Keating, P.J - member for Blaxland' and get the computer to go back as far as it can to see how concerned he was about the elimination of nuclear weapons. And what do you find? Nothing. There was not one reference to the elimination of nuclear weapons yet, through all the years he has been in parliament, it has been Australian government policy to campaign for the elimination of nuclear weapons. Through all of his time in parliament, Keating 'has not cared to concern himself with the disarmament issue and the non-proliferation issue . When the Fraser government was negotiating the comprehensive test ban treaty back in the late 1970s and came within an ace of achieving a comprehensive test ban treaty, where was P.J. Keating? What was he doing during that period? He certainly was not reading the newspapers. He certainly was not trying to find out what the major international issues of the day were. When Australia won its position proudly on the United Nations Committee on Disarmament in 1978-79 the Labor Party was completely silent on the matter. When the Fraser government got us on to the committee on disarmament there was just a resounding silence from the Labor Party. Now Labor boasts about the work of the Committee on Disarmament and how well the government is doing on that committee. But it was us who got Australia on to the Committee on Disarmament, it was us who signed the non-proliferation treaty and it was us who put this whole issue on the agenda originally. We are not having that agenda hijacked by a parvenu like Keating who just strides in and announces that this is the government's policy when it has been Australian policy for so many years. Finally, we have the issue of the current case before the International Court of Justice. This is a complex case and an attempt to try to establish in international law that nuclear weapons are illegal. The Prime Minister suddenly decided that he favours-he has woken up and decided this-the elimination of nuclear weapons. We assume that before yesterday he did not favour that; otherwise he would not have said he did. So along he comes and he says that he favours that. Then there is a case in the International Court of Justice and he says that Senator Evans will intervene in this case. I can tell from Senator Evans's reaction that it came as a surprise to him; he was not aware that this announcement was coming. I suppose he has not seen the latest opinion polls, so he is not quite sure of the Prime Minister's thinking on a lot of these things. What is the government's position in the International Court of Justice? The government's position is to say, 'Well, we don't want the court to rule that nuclear weapons are illegal. So the Solicitor-General is in the court arguing on behalf of the Australian government that the court must not rule that nuclear weapons be made illegal. You mustn't eliminate nuclear weapons, not in the International Court of Justice.' How insincere can you get? You do not want the elimination of nuclear weapons in one forum, but you announce in a speech yesterday-in the Great Hall or wherever it was-that you do want the elimination of nuclear weapons. The fact is that this whole exercise is a cheap political stunt. This is a political stunt from the Prime Minister, designed to win Green preferences and prop up the Labor Party's flagging vote amongst young people. Australians have had enough of stunts. We have had enough of these cheap stunts from the Prime Minister. They will not fall for this stunt this time. They will not fall for any more between now and polling day. (Time expired)  been an extraordinary performance, even for the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). We did not hear one word from him saying that the opposition supports this initiative, that it is a worthwhile objective that in the sweep of world events one thing they can take for granted is that they will work with the government to actually achieve a non-nuclear world-a world free of the threat of nuclear war and nuclear weapons. We heard not one comment in 15 minutes stating that. All it was about was historywhat Menzies said but did not do and what Gorton said but did not do. What have the Liberals ever done about disarmament? If this is so important to the honourable member for Mayo-he has told the House, not in this speech, that he is an expert in disarmament and he worked in Foreign Affairs for eight years beavering away on disarmament-wouldn'the direct the House to a serious speech on the Hansard record advocating the virtues of disarmament? There is no such speech. When he was Leader of the Opposition he produced The Things That Matter. I ask opposition members who respond to please point to where there is a reference to disarmament and nuclear disarmament. It is not there. It is just like Future Directions. We can pour through this document or something four inches thick. Given his glorious past in the Liberal Party, allegedly outlined by the honourable member for Mayo, there is not one reference to disarmament or a nuclear weapons free world. Here is the honourable member for Mayo saying, 'But it was past Liberal Party philosophers and prime ministers who really said these things. They liked the idea.' It is not good enough to put it in policy documents such as Future Directions and The Things That Matter. He is not good enough to come into this House as an expert, as he claims, from Foreign Affairs and deliver a serious speech on foreign affairs. It is not there. There is plenty on the Hansard record. If the honourable member for Mayo wants to make some cheap points, let me make this one. He was the dream leader of the dream team. In the deserts of Australia, like a boxer, he stepped into the ring-there was no opponent-and delivered on himself a knock-out punch. He was politically dead. He occupies this position not by reason of merit or virtue in foreign affairs but because of a deal that and there would be no bloodshed in the coalition party room. If I were the honourable member for Mayo, I would be concerned, given the hypothetical nature of a coalition victory, were I to continue on to be a coalition federal minister. I invite the House to look at the Hansard record about what the honourable member for Mayo has actually said about disarmament. In his speech on 28 February 1985 he railed against nuclear disarmament. He said that the Western alliance is not doing enough against the growing concern by young people about nuclear weapons and the establishment of a nuclear disarmament party. He said that it is a political vacuum. He is not an advocate for disarmament"" worried about ordinary people becoming increasingly concerned about the issues of disannament. On 20 August 1986 what did he say about the treaty that France had recently announced that it will sign? Mr Free-Rarotonga.  What did he say about himself? Let me quote the honourable member: ... the raison d'etre of the Treaty-this needs to be understood-is to attack the FrenchHe said that he did not want to be seen attacking the French or embarrassing the French. This is the honourable member for Mayo, who climbs on board the bipartisan group that went to Europe. He was saying in 1986 that he did not want to be seen as antiFrench or attacking the French because of their nuclear testing. There are some other quotes that I would like to read from the honourable member for Mayo-this champion of disannament. In talking about the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty Bill 1986 he said: In this case the Australian Government and some other governments which have been forced against their wishes to sign this Treaty or will be forced to sign the protocols are making the wrong judgment. He said in 1986 that they should never have signed the treaty or the protocols. Yet he is criticising this Prime Minister on the world stage in practical tenns for wanting to see the elimination of nuclear weapons. I think you will find he said some other things. He said: As I have explained. the Government has done more than just introduce the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), on behalf of the Government, has called for the constructive involvement of the Soviet Union in our region. This is the person predicting what will happen. Of course, it did not happen. But it is the old Liberal tune of commies under the bed or getting into bed with the commies. I am not quite sure exactly which one it is. This is the honourable member for Mayo speaking in 1988 about relations with the South Pacific nations. I find it amazing that the honourable member for Mayo can get up and lecture this government about nuclear disannament. He is an absolute hypocrite. I wish I could report that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was better. As I have said, he is such a champion at nuclear disannament. This document which he released contains absolutely nothing about disannament. Perhaps one of the opposition members will find a reference to it or will give me a page number. I would be happy to look at it. I took a microscope to it, but I still could not find anything. What did the honourable member for Bennelong, the alternative Prime Minister, say about the South Pacific Forum? He said that it would derogate from our sovereignty and that Australia must not be seen as being too assertive on this issue of a nuclear free zone. He said that the government is overly optimistic, even though France and every country involved in the South Pacific are now agreeing to sign the protocols. He also believes that we have got benign, naive faith. We have got benign faith that we can actually start a process and finish it. We are seeing the finish of it now. Yesterday, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) started a most important campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons, which is something everyone on this side of the House fully supports. If any honourable member on this side of the House goes back and talks to ordinary Australians, they will say, 'Yes, of course we support it. Yes, we do want the government to take a lead in it. We don't want it to be seen as something that is desirable and ultimately attainable. We would like to see the action commence now. If we can see it in our lifetime, it will be great for us; it will be better for our kids; and it will be terrific for our grandchildren.' The honourable member for Bennelong, the alternative Prime Minister, the man who has the honourable member for Mayo as his spokesman on foreign affairs, said: But we have well founded objections to the nuclear free zone treaty . . . They do not have bipartisan support; they have got well-founded objections for reasons that are well set out. He continued: We will maintain that objection because we believe that the terms of that treaty potentially derogate from the sovereignty which is involved in agreements such as the ANZUS pact. Has that prediction come true? Of course it has not. He said: But, in general terms, Australia should play a constructive, not overly assertive, but helpful role in this part of the world. Fancy a Prime Minister of Australia wanting to write to like-minded countries and get a world decision on this important issue! That is what the member for Bennelong was saying in 1988. He also said: We do not believe that that arrangement has made that part of the world a more peaceful or a more secure one. We believe the Government has an overoptimistic view of the benefits of the South Pacific nuclear free zone. Look at how many other groups of countries are trying to emulate that initiative-all because we are overoptimistic. Finally, he said: We do not place benign, naive faith in nuclear free zones. No wonder the shadow spokesman could not in conscience join with the government and say in a bipartisan way, 'We've put the past behind us; we've put behind us our past opposition to every initiative a Labor government has taken on disarmament-whether it has been appointing a disarmament ambassador as soon as it was elected to office in 1983 or being effective in all those treaties under a Labor government.' No wonder they could not do that, given their lousy past record. I apologise for reading so many quotes, but I could not believe the boldness of the honourable member for Mayo in getting up and wanting to attack what I think will be welcomed by ordinary citizens-that is, the Prime Minister's announcement that the government is going to make a special effort with likeminded friends to achieve a nuclear free world. I was pleased to attend a delegation, which was an initiative of the Prime Minister, and talk to European countries--certainly not France and certainly not some of the other countries. There is a real desire amongst the governments in Europe to see the elimination of nuclear weapons. If the French testing has done anything, it has focused the minds not only of ordinary people about the sort of world in which they want to live in the future but also bureaucrats and governments as to whether it is possible to achieve a nuclear free world. Everyone should be pleased at the prospect of the signing of the comprehensive test ban treaty, but whenever you discuss thisnotwithstanding the fact that countries have said that they will sign it-you have the problem of the threshold states. In fact, this is what I think is so offensive about a liberal democracy like France recommencing nuclear testing. It has given encouragement to a number of states on the threshold of developing nuclear weapons. This must be avoided at all costs. The problem is not going to go away in 1996. It is important progress; it is a monumental step. But all of us-Australia and every other country-need to work together. I implore opposition members to put aside the comments of the shadow spokesman and join with the government unreservedly. We can work together on this issue in a bipartisan way, as we have on many issues. If the honourable member for Mayo had to make a choice between advancing the interests of Australia or scoring some cheap political points in foreign affairs, you know what choice he would make. He ought to talk to some of his colleagues because it is disturbing them. As I said, in the instance of a coalition victory, I would be concerned if I were the honourable member for Mayo. I think it is very unlikely that he will ever be a minister for foreign affairs-something his performance proves that he is unfit for. (Time expired)",93
147,Mr TAYLOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Groom) (4.48 p.m.)Unlike the honourable member for Chifley  lenge and address the issues-I am not going to play the man, as he did right throughout his contribution to this debate. I am going to address the matter of public importance, which the honourable member for Chifley did not do. I refer to the 1995 nuclear non-proliferation treaty conference in New York last May, which was undoubtedly one of the most important multilateral arms control negotiations in history. Its task was to make the world-s most important and widely adhered to arms limitation agreement of permanent duration. Unlike previous NPT conferences, the historic 1995 conference was charged with two simultaneous tasks: review and extension. On 13 May, when Ambassador Dhanapala, the president, brought down the curtain at the 1995 NPT conference, in noting the historical significance of the three decisions that had been taken, he cautioned that there were no losers or victors but that the conference's collective achievement was to permanently enshrine the global non-proliferation norm as well as to lay down new principles on non-proliferation and disarmament and on strengthened reviews. In so doing, the conference had heralded a new era of thinking about nuclear weapons and global security. It also marked another watershed in international politics when interests prevailed over ideology. A major achievement was to agree on common language on a statement of principles and objectives. These principles and objectives deal with a program of action regarding the full realisation and effective implementation of article 4, including: firstly, the completion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty no later than 1996; secondly, the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a convention banning production of fissile material for nuclear weapons; and, thirdly, the determined pursuit by the weapon states of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons. The statement also deals with security assurances, nuclear weapon free zones, safeguards and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The opposition did join, in general terms, with what Senator Evans had to say at the outcome of that conference when he said, in part: The decision reinforces the commitment of the international community to a world free of nuclear weapons, and represents the achievement of a major security and foreign policy objective for Australia. He went on: Indefinite extension of the NPT, for which is had worked long and hardI point out to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) that people on both sides of this House over a long period have done just thatoffers by far the best encouragement for the nuclear weapon states to continue the historic process of nuclear arms reductions which had finally begun; will make it more likely that the threshold or 'twilight zone' states remaining outside the Treaty will eventually decide to look for their security in the renunciation of nuclear weapons; and is vital for implementation of the provisions of the Treaty on peaceful nuclear cooperation since they depend heavily on the existence of a climate of certainty about the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The extension decision is legally binding, while the decisions on principles and strengthened reviews are politically binding. The latter two decisions will help establish new parameters of discourse on non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament issues beginning in 1997. While these are important gains, nonetheless they represent minimal rather than maximal or even optimal progress in terms of achieving a world free of nuclear weapons and of enhanced accountability by the weapon states. On the other hand, though the extension decision per se does not include any riders or conditions, in both practical and political terms it is intimately and inextricably related to the politically binding decisions on principles and strengthened reviews. How faithfully states' parties, in particular the weapon states, live up to these decisions will essentially determine the future viability of both the treaty and the nuclear arms control and disarmament process. China's nuclear test on 15 May, two days after the conclusion of the 1995 conference, and the two French Mururoa tests since 6 September are not only demonstrative of Beijing's and Paris's insensitivity and hypocrisy on crucial global issues but also serve as a crude reminder that the weapon states' implementation of article 6 commitments Australrequires close watch by the international community. Both sides of the political fence here in Australia share the disappointment of many states that more progress towards nuclear disarmament was not possible during the long years of the Cold War, particularly during the first 25 years of this treaty's life. While this trend has been reversed in recent years, it needs to be promoted. We share that goal on this side of the House. The decisions taken in New York in May are welcomed. It is of the greatest importance that all parties to the NPT reaffirm their commitment, for all time, to prevent nuclear proliferation. We have never accepted that an indefinitely extended NPT would in some way legitimise the status of the nuclear weapon states forever. That would not only be unacceptable; it would be simply wrong. It does not reflect what article 6 of the treaty states. With the treaty extended indefinitely, the obligation on all states, but particularly the nuclear weapon states, to pursue nuclear disarmament has now become one from which there is no escape. Thus it is not only our hope but also our expectation that the principles and objectives adopted by the New York conference will consolidate progress to date, will promote accelerated progress in disarmament negotiations currently under way, and will result in additional early steps, in particufor lar a permanent end to nuclear testing by 1996. Despite all this, as a culmination over 25 years since the NPT came into force in March 1970, yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) set out in the very public atmosphere of the UN's 50th anniversary day to take all the credit for what has been achieved. In his usual way, he attempted to inject his bias and his historical reconstruction as the saviour of the world. As the Australian says, he set out to 'free the world of nuclear weapons'. Why won't the Prime Minister tell the story as it really is? Why won'the acknowledge that he and both of his foreign ministers have been playing follow the leader to the coalition on Mururoa and other issues for the last four or five months? Why won'the acknowledge that it was Senator Evans's initial wimpish reaction to President Chirac' s nuclear testing decision that has undermined Australia's national standing? Why won'the acknowledge that he has been playing catch-up politics with New Zealand Prime Minister Bolger on the issue? Why did he and his foreign minister take so long to read the mood of the Australian people on the issue? Why is he now setting out very publicly in the leadup to a general election to reaffirm his credentials domestically on the Mururoa issue and on the broader issue of nuclear disarmament? In asserting yesterday that the world has a chance to find its way out of the chaos, a chance which he said will not last long, how can he put his hand on his heart that 'we can help the world to grasp it, even show the way'? Why won'the accept and acknowledge that it was this side of the House that took the original NPT initiative. Clearly, the Prime Minister is again stretching the truth and clutching at straws as he attempts to porkbarrel his way back into the Lodge. Try as he might on this and other portfolio areas, whenever he calls the poll he will be caught out by the people who count and who will reject everything that he stands for at the ballot box.",97
148,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a great disappointment to me that the member Groom (Mr Taylor) has been prepared to be the second speaker for the coalition in this discussion of a matter of public importance because I have some regard for the member for Groom. I find him to be a man of substance and integrity. It is a pity that he has soiled his reputation by associating himself with the ludicrous remarks and the topic that the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has brought forward today. It is clear that there is a real desperation by the coalition in this matter. They are really trying to totally distort what is a reasonable and honourable objective that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) outlined yesterday. The member for Groom is a man who has some commitment to disarmament, has spoken on these matters and has done good work. I am disappointed that he has been prepared to side with that shallow opportunist, the member for Mayo, in this disgraceful topic that he has brought forward to the House today. My colleague the member for Chifley (Mr Price) made one of the most telling points in the last few moments of his contribution. The fact is that the member for Mayo has absolutely no chance of being the Minister for Foreign Affairs, because should the everincreasingly unlikely result of the coalition winning the election come to pass-which it won't-I can bet London to a brick that the member for Mayo will not be the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The member for Groom might be the Minister for Foreign Affairsand he would not make a bad fist of it-but I know that the member for Mayo will not be the next Minister for Foreign Affairs. Let's come back to the purpose of this debate-the Prime Minister's announcement yesterday in his speech celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. The contribution of the member for Mayo reminded me of the situation in my home when my two primary school aged children fight over who thought of an idea first. They tug at each other saying, 'It was my idea, it was my idea.' We had the coalition claiming, 'We thought of the idea first. How dare the Prime Minister steal our idea.' What a load of bunkum! Sure, coalition governments have said over the last 40 or 50 years, 'Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had a world without nuclear weapons.' But did they do anything about it? Did they put in place any comprehensive plan of action? No. Occasionally, they engaged in a couple of steps in the United Nations but they took no comprehensive action to implement some form of strategic process to achieve a nuclear weapons free world. But still they feel that the idea was theirs because Bob Menzies, back in the 1940s, said something like, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have nuclear weapons.' But they did not actually do anything. Bob Menzies allowed the British to test their nuclear weapons on Australian soil. That is how committed he was to nuclear disarmament. We are still suffering the consequences of that foolish decision by your great hero, Bob Menzies. I was rocked when I heard Alexander Downer's contribution. He is so desperate to restore the reputation of the Rt Hon. Sir Robert Menzies that he even tried to defend the 'Pig-Iron Bob' tag. He tried to defend the fact that Bob Menzies sold pig-iron to the Japanese in 1938, knowing that the pig-iron would be used to drop bombs on the Chinese. That is a defensible position, as far as Alexander Downer is concerned. I was shocked that he would have the hide to even bring that up. Let's get back to the reality. The Prime Minister, in his speech yesterday-it is obvious that no-one in the coalition has read itdid not claim that this was some brand new idea, that this brilliant light shone in the night and he suddenly thought, 'Let's have a nuclear weapons free world.' He did not claim that at all. It is about time we started to bring the debate back to the reality. The Prime Minister said that, with the end of the Cold War, we have a unique opportunity that we must grasp to take some strategic actions to capitalise on that situation. He was saying, 'Let's try to force the pace of getting our world free of nuclear weapons.' He did not claim that it was a new idea. He did not claim that it was something original. All he said was that he was committing our government to a series of actions to try to accelerate that process through the United Nations and other international forums. He was saying, 'Let's put some pressure on and see if we can achieve it.' I will read some of what he said: Unless we take action now, the nuclear competition that characterised most of the second half of this century will very likely return-and probably in a much more unstable and multipolar form. The world must extricate itself from the circular argument that we need nuclear weapons because we have nuclear weapons. He further said: I believe that a world free of nuclear weapons is now attainable. He did not say that he had just thought up this idea. He said, 'I believe it is now attainable.' He went on: It can be done and it will be in the best security interests of Australia and our allies and friends if we do it. Further on, he said: The Government believes the time has come for more determined movement towards the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. That is what he said. He continued: There is no magic wand we can wave to make this happen. As with the long negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament to get rid of chemical weapons, ultimate success may be decades away. And getting there involves security issues of the greatest complexity and profundity. WE do not minimise the difficulties or the dangers. What we need now is action to achieve the abolition of all nuclear weapons. That is the great contrast between the bleatings of the coalition and the performance of this government on this issue. Only Labor governments have put in place solid, concrete action to achieve a nuclear weapons free world and a world free of weapons of mass destruction. This government and previous Labor governments have put in place the building blocks that may allow us to achieve it. The Prime Minister outlined in his speech a series of 11 steps that the government is committed to for the achievement of a nuclear weapons free world. We had the ultimate distortion by the member for Mayo in his claiming that we were being hypocritical in our case before the International Court of Justice. I quote directly from the Prime Minister's speech again: The Government has now decided, however, that Australia will also argue to the court that if court is minded to make a decision in the casethat is, the case before the International Court of Justice seeking to declare nuclear weapons illegalit should decide in favour of the illegality of those weapons. That is a clear statement of the government's intention. Yet the member for Mayo totally distorted the government's position in claiming that we were arguing for the court not to make such a ruling. That is not the case at all. We are saying that there could be danger in the court considering the matter at all because, should the court decide that nuclear weapons were legal, that would set back the nuclear non-proliferation regime considerably. But were the court to decide that it does want to make a decision on this matter, that it believes it has jurisdiction, the Australian government would say, 'Declare them illegal.' That is the correct position and that is the clear statement of the government on this matter. I commend the Prime Minister for his determination in trying to achieve that. We then had the ridiculous situation of the member for Mayo making out that just because he has suffered the experience of his leader not consulting with him about decisions, the same thing happens within this government. I can assure the House that the Prime Minister's speech was prepared after full consultation between the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and all other members of the cabinet. It is the clearly stated policy position of this government. Just because the coalition makes up its policy on the run, and just because one shadow minister does not know what another shadow minister is talking about, that does not mean that is the way we do business on this side of the House. I can assure you that this is a clearly stated objective of this government, supported 100 per cent by every member of caucus. We are proud to stand up in this chamber today and say that this Labor government is committed to a series of actions to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons. It is a great disappointment that the coalition, instead of acting in a ... the statesmanlike manner, commending the Prime Minister and supporting this stated objective, has to play party political games, petty little politics, stupid catch-up politics, in a desperate attempt to claim some credit.",99

150,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"Mackellar) (5.10 p.m.)Before we broke for question time today, we had the interesting experience of the two Independents calling a division on the second reading of the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill and the government and the opposition voting together to pass the second reading. After question time we had the extraordinary spectacle of the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) rising in his place to ask whether any photographs had been taken of this event to see whether he could censor the publication of any such photographs. He felt that they might somehow be used in an election framework, where it could be seen that the government, which has for so long opposed the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank, was adopting opposition policy to privatise the Commonwealth Bank and would be shown that we voted together on the second reading. The Treasurer (Mr Willis), prior to the second reading speech, made some observations which he thought were answering some of the points that I had made during my speech in the second reading debate. Unfortunately for the minister, he got quite a deal of it wrong. He clearly does not understand the constitution, particularly section 51(xxxi). Mrs Crosio-Correction, your interpretation of it.",102
151,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"No, not my interpretation. The minister said that section 51 (xxxi) applied only if the Commonwealth were acquiring property. That is not the case. The section of the constitution applies where legislation is passed which effects an acquisition of property and it is not the Commonwealth that has to do the acquiring. I pointed out that quite a deal of case law had been passed in these matters and that if the minister cared to have a look at the briefing note of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on the matter he would see that the question had been dealt with, so this bill quite clearly would be dealing with the acquisition 1995 of property. The question is whether or not it is caught by the section. My amendment, therefore, was perfectly valid and ought to be dealt with. The minister simply washed away with a wave of his hand the question of the Commonwealth Development Bank. He said that we were annoyed that the government was changing its mind. I said sotto voce-I will now say it loudly-that our concern is not annoyance. We are concerned at the hypocrisy of the government and the fact that you cannot take this government's word to mean anything at all. Again and again we have had examples of how the government has backflipped on statements it has made upon which people have relied, such as the statement of the Treasurer, who was then Minister for Finance, when he said that the government would not sell any more of the Commonwealth Bank and that that statement was made in the prospectus. When the opposition quite rightly pointed out that a shareholders meeting would be required to effect the buyback, the government subsequently said, 'No, we can do it by legislation.' The government had to backflip on that statement and called a shareholders meeting. I also drew attention to the fact that in the simplification bill that passed through this House effecting the Corporations Law there is provision to get an exemption, upon conditions from the Australian Securities Commission, from holding the shareholders meeting. The real concern was in the government failing to meet the concerns that were raised by so many opposition speakers about the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank. For the minister to simply say that it will continue is not worth any more than a breath upon the air. It has no substance. There is no reason why the government should be believed. The very framework, the very manner in which the legislation is drafted, means that the future of the Commonwealth Bank has been set up so that its demise can be brought about.  noon I want to briefly comment on the amendments that have been proposed by the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) to the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill. Mrs Crosio-You didn't have a copy of them. You have just got them.  ments here. I thank the parliamentary secretary for her interest and for her help. I spoke on them earlier today, but you probably didn't catch my speech-as erudite as it was. I am sorry you missed it. I would also like to give some of the reasons why the government has brought forward the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill. The government have been great at mounting pieties about privatisation over the years. I said in my speech earlier today that, over the last 10 years, the government have been adept, every now and then, at dragging out the red flag and trying to rally the workers around them against privatisation. But, when they need some extra cash to try to fund their greedy and disgraceful budgets that they have introduced in the last 10 years, the first they sell is the family silver. I have only to go back to the 1989 South Australian election to remember one such perfect example. When former leader John Olsen tried to introduce policies for the privatisation of some of the state servicesservices that have now been privati sed under the successful Dean Brown governmentLabor shouted from the rooftops. It brought as onto commercial television and the ABC showing workers having their shirts ripped off their backs, starting at the cuffs, then the sleeves and then the back-the whole shirt coming off. It was absolutely going to town that pri vatisation would destroy South Australia, destroy the very social fabric which been built in that great state. That is just one example of where Labor has completely gone off the rails on privatisation. Yet here it is, six years later, selling off the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Some of the members of the Labor Party must be turning in their graves. Some of the current members of the Labor Party-like Daryl Melham and Laurie Ferguson-have allowed this to happen. I am in favour of the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. There is no question about that. But my argument is that the disgraceful humbug and hypocrisy that the Labor Party has practised in the last 10 years should be recorded today as we pass this bill for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Why are we selling the Commonwealth Bank? Why is this government forced to do so? It is because of a lousy budget surplus of $718 million that is technically in place but is in no way a reality. The government has managed to con its caucus into the idea that achieving such a budget surplus of technically $718 million is more important than all the Labor tradition for which it has stood for since Andrew Fisher passed the bills through both houses of parliament in his first ALP government to have majorities in both houses. It is a completely elusive budget surplus. We know that when we strip away the asset sales and other sales that have been included in this budget there is a budget deficit of several billions of dollars on top of all the other budget deficits that this government has thing introduced in the last 10 years. The other point to make is that the government has been manifestly unsuccessful at achieving its asset sales. It has included in its budgets in the last 10 years, or since 1987-88 to be precise, $11 billion worth of asset sales, of which it has managed to reap $5.6 billion. Now it is claiming that, yet again, it has produced a surplus, but it has been on dodgy and bodgie asset sales of the Commonwealth Bank. The inadequacy of the Labor Party is absolutely before us today, as we pass the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill. The Left of the Labor Party have been trampled by the rest of the Labor Party for so long that they had could not even mount a defence to the Commonwealth Bank sale. If they cannot do that, what is the point of having them? They have been so manifestly unsuccessful. Their hypocrisy in voting in favour of the bill today is manifest for all to see. I am disgusted with the hypocrisy of the Left of the Labor Partynot that I support holding on to the bank; I do not. They say that they stand up for workers and for ALP traditions and that they are the party for the battlers. How stark can it be today that they are so far from that.",102
152,Mrs SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"Moncrieff) (5.20 p.m.)I wish to raise a matter of particular concern to me which was referred to in the second reading amendment which was unsuccessfully moved by the opposition earlier today-that is, clause 19(3) of the bill, which states: Subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 does not apply to regulations that are made under this section and take effect at or after transfer time. The matter of the making of regulations has, of course, been a vexed one for this parliament and many other parliaments around the world for a very long time. There has been occasion to debate the government approach to the making of regulations and the proclain mation of them on more than one occasion since I have been a member of this House. We not only have a government which is seeking here to make regulations to which do not have access in a very, very important bill, but also a government seeking to give retrospective effect. We have a government which is also waiving the Acts Interpretation Act on this occasion. This is pretty extraorditime nary behaviour. In other words, know what we are agreeing to in this debate. We do not have regulations before us. We do not have an announcement of what the regulahatching tions will be. We are going to agree to thing having a retrospective effect which could have avery, very serious impact on substantial number of citizens and in relation to a vital financial institution. At the same time, we just set aside a section of the Acts Interpretation Act. In many debates in this chamber we have pointed to how important the Acts InterpretaWe tion Act is to us in our deliberations and our proceedings. I feel that this needs some serious address by the government. I note that we have present, and responsible for the carriage of this bill in the chamber at the moment, the member for Prospect and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio). I have a high personal regard for the member for Prospect. I think she is a very likeable, intelligent person. In fact, I do not think she should be a parliamentary secretary; I think she should be a minister. Given some of the drones that the government has on its front bench at the moment, she would certainly be much better, not to mention an adornment. However, I have not seen anything yet to indicate that this parliamentary secretary is really the full bottle on this bill and can give me the sort of assurances that I am entitled to ask for in this chamber on behalf of my constituents; in fact, the on behalf of anyone in the Australian community who is concerned about the matter of the sale of the remaining 50.1 per cent of the public ownership of the Commonwealth Bank. I would have hoped that we could have had a government that was a little better prepared its approach to this subject. As I said in the second reading debate earlier today, this is a matter that was announced in May by the government as part of its budget. Undertakings were given about making available, well we before this, the bill and what was the government's proposal for proceeding. We saw this bill for the first time only last week. Everybody in Australia who is interested in it has had to look at it and consider it by the it was debated today so that issues could we do not properly be raised. It is a mark of the hasty nature of the of this decision to sell the remaining somepublic ownership of the Commonwealth Bank that we have had to wait so long for the bill. a This was not a decision that was well considered, well thought out; it was a decision that was taken within hours of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) actually giving his budget speech in the House. We are seeing some of the consequences of that in the chamber today. have a bill on which the government, in even now, has made so little progress that it cannot tell the people of Australia and those who have a very keen interest in this very real issue just what it is that it is going to be doing. (Time expired)",104
153,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"I want to make it quite clear that the opposition has always been in favour of the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. It remains in favour of the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. But, to take up the point so ably made by my colleague the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), the decision to sell the Commonwealth Bank, as I pointed out in my speech during the second reading debate, was taken in such haste, in order to fill the void in the government's budget, that no attention was paid to detail, to planning, to the consequences of what would happen to, specifically, the Commonwealth Development Bank and, indeed, the ramifications of the selective buy-back of $1 biIIion worth of shares by the bank from the Commonwealth-not from ordinary shareholders but just from the Commonwealth. We have concentrated very much on the shortfall and the jeopardy in which the Commonwealth Development Bank is now placed. We have done this in fairness to those people who rely upon that Development Bank for a source of funds that allows them to stay in business-small business, rural exporters, exporters of services, people who otherwise would be unable to get capital to allow them to carry on that business and produce not only for their own benefit but for the benefit of the country as a whole. The explanatory memorandum to the bill is honest and says that the future of the bank is not known. The Treasurer (Mr WilIis) told us that of course it is known. But, of course, he is the same man who made a categorical statement to Laurie Oakes in a television interview that the government would never sell any more of its Commonwealth Bank holding after the sale of the second tranche. He put in the prospectus that ordinary mums and dads who took their savings and bought into the Commonwealth Bank could expect the government guarantee to continue and could expect the Commonwealth to remain a shareholder. It is the same man who said all those things who glibly stood up before the division on the second reading and said we could be assured that the Commonwealth Development Bank would remain, whilst the very legislation for which he was responsible and which he brought into the parliament provides for its demise. The timing of that demise is completely and utterly unknown. I raise the point that it could have been sensible to look at the AIDC, which is now being bought back into public ownership by the government-the government having run it down and having confused the market-but there was no consideration given anywhere that one can see to the possibility of bringing the Commonwealth Development Bank and the AIDC under one umbrella. There are several points that I want to make about the other matter which is quite important-that is, to ensure just terms for the acquisition of property. I pointed out a few moments ago that when the minister said that the constitutional provision only applied if the Commonwealth was doing the acquiring, that is quite wrong. I will read that provision of the constitution: 51. The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have the power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:(xxxi) The acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has powers to make laws: Very clearly, that means if the parliament passes a law with respect to the acquisition of property-and the buy-back of shares from the government by the bank will be a transfer of $1 billion in cash-that question of acquisition of property is well and truly at issue. Section 51(xxxi) is intended to protect citizens from being deprived of their property and to ensure that under no circumstances will a law of the Commonwealth provide for the acquisition except on just terms. That is precisely what it means. It has been accepted as a constitutional guarantee of just terms for the acquisition of property and has been given a broad application. A number of principles have emerged on the interpretation of this section. I pointed out to the minister that if he conferred with his colleague the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) he could look at recent case law dealing with this matter, particularly five cases handed down by the High Court in 1994-the Mutual Pools case, the Peverill case, the Georgiadis case, the Lawler case and the Nintendo case. (Extension of time granted) I point out that Legal Practice Briefing No. 13 of 28 July 1994 of the Attorney-General's Legal Practice examined the developments in the interpretation of paragraph 51(xxxi) in those cases against the pronouncements of the High Court in earlier cases. The relevant parts of that briefing regarding acquisition of property and just terms are particularly significant. The concluding remarks of the legal practice briefing requires particular attention to appreciate the complexities of the measure in clause 63 of the Airports Bill 1995. I think it is relevant to point out that in the Airports Bill, with which we dealt last week, clause 63 provides that the Federal Court must not make an order under part 3, which deals with restrictions on ownership and control of airport operator companies if the order would result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms, and the order would be invalid because of paragraph 51 (xxxi) of the constitution. Again, provision was made in 1990 in the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Act, which permitted the first issue of shares to public to pay for the acquisition of the State Bank of Victoria by the Commonwealth Bank. Section 76 of that act provided that the Commonwealth Bank should pay compensation on 'just terms' if the restructuring resulprovide ted in acquisition of property of any person. 'Acquisition of property' and 'just terms' were to have the meanings as in the constitution. What I am saying is that it is only fair that the provision for just terms should have been included because it is possible there could be a situation where there is acquiescence or a steamrolling by the government to roll dispersed individual shareholders into agreement to terms which might fall just short of just terms. I think it is important that we acknowledge the possibility is there and provide for it. The practice note that I preferred to says: Although these casesthe five case that I referred to have not expanded the overall scope of section Sl(xxxi) to any great extent, they have made its application somewhat complex. Any legislative proposal which would affect property (which essentially means any valuable legal rights) runs some risk of being held to effect an 'acquisition of property' and a question will arise as to whether that acquisition would fall within section Sl(xxxi). Except for the clearest of cases (such as taxes and penalties), this is a question on which the advice of the Office of General Counsel will need to be sought. I wonder whether the minister sought the advice of the Office of General Counsel. Any buyback of shares will involve the acquisition of cash by the Commonwealth from the Commonwealth Bank in return for the acquisition of some of its own shares by the Commonwealth Bank under the terms of the Corporations Law as amended by the First Corporate Law Simplification Act 1995. The depletion of funds of the Commonwealth Bank combined with the newly privatised entity being responsible for the Commonwealth Development Bank and its charter without any guaranteed subsidy will affect the rights of other shareholders. In terms of the concluding paragraph of the legal practice briefing mentioned above, there will be an acquisition of property requiring just terms the under section 51(xxxi) of the constitution. So in the interests of individual shareholders, despite the fact that there may well be an increase in equity value per share resulting from the buyback, the bill should specifically for just terms as is provided for under the constitution. Again and again in looking at this legislation one becomes aware of the lack of preparation and proper consultation by the government with regard to legislation. It has a record of making statements and of reversing those statements-in other words, misleading the Australian people. Thus, the minister's attempts in his summation at the end of the second reading debate to assuage any fears that I may have raised in the second reading debate really must be discounted for the simple reasons that, first, he clearly has not done his homework with regard to answering the points that I have raised and, second, his track record is that he will say one thing and simply do another.",105
154,Mrs SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"Moncrieft) (5.35 p.m.)A few minutes ago I was referring to the Acts Interpretation Act provisions in the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill and the regulations, and I was expressing my dismay at the potentially retrospective regulations we know nothing about. I was also making the point that this is of a piece with the whole handling of this bill. The chamber will recall that shortly after the budget announcement the government intended to break its previous undertaking that the remaining 50.1 per cent ownership of the Commonwealth Bank would not be sold and embark on a quite different path out of desperation because of its budgetary financial situation. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) was asked a series of questions in here relating to statements he had made in a prospectus, identical statements that had appeared over his signature in another document and, last but not least, the matter about whether the existing shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank had some say in whether the remaining shares were to be sold. It was very clear that the Treasurer was very ill-prepared in answering all of those questions on those occasions. It was very clear to me, I think to this chamber, to the press gallery and, through them, to the world at large that this has been a hasty, ill considered decision and that there was a number of dimensions the government had not properly addressed. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), in addressing, during the debate on this bill, concern about, for example, the Development Bank, I think illustrated another dimension to this. I think the role and the special place of the Development Bank are something that certainly the Treasurer, much less the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), had not thought out in advance when they made their joint decision to the exclusion of cabinet. The need for retrospective regulations underlines the hasty nature of this bill. Just because we have a bill before us that has been prepared in a very hasty manner is not reason in itself for opposing regulation, but I sound a word of caution about this chamber being prepared to, first, accept doing away with a section of an act which is meant for public protection and is there for a good reason and, secondly, consider giving approval to the very notion of retrospectivity of regulations which are so fundamental, as these regulations are. I put on record my concern and I believe the concern of quite a number of members of this place at the government's chosen course. I would not want the government to say that this was agreed to without question by the House of Representatives. I am raising the issue. I wish to raise another dimension. The government can use its numbers here and can treat us and the parliament with contempt and, in so doing, as I have pointed out before, treat the people of Australia with contempt, but I think the Senate will take a slightly different view. The Senate has a historical attitude on the subject of government responsibility in revealing regulations or the intent of regulations. It will not be as easy as the government may consider. There has been more than one celebrated occasion when government ministers, their advisers or the Public Service have forgotten that the Senate does get a bit particular about making sure the rights of citizens of this democracy are properly considered when it comes to legislative detail. I think this is a case where the Senate ought to pay a bit of attention. I am not for one second indicating that anyone is going to hold up the bill. The government is not going to get that easy a way out of its dilemma, but I think it can expect that it will not get so easy a ride just ignoring it. I raise the point once again that I have a good personal regard for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), who is at the table, but I look forward with some interest to her response to the points that have been raised in this debate. If they are not responded to, I intend to object very vigorously. Mrs Crosio-Object all you like.",107
155,Mrs SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"That about sums it up, doesn't it. Mrs Crosio-You can refer to it all you like.",108
156,Mrs SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"I shall. (Extension of time granted) The government has fallen into very bad habits in this chamber. A number of procedural changes have happened. A number of structural changes have happened, in terms of parliamentary secretaries. I acknowledge that the Treasurer came in and replied to the second reading debate. I acknowledge that quite fulsomely. I might not have liked his response, but at least he did come in and respond. At this point we ought to have in the chamber a minister or a parliamentary secretary who can properly respond on this very important bill. If that response is not forthcoming, it is of a piece with the government's behaviour on other occasions where significant legislation has come in here. On occasions, there has been no response even to the second reading. Junior parliamentary secretaries who are not qualified to respond sit at the table, so no response is given. It is not clever. It is not a case of the members of the opposition being put in their place by being treated with this utter disregard. I do not care what a member of the Labor Party does. I have been fighting the Labor Party for 35 years. There is nothing they can do to hurt my feelings. I am quite immune to the Labor Party and to the behaviour of any of its members. But I make the point that this chamber represents the people of Australia. It is through us in this chamber, whether we are government or opposition members, that voice is given to people who would otherwise be voiceless. When the government behaves in a high-handed, contemptuous way in its handling of debate, it is not doing anything to me, to members of the opposition or to members of the Liberal Party; it is doing it to those whose concerns we are expressing. The government says, 'Who cares? Who's taking any notice?' The press gallery, as usual, is pretty well empty except for, I assume, an AAP reporter. The government says, 'This is not big news.' But what is happening here at this moment is of a piece with what has been happening for months and years, and it is catching up with the Labor Party-its blatant disregard, its lying propaganda and its misstatements over the signature of senior ministers which they just sweep aside, as the Treasurer did today. He said, 'Oh, yes; when I signed that statement, that's what I meant then. But circumstances have changed and this is what I'm saying now.' What a lovely introduction to an election campaign! The Prime Minister will get up no doubt and talk about l-a-w things again and so on. In the unlikely event that he wins the next election, the day after he will say, 'I meant that three weeks ago; but these are the circumstancesMrs Crosio interjecting",108
157,Mrs SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,It has everything to do with it. You have not been listening. You are making my point. Mrs Crosio-I have been listening.,108
158,Mrs SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"I would like to hear your response to the points to the bill, if you have been listening. Your behaviour and this government's behaviour, as merited in your personal behaviour, to this bill and to many bills over the months are of a piece with the behaviour of this Labor government. It is catching up with you, and it will catch up with you at the ballot box. I want an answer to the subject of those regulations. Questions have been raised, particularly in relation to the Development Bank, that cry out for answers, given the very important role of that bank for many decades in the economy of this country.",108
159,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"I wish to support the remarks made by the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) and the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) in this consideration in detail stage of the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the haste and the lack of preparation and consideration of this legislation by the government have led to many of the problems we are discussing here today. The government's haste in moving to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank at the eleventh hour-it might have even been closer to the midnight hour-when they decided that they would in fact sell the remaining balance of shares in the Commonwealth Bank, has led to this situation. When I posed the question to the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) about what role the Commonwealth Development Bank would play in the future, he looked nonplussed and had no answer to my query. That query went to him in June 1995, not long after the budget processes had been introduced into the House. I am quite sure he did not have a clue what was going to happen with the Commonwealth Development Bank. He probably knew that it had a separate banking licence and was a totally owned subsidiary within the Commonwealth Bank framework. The fact that it had its own separate banking licence has led to this bill being before the House and has raised the issue of what to do with that Development Bank. The member for Mackellar has made an excellent suggestion and has raised the question of whether the government did in fact consider combining the Commonwealth Development Bank with the AIDe. That question has not been answered; nor has the Treasurer (Mr Willis) responded to the query I raised in the second reading debate regarding the assurance I had from the member for Petrie, Mr Johns, the Assistant Treasurer at the time. Mr Johns had said to me in the House, 'I give you that assurance.' That assurance pertained to the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank being a lender of last resort. I expressed the wish: I would trust that the government continue that role as laid out quite clearly in the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959. I have had no response from the Treasurer to that assurance from Mr Johns, the Assistant Treasurer at that time. There is also the issue of the future role it will play and whether the government had in fact considered incorporating the Commonwealth Development Bank with the AIDC, which is now going to be returned to public ownership. We have had an extraordinary spectacle in the House today. The government members who voted against the sale of the Commonwealth Bank in their caucus room just last Tuesday came into the House today and voted in favour of the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Mrs Sullivan-Who were they?",108
160,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"There were plenty of them. You could go through a list of them. The members were well known and they will appear on the video, which will be freely available during the election campaign, of today's proceedings in the House. Finding out just who did and who did not vote in favour of selling the Commonwealth Bank will be an interesting exercise. We have always held the view that the Commonwealth Bank should be privatised, and we do not withdraw from that. I recall that during the 1990 election campaign the debate on the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank was probably at its most vigorous. Even the manager of the Commonwealth Bank and many other members of the staff were instructed to go out and give brochures about this terrible thing the Liberal Party would do if they got into government: privatise the Commonwealth Bank. The member for Bendigo at the time, Mr Brumby, was very vigorous in that campaign. The attitude was that we were the terrible ogres. Now we know who the terrible ogres are, with the government moving to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. But there are a number of unresolved questions. (Extension of time granted) I appreciate the fact that the Treasurer came to the table at the end of the second reading debate and made some explanations about what the future role of the bank might be. But they were less than fully explained. He did not go into the detail of what role the Commonwealth Development Bank would play in all of this. Bear in mind that the Treasurer was the Minister for Finance in September 1993 when he made the statement in the prospectus-which was made known far and wide-and I think in the House that 'the government has no intention of further reducing its shareholding in the bank'. The difficulty for all of us is to believe what the Treasurer now might be telling us about the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank. I would like to get an assurance on the record-just as I sought an assurance from the then Assistant Treasurer in September 1993 in the House. He gave me an assurance that the Commonwealth Development Bank would continue its role as a lender of last resort. It appears now, under the framing of this legislation, that the Commonwealth Development Bank's role is still obscure. We do not quite know exactly what role it will playwhether it will be a lender of last resort, or whether it will have any government support or subsidy. It presently enjoys a measure of support of some $20 million and provides concessional finance to a whole range of rural businesses and rural activities, including farming. The future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank has not been defined to my satisfaction. I take up the point that the honourable member for Moncrieff made that it is simply not to satisfy us, as members of the opposition, but the many thousands of borrowers from the Commonwealth Development Bank and the many thousands of potential borrowers from the Commonwealth Development Bank. I am referring to people who have relied on this organisation to obtain finance when all other efforts have failed, people who have sought finance from a whole range of financial institutions but who were not able to be accommodated because of the difficulties that they were experiencing. I think what the member for Moncrieff has stated is absolutely correct. We are here to represent the people in our electorate and in the Australian community who may wish to take up financial accommodation in the future with the Commonwealth Development Bank. They want to know exactly what the terms of those financial arrangements could be-whether the arrangements will still be at a concessional rate, whether the government is backing the Commonwealth Development Bank in its activities as a lender of last resort and where the future of that part of the bank will end up. It is quite obvious and has been obvious for a long time that the government and the ministers did all of this in such haste that they were unprepared for it. They still have not arrived at a satisfactory answer for me or for my constituents.",109
161,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"I think there are a couple of procedural matters that we need to highlight at the consideration in detail stage. First, as I pointed out earlier in the day, because of the standing orders in this place, when a bill comes in on a first reading, as this one did, we do not have the advantage of seeing the second reading speech and seeing the intent of the government. I would hope that the standing orders might be changed. I understand that the reason the standing orders were brought in in this way was that it was hoped that all information would be placed in the explanatory memorandum. But of course there is no obligation to do that. So it was not until we heard the second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) that we were informed that we could see the shareholders agreement only when it was completed. That is totally and utterly unsatisfactory in the course of this debate. Secondly, as the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) has pointed out, it is not satisfactory for a bill which has such great detail and which is of such great importance, particularly to the people whose livelihood will be affected, to have at the table a parliamentary secretary-in this case, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio )-who is from an area which has no association with the bill. She is not from the portfolio responsible for the bill. Whatever merits the member for Prospect may have, an involvement in this debate is not one of them. It is only fair that we ascertain here and now whether the member for Prospect has any intention of commenting on the complex matters that have been dealt with in the debate to date. I think we are entitled to know that. She is shaking her head, which indicates once again both by having her here and by her inability to take part in the debateMrs Crosio interjecting",110
162,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"Then you are going to take part, are you? Mrs Crosio-I'll decide that when you've finished.",110
163,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"I think it is important that we know whether or not any of these matters are to be addressed. To put it at its very simplest, the Commonwealth Development Bank is now at risk, because there is no guarantee that the subsidy will continue. The Commonwealth Bank, in its own annual report for 1995, said: With the honouring of the charter, which we will be charged to administer, the Bank's objective remains to achieve a proper commercial balance between the consequences of the charter and the size of any subsidy received in support of it. In other words, the bank makes it quite clear that honouring the charter depends upon the subsidy. There is no guarantee of an adequate subsidy; thus the charter cannot be guaranteed about to to be observed. Should an adequate subsidy not be paid, there is further provision in the ing. legislation to wind up the Commonwealth Development Bank on commercial decisions. That is the nub of it. Australians who depend on the Commonwealth Development Bank as the lending authority which will lend to them when no-one else will-thus determining whether or not they will survive-are now put in jeopardy. Having a parliamentary secretary with knowledge or experience in this portfolio to answer the questions that need to be secretary, answered is an insult to the parliament. The will do. member for Moncrieff is quite right when she says that there should be a sound protest about that. The concerns that so many on this side of the House have raised about that issue deserve to be answered, not simply for the people who are going to be looking finance in the future but for those who depend on it at this very moment. It is unacceptable to have this lack of planning and lack of proper explanation-lack of due process, if you like-when dealing with important legislation like this. But the government waves its head in its usual arrodebate. gant, out of touch way and simply says, 'Like it or lump it; it's going through.' As I said earlier, we agree with the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. We have always been honest in saying that we agreed with the privatisation of the Commonber wealth Bank. It is the government which has said again and again that it would not privatise it. Simply because it greedily wants the money to spend-not to retire debt, but to spend--on recurrent expenditure and therefore pretend it had a surplus in the last budget, it is prepared to sacrifice the matters of principle and detail that need to be addressed. (Time expired) Mrs Sullivan-Are you going to reply?",111
164,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,Are you going to reply? Mrs Bishop-It's your tum. Mrs Crosio--You can't tell me what to do.,111

166,Mrs SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"No. He was about to put the question, not the third reading. We paused and indicated to the parliamentary secretary at the table, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), that we were interested in her reply and her response was, 'You can't tell me what to do.' No, we cannot tell her what to do, but I am not trying to tell her no what to do. A number of questions have been here asked in this place and the parliamentary quite rightly, will decide what she Mrs Crosio--That's right.",111

I will decide whether I wish to get up to speak and participate in this I will do that when I feel that they have completed their assumptions. I do not require the honourable member for Moncrieff to tell me what I should or should not do. Mrs Bishop-Somebody has to. Mrs Crosio--I will also reply to the memfor Mackellar because of the hypocrisy of what she just gave. What we have before the House at the moment is the consideration in detail of a number of amendments",111
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"Is the parliamentary secretary speaking to the amendments? Mrs Crosio--Yes, I will speak to them.",112
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,The honourable member for Moncrieff has the call.,112
172,Mrs SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"I take it that you have not allowed the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wanted to indicate that, prior to your coming into the chair, a number of questions were asked on the detail of this bill relating to regulations-that was an area I was particularly· interested in-intentions and so on, and a response from the parliamentary secretary was sought. Nobody else was rising for the call when you proceeded to put the question. I was waiting to see whether the parliamentary secretary moved. It was not my intention to speak again. I wanted to hear her answer. I got the very clear message, as I think everybody else in this chamber did, that she did not intend to speak again. Given that, I wanted to raise a couple of matters in relation to questions I had earlier asked. That is not only in order but also very proper. If the parliamentary secretary is now indicating that she intends to reply to these items at this stage of the debate, I will resume my seat and wait to see whether she seeks the call. If she does not, then I shall seek the call again.",112
173,Mrs CROSIO,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (6.02 p.m.)-I will seek the floor on a number of issues raised during the debate. As I said when I first rose on a point of order on the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), I have been sitting in this House now since five past five. What we have actually seen is a ploy that was used by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) to have another bite of the cherry during the debate because she was either illadvised or not briefed adequately and then found a number of pages in her speech that had been eliminated and she wanted to bring them up again. Then we had the farcical amendment moved that those opposite would not stop the second reading but, in the words of the usual amendments supplied from all frontbenchers, omit all words after 'That'. Consideration in detail of the bill before the House allows speakers to speak for five minutes each, ad infinitum. Dr Kemp-It's part of parliamentary procedure.",112
174,Mrs CROSIO,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"It is parliamentary procedure in debate. There are a number of procedures here that can be put in place. But, really, what has occurred with the speakers who have now exercised their right to speak is that they have not had the audience they proposed they would get or expected. We do not have it in either the public galleries or the press gallery. The member for Mackellar certainly made a point of that. One of the things that has to be brought up is hypocrisy. It really is hypocrisy. Once this bill goes through this House, it will go to the Senate in total. They know it and we know it. The answers to the questions that have been raised ad infinitum, given by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and to be given in the Senate ad infinitum, would be just a repeat then of any information I would give or even any debate on what is now going to happen in the Senate. They know it and we know it on this side of the House. They also knowMrs Bishop- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order",112
175,Mrs CROSIO,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"Don't you want to hear it? Mrs Bishop- Mr Deputy Speaker, I would just like a point of clarification. Is it in order for the parliamentary secretary to say that information will not be given to this HOl.se because it may be given in the Senate? Is that in order, because that is what the parliamentary secretary said?",112
176,Mrs CROSIO,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,Further to the point of order by the honourable member for Mackellar: maybe I should speak a little bit more slowly so she can comprehend and understand what I am talking about. Mrs Bishop interjecting,112

178,Mrs CROSIO,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"The sensitivities you have expressed during the debate include, firstly, that you did not have the audience you expected.

As honourable members would realise, the questions that have been raised in this House, I believe, have been covered during the that is requireddebate. The honourable member for Mackellar was rather disturbed that she felt I was ting her in some way and that I have publicly said that I will continue to do so. I am here representing my government in this particular area and that is where I shall As far as the bill is concerned, I repeat: this approach of moving that all words after 'That' be omitted just so that you can take another in the debate after the allocated time for procedures has expired is hypocritical. In relation to the questions that have been raised, I suggest that you had opportunities during the second reading debate. You did not take those opportunities. What you are doing now is, in further consideration of the bill, trying to raise the issues. I do not believe this is a procedure I am going to answer to.",113
189,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"In comments made just before the member for (Mrs Crosio) had it pointed out to that in fact the amendments moved by me were in-principle amendments moved to the second reading question, she got up to say that we should be discussing the amendments menhere at the consideration in detail stage. However, somebody pointed out that she had got it wrong. The point we are making, and fairly making-the Hansard will show it to be that consideration of a bill in detail is the designed to elicit more information so that can better understand the workings of bill. That is the purpose of the procedure. We have asked perfectly sensible and you legitimate questions. We have a member on duty-it is the fault of the government and of the way they arrange their business-who is unable to answer those questions, through no fault of her own perhaps. She has not the knowledge nor the understanding of the to deal with the questions. Her interjection that she has no intention of dealing with anything is, again, just a slight Her pathetic statement that these questions would all be dealt with in the Senate, somehow meaning that here in the House of Representatives we are held in contempt and not permitted to have the sort of information Mrs Crosio-I do not need the member for upsetMackellar to put words in my mouth. I very neither said nor implied that.",113
190,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,That is not a point of order. Mrs Sullivan-What's the point of order? Mrs Crosio---My point of order is that the way in which this was moved is hypocritical. The questions raised previously were answered by the Treasurer and I feel sure that the same debate we are experiencing here will take place in the Senate. Mr Reid interjecting,114
191,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,I do not need help from people who have no right to interject when the chair is listening to a point of order. I say that there is no point of order.,114
192,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"I think it was very kind of you to point out to the member for Prospect that she does not understand the standing orders in this place, just as she did not stand what we were debating.",114
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,It helps the debate if there is no provocation.,114
194,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"The point I was making is that it was said that this information will be given to the Senate perhaps, which is not where the Treasurer resides. He should be here on duty answering these questions. The second reading speech, for your information, is an in-principle speech, as you know. We then come to the detail in the bill where we elicit information. We have someone on duty who is incapable of giving us the information and tells us that some time in the future in the Senate somebody else who is not the minister but may be better briefed will be able to answer the questions. I am sorry. That is contempt of this place and we will not wear it. Mrs Crosio-What about the second reading speech?",114
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,This is not a chamber for private conversation. The parliamentary secretary will please not interrupt.,114
196,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"The fact of the matter is that I have spelled out that the Commonwealth Development Bank is of vital importance to people in Australia. They are entitled to know what the future of that bank is. The explanatory memorandum says that its future is not known, it is not secure. The parliamentary secretary says, 'She'll be right, mate.' If you believe the Treasurer, you would be someone who would believe the statement that he made formerly when he bought shares in the Commonwealth Bank. There is no guarantee of the subsidy, and the directors of the bank say that they cannot honour the charter unless that subsidy is paid. I repeat: there is no guarantee. The charter itself is taken out of legislative form and put into the memorandum of association of the newly formed corporation: the Commonwealth Development Bank Ltd. There is provision for that memorandum to be amended. There is provision to wind up the Commonwealth Development Bank if there is no adequate subsidy paid. In other words, the government has put in place a structure to allow the under- winding-up of the Commonwealth Development Bank-and heavens knows what the future will be of those people who depend on that bank for future borrowings. Those are questions that we are entitled to have answers to. Those are questions which the parliamentary secretary has told us she has no intention of answering, and for the very simple reason that she does not have the knowledge to do so-nor is there any reason why she should have that knowledge. It is the Treasurer who should be here handling his bill. It is the Treasurer who should be here answering why he gave false information on a previous occasion and why he thinks that any undertakings which he gives by way of passing mention should have any standing at all in this parliament or with the people of Australia. It is, quite frankly, a contempt of this parliament to have this bill treated by the government in this way.",114
197,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"I rise again because I have not received any answers of substance from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio). I raised a number of issues during consideration in the committee stage of the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill, and they have not been answered. They were not answered by the Treasurer (Mr Willis), they have not been answered by the parliamentary secretary-and I take exception to the fact that the parliamentary secretary says that it is adequate for the bill to go to another place, over to the Senate, and for answers to be provided there. The standing orders of the Senate preclude a member of the House of Representatives from participating in a Senate debate and trying to obtain answers from a senator representing the Treasurer who should be handling this bill. The standing orders of the Senate do not allow me to go to that chamber and put the questions for which I wish to receive answers. My responsibility in this place is to represent the people in my electorate, the people who elected me to be their representative and to put their concerns to this House and have them answered by the government-the people who are running this country, or who are supposed to be running it. For the parliamentary secretary to get up and not respond to genuine concerns of my constituents is an abrogation of the government's responsibility. I will not be satisfied until the government answers the queries regarding the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank. It simply does not suit the situation for the parliamentary secretary to handball it over to the Senate and say, 'If you want answers, you'll get them over there.' Mrs Crosio-I didn't say that.",114
198,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"That is the total arrogance of this government and the way its executive powers are used. The government does not care about the constituents whom they are representing-but I do, and I want answers to this. I am not satisfied for the parliamentary secretary at the table to say, 'It is going to go over to the Senate, and you can either like it or lump it. You can accept what they do over there.' For anyone to absolve their responsibility in this way is not in the best interests of the legislation, it is not in the best interests the people whom I represent-and I require answers.",115
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"I would just say this: there is no compulsion upon the member for Bendigo to speak; there is no compulsion upon the parliamentary secretary to answer his questions. The feeling of this chamber in its decision regarding this bill will be made when you have finished some of the nonsense, if I may say so, which has been entered into and we have a vote on the bill before the House.",115
200,Mrs CROSIO,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (6.14 p.m.)-I feel that the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) has to have a reply. He has already had an opportunity to speak on the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill during its debating period. I believe that what he and the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) have stated has really reiterated what I said earlier-and that is the fact that the way these amendments were moved in the process of consideration of the bill in the committee of the whole was a sham. I will say to the member for Bendigo-and he does not have to put words into my mouth-I did not say that all your answers would be answered in the Senate. I said that the hypocrisy of this type of debate, with the procedures which now are occurring here in this House, we will see again in the Senate. That is what I said-we will see it again in the Senate. I also said to the member for Mackellar that one of her prime concerns was that she was not getting the audience she required-and I will repeat it. She was up here before you, Sir, for five minutes addressing the gallery, and not once did she address her comments through the Deputy Speaker in the chair. Again I reiterate: during this five minutes of jumping up ad infinitum since five past five on this bill before the House, we have had the sham-and I grant that concerns have been raised-of repetition being applied which is, again, only adding to the hypocrisy of the debate before the House. I do not say, and never have said, that this House needs access to what the Senate is of saying. In fact, it was only just last week, when you had another one of your frontbenchers trying to defer a bill until its second reading in the Senate, that I got up and said, 'This House will not be dictated to by what the Senate does.' What I did say-and I will repeat myself very clearly, was that the type of debate we have had here now on this bill before the House is the same type of debate I feel sure we will experience in the Senate. I do not need to be told by the member for Mackellar, the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) or you, Sir, whether I should or should not answer as to the bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, I appreciate your words. I am saying now, as I have said before, that since five past five, which is now something like one hour and 10 minutes ago, we have had a couple of speakers just get up and repetitiously raise concerns because the Treasurer (Mr Willis) is not here. Well, I happen to be here in the House representing the governmentMrs Bishop interjecting",115
201,Mrs CROSIO,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"Whether the member for Mackellar thinks I am useless or not is strictly her opinion; I am entitled to mine. If we would like to go on for the next 10 or 15 minutes as to what in some cases I think of her, we could bring out certain procedures that have taken place. But we will not do that because we have the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995 before us with, again-I will repeat-hypocrisy in the way it was moved to give a second voice to consideration of the debate so that you could go ad infinitum into the bill itself. But that is fine.",116
202,Mrs SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"Moncrieft) (6.17 p.m.)It was not my intention to speak again, but I just want to say this: the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) has brushed aside everything that I have said in this consideration in detail debate. The situation is that she can peel her eyeballs-if she reads my speech in the second reading debate and the contribution I have made in consideration in detail, she will find no repetition. In my speech in the debate on the second reading I dealt with broader issues. In this debate I have been asking specific questions about section 19-1I have been into consideration in detail. I have made the point that I would like questions answered. They have not been answered. I do not think it is good enough to say-and I know that the parliamentary secretary did not say this-that one of my colleagues can ask questions over in the Senate and require answers there. The basis of our system of government, in separation between the House of Representatives and the Senate, is that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) is here in the House of Representatives. This is the House that provides the Treasurer. Nobody has ever seriously considered that the Senate is the HouseMrs Crosio--I never said it.",116
203,Mrs SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"No, I am not saying that you said it. I am trying to tell you something-in which the Treasurer is responsible for giving or forced to give his answers. There are two positions that cannot be occupied by the Senate: Prime Minister and Treasurer. Therefore, the holding of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister personally accountable is the very real responsibility of the members of this House. We have an important deal here, which is the Treasurer's responsibility. I listened to the Treasurer's response in the debate on the second reading. I was not present in the House because I had a group of schoolchildren in the gallery, but I was listening to the response with them and we discussed it afterwards. So I heard the debate. Also, I was not here at the beginning of question time because I was then off discussing what those schoolchildren had witnessed down here in terms of divisions. I have said that for the benefit of the parliamentary secretary, in case she thinks I did not listen to the answer. I did, and the things I raised then were not answered. But I have not raised this. And I am entitled to raise issues in the debate on the second reading and then come in here in consideration in detail and get into the picky detail of the individual sections. That is what I have been doing. I don't think the amendment is farcical. It stated in outline the problems that we had with the bill and in outline we dealt with them at the second reading stage. The fact that we are looking at the specifics of the amendment is very much to the point. The member for Mackellar, in the first three contributions that I heard, was raising specific points in detail. It is not a matter of having an extension of time for your speech on the second reading. I reiterate: this is not a hypocritical debate. This is what parliament is about. This is what the procedure of the second reading stage and consideration in detail are about. It is only this year that, as a result of the report of the Procedure Committee, of which I am deputy chairman, the consideration in detail structure was set up. It is a little bit different from the structure we used to have when we went into committee. I have to say I think it leaves the old situation standing. It is a much better one as far as private members are concerned because, amongst other things, it has let me get up and ask questions relevant to clause 19. I expressed a real concern on the subject of regulations. I have heard no response to that issue, and I am entitled to point that out.",116
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"It is quite apparent that this is a circular debate. People do not want to be continually repeating points they have made back and forth. The only way this debate can be ended, and ended sensibly I feel, is possibly for the parliamentary secretary to move that the question be put. Mrs Bishop-That is outrageous, that you are suggesting to the honourable member that she do so. That is just not acceptable conduct in this place. Mr Leo MCLeay-I do not think the government will be looking at moving the gag on this. But I do not think we want to spend all night on it.",117
205,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"Mackellar) (6.22 p.m.)There is only one point that needs to be on the record, because to let it go unanswered would be to misinform people who pay attention to the forms of the House, and that is that somehow the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) thinks you only have consideration in detail on the bill if amendments are moved. Wrong. The forms of debate to deal with bills are a first reading, a second reading, a consideration in detail and a third reading. Each of those forms has a specific function, and the function here is to elicit detail from the bill which is not provided in speeches in detail. Perhaps it would be proper if the clerks could conduct a few classes so that people like the member for Prospect could attend and know precisely what the forms of this House are before she comes on duty to deal with a bill on which she cannot answer one question and gets up again and again and says, 'I will not because I will not because I will not,' when the real answer is she cannot.",117
206,Mr FILING,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"I agree with the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop). I think there has been a misunderstanding here by the parliamentary secretary, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), at the dispatch box. Quite clearly, the consideration in detail of a bill following the second reading is to allow members, as the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) quite rightly pointed out, to elicit more detailed responses in relation to the substance of the bill. That precedes the third reading, which is the third opportunity for members to make a decision in relation to a bill. As an Independent member of this place, I have been listening to this matter in my room and have come into the chamber because I, too, am interested in the responses to the questions raised by the three members in relation to the substance of the bill. If the Chief Government Whip believes that moving a gag would be somehow satisfactory, then he has another think coming. All that will do is exacerbate the problem. No doubt senators in the other place will take the opportunity of pointing out that the detailed responses to those questions have yet to be given. The member for Mackellar quite rightly pointed out that in this instance, if the parliamentary secretary is unable to give these responses, either consideration in detail should be deferred or alternatively the minister with the details should come into the chamber to answer those detailed questions. All I can say is that from my perspective it is unsatisfactory for the Chief Government Whip to march in and basically say, 'If you don't like it, we'll just close the thing down and choof it through. Mr Leo MCLeay-That's not what I said at all.",117
207,Mr FILING,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"Yes, you did.",117
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,It was the chair that suggested one way of resolving this conundrum. It was the Chief Government Whip who said the government was reluctant to move the gag. Mr Leo MCLeay-I am being verballed here.,118
209,Mr FILING,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"I could never, in my wildest dreams, imagine the Chief Government Whip being verballed on anything. If that was a suggestion made by you, Mr Deputy Speaker",118
210,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,Perhaps we should move from police matters to parliamentary matters.,118
211,Mr FILING,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"I was not talking about police matters; I was talking about parliamentary matters in the first instance. I was going to say that I do not think that would be satisfactory and I, too, would like to hear the answers to the questions put. If necessary, I understand the procedure is for the matter to be deferred if those questions are unable to be answered in the consideration in detail.",118
212,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"You must understand that the chair would like to see this matter resolved satisfactorily, but it is going to be resolved satisfactorily following the path which we are following.",118
213,Mr FILING,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,"With respect, perhaps you could enlighten me-I took the trouble to go down and get advice on this-as to how you see this matter being satisfactorily resolved to the interests of all of us.",118
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK SALE BILL,I made a suggestion and it was met with general derision. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mrs Crosio)-by leave-read a third time. NA AMENDMENT (CARER PENSION AND OTHER MEASURES) ACT 1995 Cognate bill: SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 19 October. Second Reading,118
215,Mrs CROSIO,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (6.29 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Earlier this year I introduced the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill 1995. That bill provided for the implementation of initiatives announced in the 1995 budget that responded not only to the particular needs that families with children have at certain times but also to making the system simpler and more consistent. The government recognises, however, that it is essential for the Australian social security system to be responsive to the needs of all groups in the Australian community. To that end, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995 serves to give legislative effect to a wide range of 1995 budget initiatives. One group of 1995 budget initiatives will mean a not better deal for people caring for others in the community, as well as for those receiving care. One group of 1995 budget initiatives will mean a better deal for people caring for others in the community, as well as for those receiving care. First, the bill will ensure that a person who cares for another person may qualify for a carer pension even if the caree is not in receipt of a social security or veterans' affairs pension or a social security benefit. A person whose family income and assets are less than $61,020 and $559,250 respectively will be able to have someone on carer pension look after them. These limits will rise in line with the family payment income and assets tests. Carers will, of course, have to meet all other existing qualification criteria for carer pension. Secondly, from July 1996 it will no longer be a qualification requirement for carer pension that the carer live in the same or an adjacent house to the person receiving care. As long as they provide the necessary level care, it will not matter where the carer lives. Thirdly, from March 1996, carers will also continue to get carer pension for a further weeks following the admission of a care recipient to a nursing home, unlike current arrangements where qualification ceases as soon as the person being cared for pennanentwill ly enters a nursing home. This period of payment will give carers time to adjust and look for work or meet the requirements of other income support payments. The bill also ensures that the same benefihelp cial arrangements for people in nursing homes will be available for people being the community. From March 1996, if a person receiving care moves into the home of their carer, the care recipient's former home will be disregarded under the assets test for two years. Similarly, a carer's former home will not count as an asset for two years if they move into the home of the person for whom they are caring. In addition, from March 1996, rent assistance will be immediately available to a social security recipient who must leave their home to be cared for by somebody in the community, or to care for someone. A further group of initiatives contained in this bill relates to rent assistance. Rent assistance is a supplement for people who are in the private rental market. First, from March 1996 the maximum rates of rent assistance will increase by $5 per fortnight for families with children. Secondly, rent thresholds will increase by $5 per fortnight to the March 1996 CPI increase. This will alIow better targeting of assistance to rent assistance recipients who pay relatively higher rents. There are currently a number of rent assistapplication ance recipients who are 'saved' at beneficial rates of rent assistance equal to the amount they received prior to rent assistance refonns in 1989 and 1993. This results in their receivbetter ing a higher rate of income support than similar recipients assessed under the current provisions. The bill provides that from March 1996 any CPI increases in the total social security entitlements of these 'saved' recipion ents will reduce their 'saved' rate of rent of assistance until the 'saved' rate equates with the nonnal current rate of rent assistance. The bill also provides for the payment from 14 January 1997 of a new residential care allowance. This new indexed allowance will replace rent assistance for residents of nursing homes and hostels. Residential care allowance be paid at the same rate and be subject to the same threshold, indexation and all other arrangements as currently apply to rent assistance. Social security pensioners with little or no other income apart from their pension are often unable to access lump sum amounts to meet living or capital expenses such as emergency replacement of household equipcared for in ment and car repairs. This bill will help recipients of some social security pensions and benefits by allowing a lump sum advance of a person's payment. The maximum advance available will be the lesser of $500 or 6 per cent of one year's pension payments and will be repayable by deductions from ongoing fortnightly pension payments over 13 fortnights. Advances will be made only to persons with the ability to manage financially on a reduced payment for the duration of the repayment period. A person will be able to increase the amount of deductions for early repayment or apply to have deductions reduced in times of hardship. In addition to the measures contained in the Social Security Legislation (Family Measures) Amendment Bill 1995 and the special rent assistance measure for families described earlier, sole parents receiving guardian allowance will be paid an extra $4 per fortnight coincide with from September 1996. Families will also benefit from other measures announced in the 1995 budget. These measures provide for the simplification of the and assessment process for family payment and child-care assistance, including combining the child-care assistance and family payment annual review processes and aligning the definitions for child-care assistance and family payment. Ongoing entitlement to child-care assistance and family payment will be able to be reassessed at the same time. There will be increased emphasis child-care assistance compliance, through the introduction of family compliance reviews, including data-matching and risk based interviews. The bill will authorise datamatching activity from 1 January 1996 in relation to the information provided to the Department of Social Security for determining whether child-care assistance should be paid to a person, to ensure that the information is accurate and consistent with information provided by the person to other Commonwealth agencies. The data-matching program is conducted under the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. The data-matching act was originally given two years of operation, with a sunset clause to take effect in January 1993. Although the government later attempted on two occasions to have the sunset clause repealed, the parliament decided to extend its operation for a finite term. Unless amended, the data-matching act will operate until January 1996. After four years of operation, the government considers that the data-matching program has achieved, and will continue to achieve, substantial savings in public expenditure. It is an important control on personal financial assistance schemes, helping to keep them free of abuse and fraud. Accordingly, one of the amendments proposed by this bill to the data-matching act provides for the repeal of the sunset clause. Another amendment in this bill relates to departure certificates. Specifically, a departure certificate is required for all social security pensioners who leave Australia and, currently, pensioners who remain absent from Australia for more than six months without a departure certificate have their pensions cancelled automatically. Pension may only be regranted when the pensioner returns to Australia. The harshness of the departure certificate provisions has created concern and some complaints. New arrangements to be implemented by this bill will mean that pensioners who leave Australia without obtaining a departure certificate will have their pensions suspended, rather than cancelled, after they have been absent for a period of six months. Pension will not be cancelled until the pensioner has been absent from Australia for 12 months. A review form will be sent to their last known address and pension will be restored, with full arrears, if the review form is returned within three months of its issue and the person still qualifies for pension. In cases where the review form is returned more than three months after its issue but before the anniversary of the pensioner's date of departure from Australia, pension will be restored from the date ofreturn of the form only, with no arrears being payable. The Secretary to the Department of Social Security will have the discretion to restore pension, with full arrears, up to two years from the pensioner's date of departure from Australia, in circumstances when being able to comply with procedures was beyond the pensioner's control. With a view to providing for more certainty in decision making and alleviating concerns about recovery for a small number of debtors whose circumstances warrant leniency, this bill proposes amendments to the waiver provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 to: clarify that part of a debt may be waived in appropriate circumstances; provide for general recovery of debts over $50 where recovery can be effected by withholdings from social security payments; provide for decisions on recovery of debts to be put on the same basis as commercial decisions about present values; provide for negotiated settlements in the administrative appeals process in addition to through civil action; provide for non-recovery of debts where there are special circumstances-within certain limitations-that would make recovery inequitable; and provide for waiver where a person has a notional entitlement to parenting allowance. The bill also makes a number of non-budget portfolio amendments to social security and associated legislation. A payment received by a trainee in part-time training in a labour force program currently is not taken into account as income for the purposes of the Social Security Act, if the trainee is also receiving a social security or service pension. Amendments in this bill expand this exemption from the definition of income to include a payment made to a trainee in part-time training or work experience under a labour market program where the trainee is receiving a social security benefit or youth training allowance and the payment is made to cover expenses associated with participation in the training or work experience. The bill amends the waiting period provisions relevant to jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance and sickness allowance to allow any part of a particular waiting period already served by a person to be transferable across payment types. The bill also makes a number of further amendments to sickness allowance. The qualification conditions for sickness allowance for certain 15-year-olds will be modified in two ways. First, clients who are independent of their parents' or other adult financial support will qualify for sickness allowance without having to meet the work history or 13-week CES registration elements of qualification. Secondly, clients who live at home with a parent who is receiving a social security pension or benefit, a service pension or certain education payments will be able to access sickness allowance if they can establish a work history or job offer. Qualification for sickness allowance is generally limited to two years. The two-year preclusion period does not apply if incapacity for work is caused by a different or more serious medical condition or by relapse of a chronic condition or by the fact that the person is undergoing a program of counselling, treatment or therapy for drug or alcohol abuse. The bill amends the Social Security Act so that, in addition to the above exception, the two-year preclusion period does not apply if a person's incapacity for work is caused by a medical condition and the person is awaiting surgery that is expected to improve the person's condition within two years from the date on which the person was regranted sickness allowance. The bill also removes the requirement for a medical practitioner to indicate whether a social security recipient's condition is likely to improve if that person receives treatment or undertakes a rehabilitation program as it considered that the requirement is not essential to determining qualification for, or payability of, sickness allowance. Further, in relation to sickness allowance, amendments are made to allow the liquid assets test waiting period to be waived in hardship cases. This will align sickness allowance with waiver provisions that already exist in relation to jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance and youth training allowance. The bill amends sole parent and sole parent special needs provisions in the Social Security Act to clarify those situations where a person is obliged to pursue maintenance. As well, the bill includes two categories of amendments relating to bereavement allowance. The bill amends the bereavement provisions for carer pension to provide that bereavement payments will be paid to a person who ordinarily receives carer pension when the person whom they care for dies during respite care. The provisions that deal with special short-term bereavement payments for family payment, child disability allowance and double orphan pension are amended to ensure that the fourweek bereavement period commences on the day after the child's death. The Social Security Act provides protection of ongoing social security pensions and benefits from garnishee action. This same protection is to be extended to a number of one-off or lump sum social security payments that have been introduced in the last few years, such as the employment entry payment and advance payments of jobsearch allowance. The bill clarifies the conditions under which a person's social security pension, benefit or allowance will cease to be payable due to the person's failure to nominate a bank account into which the person's social security payments are to be made. A person may be paid a social security payment up to 28 days from the day the person becomes entitled to the payment. The person then has three months from the date the payment ceases to be payable to nominate an account. If the person nominates an account within three months, then arrears are payable. If the person nomiis nates after three months, arrears may be paid only from the date on which the nomination was made. Other amendments made by this bill meet an undertaking previously given by the government during the second reading debate on the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1994 that amendments would be made to the Social Security Act to draw attention to the ability to 'convert' an imprisonment term to a monetary penalty via the operation of the penalty units scheme in the Crimes Act 1914. Similar amendments are also made to the Farm Household Support Act 1992. The bill makes some minor amendments relating to compensation recovery. In this regard, it clarifies the situation that, when a person's entitlement to periodic compensation payments under a law of a state or territory is converted into an entitlement to a lump sum and it is calculated by reference to a period, the person is considered to have received in each fortnight during the period a periodic compensation payment equal to the lump sum divided by the number of fortnights in the period. The bill also addresses the situation of a person receiving a compensation affected payment under the Social Security Act who receives a lump sum compensation payment and whose partner is qualified for a compensation affected payment under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. In that case, the smaller of the compensation part of the lump sum or the amount obtained by adding the compensation affected payments made under the Social Security Act and the pension payments made under the Veterans' Entitlements Act is recoverable. The bill also makes a number of minor or technical amendments that, for example, remove superfluous terms from the Social Security Act. I commend the bill to the House. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA BILL 1995 This bill contains several important measures announced in the 1995 budget for the social security and veterans affairs portfolios. The reforms will bring increased security and stability to customers while continuing the government's commitment to target assistance to those in our community who are most in need. A common thread throughout these initiatives is the simplification of existing policy and the elimination of excessively bureaucratic procedures. It is true that the scope and complexity of the Australian social security system, placing as it does considerable demands on administrators, have sometimes created procedures and rules that confuse and frustrate people. The government has made it a priority in recent times to examine ways in which the system may be simplified and made more user friendly. That work continues, with this bill marking a further step. One major initiative in this bill arises directly from the recommendations on the pension income and assets tests contained in the independently commissioned report Targeting for equity. The report was based on extensive consultations with pensioners, retirement community groups and industry groups who supported simple and more predictable means testing arrangements. At present, there are many different and complex rules for assessing the income generated by financial investments. In some cases, the rules depend on when the investment was made. From 1 July 1996, all of these rules, including the rules for assessing unrealised capital growth on managed investments and shares, will be replaced with one set of rules for working out income from financial investments. These rules will apply to all social security and veterans affairs pensions and allowances, with the exception of family payments. These amendments build on the successful bank deeming measure. They respond to the concerns of pensioners themselves about the complexity of investment rules, the frequent changes caused to pension payments and the effect on incentives to earn more from investments. The new rules are simpler, fairer and more predictable and will encourage people to maximise their resources. The extended deeming rules will apply to bank, building society and credit union accounts; cash, term deposits, friendly society bonds and other managed investments; and shares, loans and debentures. They will also apply to gifts of assets of more than the allowable limit. The rules will not apply to the principal home or its contents; cars, boats or caravans; antiques or stamp or coin collections; standard life insurance policies; or holiday homes, farms or other real estate. They also will not apply to income stream products, such as superannuation pensions, allocated pensions, immediate annuities or allocated annuities. Under extended deeming, the total value of a person's financial investments will be used to work out income from these investments. A deeming rate of five per cent will apply to the first $30,000 of the total for single people, to the first $50,000 combined for pensioner couples, and to the first $25,000 for each member of a non-pensioner couple. A deeming rate of seven per cent will apply to the value of investments over these thresholds. The five per cent and seven per cent deeming rates have been set so that they are easily achievable in safe investments. The deeming rates will be reviewed periodically to take into account movements in financial markets. Importantly, people who earn more than the deeming rates will not have the extra counted as income and it will not reduce their payments. This significant change will encourage people to maximise their income. The current rule assessing capital growth on certain managed investments when they are cashed in will be abolished from the date of royal assent to this bill. This concession will allow people who wish to change their investments before July 1996 to do so without their payments being adversely affected by past capital growth. People will have plenty of time-until July 1996-to consider their situation and adjust their investments if they wish. They will be encouraged to use the free and significantly expanded Social Security Financial Information Service for information on whether they will be affected and on the issues they could consider in making any investment changes. They could also get information from the National Information Centre on Retirement Investments, which has had its funding further increased in the 1995 budget. The simplifying and customer oriented changes to the pension loans scheme will give social security and veterans affairs pensioners more say in when and how they receive their pensions. The pension loans scheme is a scheme under which the assets of a pensioner whose pension would otherwise be reduced because of the assets test are disregarded so that they no longer have any effect on the pension. The difference between what the pension is under the scheme and what it should be under the assets test is the 'loan'. In return, the pensioner incurs a debt of the difference in the pension plus a specified rate of interest, but the debt is not recoverable until after the pensioner's death. The loan is secured by the disregarded assets. The pension loans scheme will be made more attractive to age pensioners and their partners by relaxing or abolishing some of the current loan conditions. The fortnightly rate of the loan will be lifted to the maximum pension rate or a rate specified by the pensioner-whichever is the lower. Therefore, pensioners will be able to take maximum advantage of their assets under the scheme. However, to participate in the scheme, the pensioner would have to be entitled to some payment under either the income or the assets test. Participants in the scheme will become entitled to withdraw from the arrangement at any time. If they do so, either the loan could be repaid immediately or the debt could be left to be recovered after death, although it continues to accrue interest until it has been repaid. To participate in the scheme, there is a current arbitrary rule that at least $100,000 must be left in a person's estate after the debt is repaid. This rule will be replaced with a new, more flexible one. Under the new rule, the pensioner may nominate a 'guaranteed amount' to be left in the estate after the loan is repaid. The asset types to be used as security by the Commonwealth will now be limited to real estate. Also, the interest rate used in the pension loans scheme will now be expressed in compound interest terms. In recognition of the difficulties faced by many older u,nemployed people in the labour market, mature age allowance was introduced in 1994, with a sunset clause of June 1996. There are over 37,000 mature age allowance recipients. The mature age allowance regime has proven so effective in providing appropriate support for older disadvantaged workers that the government has decided to remove the sunset clause. At the same time, other simplifying changes are being made. The current requirement that recipients have 12 months CES registration will be replaced with a requirement that they have no recent work force experience. People transferring to mature age allowance from unemployment payments will now have to have nine months, rather than 12 months, history of income support. People who lose entitlement to other payments such as carer pension and parenting allowance will not have to establish any particular period of income support history to transfer to mature age allowance. Although recipients will not be required to look for work, they may do so if they wish. If they do so, they may register with the CES and receive labour market program assistance. The allowance will be payable under social security benefit conditions, including benefit income and assets tests, although it will continue to be based on pension rates and carry pension type concessions. However, existing recipients will continue to be paid under pension conditions. Another major change brought into effect by this bill is the streamlining of payments unemployed people into a single system which will tailor administrative requirements according to people's individual needs and circumstances. The current distinction between jobsearch and newstart allowances is primarily based on CES registration for 12 months. This distinction once represented a move from one level of income support to a more active promotion of labour market and training opportunities. However, over the years, the distinction has become more blurred, with additional labour market help such as training programs and case management support now being based on the likelihood of becoming long-term unemployed, rather than being in receipt of news tart allowance. From September 1996, the current twotiered system will be replaced by a single payment called newstart allowance which will be available to people regardless of their period of unemployment. The simplified system will be coupled with an earlier review process in an intensive effort to prevent people from joining the ranks of the long-term unemployed. There will be an intensive review of all those who have remained unemployed for nine months. Some of those will also be selected for an additional review. The existing three-month review of all recipients will remain. This review will identify people at risk of becoming long-term unemployed, so that they can be referred to appropriate services and assistance. Furthermore, people whose job search efforts are already being closely monitored or who face particular hurdles such as age, will benefit from more flexible, reporting requirements. Some people whose search for work is closely supervised via one-on-one case management will be given the option of submitting forms every four weeks. This option will also be available to people undertaking formal training, voluntary work or short courses. Anyone over 50 who is unemployed and is transferring to jobsearch or newstart allowance after at least 12 months on a pension, such as carer pension, will have the option of reporting every 12 weeks. People to be offered the reduced reporting for option will be carefully selected using a screening tool that will take into account factors such as age, length of time on income support, past record of compliance with reporting and other requirements and local labour market conditions. The measures will not relax the job search efforts required of unemployed people in return for their income support, but they will streamline those requirements. People in rural and remote areas will also have the option of making individual arrangements with their regional office about how and when they lodge their forms. For example, this may include lodging forms when visiting services are available. From March 1996, people receiving jobsearch, newstart or youth training allowance who become temporarily incapacitated for work will no longer have to transfer to sickness allowance. Instead, they will remain on their usual allowance but will be exempt from job search activity while they are ill. People who become unemployed because of illness and those who suffer a potential loss of income due to illness will be paid the appropriate unemployment payment instead of sickness allowance. Sickness allowance will be paid only to those who will return to their jobs or study when they recover. This measure makes much more sense administratively, and it will allow people who are ill to undertake part-time work if they are capable of it and to retain access to employment and education entry payments. They will also maintain continuity of unemployment history so that they are not disadvantaged later in relation to access to labour market programs, case management and job compact eligibility. The allowance earnings credit scheme will be modified from March 1996 to eliminate some anomalies and to focus it more effectively on customers with casual or part-time earnings. An allowance recipient's earnings credit will accrue at a rate equal to the amount of the unused free area in any fortnight. The maximum amount of the earnings credit that can be used in any fortnight will be limited to $100. Lastly, the bill also contains two protocols that amend the international social security agreement between Australia and New Zealand. The first protocol provides for amendments mainly of a technical nature, while the second protocol enables people being paid under the agreement to leave their country of residence for short periods of time without losing entitlement to their pensions. It also provides for reimbursement by the country of origin to continue during these absences. When negotiating the protocols, it was Australia's objective to extend the temporary absence period for all pension types to 26 weeks-that is, not just for age pensions. New Zealand would not agree to this. We believe that 26 weeks is a fair period of time to allow for the continuation of pension payments for people moving temporarily between Australia and New Zealand. It is our intention to continue urging New Zealand to reconsider its position on this issue. Nevertheless the protocols will improve the operation of the agreement for both countries. I commend the bill to the House.",118
216,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGIS LATION AMENDMENT,"Berowra) (6.56 p.m.)We are addressing two bills tonight. I will address them in a different order to that chosen by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio). First of all I will speak to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and then the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill. The bills are being dealt with cognately. I suppose the first point to be made about both of them is that they contain, in the main, budget measures, but there are a number of non-budget measures dealt with. The bills are long, complex and range over many issues. In a cognate debate, quite frankly, it is not possible, even if you read a speech as quickly as the parliamentary secretary did, to cover all the ground. Mrs Crosio-They only gave me 30 minutes to do it in.",125
217,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGIS LATION AMENDMENT,"I commend you on it. I am not being critical. I make the point that unless I outline another course that I intend to follow during my speech-and assuming I am able to do so within the time-it ought to be assumed that the opposition will not oppose the measures that are not the subject of separate comment. I will be proposing a second reading amendment to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. The purpose of the amendment is to put on record our very severe criticism of the government in relation to the timing of the bill itself and some observations that we have to make about the government's extended deeming proposals. While the paper that has been circulated has one minor amendment to take into account some changes that occurred today, it is an area in which the government's responses have been quite ad hoc. They are obviously moving towards an election in which they need to rethink their positions almost daily. Both of these bills are the subject of changes which have occurred only in the last week or so. I foreshadow that I will move an amendment in the following terms: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for: (1) its cavalier treatment of the House by providing only 8 days between the introduction of the Bill and its second reading debate to enable consideration of the detailed provisions of complex legislation contained in the Bill; (2) its failure to draft the Bill to include as to the timing and regularity of valuation of financial investments under the extended deeming rules introduced in Schedule 1 of the Bill; (3) failing to advise Australians adequately that it estimates that the extended deeming rules will result in 207,000 pensioners suffering a decrease in their pension if they do not rearrange their assets to meet or exceed the deeming rates; (4) its failure to adequately assist investors of the Meridian Investment Trust who have been disadvantaged by the unrealised capital gains provisions currently contained in Part 3.10 of the Social Security Act, and (5) failing to address the potentially adverse impact of the extended deeming rules on the holders of investments in friendly societies"". One of the reasons I am particularly concerned about the way in which this bill has been handled is the complexity that becomes apparent day by day in relation to social security law. It is bad law when you cannot understand what is intended by the government in relation to law that affects ordinary people, and social security legislation affects ordinary people. The first bill, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, contains some 229 pages. The second bill contains some 167 pages. The law is complex. It adds to legislation that is already exceedingly complex. The government does not help itself by providing inadequate time for consideration of bills of this sort. It is obvious that, because of the complexity of the law, enormous difficulties will be occasioned daily. Each day you see comments from independent observers-and I am not talking about myself. The Ombudsman drew attention to these matters in the last week or two. The Auditor-General did the same last week. The Welfare Rights Movement has put on record over a long period its concern about the complexity of the social security system. This legislation does little to alleviate that concern. I make one point very clearly. I want to thank the staff of the Department of Social Security for their assistance to me in trying to understand this legislation. Under the program the government set, we had only eight days detail in which to consider the provisions. That meant that officers of the Department of Social Security had to meet with me at 7 o'clock last Friday morning. I regard that as service beyond the call of duty. I thank them publicly for that. The criticisms I offer are in no way intended to reflect upon the professionalism of the officers involved. But it does reflect very seriously upon the government. To introduce bills with more than 40 amendments-particularly when they contain provisions relating to extended deeming-so late in the session is not appropriate to efficient and effective governing. Time is required to constructively study and comment on changes and to consult with interested parties. My inquiries suggest that only the Welfare Rights Movement had advance notice of the provisions and were in a position to offer some comments. Even they were preparing their comments only last Friday and that left little time for those of us in the parliament to be made aware of their concerns. That is of very significant concern to me. Part of the delay arose from the decision of the government caucus to change the provisions in the draft Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill, and that meant they had to reprint the bill to remove a measure that had been announced in the budget-the ineligibility of women under the age of 40 for the wife's pension. That was a particularly dastardly act on the government's part and was subjected to-Mr Gibson-Do you disagree with us taking that decision?",125
218,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGIS LATION AMENDMENT,"The only reason the government changed its mind is the pressure we put on it in relation to that outrageous measure. When it was understood that the government had made a clear promise to people who were affected by this measure that they would not be denied their wife's pension retrospectively-in other words, their eligibility was to be saved while entry for new claimants was denied-it wanted to walk away from the matter again. That is an indication of the government's sensitivity to this matter and of the proximity of an election. People should have regard to the fact that many other decisions were taken in the term of this government which had quite an adverse effect on pensioners and beneficiaries and which were not changed. It is the timing of this matter that makes it relevant. I move on to the extended deeming issue, which is the main issue in this bill. The extension of the deeming regime and the repeal of Labor's unrealised capital gains measure-which treats any gain on shares and managed investments as income-has been a matter of some controversy. It burnt the government when it first legislated for it. I suspect that deeming will bum the government in the same way if it happened to be re-elected at the next election and these measures start to apply. I suspect that most people do not understand at this stage the impact of this measure. Certainly, the government has not seen fit to inform them of its impact. The position needs to be understood clearly. The coalition has long pledged to repeal the unfair unrealised capital gains provisions. We have criticised the government for the unfair nature of provisions under which people's pensions go up and down on a fairly ad hoc basis according to changes in the share market. That has created enormous uncertainty and hardship for many. The government did not receive the revenue they expected from this measure. They expected to make far more significant savings. They did not and I suspect that is one reason we are now moving to these extended deeming arrangements. The new system of calculating income on financial investments at a deemed rate of five per cent up to the first $30,000 for single people and up to $50,000 for couples, and seven per cent thereafter, will always assure the government of savings. That is outlined in the government's own statement on the financial impact of this measure. It expects to save of the order of $70 million in both the social security and veterans affairs areas by removing people from entitlements; that is, pensioners will lose their eligibility for fringe benefits or will lose eligibility for pensions or part pensions as a result of this measure. That is the reason there will be savings. Yet the government argues that this is a fairer measure. I suspect that those pensioners who lose out will not see it as being particularly fair. The second issue I want to address, beyond the handling question-it comes through in my second reading amendment-is valuation of investments. This issue is particularly germane. I was astonished when I was told by officials that the government was proposing to rely largely upon existing administrative arrangements for reporting shifts in people's financial investments when dealing with the contentious issue of valuation. The government has argued that the new deeming rules are attractive because they will create certainty. But people's deeming rates will move up and down, depending on the valuation of their assets. People will have difficulty understanding why deeming rates, which are fixed, are going to change. This act, when it is amended, will not tell us how often valuation is to occur. I suspect that the government does not intend to leave the matter open to pensioners to decide to elect when they might like to have their portfolio revalued. That would be an interesting proposition. I suspect the valuation will occur at times of the government's choosing, to advantage the government in the amount it might be able to rip off pensioners. That is the more likely to happen. At present, people are required to notify the department each time the value of their assets changes. Their pensions are adjusted accordingly. There are penalties involved if people fail to advise the department of a change that could lead to a debt. This matter of the changes that will occur in valuation will be a particularly important one, but things are all quite uncertain. There are no administrative arrangements in place-nothing we have been advised of-no determinations, no proposals for any rules. All of it is left vague and uncertain. Apparently, the department wants to achieve a system which is administratively workable. I suspect, when it tells me it is saying that the issue is so complex and so difficult, that it cannot tell me now how it is going to make this administratively workable. If that is going to be a simple system for pensioners to understand, I do not know what could be a simple system. Quite frankly, this is a matter that we regard as so important that it should be referred to the Senate Community Affairs Committee. We have asked for a reference to that committee already to consider the issue of appropriate timing and regularity of valuation and, if possible, amendments to incorporate an appropriate scheme. It could provide for valuation at the election of beneficiaries. We will see whether the department wants to oppose that. If it is not going to propose specific suggestions as to how it is done, that is the course I would put forward, and we would let pensioners choose when they would like to announce their revaluations themselves. The third matter is the budget savings and the numbers of people affected. I have already mentioned that in part. The government estimate of the number of people affected ought to be well known and understood. It is the sort of initiative that ought to have been the subject of a letter to every pensioner owning shares outlining the potential impact of this matter, and it ought to have been done before this legislation was proceeded with, in the same way that the wife pension was subject of such helpful advice that ensured that people understood how they were going to be affected. I do not know why this has not been done in this area, but I suspect that the department knew that people would have greater concern if it was made known to them. The fourth matter I want to deal with is the Meridian Investment Trust. The government has failed in this bill to assist investors in the Estate Mortgage trusts who have been adversely affected by the unrealised capital gains provisions. We now know that the government acknowledges that this is a matter of concern. The Estate Mortgage Investment Trust collapsed in 1990. Investors lost a lot of money at that time. The trust has now been relisted as the Meridian Investment Trust, and since that time investments have increased modestly but not to the point where the losses that have been made have been recouped. If these investments had remained listed, they would have been saved investments-in other words, they would not have been subjected to Labor's unrealised capital gains measure; they would have been saved-but because the trust was relisted they were no longer exempt. We heard today that the government intends to give people an ex gratia payment. But it is not going to put them back into the position they would have been in if these were saved investments. This government is so mean spirited that it wants to adopt the deeming provisions for these people before it adopts them for anybody else. It is an outrageous proposition. If the government thinks that it will get away with that, it has another think corning. I would like to think that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who is going to speak afterwards, will acknowledge that and support the amendment that we will propose. There will be an amendment to ensure that these investments are saved investments. I move on to the issue of friendly society bonds. There have been considerable representations to members and senators from the umbrella organisation for friendly societies, the Australian Friendly Societies Association. That organisation has asserted that provision should be made to treat prepaid investments, such as friendly society bonds, differently from products on which tax is not prepaid but on which the investor pays tax at their own marginal tax rate. The association argues that returns from prepaid tax products will necessarily be lower as the tax has been paid prior to the distribution to the investor. It has argued that its members will be adversely affected, prejudiced, under these new extendthey ed deeming arrangements. The association claims that there are 400,000 pensioners with total investments $2.8 billion. That is a very significant investto ment amount. It has made some suggestions involving introducing differential deeming rates and amending division 8A of the Income Tax Assessment Act to enable friendly sociance. eties to provide income stream products alternative character, to which pensioners might switch without penalty. I think those matters in time will become of very signifistationery cant concern, particularly in Victoria. We think it is important, in the this matter in particular, that the representations that have been made should be fully considered. Whether there should be changes to the deeming rules or whether tax legislathe tion should be amended is a matter that should be examined by a parliamentary publish committee. We will be moving a reference that matter to the Senate Community Affairs Committee. I want to see those particular issues examined in the other place. The earnings credit scheme-and I hope some of my colleagues will discuss this matter-is a measure that is designed to produce savings for the government. It is designed to remove a number of people from eligibility for the full earnings credit to which they are now entitled to ensure that it can only be reclaimed over time. I suspect that, with the estimated savings of $93 million over the next four years, many of the people whom this was designed to assist will be very concerned when they become aware of the nature of these amendments that ment is forcing. The earnings credit arrangement needs to understood. It provides the opportunity people who have seasonal occupations-Santa Claus is often used as the example-with a very high level of income at a particular point of time to be able to apply that as a credit over time so that their earnings are within normal allowance that is made to those folk who have earnings of up to $60 per fortnight before their benefit is affected. They will able to spread those earnings over a period time and not be disadvantaged simply because had all their earnings at the one point in time. What amazes me is that, while the amalgaof mation of jobsearch and newstart is claimed be a simplification, it was only in July 1991 that we saw the government claiming significant benefits from introducing a new payment, which was to be the newstart allowThe jobsearch payment existed before of an that. Here we have a change again, in a relatively short period of time, which will have associated with it costs of changing and adjusting computers. Quite considerable administrative costs will be context of associated with the measure. One of the other concerns that we always have is that all too often these sorts of changes seem to produce another means of hiding number of long-term unemployed. The department tells us that it will continue to statistics which distinguish between on short-term and long-term unemployed. But that is merely an undertaking. There will be no requirement for it to do so. It is right that, with the high levels of unemployment that we have, the mature age benefit be continued on the current basis. It is a benefit with pension conditions that assists those who are over 60 and unlikely to be able to get employment and exempts them from the activity test. The government had a sunset clause operating in relation to that, which was to cease on 30 June 1996. Obviously, with the high levels of unemployment that continue to exist in this country and the difficulties that the mature age experience, the situation could not be allowed where this the governbenefit was not continued. The government should not be thanked for be it. It is obviously a matter for which the for government should be condemned. But the fact is that, notwithstanding the unemployment situation and the government's responsibility for it, an appropriate response in part is to have a mature age allowance. We do not the oppose it, but it ought to be understood that the mean-spirited nature of this government is evident even in this matter. What the be government seeks to do now is to introduce of other conditions which are not as generous as were previously available. In other words, while recipients were paid on full pension conditions before, allowance conditions are now being introduced and there will be savings from that measure. It is interesting, however, that it will apply to women. Why does it apply to women now when it did not before? Because this is the government-notwithstanding its promises before the last election when it severely is it? criticised us for holding out that we might do so-that promised it would not pension age for women and is now progressively doing so. During the first year of this allowance the age at which women will be eligible for this allowance will be 60.5; six months some women will have to be driven eligible for the mature allowance, otherwise they would be disadvantaged relative to position of men. I move on to the other bill-the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pensions and Other Measures) Bill. The major issue that I wish to comment on, because does involve some amendments I will be moving, relates to data matching. I will rise to the bait about the impact of data matching. We still see it as being highly questionable. I know the government has been endeavouring to build it up as achieving certain outcomes. But we are going to meet it halfway. We will be proposing an amendadequacy ment to the effect that the operation of data matching be extended for a further three acknowledges years, to January 1999. But we certainly want to ensure that the efficacy of the process something that is still tested. We certainly will not agree to your amendment that we will avoid reporting to parliament in relation to this measure on a regular basis-that is, yearly-by substituting three years. That measure that we will be opposing. We are giving you the entitlement to extend data matching to child-care assistance paycent ments, merely because they are at the moment tested on the same basis as family payments. If you obtain information that somebody cheating in one area, I guess it is fair that you ought to be able to use that informapension tion to deal with other areas in which fraud may be occurring. We do not object to the changes that are being made in relation to the departure certificates. That was an amendment mocle in response to the Commonwealth Ombudsman's report. Obviously, it might be appropriate. I want to deal with the two other matters that respectively reflect upon the mean spirited nature of this government. Mr Gibson-That is the word for the day,",127
219,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGIS LATION AMENDMENT,"It is, and you will raise the continue to live with it. ",130
220,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGIS LATION AMENDMENT,"I am surprised, because so for of the extent to which the government is by polls, that there have not been some modifications on these matters. I suspect that the on each of them we may see some changes from this government before they have to face the wrath of the people. The issue I want to raise is the guardian allowance. The government announced in the it budget that the guardian allowance would increase by $4 a fortnight as of September not 1996-that is, $2 a week-for the people who are seen to be the most needy and the most vulnerable in our community. This has been identified particularly by ACOSS. It is acknowledged by the government because it is one of the areas in which they carry out studies to try to assess people's situations. What does this government do? It that this is a problem, that there is a need that ought to be addressed, but it is delays the introduction of the measure by 16 months, to the budget after next. Mr Truss-For $2.",130
221,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGIS LATION AMENDMENT,"For $2. I cannot understand why you introduce a measure of that is a sort and then put it off. ACOSS makes it clear. It says that since 1973 the real value of the guardian allowance has dropped by 48 per and there has not been a real increase in the allowance since 1986. The increase in the payment still leaves the payment $10 a week is short of the amount needed to meet the enough benchmark of 10 per cent of the married rate. Let me ask the question again of the the honourable member for Moreton: when you hear that your government is doing that, isn't 'mean spirited' an understatement? I notice his silence. Mr Gibson-Ha, hal",130
222,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGIS LATION AMENDMENT,"Now I note his laughter. Quite frankly, it does not do you any credit at all. But you will obviously support the government's measures in relation to rent assistance, which I also say are quite mean spirited. In this bill, the government is introducing three changes to the provisions in relation to rent assistance. It says, 'Applaud-rent assistance is to be increased by $5 a fortnight for families with children.' But then it says quietly, under its breath, 'The rent assistance threshold will be increased by $5 a fortnight. ' That is, for a number of folk, the threshold which their income has to meet will be raised before they will be eligible for rent assistance. Of course, it says in relation to other people, those living in boarding houses and other rental type accommodation-lodges and certain retirement villages-who had a saved eligibility for rental assistance that they would no longer be eligible to receive the former payment. Their payment was to be frozen until it was removed. The overall impact of these changes is that the government gets a net saving of $16.9 million over 3% years. So you have got $5 million a year being saved out of changes to rent assistance. I think it is mean spirited. It is hypocritical on the part of this government-there is another word for the honourable member for Moreton-to praise itself for the impact it will have on families through changes to rent assistance, but by ripping it off the older pensioners in the form it does we have about 310,000 recipients who will lose $3.75 a week as a result of the increase in the threshold. This is disastrous for pensioners and you will know it at any election. (Time expired)  Science and Personnel) (7.26 p.m.)-The question is whether we will know the opposition's policies on that or anything else before the election. I highly doubt it. I move: That the debate be adjourned. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",131
223,Mr BEDDALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",131
224,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Do you claim to have been misrepresented?,131
225,Mr BEDDALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I definitely claim to have been misrepresented.,131
226,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,131
227,Mr BEDDALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yesterday afternoon in the other place, Senator Chapman claimed, in a question to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) that, when I was the minister responsible for that portfolio, I had received a commercial-inconfidence letter from 17 Cut Price Deli franchisees and that I had passed this commercial-in-confidence letter on to Mr Rechichi, who subsequently intimidated the signatories to this letter. I categorically refute this outrageous assertion by Senator Chapman and assure the House that neither I nor any member of my staff passed on a commercial-in-confidence letter to Mr Rechichi or any other party. My office and I always treat our representations on such matters in strictest confidence, as would be demonstrated by anybody who talked to the small business community. I confirm, however, that Mr Rechichi was appointed to the franchising task force established by me in 1991 and chaired by Mr Robert Fitzgerald, who now chairs ACOSS. Mr Rechichi was the nominee of the Franchisees Association of Australia to the task force, not mine. NA  That the House do now adjourn. Kokoda Hospital Project",131
228,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening in the adjournment debate I want to put on the record some very good work that has been done by a number of Rotarians from a number of Rotary clubs in New South Wales. I refer to the Kokoda Hospital project which has been undertaken in New Guinea and which has been built, as I say, by a number of Rotarians from a number of different Rotary clubs across Australia, as well as members of Lions clubs and other non-service clubs. It is interesting to note that 32 Rotary teams have been involved to date and also members of Lions and non-service clubs. Originally, this project at the Kokoda Hospital was intended to be jointly funded by the Australian and PNG governments, but I believe so far there has been no money forthcoming from the PNG government. I want to put on record the names of the people from my electorate who have been involved. I have had the pleasure of being able to assist them with their communications, with faxes backwards and forwards, in organising equipment and the like. As the House would appreciate, it is a rather remote area of New Guinea. From within the Lyne electorate, I mention people from Forster-Col Robinson, Jeff and Mark Bower; from Port Macquarie-Ray Lambert; and from Taree-Norm Jones, Bob Young, Bob Newling, John Ritchie, Rob Keen and Charlie Lelean. I think it is important to note particularly the effort that Charlie Lelean has put into it. He has played a major role in organising, designing and supervising the installation of the electrical equipment in the hospital. Charlie was there on 16 September this year, when the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating), accompanied by Julius Chan, opened the hospital. I think we all saw the press photographs that came back of the headgear. He certainly recognised the good work that the members of Rotary did at that hospital. The project is going to come in under the $1.5 million budget. The work has included three staff cottages, two hikers cottages, an airport terminal at Kokoda and local health clinics at Soqeri and Menari, adjacent areas, in addition to the memorial hospital. It was indicated to me that, if the hospital had have been constructed on a commercial basis, if it had have gone out to tender for contractors to build, it would have been more like $4 million worth. The people in that area of Papua New Guinea are very grateful to the labour of love that has been provided by the Rotary members and Lions members who have travelled up there and camped in the area while they have been working on this construction. By way of a little aside: I believe that after the Prime Minister opened the hospital a couple of the local tribes presented, as a gesture of goodwill, the Prime Minister with a couple of pigs. I do not know what the Prime Minister has done with the pigs since then. It will certainly be interesting to see whether they appear on his register of members' interests. I believe the Prime Minister's minders were thrown into a bit of turmoil when these pigs turned up because they could not not accept them because it would have been an insult to the tribes that presented them. I think the pigs were knocked out by some injections and flown back to Port Moresby. As I say, it will be interesting to see whether the pigs appear on the Prime Minister's register of members' interests. By way of a further aside before my time is up, I wish to speak again of Charlie Lelean, a member of the Taree Rotary Club who did all the electrical work in the hospital. Very shortly he will be going up to Vietnam and doing exactly the same thing with the Fred Hollows Foundation and the factory that they are building in Vietnam to manufacture, at a very competitive rate, intraocular lenses to be used in clinics in the Third World. I commend Charlie and all the other Rotarians and Lions members who have been involved in these projects. The people of Australia should be justly proud of them. Roads: Urban Public Transport",131
229,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Urban traffic congestion is a complex problem. As we head towards the 21st century, we need a new approach to transport policy which elevates the importance of public transport. A one-dimensional approach of simply building more roads is unacceptable, although for safety and other reasons we will need upgrades and new roads from time to time. But, to use a medical analogy, we cannot keep widening arteries forever without cutting into vital tissue. Cut too deep and you risk harming vital organs. This is the case in the community that I represent. For this reason, I vigorously opposed a proposed airport motorway in my electorate through the suburbs of Kallangur, Wooloowin, Clayfield and Kedron. I joined with the local community in opposing this proposal, which was reflective of an outdated transport department mentality indifferent to the importance of public transport and without due regard to the quality of life of local communities. In response to representations, this proposal was dropped. I am delighted to say that since that time the state government has left behind the departmental philosophy mentioned before and has embraced a radical new public transport agenda encompassed in many state election commitments given recently. This change of approach is what I lobbied long and hard for in my local area. It will mean a huge state and local commitment to northern bus ways through Chermside and beyond, leading to express bus services along Gympie Road in peak hour; increased frequency and reliability of suburban rail services when the new inner city tunnels are completed; and, very importantly, a Brisbane airport rail link. These will be exciting develstrongly opments for the northern suburbs of Brisbane in the years ahead. In the meantime, there are some traffic bottlenecks and dangerous intersections that must be dealt with. Along with Terry Sullivan MLA, the member for Chermside, over the past 2% years I have lobbied the state government to provide the money for the upgrading of Gympie Road to solve the problem of the Nundah bottleneck-the most significant traffic problem on the north side of Brisbane. I congratulate the Queensland transport minister, Mr Elder, on his announcing of the provision of $40 million for the upgrading of Sandgate Road at Nundah. Also along with Terry Sullivan I lobbied the transport department successfully to allocate $2.3 million to upgrade the intersection of Rode Road and Gympie Road to provide dedicated turning lanes from Rode Road into Gympie Road. There are also further areas of transport need in my electorate. Bus services are poor in Zillmere and Brighton, and I am now lobbying the council and state government to upgrade these services. The Residents Action Group of Zillmere, whose president is Mr Jim Freilich and secretary Mr Vern Pailthorpe, are seeking the introduction of a trial period redirecting the existing 96 bus to cater for the suburbs of Boondall and Zillmere, a onehourly 96 bus service on week days and, on Saturdays and Sundays, a 96 bus service to cater for visiting hours at the Prince Charles and the Royal Brisbane hospitals. Bus services are also poor in Brighton after 6 p.m. and on weekends. There needs to be a significant upgrading of services after hours and on weekends in this area to connect with the new federally funded bus-rail interchange at Sandgate. There is also a need for better bus services connecting Prince Charles Hospital, Toombul, Burnei Brae and the Royal Brisbane Hospital. There is also a need for sound barriers at Deagon and for noise amelioration along the gateway at Nundah. These are matters I am seeking to resolve with the responsible tier of government. Within six weeks, the transport minister, Mr Elder, will be releasing the Brisbane inner northern suburbs transport study. I have put the views of the community that the state government must rule out the east-west connection between Eagle Junction and Kedron and reject any substantial upgrading of Junction Road. I believe it is the role of the federal member to stand up and strongly articulate the needs of the community in these matters, which are so essential to the quality of life. There is nothing more important to our lives than the quality of the air we breathe, and there is nothing more destructive to the quality of the air we breathe than the motor car. To protect our fragile environment, we must commit ourselves to this radical public transport agenda, because we do not want to see our communities pulled apart by roads. Traffic affects our health, safety and work. The sickening screech of tyres and the too frequent sound of sirens which signify traffic accidents jolt our sense of security and well-being. The motor car is a necessary evil. It is essential for many of us in earning our living. As a community, we have to find the balance between the use of the motor car and the enhancement of our quality of life. The new radical transport agenda evolving in Brisbane and south-east Queensland I believe will achieve these important aims over the next few years. It will be Labor governments at the state, local and federal level that can put this agenda into action. It is not an agenda which is shared by our conservative opponents, who do not have any agenda at all for public transport and no concept of planning for quality of life. Quality of life is too important to leave to conservatives. It will be in south-east Queensland and Brisbane that Labor governments-local, state and federalwill solve this problem for the benefit of residents. Lowy, Mr Frank",132
230,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"The appointment of Mr Frank Lowy to the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia on 22 June this year is a scandal. In March 1992, Mr Lowy fiercely resisted an Australian Taxation Office demand for $18 million back taxes which was settled to his satisfaction. Another dispute developed between the Lowy family and the ATO in March 1994. According to the Sun-Herald of 2 July 1994, Mr Mark Leibler, Melbourne based tax haven expert, once again sprang into action. Mr Leibler aggressively refused to cooperate with the ATO audit team. He and Mr Lowy also ignored a formal section 264 notice, which is a prosecutable offence. Mr Leibler also sought an interview with senior ATO officials. As Mr Lowy is reportedly a close friend of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the question must be asked: did Mr Leibler's representations bring about high level interference in Mr Lowy's favour? Mr Lowy, acting on Mr Leibler's advice, would not answer questions and claimed to know nothing of the source of the funds. Incredibly, Mr Lowy claimed that the money was a capital injection from 'unknown international sources'-I repeat 'unknown international sources'. How lucky can you get? The dispute related to amounts totalling $47.8 million, $42.8 million being paid to a Lowy family company in January 1987 and $5 million in November 1988. The tax office claimed it was taxable income. Subsequently, the ATO audit team issued assessments for $21.4 million tax and referred the case to the DPP for action. It is not clear whether the reference was for non-compliance with the section 264 notice, the receiving of secret commissions or both. The DPP decided there was no case to answer. However, the Lowy family company was still liable for tax, penalties and interest to the value of $50 million to $51 million. Elements of the dispute then went before the AAT, and again the settlement was in the Lowy's favour. Several days later the case was mysteriously settled, and the Lowy family reached an agreement with the ATO to pay a total of $25 million, or half the tax outstanding. This settlement caused such distress to the audit team assigned to the Lowy case that the two tax investigators involved had to take stress leave. In the course of the Lowy matter the ATO took advice from Mr Alan Goldberg QC which, I am reliably informed, was in Mr Lowy's favour. Mr Goldberg was the same 'expert' who 'cleared' the Coles Myer directors over the Yannon transaction. The AAT hearing in April 1995 provides some clues to this scandal. The hearing centred on the issue of confidentiality of three key documents held by the ATO. The ATO did not want to disclose these documents, as they feared that if advance warning was given evidence might be tailored and future investigations would be frustrated. Significantly, the ATO documents referred to an entity based in the well-known tax haven, Liechtenstein. This entity, Yelnarf, was believed by the ATO to be linked to the Lowy family, who have a number of companies with the title Franley-Frank and Shirley Lowy. 'Yelnarf' is, of course, 'franley' spelt backwards. A settlement was reached only a few days after the AAT hearing. Why? If the money paid to Mr Lowy was from 'unknown international sources, as he claimed, why was he willing to pay $20 million if it was not his money? Can anyone seriously believe that 'unknown international sources' based in the tax haven of Liechtenstein would provide Lowy with $47.8 million? How did Mr Lowy and his legal adviser, Mr Leibler, avoid compliance with a section 264 notice? Above all, who authorised the reduction of Mr Lowy's tax bill from $50 million to $25 million? Mr Lowy is one of Australia's richest men. He has a net worth of $860 million and a reported annual salary of $3.1 million. Yet he had his tax obligation halved and avoided tax investigation of his affairs. Is it a coincidence that the matter was settled shortly before Mr Lowy's appointment to the Reserve Bank board? The government owes honest Australian taxpayers an explanation for the Lowy taxation scandal. In conclusion, I seek leave to table the AA T decision and reasons in the Lowy matter dated 11 April 1995, which is in any case a public document. Leave granted. Industrial Relations: M. C. Herd",134
231,Mr OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"In July of this year I attended a ceremony in Geelong to present ISO 9002 accreditation to M. C. Herd Pty Ltd, a local meat processing company. It is timely that I raise this matter in the House, given recent debates in the parliament on industrial relations and the high level of industrial disputation in Queensland abattoirs at the moment. M. C. Herd is the first domestic abattoir in Australia to obtain ISO 9002 quality accreditation. I offer the congratulations of the House to the management and the workers of that company for achieving the most significant milestone in Australia's meat industry. This historic accreditation was achieved through a strong commitment by all levels of the Herd organisation-management and workers-to quality in production processes and quality in service to customers. The point I want to make is that this quality accreditation was achieved with the cooperation of the workers and their union representatives. This achievement won by workers, their union and the management of the company was reached in a spirit of cooperation, not confrontation. The process was not easy; the achievement of a vision which throws out the big challenge to managers and workers rarely is. But with persistence, trust, goodwill and a thirst to be the best, this company and its work force have reached the top in an industry which in the past has suffered an appalling industrial relations record. I listened with great pride as Paul Conway, representing M. C. Herd staff, explained the workers' role and commitment to the process of quality accreditation. I listened with excitement as the owner, Frank Herd, outlined his commitment to quality accreditation and his vision for the company and announced a $2 million investment, which will create over 100 jobs in Geelong. I listened with pride again as the old warhorse from the AMIEU, Wally Curran, a man who has devoted his working life to the advancement of the conditions of meat workers in Victoria, spoke of the progress made at this company through cooperation. M. C. Herd is testimony to the fact that there is a better way to conduct industrial discourse in this country. This company is testimony to the fact that an enlightened management, a progressive union and work force and a cooperative industrial relations framework provided by a federal Labor government in Canberra can produce a visionary outcome equal to anywhere in the world. The company's pursuit of excellence in quality is built upon people working as a team. Fundamental changes in attitude and work practices have taken place in developing greater responsibility by the employees and the management to improve quality. The company has displayed great commitment to training the work force and improving the communication skills of its workers and throughout the enterprise. M. C. Herd is an example of how it can be done the modem Australian way in the 1990s-not the 1960s way that certain elements of the opposition would have us return to. My congratulations go to the Herd family, the workers and their union for their achievement of an Australian first.",135
232,Ms WORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"Our continent is the driest inhabited continent on Earth, yet we use our water as if it is an endlessly abundant resource. Given our present rate of water usage and Australia's projected population growth, our demand for water will exceed our current developed fresh water supplies by the year 2020. This is not a distant event to be dismissed and left to future generations to deal with. It is a crisis that we may face in only 25 years time and one which must be dealt with now. National Water Week, which concludes this Sunday, is aimed at raising awareness about the scope of the problem we face and the need for action. I wholeheartedly support these aims. Our river systems are, quite simply, the lifeeffluent blood of the land which sustains us; yet we have drastically altered both the quality and the quantity of the water flowing in our rivers. The Murray River is a case in point. If water were not diverted from the Murray River, over 13,700 gigalitres of water would flow from its mouth at the South Australian town of Goolwa. Now, little more than 4,900 gigalitres of water enters Lake Alexandrina. Reducing the level of river flows so dramatically has endangered-if not destroyedtoo many of the native flora and fauna species that rely on our wetlands and flood plains. The Murray cray, for instance, is now extinct in our state. Biodiversity is also threatened by the declining quality of the water in our rivers-a result of viewing our rivers as convenient receptacles of our waste. The devastation of the river systems must not be dismissed as simply a 'green' issue. As always, economics and environmental issues are intrinsically linked. For instance, the value of the agricultural product derived from the Murray-Darling catchment area exceeds $10 billion annually. In a nation so economically reliant on primary production, the destruction of our river systems amounts to economic suicide. Clearly there is an urgent need for change and I would like to take this opportunity to commend South Australia's Brown government for its visionary response to this needa response embodied in our state water plan. Water Amongst the many initiatives in this plan, the Brown government's commitment to addressing the degradation of the Murray River is particularly noteworthy. However, I am angered that it is an initiative that is being undermined by short-sightedness on the part of the Keating government. In relation to this point, I would like to quote from an excellent article which appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser earlier this week. It states: The Murray is dying. The experts believe it. Politicians are listening to the warnings and proposing dramatic changes in the way we use the river. The SA Premier, Mr Brown is leading the charge, with a plan to revitalise the river as part of national projects to celebrate in 2001 the centenary of Federation. Under the Brown plan, the Murray would undergo a huge clean-up. Drainage and waters would be diverted away from direct toxic injection into the river; salt-level reductions and river management schemes would mean more, and cleaner, water for all. Such schemes are the stuff of major spending ... Mr Brown is planning a levy system on water charges to finance SA's $35 million contribution ... From Canberra, the initial response-at least under the umbrella of the 2001 program-has been to reject projects of this kind ... Mr Brown is still awaiting an official Canberra response. Such is the commitment of this government to sustainable use of our water resources. On the occasion of National Water Week, I am proud to reiterate the following commitment given in Adelaide last Friday evening by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). He said: Earlier this year, the Liberal and National Parties made a commitment to work with the States and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in undertaking a major rehabilitation program that would be completed for the Centenary of Federation ... it is abundantly clear that, at current levels of Commonwealth funding, it will be impossible, even with all the best ideas and intentions of the Commission, to achieve sustainable land management in the Murray-Darling Basin within the next thirty yearsif at all. Let me reassure you that the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling Basin will be one of the key initiatives in the Coalition's Environment Policy for the next election. Such is the commitment of the Liberal and National parties to the sustainable use of our water resources. Economy . Mr HORNE (Paterson) (7.50 p.m.)-Time IS a great healer, but it also distorts the memory. Perhaps Harold Lasseter, an Australian explorer, is a classic example of this process. He knew where the reef was. He had seen. it; he could picture it, but he perished leadmg an expedition to claim it-because it was not there! Some claim that he was a con man. But distortions of this magnitude are not uncommon. Over recent months much has been said about the white picket fence. It has been adopted as the status symbol by conservatives as they recall their golden era-the Menzies era. I am a product of industrial Australia. I born, educated, married, lived and reared my family in the Hunter Valley, and my recollecti-m of that golden era is not strong on white pIcket fences. I remember a steel industry that employed masses of people, mostly as labourers. I remember thousands of bicycles at change of shift. I remember the hundreds of workers who turned up daily at the gates in the hope of getting a day's work. Yet at the end of that era our steel industry imported steel products from Japan and Korea because they were cheaper. We had an industry that was not competitive. I remember a coal industry where whole towns provided the miners that slogged their guts out in an underground hell where disaster was never far away, and death did not have to be a violent one. I have seen dusted miners dying. I remember the industrial unrest as workers fought for a fair wage. Life was cheap. I remember a waterfront where the work was done manually or with primitive machines while our exporters competed against increased mechanisation on foreign wharves. I remember extended families. Pensions were rare and meagre. Married women and mothers c-uld not have a career unless they were WIdows, and then they worked for a pittance. There were no child-care centres then. I remember young married couples renting rooms, living with parents and renting sheds in backyards because they could not afford a block of land or a home. This was the golden era of the Liberals, and this is what they aspire to. Today in the Hunter I see vast changes. We have a steel industry that is competitive on a worldwide basis. We not only export our steel products; we give our own manufacturing mdustry an edge when competing for international sales. I see the most efficient coal industry in the world producing record export - ales through the largest coal loading facility m the world and at the same time feeding the largest group of electric generating facilities in Australia. I see Goninans making locos and rolling stock that are being sold overseas-an export that only a few years ago we would not have dreamt possible. I see ADI making fibreglass minehunters was for our navy; developing a new industry that will place the Hunter on a world map for excellence in fihreglass and electronic tech-ology. I see new suburbs with quality housmg. I see excellent child-care facilities. I see aged and disabled people being supported by our most extensive pension network ever. I compare this with the golden era of the Liberals of my youth. I know which model has the greatest hope for our children, for our country, for our future. And I know which government had the vision and the determination to make it happen. So do all other Australians. If by some unjust quirk John Howard does win the next election and takes this nation off in search of the distorted recollections of his youth-in search of that white picket fence that really existed only in films such as Pollyanna and in the mid-western American movies that they showed us to comfort us and make us look for some hope-then our nation is in for a rude shock. Lasseter's last ride will pale into insignificance compared with Howard's last ride. Member for MCEwen",136
233,Mr HALVERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Casey) (7.55 p.m.)The honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) constantly raises issues in this chamber that have nothing whatsoever to do with his role or responsibilities as a member of the federal parliament. Presumably, his constant tirades against the very efficient and effective Victorian Liberal government are as a result of his apprehension-or perhaps a better word would be 'comprehension' - about his prospects at the next election. Apparently, he is determined to indicate to his factional colleagues in Victoria that he would not mind having a tilt at Spring Street following his second enforced retirement from Canberra. The problem is that, whilst most of us here have become immune to his constant ranting and raving, when he sets out to involve a wider audience the time has come to challenge his activities. Let me give you an example. In an endeavour to capitalise on well-founded community concern about French nuclear testing in the Pacific, the honourable member for MCEwen distributed a letter throughout his electorate claiming that the Kennett government was planning to sell the Eastern Energy grid to the French government corporation Electricite de France. The letter was printed on official Parliament of Australia House of Representatives letterhead. Enclosed with the letter was a petition, which the honourable member invited his constituents to sign and return to him. He stated in the letter: This petition will show the Kennett Liberal ment how we feel, and help me to stop any sale our power grid to French companies. The letter concerned was dated 14 September 1995. It had been public knowledge since August, more than a month before the honAlthough ourable member circulated his letter, that Electricite de France was no longer involved in any negotiations regarding the sale of Eastern Energy or, for that matter, any other energy business in Victoria. However, the member for MCEwen was not going to be put off by something as unimportant as the truth. Instead, he asked his conto stituents to sign a petition which he claimed would help him stop something that had in fact already been stopped weeks before. Furthermore, the petition enclosed with letter was not addressed to members of the Victorian parliament but to the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives. election campaign. Not only was the wording of the petition completely inaccurate and misleading but anyone with a modicum of intelligence would know that the House of Representatives has nothing to do with the privatisation of electricity distribution or generation companies. In any event, no matter what he may pretend to his constituents, the honourable member for MCEwen has about as much chance of influencing the Kennett government as he has of retaining his seat at the next election-in a word, zilch, and that is probably a generous estimate. This whole exercise was nothing better than a hypocritical, unscrupulous and devious attempt at cheap political point scoring. It is also a sad reflection on the contempt with which the member treats his constituents. Does he take them for fools? Apparently so. What an unhappy and inexcusable state of affairs. Here he is trying to beat up a non-existent issue while at the same time ignoring the significant matters which are causing major problems for many of his constituents. Where is his petition on the appalling effects of the national debt, on long-term and youth unemployment or on the fact that, under this Labor federal government, the gap between the haves and the have-nots has grown wider on Governa daily basis and is still growing? He is of strangely silent on these critical matters. It is hardly surprising that so far it seems that the honourable member's efforts to 5 mislead and confuse have had little effect. he circulated this scandalous piece of literature almost six weeks ago, so far none of the petitions have seen the light of day in this chamber. Of course, it could be that the electors of MCEwen are already awake to the member's motives so none of them have bothered to sign it. Alternatively, perhaps the honourable member is simply too embarrassed present the petitions because, if he did, even his colleagues would be forced to question the abuse of the system. Or perhaps he is just using this exercise as a covert the method of collecting names and addresses, which were provided to him in good faith, to build up data for use during the forthcoming Unfortunately for the present member for MCEwen-but very fortunately so far as his long-suffering constituents and the nation are concerned-it does not matter what sort of state databank he may be assembling, how much taxpayers' money he is willing to waste in sending out palpably misleading letters or how far he is willing to go to try to divert the electors' attention from the real issues, it will not save him on election day.",137

The member for Casey (Mr Halverson) is totally confused and obviously does not know what he is talking about.

On the other hand, it is also quite overseas we have absolutely no control over can be no control of it, what is the point Another thing I see-just a small thing-is taken out as family pets to two.

What happens to a family? They might have What do you do? Do you have one bird put down, to have it in that form, where the limit is two, to apply common sense.

There is a section where, for the government can dictate that they must overseas as to what the animals are going to be after-that is when they are exporting from clear in the legislation that once the animals go them.

Also, what sort of bird is this about? they are in such large numbers in Australia making a speech in this parliament, probably things change.

There is absolutely no doubt that when Australia-that was prior to 1 June 1960-those trapping birds took the business very seriously. illegally, they would report them and they would there was great control on it. Now the legal illegal trappers are out there because they do with great cruelty and they I can remember that, for instance, in Germany for 15 tiger snakes.

(2) Has the Government consulted Optus and Telstra about the delivery of pay television services by cable on power poles. (3) Does the Government support the delivery of pay television services by cable on power poles. (4) Has the Government considered measures to minimise the visual pollution caused by wires on power poles by encouraging the use of underground delivery systems. (5) Is it a fact that in some areas Telstra and Optus will deliver pay television services through two separate sets of cable and associated equipment mounted on power poles. (6) Is the mounting of cables and equipment on power poles subject to Commonwealth legislation. (7) Will the Government arrange for Optus and Telstra to advise all Members of Parliament of the streets in their respective electoral divisions in which pay television services will be delivered by overhead cables on power poles. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I understand that the delivery of telephony and pay television by cable will in some instances result in more wiring and associated equipment being mounted on existing power poles. I am advised that Optus will, where aerial infrastructure exists, co-locate with it. Where existing aerial cable is proposed to be put underground, Optus has indicated that it will pay a share of the costs, thereby subsidising the cost of underground electricity supply. Telstra has advised that some cable for pay television and associated equipment will need to be located on existing power poles. It expects that this will be in the order of 20 per cent of the street cable and will generally occur in areas where the existing telephony system is aerial and it is cost prohibitive to install underground cabling. In NA addition some of the ""lead-in"" cabling will be aerial. (2) The Government has held discussions with both Optus and Telstra to obtain general information about their respective plans to deliver communication services, including pay television and telephony by cable on power poles. (3) The decision to deliver pay television services by cable on power poles is one for the carriers, subject to the carriers aerial deployment abiding by relevant Commonwealth legislation (including in particular Part 7 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 and the Telecommunications National Code). (4) In relation to cabling laid by the telecommunications carriers, the Government has in place the Telecommunications National Code which has the objective (among other things) of requiring carriers to develop or provide infrastructure in a manner that has full regard to the need to maximise the protection of Australia's natural environmental and cultural heritage. (5) There may be some areas where the cable television rollout of Telstra and Optus will coincide and the services will be delivered through separate infrastructure. However, as the majority of Telstra's cabling will be underground it seems unlikely that there will be many areas where Optus and Telstra will both have cables mounted on power poles. (6) The provision of telecommunications infrastructure, including the mounting of telecommunications cable on power poles by telecommunications carriers, is subject to the Telecommunications Act 1991, The Telecommunications (Exempt Activities) Regulations, and the Telecommunications National Code. (7) The Government has no specific requirement in place to require carriers to notify Members of Parliament about their plans for provision of pay TV by overhead cabling. The Government, however, has in place the Telecommunications National Code which requires the carriers to advise local authorities of proposed construction of infrastructure in their region. Mobile Telephone Base Stations: Health (Question No. 2422) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 8 June 1995: (1) Is it a fact that Telstra has recently installed a mobile telephone base station comprising 12 telecommunications transceivers, approximately two metres high and one metre wide, and six transceivers, approximately one metre high and one metre wide, just below the roof line of a Telstra building in Harbord NSW, some of which are approximately 10 metres from a home unit building; if so, to what extent has it been established that the installation poses no risk to health. (2) Did the Warringah Council object to the installation; if so, what was Telstra's response. (3) Did community consultation result in objections to the installation; if so, was Telstra able to proceed regardless of the objections. (4) Did Telstra agree to observe the Municipal Associations of Victoria code concerning the installation of mobile telephone base stations; if so, (a) what steps did Telstra take to ensure that it adhered to the agreement in proceeding with the installation referred to in part (1) and (b) will he provide an up-to-date copy of the Municipal Associations of Victoria code. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Telstra has advised that it has installed and commissioned a mobile base station facility on a Telstra building in Harbord NSW following procedures as outlined in the Telecommunications National Code, including granting of approval from the Department of Environment, Sport and Territories (DEST). I am advised that DEST conducted a site visit and sought independent expert advice from the Australian Radiation Laboratory (ARL) in relation to the health risks of the installation. The ARL concluded, on the basis of the information provided to it by Telstra, that the radiofrequency radiation exposure levels for the proposed installation, at all locations accessible by the general public, are well below the levels set by the current Australian standard and are regarded as non-hazardous. I am advised that on the available evidence, DEST could not uphold the objections and subsequently authorised Telstra's application. Telstra has advised that further meetings were held with representatives of the Harbord kindergarten, parents and Telstra senior management to ensure concerns of the Harbord community were Risks addressed. I am advised that the ARL in August conducted tests on the radiation emissions from the Harbord facility which indicated that the level of emission was at least 239 times lower than the Australian standard. The standard itself is regularly reviewed by Standards Australia, through a consultative process involving government, industry and consumers. The purpose of this process is to ensure that the standard continues to reflect the best available international scientific advice concerning all relevant public health effects arising out of the emission of radiofrequency energy. Telstra has advised that, after a further meeting on 17 August 1995, Telstra indicated that it was unacceptable to Telstra for the Harbord Kindergarten's viability to be threatened as a result of community perceptions associated with a mobile base station. Telstra therefore suspended the base station sector adjacent to the kindergarten. Telstra has indicated that it will work with local government to find an alternative site while still meeting the communication needs of the community. (2) I am advised that the Warringah Council lodged a formal objection to the proposal and Telstra investigated alternative options which were found to be unsuitable or unavailable. Telstra referred the case to DEST as required under clause 8(5) of the Telecommunications National Code. See answer to (1). (3) Telstra advises that it consulted with the local community. Telstra was not able to proceed regardless of the objections. See answer to (1) and (2). (4) Telstra has agreed to observe the Municipal Association of Victoria's (MAV) Guidelines concerning the installation of mobile phone base station facilities. Telstra has advised that it has complied with the requirements of the Telecommunications National Code, as well as the MA V Guidelines with respect to community consultation in relation to this installation. Telstra advises that its actions included notifying the local community of its proposal through public notices, holding a series of public meetings and providing information to the community on research into the health effects of radiofrequency radiation. A copy of the Municipal Association of Victoria's Guidelines has been forwarded to the honourable member. Broadcasting Towers and Mobile Telephone Base Stations (Question No. 2498) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 29 June 1995: (1) Is he, his Department or any agency within his portfolio responsible for authorising, permitting or otherwise overseeing the installation and operation of (a) television and radio broadcast towers or (b) mobile telephone base stations; if so, does the responsibility derive, wholly or in part, from an international agreement or treaty and, if so, what are the details. (2) Have the health effects of electromagnetic radiation generated by (a) television and radio broadcast towers or (b) mobile telephone base stations been drawn to his attention or that of his Department or any agency within his portfolio; if so, what are the details. (3) Does he, his Department or any agency within his portfolio measure or monitor levels of electromagnetic radiation from (a) television and radio broadcast towers or (b) mobile telephone base stations; if so, (i) which installations are monitored, (ii) how often are they monitored and (iii) what have been the results. (4) Have electromagnetic radiation levels exceeding recognised safety standards been detected from (a) television and radio broadcast towers or (b) mobile telephone base stations; if so, (i) which installations, (ii) where are they located, (iii) what electromagnetic radiation levels were involved and (iv) what corrective action has been taken by (A) his Department, (B) agencies within his portfolio, (C) other Commonwealth agencies and (D) the installation operators. (5) Has he, his Department or any agency within his portfolio required proponents of projects to install (a) television and radio broadcast towers or (b) mobile telephone base stations to demonstrate that their proposals comply with recognised health standards relating to electromagnetic radiation before installation was permitted. (6) Will the Government require proponents of projects to install (a) television and radio broadcast towers or (b) mobile telephone base stations to demonstrate initial and continued compliance with electromagnetic radiation health standards before installation is permitted and without which the operator would be required to discontinue operations; if so, what are the details of the requirement and (b) when will it be introduced. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Based on advice from the Department of Communications and the Arts, the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA), AUSTEL, the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) and the National Transmission Agency (NT A), I am advised that: (1) General Under the provisions of the Radiocommunications Act 1992, an organisation that wi$hes to operate a broadcast or mobile phone base transmitter must be issued with a transmitter licence by the SMA. The SMA has advised that the transmitted frequencies used in Australia align with intemational spectrum arrangements agreed under the Constitution and Convention of the Intemational Telecommunication Union (ITU). Broadcasting The ABA has advised that while it is the responsibility of the individual broadcasting licensee to plan and oversee the installation of broadcasting towers and to install and operate broadcasting transmitters this must be done with regard to the Technical Planning Guidelines (TPGs) issued by the ABA. The NT A is responsible for the operation of television and radio transmission facilities, including towers and masts, to make ABC and SBS services available to the public. NTA installations are built under contract and are subject to the requirements of local planning laws. Telecommunications AUSTEL is responsible for monitoring and ensuring carrier compliance with the Telecommunications National Code (the Code). The Code provides a regime for all proposals by the telecommunications carriers Telstra, Optus and Vodafone, to carry out prescribed activities including the installation of mobile telephone base stations. Specifically, the Code spells out circumstances where carriers are automatically required to notify the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories (DEST) of their intention to engage in a particular activity. Objections raised by DEST must be resolved before the carrier can proceed. Those provisions effectively operate as a veto power. The Code also specifically provides a role for local councils to receive details of the carriers' proposed activities to enable affected communities to be consulted. If, after consultation, there is still disagreement between a carrier and a local government authority about the environmental significance of a mobile tower or similar structure, that proposal must be referred to DEST if the council so requests. Again, the carrier cannot proceed until any objections by DEST are resolved. Carriers are also required to locate towers and similar structures on existing towers or as close as practicable to an existing tower unless it is not technically feasible; is incompatible with the network configuration; or is likely to have a greater adverse effect on the environment than putting a new facility in place. If it is considered that a carrier is not fulfilling its obligations under the Code, the matter may be referred to AUSTEL, which has power under the Telecommunications Act 1991 to enforce compliance with the Code. The carriers have all agreed to guidelines complementary to the Code for local community notification and consultation. These guidelines were developed in association with the Municipal Association of Victoria. (2) General The Government is aware of a number of studies into the health effects of electromagnetic energy (EME). I am advised that a review by the International Symposium on Possible Health Effects from Radiofrequency Radiation, Auckland, New Zealand, February 1995, of emerging technical and social issues regarding health effects of radiofrequency emissions found that replicated evidence from laboratory studies did not lead to an expectation of long-term adverse health effects from radiofrequency at typical levels in the residential and occupational environment. The Symposium was attended by occupational physicians, electronic engineers, regulators and researchers from Australia, Finland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. The Symposium reviewed the most up-to-the-minute findings of various strands of research being conducted by a number of the scientists present as well as other researchers. The Government is keeping informed about EME related research taking place in Australia and overseas and acts on research findings as appropriate. A number of agencies including the Department of Communications and the Arts, AUSTEL, the SMA, the ABA, the NTA and Telstra each address EME issues in relation to their areas of responsibility and are actively monitoring developments in EME research. This is done in consultation with other agencies/organisations outside the portfolio such as the Department of Human Services and Health, the Australian Radiation Laboratory and Standards Australia. Officers of the Department of Communications and the Arts and portfolio agencies have been involved in the development and review of Australian Standard AS2772.1. AS2772.1-1990 specifies limits of exposure of the human body to radiofrequency radiation intended to avoid biological effects hazardous to the body in the frequency range 100kHz to 300GHz. The standard applies to emissions from both telecommunications and broadcasting installations. In 1994, the CSIRO was commissioned by the SMA to provide a report on the status of research on the biological effects and safety of EMR in the telecommunications frequencies. The CSIRO reported that while there is no evidence of adverse health effects from extended exposure of the public to low-level electromagnetic energy, the possibility cannot be ruled out. The CSIRO advised that research into the possibility of long-term health effects is limited and further study is needed. (3) Broadcasting The NTA has advised that it monitors the levels of EME generated by all transmission facilities under its control with information being updated whenever there is any change to transmissions from a site. The NTA complies with AS2772.1. Telecommunications Telstra has advised that in conjunction with the CSIRO Division of Applied Physics, it has typetested radiofrequency energy on a number of typical transmitter sites to verify compliance with AS2772.1. I am advised that the tests have shown that all areas outside the transmitter installation sites which are accessible to members of the general public are exposed to radiofrequency energy levels that are below the limit recommended in AS2772.1. A study ""Environmental Levels of Radio-Frequency Radiation around Cellular Mobile Telephone Base Station Installations"" was conducted by Telecom Australia Research Laboratories (Report 7956) in 1990. The study found that the levels of radiofrequency radiation produced by mobile phone base transmitters are well below the recommended exposure limits described in AS2772.1. (4) General The measurement of electromagnetic energy levels and making informed judgements about exposure levels in relation to AS2772.1 is a specialised field. I am advised that the Australian Radiation Laboratory of the Human Services and Health Portfolio conducts this type of work for agencies that do not have the necessary equipment or expertise. Broadcasting The ABA has advised that it is not aware of any case where a broadcasting service has caused transmitted energy exposure levels that exceed the levels described in AS2772.1. The NTA has advised that to ensure that its transmission facilities do not exceed accepted safety exposure levels for the general public, Commonwealth facilities are surrounded by security fencing with signs attached to alert the public to the danger of trespassing on NT A transmission sites. Telecommunications AUSTEL has advised that it is unaware of cases of electromagnetic energy from mobile telephone base stations exceeding recognised safety standards. Telstra has advised that it constructs its radiofrequency transmitter installations so that all areas outside the site which are accessible to members of the general public are exposed to levels of radiofrequency energy which are below the limits recommended for the general public in AS2772.1. Telstra has also advised that the levels of radiofrequency energy in public areas in close proximity to mobile base stations are below the recommended limits for members of the general public. (5) Broadcasting The ABA has advised that its Technical Planning Guidelines contain mandatory technical requirements to be met by all commercial and community broadcasting licensees using the broadcasting services bands. This includes compliance with AS2772.1 Telecommunications The Telecommunications National Code requires that the carriers, when carrying out a prescribed activity, including the installation of mobile base stations, comply with existing industry standards, su-:h as AS2772.1. (6) General The compliance regime currently in place puts the onus of responsibility for compliance of installations with AS2772.1 on the operators. This system of self-regulation appears to have worked satisfactorily to date, with no evidence apparent of any disregard of the standard. An amendment to the Radiocommunications Act 1992, to give the SMA the power to regulate the safe operation of radiocommunications devices, is in train. This proposed amendment, if passed, will give the SMA the power to enforce compliance with the substance of AS2772.1. Broadcasting The ""Technical Planning Parameters and Methods for Terrestrial Broadcasting"", published by the then Department of Transport and Communications in June 1992, and about to be republished by the ABA as the ""Interim Australian Broadcasting Planning Handbook"", requires that ""transmitting stations shall be sited and designed with due regard to AS2772.1"". Telecommunications As stated above, the Telecommunications National Code requires that the carriers comply with existing industry standards, such as AS2772.1. Australia Post: Mail Centre, Gwelup WA (Question No. 2539)",184
292,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 22 August 1995: (1) Has Australia Post proposed building a mail delivery centre in Gwelup, WA; if so, were residents near the proposed site consulted; if not (a) why not, (b) will Australia Post consult the residents to determine their opinion on the proposal and (c) will the residents' views be used in reconsidering the proposal. (2) Did Australia Post discuss the proposal with the City of Stirling or other authorities; if so, (a) what discussions were held and (b) with whom. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows, based on information provided by Australia Post: (1) Subject to all relevant planning approvals being granted, I am advised Australia Post is proposing to purchase a site in Wishart Street, Gwelup, WA, on which it will build a small, single-storey mail delivery centre for the delivery of mail to Scarborough, Karrinyup, North Beach and parts of Doubleview. A condition of the purchase of the site is that the owner/vendor effect a rezoning of the land to enable a small delivery centre to be built, and for the City of Stirling to permit the development of such a facility. Consultation with local residents takes place through the local government authority. The normal process of rezoning requires that authority to initiate the rezoning; advertise the proposed rezoning (including placing a sign on the site); accept comments from the public; consider those comments and then make a decision. If that decision is favourable, the proposal is then submitted-with any objections-to the Ministry of Planning for assessment and decision. (2) Australia Post, and architects and planners engaged by Australia Post, have had ongoing discussions and correspondence with the City of Stirling for the past 10 months. Optus Vision: Public Libraries Cable Network (Question No. 2546) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 22 August 1995: (1) Under the Optus Vision education commitment will all public libraries passed by the Optus Vision broadband cable network be able to connect to the network either free of charge or for a subsidised fee; if not, will the Government mandate the services as a community service obligation. (2) What other initiatives is the Government taking to include Australia's 1400 public libraries in networks of electronic information. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Optus Vision education commitment is not intended to cover the connection of public libraries to the Optus Vision broadband cable network. I am advised by Optus Vision however that while all public libraries will not be able to connect to their broadband cable network, the company is looking into the possibility of providing additional community services. The Universal Service Obligation (USO) set out in s228 of The Telecommunications Act 1991 relates only to the provision of the standard telephone service (and payphones); in particular, that the standard telephone service should be reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business. On I August 1995 I announced the Government's decisions in relation to post-1997 telecommunications policy and regulation. Those decisions do not envisage telecommunications carriers being subject to a specific community service obligation to provide public libraries with a broadband cable connection for free or for a subsidised charge. (2) The Government promised in Creative Nation to work with the States to form local access points to the information services becoming available. In particular the 1400 public library service points throughout Australia were seen as providing a major opportunity for linking communities to network services. I have established an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) on Libraries as Public Access Points. The IDC is chaired by the Department of Communications and the Arts and comprises representatives of the Departments of Employment, Education and Training; Housing and Regional Development; Social Security; and the National Library of Australia. A number of possible strategies are being discussed to enable public access to electronic information networks through libraries. The IDC will take into account the report of the Libraries Working Group of the Cultural Minister's Council, 'Bush track to Superhighway: public access to electronic information', as well as the report of the Broadband Services Expert Group (BSEG). Possible initiatives to promote access to these services are being considered and others are already under way. These include the Community Information Network, a Department of Social Security pilot program, which is providing local access points in a number of locations (including libraries) for a range of electronic information services. Broadband Cable Infrastructure (Question No. 2547) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 22 August 1995: (I) What are Telstra's plans in terms of coverage and timetabling for the roll-out of broadband cable infrastructure. (2) What is Telstra's best estimate of the proportion of Australian households to be passed by both Telstra and Optus Vision cables. (3) When will Telstra install cable through the local government areas of Liverpool and Campbelltown in Sydney. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Telstra advises that it plans to roll broadband cable past four million homes by 1999. Three million of those homes will be in the metropolitan area. (2) Telstra advises that some level of duplication is likely to occur in the early stages of network construction, given that both carriers are offering pay television services to similar customer groups. Over the long term, Telstra advises it expects that, as the carriers begin to offer a more differentiated range of products and services, the carriers are more likely to target a different range of demographic groups and the level of network duplication is likely to reduce. If duplication is not commercially desirable for the carriers, then the regulatory framework provides an appropriate interconnection regime. (3) Telstra advises that, as it is delivering cable services in a competitive environment, the release of such planning information would put Telstra at a commercial disadvantage to its competitors. Telstra therefore regrets that it is unable to provide information regarding the planned installation of cable roll-out in the local government areas of Liverpool and Campbelltown in Sydney on the grounds that it is commercial in confidence. Australian Film Commission: Film Festival Funding (Question No. 2571) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 23 August 1995: (1) For which film festivals did the Australian Film Commission provide financial assistance in 1994-95. (2) What sum did the Commission provide in each case. (3) What definition of ""regional"" does the Commission use in its objective of assisting festivals in regional centres. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Australian Film Commission (AFC) has advised that it provided the following support to the following festivals: Australian Intemational Video Festival-$25,OOO Brisbane International Film Festival-$45,OOO Festival of Jewish Cinema (loan)-$15,OOO Melboume International Film Festival-$44,800 Melbourne Super 8 Film Festival-$6,OOO St Kilda Australian Short Film Festival-$6,OOO Sydney International Film Festival-$38,400 Travelling Film Festival-$48,OOO (3) The AFC has advised that it primarily interprets ""regional"" to mean outside of the major capital cities in each State, but recognising the concentration of film resources in Sydney bourne, also includes capital cities other than Sydney and Melbourne in its concept of regional. In addition, the Commission is conscious of the changing demographics of major capital cities and intends to consider the implications of this in a Summit it is convening in October this year to consider funding policies for its Industry and Cultural Development Program, through which it provides assistance to film festivals. (Question No. 2593) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 28 August 1995: (1) What were the (a) direct and (b) indirect costs of Telecom changing its name to Telstra; and (2) Why was the sum spent on the name change not spent on providing adequate telephone services and facilities to many subscribers in rural and regional Australia. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Telstra has advised that: (1) Telstra spent some $4.2 million on the name change from Telecom to Telstra during 1994-95. Of this total, some $2.8 million related to costs associated with changes to signage on Telstra's 11,000 buildings, with the balance due to corporate marketing and product packaging activities. Telstra's name change is being phased in on a progressive basis as and when practical opportunities arise, eg as part of normal maintenance requirements for vehicles, when signage needs replacing, or as stocks of stationery are depleted. The name change should be completed by 2002. (2) The name change was considered imperative having regard to Telstra's competitive operations both in Australia and overseas. A name was required that was capable of registration as a Trade Mark and that could be used to identify the company both domestically and internationally. Many overseas telecommunications companies have the and Mel- word 'Telecom' as part of their name. Telstra advises that it is committed to providing high quality telephone services to rural and regional Australia. It is investing some $3.3 billion on the FMO (Future Mode of Operation) project over the next four years to upgrade its network to provide access for country people to a range of new services, including high speed fax and computer links, itemised billing, Electronic Funds Transfer at Telstra Point of Sale (EFTPOS) and Easycall. Telstra is also obliged under its licence conditions to provide preselection facilities, enabling automatic choice of carrier, to all consumers in Australia by 30 June 1997.",189
