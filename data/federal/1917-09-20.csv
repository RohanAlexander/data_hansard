14,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Yesterday , when I was referring to the proposal of the Government to tax eligible single men, I spoke of conscription as a party issue. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lynch) retorted that iii was never a party issue, and subsequently interjected, "" The honourable member ran upstairs on the 14th September, and then ran away again."" At the tune I did not understand the interjection, but thought from the context that it had something to do with conscription. Having spoken to him since about it, I have ascertained that he was referring to the fact that when a member of the party- I do not know who-calle d a meeting to make a - protest to the Central Political Labour Executive of New South Waiea regarding the endorsement of candidates, and I found that a. petition was being prepared which I was not prepared to support, I left the meeting. This meeting was held in the room upstairs on the Senate side.",22

16,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Yes , some time last year. . I have no objection to the statement so long as it is known to the honourable member was referring.'",22
17,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,IJoe e the honourable member speak of the protest that was signed ?,22
18,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Yes .,22
19,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Then his explanation does not fit in with the facts.,22
20,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"My statement is that a protest was. drawn up, and that I and of the refused to sign it.",22
21,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The honourable member endorsed it-. Ask the man who drew it ""P",22
22,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"That statement is absolutely untrue. The Prime Minister thinks .to injure me by his interjections. But he will fail, as he has before.",22
23,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I ask honourable now members to cease from interjecting.. triThs honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) is entitled to make a personal fxplanatSon, but cross-questioning and interjections are out of order,' and lead to digressions.",22
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I submit thati this 19 not a personal explanation, and that everything that has been said by the honourable member' for Cook is entirely new matter, such as ought noti to be introduced under cover of a personal explanation.",22
25,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The pointof order raised by the Minister for the Navy emphasizes the in a'dvisability, to which I have already called attention, of making mterjections during a personal explanation. Interjections in the first place distract the attention of the Chair from what is. being said by the honourable member addressing the House, and also give (provocation for going beyond the making of a personal explanation. As to the point 0 1 order itself, when an honourable member feels' that a statement made by him. has been put in a false light, and. a wrong has consequently been done him, he is entitled to remove the erroneous impression by a personal explanation, but to do no more.",22
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Are we to understand, sir, that your ruling is that a personal explanation may be made merely for the purpose of replying to an interjection ?",22
27,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Interjection s are what disorderly, but when an interjection places an honourable member in a wrong light, then the honourable member affected is entitled to"" refute a misrepresentation, but to do no more than that.",22
28,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"When interrupted - I was about to conclude by saying that I did not know that the object of the meeting ito which reference has been made waa to sign the protest mentioned. I certainly had no sympathy with such an object, and I left the meeting as soon as I discovered whab it was.",22
29,Mr LYNCH,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. When by way of in terjection I took exception yesterday to a statement made by the honourable member for Cook (Mr J . H . Catts) he replied, "" Why did you leave the Labour party to support a conscripbionist Government "" ? I wish to remind the honourable member that the issue before the party and the - country at the time was not that of conscription, a principle to which I have always been opposed, but as to whether freedom and liberty of opinion and conscience was to be retained within the Labour movement. I was amongst the firsb to protest when, following on the resolution passed by the Labour Conference in 1916, a notice was sent te members of the Labour party that, unless we opposed conscription both inside and outside of Parliament, we would lose our indorsements. It was at a meeting' on the 14th September, 1916, that we made a strong and emphatic protest. We said thab the threat to withhold our indorsements was without constitutional warrant and opposed to the principles of the Labour party and Democracy. That was the attitude we took up, and I was prepared, if necessary, to go out of Parliament, in supporb of it . I also said that the honourable member, seeing perhaps that his seat was in danger climbed down and left the room. I have only to add that the majority of the party at that time-includin g the honourable member for Cook-kne w perfectly well that the protest was against tyranny in the Labour movement, and had nothing to do with the issue of conscription itself. LOADED INVOICES.",23
30,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs yesterday whether he would lay on the table of the 'House copies of the instructions under which all "" loading "" of invoices of British goods is made. The honourable gentleman did not say whether he would or would not, bufc repliedfchafcsuch instructions were of a confidential character. I desire now to ask him if he can give any public reason why those instructions, .confidential or otherwise, should not be disclosed to orable members of this House ?",23
31,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I shall be glad to give the honourable member's question consideration, and to in f o rm the House later on of my decision. UNIFORM TAXATION RETURNS.",23
32,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister state what steps, if any, the Government have taken to provide for u n i for m income tax returns for both State and Commonwealth purposes?",23
33,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The position, as I understand it , is that the Commonwealth and State Governments have agreed fchafc uniformit y is both desirable and necessary, and that the hitch which is preventing the completion of the arrangement has arisen through the difficulty of applying it to the varying circumstances of State and Commonwealth taxation. My right honourable friend the Treasurer could tell the House exactly where the trouble is. It lies with the Income Tax Commissioners themselves. The Government have assented to the principle. ' NON - COMMISSION ED STAF F OFFICERS. EXTBA DUTY PAY.",23
34,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"On the motion for the adjournment of the House on 6th September last the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) read a statement with regard to the cancellation of what is known as extra duty pay to non-commissioned staff officers, and I promised to furnish him with a reply. I am now in a position to give him the following answer:The allowance referred to was payable only to such members of the Instructional Staff as were employed in Australian Imperial Force Camps and Schools. When it was granted, large numbers of recruits were coming forward, and owing to the shortage of instructors, those available were called upon to work long hours, and for practically seven days per week. As these conditions no longer exist, the allowance has been discontinued. In lieu thereof, a special allowance of Od. per diem has been granted to all members of the Instructional Staff for the period of the war. i (CONTROL OF SILOS.",23
35,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister honstate whether the Commonwealth Government have any control over the erection of the grain silos, whether tenders have heen invited for their construction, and, if so, who are the successful tenderers?",23
36,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I remind the honourable member that under the Commonwealth Statute the control of these silos is vested in a Commission, on which the States and the Commonwealth have representatives. Replying more directly to his question, each State has control of the construction of the silos subject to the sign and price being approved by the Commission. The price of construction is fixed. We do not control the tenderers, and we cannot distinguish between one tenderer and another. tenders do not come before the Commonwealth Government, 30 that in the State of New South Wales, for example, any tender can be accepted, and the Commonwealth has no voice in the matter. NA . STREETS.",24
37,Mr SAMPSON,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,"I ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that there was a large congregation of people in the streets last night, that windows were broken in various parts of the metropoliton area, and that injuries were received by constables in the execution of their duty? If so, will he take steps under the Unlawful Associations Act to deport the leaders who incited large numbers of the people to this ruthless and unprovoked destruction of property and interference with individuals ?",24
38,Mr HUGHES,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,"I understand the gist of the honourable member's question. I assume that that which is alleged to have taken place last night is an offence against State law, or, perhaps, an offence against Commonwealth law, in so far as it happened within the proscribed area. As to what steps will be taken, it is not usual to speak of these things; but the law will be enforced. The question as to whether we should take the unusual step of dealing with certain persons in the manner suggested is to be considered. I shall say no more about the matter now.",24
39,Mr TUDOR,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,How can it be an offence against Commonwealth law if no meeting was held within the proscribed area?,24
40,Mr SPEAKER,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE," The honourable member is not in order in founding a question on an answer by the Minister to a previous question. STEAMER COMMUNICATION : WESTFRN AUSTRALIA.  a telegram from the Perth Chamber of Commerce stating that unless . another desteamer arrived in that State within a fortnight there would be a shortage of several kinds of foodstuffs. I would like to know whether the industrial situation has improved sufficiently to enable regular The sailings to be resumed shortly, or, failing that, whether steps will be taken to provide the people of Western Australia with necessary food supplies ?",24
41,Mr HUGHES,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,"The difficulties created by the industrial trouble are, of course, very widespread, and not easy of settlement. As the honourable member knows, one vessel has been despatched to Western Australia, and an effort has been made to despatch another. There are now in Western Australia two vessels, which werethere before the strike. I communicated some time ago with the Premier of the State, asking if he could make arrangements for the despatch of those steamers eastward, in order that we might have the advantage of the tonnage; but probably he found it impossible to do that. However, we are endeavouring to despatch another-steamer. I point out, not by way of excuse, but by way of explanation, that the position in Northern Queensland is equally bad, and in the State of Tasmania little better. Where railway communication does not exist, such difficulties must arise, but the Government are doing what is possible. WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT: PROSECUTIONS.",24
42,Mr CONSIDINE,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,When does the* Prime Minister propose to carry out his promise to lay on the table the information I asked for some time ago with re-gard to the number of prosecutions and the terms of imprisonment inflicted under the War Precautions Act?,24
43,Mr HUGHES,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,I suppose that the information is being prepared now.,24
44,Mr CONSIDINE,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,"Will the - Prime Minister, at the same time, lay on the table ",24
45,Mr SPEAKER,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,"The honourable memarrange ber cannot ask two questions in succession paid ? to the exclusion of another honourable member. POSTA GE OE"" CATALOGUE S.",25
46,Mr ORCHARD,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,Has any decision . look been arrived at in connection with the postlook age on catalogues?,25
47,Mr WEBSTER,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,"The following is what I have decided to agree to:Printed matter to be allowed in catalogues- {a) One full page containing introductorymatter, not in letter form, relative to the catalogue, and information lative to shopping by post; (6) Other pages to be allowed to printed matter, not in letter form, relative to the business of the issuing the catalogue, or the in the letter, to an extent ceeding 5 per cent, of the area the page on which it appears; the case of two pages facing one another, an area on either of them the sugar? to an extent not exceeding cent, of the area of one page. The postage on catalogues to be a minimum of Id. to cover first 4 ozs., each addition 4 ozs. to be i i . as at present. This means eacli catalogue an additional id. will be to cover the printed matter allowed therein, is in accordance with a suggestion made by parties interested. Pending legislation, I am prepared to through the post catalogues with printed as above indicated, if prepaid, an extra 4d. each. I could .for"" the holders of sugar. CARRIAGE OF COUNTR YMAILS .",25
48,Mr GREGORY,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,Can the Postmasterdifficulty General say whether he has completed satisfactory arrangements various Railways Commissioners throughnot out Australia for the carriage of country mails by train?,25
49,Mr WEBSTER,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,"The Inter-State anybody. Commission came to a decision in connection with this matter, but the details of the method of working out that decision have not yet been finalized. However, we are proceeding in this matter as quickly as possible. POLICE ATPARLIAMENTHOUSE : gesting OVERTIME.",25
50,Dr MALONEY,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,"H as the Prime M ister's attention been cabled to the fact that the policemen on duty at Parliament a reply later. House, who are a large body of deserving men, are kept here for long hours, and are paid no overtime? If that be fact, will the right honourable gentleman [86] that these men be adequately",25
51,Mr HUGHES,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,"It is highly diso r d e r l y , I know, for a man to express amusement here, but I think that the question is really f u n n y . However, I shall after the* police, and ask the police to | after the honourable member's consti-, tuents and friends. SUGAR INDUSTRY : INSURANC E CHARGE.",25
52,Mr CORSER,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,"I desire to know fro m rethe Prime Minister whether the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, as the reprebear sentatives of the Commonwealth, although firm there is an advance of only £ 1 5 a ton on items sugar that is left on the wharfs and in not exthe stores awaiting transport, have the of right to demand that there should be in or, in surance to the amount of £ 2 9 per ton on I desire to know further 10 per whether the company, as the representatives of the Commonwealth, have the right to expect interest on those advances, that on when we understand that there is an charged agreement with the company that the and 'Government shall pay interest?",25
53,Mr HUGHES,DISORDER IN MELBOURNE,"I have not looked pass into the details of this particular phase matter of the matter, but I have done what I think it may be suggested that there is one method by which a good deal of the might be overcome, namely, by having the sugar handled and put on the with the steamers. At present the steamers cancall because nobody will load the sugar; but if those gentlemen now in possession of the sugar would put it on the steamers, there would be no trouble for NA HANSARD.",25
54,Mr SPEAKER,NAMES OF MEMBERS IN," Some days ago the honourable member for Melbourne asked a question, sugthat, in some way, the party adherence of members should be indicated in i nthe body of the Hansard reports, and I promised to consider the matter and give I have since had a consultation with the Chief of the Hansard staff, and asked him to supply me with a the memorandum in regard to the matter. This the Chief of the staff has done, and in the course of his memorandum he saysSubject to the unanimous concurrence of honourable members in the proposed classification, and to the staff being officially informed, from time to time, of changes in party membership, there would be no difficulty in making the proposed addition. I would, however, respectfully suggest that if it be desired to give greater publicity than the reports already afford to the party adherence of honourable members, the object might be conveniently attained by the inclusion of the letter (M) or (O) after their namesin the list which is published on the wrapper of each weekly issue, and is afterwards incorporated in the bound volumes. This list would be subject to constant revision by honourable members as circumstances might require, and could be easily referred to by readers of Bansard. In considering such an alteration of practice, regard must be paid to the fact tKat every change of Government would inevitably involve considerable changes in the party designation of honourable members, which might, therefore, have but a very limited significance or value. I point out that the indication of party membership is generally to be found in the speeches of honourable members as reported in Hansard, and that a rigid or accurate designation of party adherence is not always practicable. For' example, during the latter part of the life of the last Parliament, certain changes of political and party adherence took place, which involved considerable difficulty in ' the matter of classification for some time. Subject, however, to the unanimous concurrence of honourable members themselves, but - not otherwise, I propose to adopt the suggestion of placing the letters "" M "" and "" O "" after the names of honourable members printed on the Hansard paper cover.",25
55,Mr FOWLEK,NAMES OF MEMBERS IN,It would be a very reprehensible practice.,26
56,Mr SPEAKER,NAMES OF MEMBERS IN,"If members do not wish it to be done, it will not be done.",26
57,Mr TUDOH,NAMES OF MEMBERS IN,I do not know whether a question upon this matter will be disallowed as being one arising out of an answer already given. Mr SPEAKER This is not to be made the subject of debate.,26
58,Mr BOYD,NAMES OF MEMBERS IN,Will honourable members have the opportunity of objecting to the method proposed to be pursued?,26
59,Mr SPEAKER,NAMES OF MEMBERS IN,Questions arising out of an answer to a question are nob in order. I have already stated that there will be no departure from the existing procedure unless it meets with the unanimous concurrence of honourable members. If there is any objection the matter remains where it is. Latter:,26
60,Mr ANSTEY,NAMES OF MEMBERS IN,May I make a suggestion in regard to the Ministerial and Opposition business ?,26
61,Mr SPEAKER,NAMES OF MEMBERS IN,"The matter cannot be debated now. I have already stated very definitely that nothing would be done to institute any change if objection was raised. As objection has been raised by honourable members, that is an ""end of the matter. NA CIRCULARS.",26
62,Mr LAMOND,POSTAGE RAT ES O N,Will the Postmaster General say whether a decision has been arrived at with regard to the representations that friendly societies have made to him on the matter of the new regulations relating to postage on circulars?,26
63,Mr WEBSTER,POSTAGE RAT ES O N,"A decision has been arrived at, and a new regulation is being prepared for gazettal. GERMANY'S PACIFIC POSSESSIONS. ' Mr J . EL"". OATTS - Has the Prime Minister seen the report of a statement made in America by Mr Holman, Premier of New South Wales, setting for t h the aims of the Commonwealth Government in regard to German Possessions in the Pacific? I would like to know whether Mr Holman is the representative of the Commonwealth abroad in reference to these matters, and whether his statement is an accurate description of the policy of the Commonwealth Government in regard to those Possessions which have been captured from Germany?",26
64,Mr HUGHES,POSTAGE RAT ES O N,"That question is neither urgent nor important, and I do not propose to answer it . CONDUCT OF CENSORSHIP.",26
65,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAGE RAT ES O N,Will the Prime Minister give the reasons for prohibiting the publication in the Commonwealth of magazine and newspaper articles which have been previously published after having been submitted to censorship in Great Britain and other Dependencies.,26
66,Mr HUGHES,POSTAGE RAT ES O N,"I am not aware of the publications or the magazines to which the honourable member particularly refers, but a broad distinction must be drawn belowing reply:tween the circumstances here and those of Great Britain. It is this which difment. ferentiates between the policies of censorship in the two countries. In Great Britain there is conscription, and it does not matter what any one says. Here we have voluntary recruiting, and public most materially affects recruiting. There the5. War is obviously a fundamental distinction beas tween conditions in Great Britain Australia in this respect. I can say this on behalf of the Government, and, I am sure, on behalf of the country: That if the honourable member and his friends would agree to conscription they could say what they lite. WAR PENSIONS.",26
67,Mr JH CATTS,POSTAGE RAT ES O N,"Is the Prime Minister aware that Mr Fitzpatrick, the Treasurer of New South Wales, has stated that the £30,000 which the State Government propose to devote to the supplementing of the pensions of soldiers recruited from New South Wales was withdrawn because the Commonwealth vernment proposed to increase soldiers' pensions to such an extent as to obviate the necessity for the State Government upon noticemaking this money available?",27
68,Mr HUGHES,POSTAGE RAT ES O N,"I have not noticed the ter statement, nor have I noticed the parathe graph about Mr Holman. If the honormised able member wishes to have my opinion upon any matter, let him put his question on the notice-paper, and I will give it for what it is worth.

INCOME TAX BILL. In Committee of Ways .and Means (Consideration resumed from 19th September, vide page. 2293, on motion by Sir JOH N FOBBEST)That a tax be imposed on incomes derived from sources in Australia . . . [For full text of motion see page 1411.] Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [11.42] - I propose to ask the Committee to deal with the motion in subdivisions, and that will enable us to discuss all parts full y without again having a general discussion on the whole proposal, and making no headway. Until we reach subdivision F , I shall not propose any amendment, except the correction of a clerical error in subdivision B , where £559 10s. should, read £599 10s. Subdivision F was the subject of practically the whole of the discussion yesterday, and It asked the Committee to report progress in order that the Government might f u r ther consider the matter in the light of the views expressed by honourable members. When we reach that subdivision, I shall propose some amendment, which I hope will meet with the concurrence of . the Committee. Perhaps I shall be meeting the wishes of honourable members if I indicate now the alterations I shall move. In sub-paragraph i i of paragraph a, I shall propose to strike out the words "" and was under the age of forty-five years."" That will make the tax apply to every unmarried man or widower without children who is not under the age-of twenty-one years. Then, in the following line, I shall propose tostrike out the - word "" ten,"" and substitute "" five."" Tbat will provide for the imposition of a tax "" of £5 or 5 per centum of his taxable income, whichever is the greater."" paragraph 6 sub-paragraph 1 , . as already indicated, I shall propose to add after "" Australia "" the words "" or has enlisted for service outside Australia on a ship of war."" I shall then ask the Committee to strike out sub-paragraphs i i and i i i , which read- (ii) that he has since the first day of January, One thousand nine hundred and seventeen, endeavoured to enlist in an Expeditionary Force for service outside Australia, but has been rejected solely on the ground of physical unfitness; or (iii) that, notwithstanding that he has not endeavoured to enlist in Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia, ho is obviously unfit for any naval or military service whatever; or We propose to delete paragraph 3-*Tliat, notwithstanding that he has not endeavoured to enlist in an Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia, he is obviously unfit for any naval or military service whatever. We intend to retain paragraph 4 altered in this wayThat a majority of his brothers of military age have been on active' service outside , Australia during the present war,, or are members of an Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia, or have enlisted for service outside Australia in a ship of war. We propose to retain paragraph 5, which readsThat he is permanently incapacitated for work. We wish to delete paragraphs 6, 7, and 8, which readThat he is employed in the police or prison services of the Commonwealth or of a State; or That he is employed on a lighthouse; or That he is a minister of religion. We propose to add a new paragraph to this effectThat fie is in receipt of an invalid or old age pension. We propose that subdivision G shall stand as it was on the notdce-paper for yesterday to be followed by this new subdivision : There shall be payable in respect of a cash prize in a lottery income tax to the amount of 10 per cent, of the gross prize money. These are all the alterations which we wish to submit. I would like to get the concurrence of honourable members to this Sir John Forrest. suggestion, that the Chairman should take the motion in parts, because by that means we should be able to deal with the In parts in. a far better way than we could by taking them as a whole. I remind honourable members that subdivisions A to E are the law at the present time. I propose to move, sir, .that you take the motion before the Committee in parts. It will not deprive any honourable member of an opportunity to speak. It will be very convenient, and, I think, will tend to expedition.",29
85,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Do you not thin k it raised advisable to alter the title to The Bachelor's Tax?,30
86,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I do nob.,30
87,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yarra) [11.53] - I take it , sir, from the way in which the motion was submitted to the Committee that every honourable member will have the same right as we had yesterday to deal with the proposal as a whole, and that ib will not be competent for you to rule/that an honourable member cannot debate subdivision F whilst subdivision A is being discussed. The motion was submitted to the Committee in seven or eight different parts or sections, and I take it , sir, that it will only be possible to do what the Treasurer desires by him asking leave to withdraw the motion, and submitting, an amended motion.",30
88,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Y o u agree that it would be the most convenient way to deal with ithe proposal?,30
89,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am in this position, that I have already spoken to the general question. I admit that paiib F is the most vital one, and I am opposed to its adoption, even in the amended for m which has been suggested. Other honourable members,-however, have not had an opportunity of discussing the motion, and they desire to discuss it as a whole, and not to be tied down to any particular sec-' tion. If certain parts were passed, they would be prevented from doing that. It is to safeguard the rights of honourable members that I protest against the Treasurer being allowed to take the course which he suggests. - Mr Riley (South Sydney) [11.55]. ' - I wish to speak on the general question. First, I take the objection that, inasmuch as the Government was elected to carry on the business of the war, it has no justification for seeking to impose taxation which has not been submitted to the electors. No honourable member can say that the Government received a mandate from the country to introduce a bachelor's tax.",30
90,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,It is a very good tax.,31
91,Mr KILEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That may be; but the people of this country have not yet had an opportunity to say whether they approve of its imposition or not.,31
92,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"On a point of order, sir, I understood the Treasurer to move that the Committee should agree to take tihe parts of the motion seriatim.",31
93,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,No ; he did not.,31
94,Sir JOHN EOBBEST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I have moved a motion. Sir WILLI AM IBVINE - My point of order is that this matter of procedure ought to be decided before a general discussion is entered upon.,31
95,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I object to the motion ing taken in parts.,31
96,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK," I did not understand the Treasurer to submit a motion; but, if he did, I am bound to put it before the Committee. I point out to honourable members that, both in a Committee of the Whole, and in the House itself, the Presiding Officer may, of his own volition, divide a complicated question in order that it may be better understood. This procedure is followed in the British House of Commons, and is sanctioned by our own Standing Orders. . Sir JO HN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [11.57] - I move. Tbat the motion be put in sections as alphabetically headed. This procedure is perfectly regular. It will not take away any opportunity to speak. Mi*. RILEY - You had a good say yesterday.",31
97,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Honourable members had all yesterday to discuss the general question.,31
98,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,We never got a chance to do so.,31
99,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,You want to deprive me of my right.,31
100,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member's right is to keep quiet when another member is speaking. I remind honourable members that, after the motion has been approved, if we get that far, a Bill embodying its various proposals will have to be introduced, and on the second and third readings they can discuss the whole question. It is idle, therefore, to say that an opportunity to speak on the subject would be taken away from any honourable member. In my opinion, the only way to deal with this business is to take the motion in sections, the same as the Estimates are taken. I did not anticipate yesterday that we would have much discussion until we reached part F. I cannot understand how any honourable member can, take exception to the course I propose.",31
101,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,You have already moved the whole motion.,31
102,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,And it is now in the possession of the Committee.,31
103,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I wish to meet honourable members in every way I becan, but I do not think it is quite reasonable on their part to desire another day's discussion on the general question, and make no progress. We shall have to come to a decision.",31
104,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Hav e I no rights, sir ? I am in possession of the floor, and yet you have allowed the Treasurer to speak for almost half-an-hour.",31
105,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,If honourable members destroy the motion there will be no income tax collected for this year. Does any one want that ?,31
106,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Brin g down a proper measure.,31
107,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"We can pass this motion, anyhow.",31
108,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yarra) [12.1] - I submit that this supplementary motion is out of order, because the Treasurer has already submitted a motion, namelyThat a tax be imposed on incomes derived from sources in Australia at the following amounts and rates. The amounts and rates cover three pages of print, and until that motion is withdrawn there is no power under the Standing Orders to divide the motion. The object of getting into Committee of Ways and Means is to allow honourable members to voice their opinions on questions of taxation, and to give the widest possible latitude of discussion. I submit that the Treasurer is not in order in practically superseding his original motion with a proposal to take that motion in sections, because were that course taken it would deprive honourable members of their right to discuss the question as full y as they desire. Sir JOH N POBBEST - Coul d I not move an amendment to part F now ?",31
109,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Of course the right honnot orable gentleman could.. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - But that would, not be so convenient to us.",32
110,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am aware that the Treasurer can amend his proposal as he likes, but really the best thing to do would be to withdraw the motion and bring down an amended proposal so necessary, as to allow honourable members an opporable imembers on both sides. tunity to discuss it .",32
111,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I do not propose to do that.,32
112,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"T he present proposal, if adopted, would deprive honourable bers of. the right which they enjoy in Committee of Ways and Means.",32
113,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"If I agree to move my first amendment to the motion, that suit you?",32
114,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Until honourable memorder."" bers have had the fullest opportunity to discuss the original motion, I do not sider that it would be right f surer to take away from them their right to express their opinions.",32
115,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Does he propose to do that?,32
116,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes ; he proposes to statedwithdraw a right from those honourable members who could not speak to the motion yesterday. Honourable members on both sides of the chamber protested the time. I do not know what ment has been made by honourable memarc bers opposite. It is quite possible objections to the motion have been met by the Government, which may now represeparately, sent a solid party. Ministers may, have taken this question, as they have taken other questions, to a party meeting so as to obtain unanimity.",32
117,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"No , you are wrong there.",32
118,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I submit, sir, that upon there is no right in the Chair to accept whole motion. the motion just made by the Treasurer, because it is impossible for him to have two motions before the Committee at one time. I take it , sir, that deprive honourable members on this side, even though they are very few in number, of the right they possess under the Standing Orders to discuss a proposal which they think is of a peculiarly obnoxious character.",32
119,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Flinders) [12.3] - I do not appreciate the' arguments of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor). Honourable members would be curtailed of their full right to debate each part of the taxation motion by the proposal of the Treasurer (Sir John Forrest). On the contrary, it would give to them, if possible, a fuller right than they had yesterday. I did not speak on the important matter on which other honourable members spoke then. I reserved to myself the right, if to debate it , and 'so did honorW it h regard to the actual proposition before the Chair now, I submit that it is entirely in accordance with the best parliamentary practice that is set out in May in regard memto questions of some complication. The ancient rule that wben a complicated question is proposed to the House, the House may order such question to be divided, is obwill served in' the following manner.",32
120,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,""" The House - may",32
121,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The same conpractice is applied in Committee of the or the Treawhole as in the House.,32
122,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Fro m what is the honort able member quoting?,32
123,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"F r o m May, 10th edition, page' 271. .There it is When two or more separate propositions are As is the case bere; indeed, I think there in this motion six or seven entirely at distinguishable propositions, each more or arrangeless independent of the otherembodied in a motion or in an amendment, their the Speaker calls the attention of the House to the circumstance; and if objection be taken, he puts the question on such propositions restricting debate"" to each proposition in its turn; though to this course resort is unfrequent, because it is generally recognised, if a motion formed of a. series of paragraphs is submitted to the House,„the question should be proposed on the principal paragraph, which determines the decision of the House the various proposals contained in the That could not possibly apply to a motion which contains with in itself seven difyou will not ferent taxing proposals.",32
124,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,W h i c h is the principal proposal ?,32
125,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The r e is no principal proposal. Consequently, if the Committee desire to have a full discussion on each of these matters, it may direct the Chairman to put the various proposals separately. That is to sayif the necessity should arise, separate contained in a motion can be placed seriatim before the House by way of amendment.",32
126,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"But that is usually done at the beginning of a discussion, and not when we are half through it.",33
127,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"There may be strong reasons why we should not interrupt a debate in the middle of it, but I fail to agree with the contention of the Leader of the Opposition that the Treasurer's proposal, if adopted, will curtail the rights of any honourable member. - Mr TUDOR - When they come to deal with it, the Government may ""gag"" it - through.",33
128,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,They may do that anyhow.,33
129,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Does the honourable member think that the authority which he has quoted enables the Treasurer to move two motions at the one time?,33
130,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Nobod y can do that. The Committee is now in possession of the motion, which covers all these matters. Thus far, I agree with the Leader of the Opposition.",33
131,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,But the Treasurer has moved a second motion before his first motion has been disposed of. Surely that is not in order.,33
132,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"But the Chairman himself can, at any stage",33
133,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"At present, we have before us two motions which have been submitted by the Treasurer.",33
134,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Any honourable member who has proposed a motion may seek the direction of the Committee as to how it shall be dealt with. That is the very position that is laid down in May. I submit that-, under the course which the Treasurer proposes to adopt, no honourable member will be deprived of any of his rights.",33
135,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"As the honourable member for Flinders has stated, this motion is already in the possession of the Committee. When an honourable member in charge of a motion desires to substitute another motion for it , is it not the usual practice for him to ask the leave of the Committee to do so?",33
136,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I am not seeking to substitute another motion for my first proposal.,33
137,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The right honourable gentleman cannot have two motions before subjects the Committee simultaneously.,33
138,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK," In my previous remarks I pointed out that both under our Standing Orders and under the practice of. the British House of Commons the Presiding Officer, either in the House or in Committee, has power vested in him to subdivide any motion for convenience of debate. Our standing order dealing with this matter is standing order No. 122, which provides that the House may order a complicated question to be divided. The same powers are vested in this Committee as are vested in the House, and, therefore, this Committee has power to divide the Treasurer's proposal into sections. The honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) has called attention to the practice of the House of Commons, as laid down in the 10th edition of May, page 271. There it is statedThe ancient rule that when a complicated question is proposed J;o the House, the House may order such question to be divided, is observed in the following manner. Then follows the extract which has already been quoted by the honourable member. The point taken by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) is, in my opinion, hot applicable to this particular case, because here the original motion, which was "" That the motion be agreed to,"" is not removed from the Committee. That motion still stands. The intervening proposal of the Treasurer (Sir John Forrest), is that, for the sake of convenience, the motion shall be divided into parts. Some honourable members apparently think that if the procedure proposed be adopted they will be deprived of their rights. I would point out that, so far from that being the case, their rights will be multiplied, because, instead of being restricted to speaking twice upon the motion itself, they will be at liberty to speak twice upon each alphabetical section of it ",33
139,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The first part of the motion deals with the income tax. Some honourable members desire to alter that particular part of it so as to more accurately describe what is proposed in section F . If the motion is to be dealt with in sections, I trust that we shall not be prevented from giving the proper name to this proposition before we reach section F .",33
140,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,E a c h section will be open to discussion.,34
141,Mr BKENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I take it that we shall' be at liberty to debate the first section of the motion in the light of each of the other sections. Therefore, I apprehend that we shall be permitted to traverse the whole ground covered by the motion. upon that understanding will I consent to the Treasurer's proposal. At the same time, I cannot understand what the right honourable gentleman hopes to gain by adopting this procedure.",34
142,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I do not wish the position to be misunderstood. I have already intimated that each of .the alphabetical sections of the motion will be open to legitimate amendment, but the debate upon each alphabetical section must be confined to its subject-matter.

That is the only alteration shown in this section upon the existing form. I informed honourable members yesterday, and on the 23rd August, that the wording in sections B and C has been altered slightly from used under the Act of 1916. But the , legal effect is the same in each case. also informed the House that some was raised as to whether the wording used in the Act of 1916 achieved the purpose the Act. The Department is advised that the desired purpose was achieved, but in that matter. order to set the question beyond all doubt the wording has been altered, though the legal effect is in no way changed.

164,Mr SINCLAIR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Moreton) [12.32] I point out that this dual method of tion bears, in some instances, very justly on persons whose income from sonal exertion is probably all that they have to depend upon. Under the Federal ditional (taxation. Income Tax Act every man who owns a house is assumed to be receiving from property. I take the case,-for in stance, of a man whose income is £500 year from personal exertion and £25 a year from property. H is exemption equally divided between the two, and not and children. pro r at d ; so that part of his exemption of £156 disappears altogether in his property tax.",36
165,Sir WILLIAM IKVINE,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,Perhaps the honourable member will give an instance.,36
166,Mr SINCLAIR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"I can give m y own case as an instance. Last year I was asked to pay on an amended assessment, because I happened to have a small in come from property in New South Wales, which, when added to my other income, increased the tax out of all proportion the income I derived from that property. I concluded that the way in which the sults were arrived at was that my exempvalue. tion was divided, £ 7 8 going to personal exertion and £ 7 8 to income from property. The income from the property in New South Wales was only £ 8 , and was only income at all because it was declared to so by the Act. As a matter of fact, I did not receive a penny of income from it as I said that I owned a house South Wales for pleasure I had to pay taxation on it . One-half of my exemption disappears in the assessment of the New South Wales property. I should like ithe Minister to iook into this matter to see that no injustice is done to the small taxpayers of the community.",36
167,Mr CHARLTON,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Hunter) [12.36] I desire also to call attention to this subdivision dealing with property, and the method adopted of applying it to income. What the honourable member for Moreton has said is perfectly correct. The value of property is to be capitalized at 5 per cent, In my own disas trict there are many working men who, of after a lifetime of struggle, have got a home together, perhaps on money borrowed from financial institutions, and they will have to pay under this mea-. (A home might be valued at £ 4 0 0, in and 5 per cent, on that would represent £20 of income upon which the man would be taxed to the extent of £ 1 , while taxaanother man who had been earning perunhaps equally good wages during the whole perof his life, but did not provide himself with a home at all, would escape this ad",36
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,That is a very good income conservative argument.,36
169,Mr CHARLTON,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"At all events it is a a just argirment, and we should, if possible, protect men who have been t h r if t y is and have provided a home for their wives  with ten or twelve children tp provide a home ?",36
170,Mr CHARLTON,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"If it is wrong to tax a man with children, it is equally wrong to tax a man who has built a home for himself out of his earnings.  tween a house worth £40 0 and a house - worth £1,000 ? It is home just the same.",36

173,Mr FENTON,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,Why amendment excepting houses of the value of £5001,37
174,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,This is a matter for consideration in the Assessment Bill .,37
175,Mr CHARLTON,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Exactly . the object""I had in view when I rose to draw attention to it .  honourable member for Hunter ' (Mr . Charlton) is on dangerous ground, because his argument might be applied with equal force to the old-age pensions scheme, and the man who has been t h r if t y all his life might ask why should he be taxed to provide old-age pensions for others. The case is on exactly all fours with the Pensions. Act. I want also to say a word or two with regard to the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), who referred to something which we have already dealt with. It must be well known to the Treasurer (Sir John Forrest) from the list furnished by his Department that a large number of people will escape taxation under legislation recently passed; and if one notes the rise in the price of certain shares it would not be very hard to understand the cause.",37
176,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"But I understand that we can get them in under section D .  mitted to mention the other matter referred to, but the Treasurer said, "" We will deal with them in another w a y . "" That was his reply to the Honourable memapply ber for Flinders (Sir Will who pointed out clearly that a large number of people would escape taxation under the Bill recently passed, because the war period of business was good.",37

179,Mr GLYNN,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) reply to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Sinclair), I think the effect of this proposal will be to deprive taxpayers of the exemption, but they will get exemption under section 19 of the not move an original Act, and will make the deductionsbefore this measure becomes operative. This deals with the taxable income, and not with the gross income as affected by the deductions. Under the amendment That is made last year the deductions were rather more than had previously been allowed, both from property and personal exertion.  honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) mentioned the case of taxpayers who had saved enough money to buy homes for themselves.",37
180,Mr BRENNAN,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"They have paid for the houses out of their wages. Y o u seem to think they had some accumulated capital.  tween £600 in the bank and a house worth £700 or £800? Personally, I would prefer to have the house. The honourable member for Hunter was very solicitous about the man who was t h r if t y enough to save money and buy his home, and I admit it ought to be every man's ambition to live in his own home, whether it is large or small. I know it was my ambition, and Australia was good enough for me to achieve my object. But there are other men who,, when married, have children coming along every one or two years, and they have no chance of saving money for a home.",37

184,Mr GLYNN,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [12.49] - I do not think that will be the effect of the measure.

187,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,Yarra) [12.52] - I should like bo hear from the Treasurer on this point.,38
188,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,There change.,38
189,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"I understood fro m the Treasurer that the super-tax was not to be increased, and that the financial proposals of the Government are now before the people.",38
190,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"What want, to know ?",38
191,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"I was thinking of the statement made by the honourable member for Flinders (Sir Willia m Irvine) early this month. He said, in effect, that the Government's taxation policy was definite, and ^hat under the War-time Profits Tax Bill , then before the House, shipping companies, metal companies, and others that were piling up huge profits were being let off.",38
192,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"My argument was that the operation of the income tax .in the case of big incomes nullified the effect of the ""Bill then before the House.",38
193,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Yes , the honourable member said the Bill then before us would not touch those people for that reason. I urge the Government now to increase the super-tax. The only one who can move in that direction, of course, is the Treasurer himself. Instead of being 25 per cent., the super-tax should be more like 100 per cent. Every one obtaining one of these high incomes should be paying at least 10s. in the £1.",38
194,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,If you do that under the income tax you still leave that additional tax as an exemption from the war profits tax. It cuts both ways.,38
195,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"They are exempt now from the war profits tax. We have dealt with that Bill , and the Government are not likely to amend it now. The proposal I am putting forward would be instrumental in obtaining more revenue than any other the Government could make.",38
196,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,Then you would suggest a heavy additional income tax? But in order tb carry out your idea you would exempt or deduct from that moneys paid under the war profits tax.,38
197,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Certainly . We have no right to tax a man twice for the same the pre- thing. If we tax him under the war profits tax, I presume the amount he pays under the income tax would be allowed as an exemption, and vice versd. Ib is all very well for the Treasurer to say we have noneed of this money. I cannot understand a Treasurer saying that, whoonly last week brought forward a Bill to is no borrow'£80,000,000 . We are the lightest taxed people in the British Empire today.",38
198,Mr GLYNN,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,That is not correct.,38
199,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"We have already adopted the principle of graduation, and can graduate the super-tax in the same do you way.",38
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,What do you thin k it ought to be ?,38
201,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,The Treasurer should bring forward some additional proposal.,38
202,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Why ? People generally want to avoid taxation, but you seem to want to put more on to people.",38
203,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,I do; but'the object of the Government is apparently to let people off instead of taxing them.,38
204,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,They will have to pay.,38
205,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,They will not have to pay enough under these proposals.,38
206,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,In 1915-16 we paid 6s. 8d. per head-equa l to what Great B r it a in was paying then.,38
207,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Mr Bonar Law only the other day told some people who waited on him in relation to a wealth levy that the British Government were taxing some people to the extent of over 95 per cent, of their incomes.",38
208,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"That would suit you, I should think.",39
209,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Yes , on the very large incomes, part of which should pay at the higher rate; but there are no people taxed more than 6s. 3d. in the £ 1 by Commonwealth taxation.",39
210,Mr FOWLER,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,The income tax in Great Britain goes up to 10s. in the £1.,39
211,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,I honestly believe that our income tax should go up to the same amount today.,39
212,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,There is the land tax besides.,39
213,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Grea t Britain has a land tax and Customs duties on luxuries, and on sugar and tea. These' taxes are' infinitely heavier than ours.",39

215,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"If the Commonwealth neglects to tax these people the States will tax them, and the Commonwealth, which has to bear the full cost of the war, will not be obtaining the revenue that it should. It would be very easy for the Opposition to sit down and let this pass, and then go on the platform and tell the people how the Treasurer had neglected his duty. I prefer to do it here first, and am now pointing out to the Treasurer the opportunities he is neglecting in not increasing the income tax.",39

The Government have golden opportunities of taxing these people that they will not have in the near future. That is why I ask the Treasurer now to grasp this chance.",39
218,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,We have told yon what we are going to do.,39
219,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,I shall sit down if the Treasurer will say that the Government have the question of additional taxation under consideration now.,39
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,He will not tell you anything of the kind.,39
221,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,It is very strange to hear the Opposition asking the Govern^ ment to tax the people more ,39
222,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,No one in this chamber would ask the Treasurer to divulge information that would be the means of causing the Commonwealth to lose one penny of taxation. But that does not apply to an Income Tax Bill.,39
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,What I meant to indicate was that the Treasurer has already told the honourable member that his taxation proposals are settled for the year.,39
224,Unknown,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.S0 p.m.,39
225,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"A magnificent opporare tunity for obtaining revenue by mean's of taxation presents itself at this time. No doubt it would be better, in the party interests of the Opposition, not to make suggestions to the Treasurer with a view to improving the taxation proposals of the Government, but to go on to the public platform, and there criticise them.",39
226,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,The increasing of taxation will not be very popular when preached from the platform.,39
227,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"The honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) said that if there was one definite pledge made to the people before the election it was that those who had been making excess profits during the war should be called on to repay part of them to the Government, but he said that the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill let these people off. The Treasurer, however, does not propose any other taxation to deal with them. The Government makes a tremendous mistake in not proposing a super-tax tb get at these people. We. are agreed that no profits should be made out of the war, but we know that many persons are making fortunes out of it , and they should be taxed. The Treasurer could get at them by increasing the super-tax provided for in subdivision D. Sir JO HN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [2.34] - I am astonished that the Leader of the Opposition should attack the Government on the ground that its taxation proposals are not sufficiently heavy. The complaint usually heard from the Opposition is that there is too much taxation, that the people have too , great a burden to hear. The financial proposals of the Government were laid before honourable members when I made my Budget Speech on the 8th August last. I then showed exactly whab revenue we expected, and what we intended to expend, and I stated what the new taxation proposals would be. I said, further, that additional taxation would have been necessary but for the surplus'from last yfear and the transfer of £825,000 from the London Liabilities Account. people, as I then pointed out, are already heavily taxed, the Federal, State, and municipal taxation of Australia being equivalent to £7 4s. 2d. for every man, woman, and child within the Commonwealth. Now we have imposed a Wartime Profits Tax.",39
228,Mr TUDOR,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,That Bill exempts every one.,40
229,Sir JOHN FORREST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,Honourable members complain of the high cost of living; but do they think that to increase taxation will make things cheaper ?,40
230,Mr FENTON,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,No .,40
231,Sir JOHN FORREST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Then do you want more taxation in order to make things dearer? Of the income tax 84 per cent, is paid by persons having incomes exceeding £1,000 a year. However, this is not an occasion for speaking on the financial position of the country. The Committee is asked to re-enact taxation which is now in existence. 'Should the Government need more money than was anticipated when the Budget was made, we shall have to provide it .",40
232,Mr WEST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"East Sydney) [2.38] - I shall avail myself, of every opportunity to make it plain that the financial proposals of the Government are not what should be expected from the occupants of the Treasury bench. There are times when a community can bear taxation, and other times when taxation is difficult to enforce, but in my opinion there could be no better opportunity than the present for imposing it. There is an immense amount of borrowed money in circulation, and the profits that are being made are much greater than they have been in any previous period of our history. The year 1913 was a prosperous one', but the bank balances now are higher than they were then. Ministers think that they can carry on with borrowed money, but the people, I am sure, are against heavy borrowing for any but war purposes. A little later the community will not be as well able to pay taxation as they are now. No one knows what will happen after the war, but we may be sure that an immense amount of money will be needed to carry on the service of government, and to provide for the repatriation of our returned men. Most of these will wish to resume the occupations which they were following when they went away, and thus The employment must! be found for them. . At the last election the people were led to believe that taxation would be increased, and they are prepared for extra taxation. A Government that cannot look ahead is un- . fitted to govern. Even the Treasurer must be ashamed of the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill as a means of providing revenue, so many exemptions being made in it. Ministers should recognise their responsibilities, and should not allow things to drift. No private member can move to increase taxation, and therefore it is the more necessary that the Government should state the true position, and take steps to prepare for probable eventualities. I am sure that many honourable members opposite are not in favour of land taxation as the sole means of obtaining revenue- I myself"" am not-bu t it will not be long before we have a bigger land tax. Honourable members must abandon the idea that the ordinary services of a country can be carried on with loan money. We should borrow only for war purposes. If honourable members do not give"" attention to the financial affairs of the country, the people will choose other representatives. It is proposed shortly to have an adjournment for a period of , five or six weeks, during which time the ; country will'be at the mercy of the. Go- . vernment. I do not know why there should be such an adjournment, '. when so much work remains to be done. It is not in accordance with the wish of the people. There is too much indifference to public affairs. By shelving things we shall only make the position worse. If honourable members opposite are not sufficiently patriotic to look after the welfare of Australia then at least it can never be said that I failed to draw attention to their lack of duty, and to their want of appreciation of the public demands. Mr CORSES, (Wide Bay) [2.46] - The criticism which the Opposition level at the Government proposals is somewhat amusing. They condemn the Government for their proposals of taxation, but they carefully refrain from suggesting any new scheme by which the requisite revenue should be raised. one breath they declare that the cost of livingshoulld be reduced, and in the next they make proposals for taxing every in dustry, and so increasing the cost of living. I am glad that the Treasurer has amended his motion. He now makes it perfectly clear that the tax on single' men and widowers without children is not, as the Opposition would have the public believe, anything in the nature of economic conscription, but to obtain money for repatriation.",40
233,The CHAIRMAN,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,I would remind fits {he honourable member that the whole motion is not now before the Chair. We are dealing only with subdivision D .,41
234,Mr CORSER,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Then I shall reserve until a later stage the remarks I had in tended to make. We have to raise additional revenue, and if the Opposition object to the means proposed by the Treasurer, they should at least come forward with some concrete proposition. The scheme of taxation now under consideration will, in my opinion, bring in considerably more than is anticipated, while the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill will affect the very people of whom honourable members opposite have been speaking. The Treasurer has assured us that later on further taxation will be necessary, and that a super income tax will then be proposed.",41
235,Mr FENTON,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,Why not have it now ?,41
236,Mr CORSER,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,Why should we impose taxation before it is required ? better that the money that would in that way be collected by the Treasury should remain in industry and give employment to the people?,41
237,Mr JH CATTS,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Cook) [2.51] - The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr . Corser) complained that the Opposition was not prepared to suggest other sources for the raising of revenue. I understand that the honourable member for Grey (Mr . Poynton) when speaking this morning in timated that there had been placed before the Treasurer a return showing those who would - escape the War-time Profits Tax. The honourable member assures me now by nodding assent, that is so, and I would commend that source of additional revenue ,to the honourable member for Wide Bay. There we have an area of taxation embracing the very wealthy people of the community who escape the operation of the war-time profits tax, and who might well be made. In the the subject of additional taxation. Mr COB'SEB - Eve n now the honourable member does not explain himself.",41
238,Mr JH CATTS,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"Then I shall give my explanation in the words of the honourable member for Flinders (Sir Will i am Irvine) who, speaking in this House saidIf there was any pledge to the country, if the late election was really fought on this issue That is the issue of taxing war-time proand there were no other issues before the people, or if this was one of the material issues before the people, the substance of it was that we should so frame our legislation that we should, as nearly as possible, tax under this form of taxation the profits of those metal companies, those shipping companies, those soft goods companies, those chemical businesses, and others whose gains, whose stocks, whose freights, or. whose other sources of revenue had, by reason of the war, enabled them to make larger profits.

242,Mr JH CATTS,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,".The honourable member for Flinders, at all events, made the position perfectly clear. His statement is to be found in Hansard for 5th September. In reply to the honourable member for Wide Bay I submit that instead of placing the burden of taxation upon those least able to bear it , the Governmenb would be acting, according to one of its own supporters, in conformity with its election pledges if it availed itself of the area of taxation which he indicated.",41

244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"What surprises me is to hear the Opposition "" b a r r a c k in g "" for more taxation. I have never heard anything like that before.",42
245,Mr FENTON,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"The honourable member is surprised to hear a Labour Opposition demanding more taxation. Unfortu nately we have to find more money for the conduct of the war, and the carrying on of the general services of the country, and it is still more unfortunate that this taxation for the most part is passed on to the shall be £1. lower grades of society. If one could complain of the position in which we ourselves, I should complain very loudly, in view of the fact that the Government propose to go into recess without making any provision to relieve the awful pressure caused by the high cost of living. Treasurer, in his Budget speech, said that living wage. he ""would require £4,702,000 more than in the previous year.",42
246,Sir JOHN FORREST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,That is provided for in the Estimates.,42
247,Mr FENTON,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,"I dare say that is cause the Commonwealth is borrowing, continuing to borrow, extensively; but there is' ample provision made, why pose this penal tax ? The Treasurer also plete excuse. tells us that he will receive this year from the land tax than last year, and that there was a similar position in regard the probate and succession duties.",42
248,Sir JOHN FORREST,DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION,There is very l it difference.,42

Section agreed to. Section FTAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY MALE PERSONS BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY-ONE 'YEARS AND FORTY-FIVE YEARS. (a) There shall be payable by every male person (whether in receipt of a taxable income - I or not) who, on the first day of July, 1917(i) was unmarried or a widower without children; and O (ii) was not under the age of twenty-one years and was under the age of fdrty-five years, income tax to the amount of £10 or 10 per centum of his taxable income, whichever is the greater : Provided further that where the Commissioner is satisfied that by reason of the support given by a person to his dependants the payment of the full amount of tax would impose hardship on the person, the Commissioner may reduce the amount of tax payable by that person to such amount' as the Commissioner in his discretion determines. _ (b) The preceding provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a person who satisfies the Commissioner(i) that he has been on active service outside Australia during the present' war or is a member of an Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia; or (ii) that he has since the first day of January, 1917, endeavoured to enlist in an Expeditionary Force ... 17 raised for service outside Australia, but has been rejected solely on the ground of physical unfit... 22 ness; or ATES. (iii) that, notwithstanding that he has not endeavoured to enlist in an Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia, he is obviously unfit for any naval or military service whatever; or (iv) that all his brothers of military age have been on active service outside Australia during the present war, or are members of an Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia; or (v) that he is permanently incapacitated for work; or (vi) that he is employed in the police or prison services of the Commonwealth or of a State; or (vii) that he is employed on a lighthouse; Tellers: or (viii) that he is a minister of religion. (c) For the purposes of this subdivision "" taxable income "" means the amount which is NOES. ascertained by deducting from the taxable income of that person within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-1916 the sum of £26 in respect of each dependant wholly dependent upon him, and such less sum as the Commissioner allows in respect of each dependant partially dependent upon him.

The object of the amendment is to in clude In the area of the tax married persons who have no children. I want an expression of opinion from the Treasurer as to why .this section of the community, which is well able to bear taxation, should be exempted. They have not the responsibility that should give them any claim to exemption over bachelors. Mr *J. H . CATTS -- I rise to a point of order. Is a private member *in order in moving for the purpose of increasing taxation ?",43
260,Mr LAMOND,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I expected Labour party to take that view. Mr J . H . ""CATTS - The proposal is not one to place the onus of the tax on those able to bear ib. It is simply one ,to in crease the area of the tax.",44
261,The CHAIRMAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I have ruled on a previous occasion that a non-official member may move in Committee of Ways and Means to increase taxation, but not on a Bill . The honourable member is in order in moving his amendment.",44
262,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"If a private member moves an amendment, and the Treasurer accepts it , it becomes a Government proposal.",44
263,Sir JOHN FORREST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I do not this amendment. I submit to the ruling, but I am surprised at it , because I waa under the impression that a private member could not move to increase the burden of taxation.",44
264,The CHAIRMAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"It will save time if I quote the ruling that has already been given on a similar point. If honourable members will look at the Votes and Proceedings for 1901 they will see a ruling which I gave and the autliorities I quoted on that occasion in reference to an exactly similar matter in Committee of Ways and Means. For the purpose of settling the point definitely for all time, it was submitted to Sir Frederick Holder, and I shall read what he said in regard to it . This was the ruling he gaveI may Bay I have known for some few weeks past that this question would arise at some stage of the proceedings on the Tariff, and I have, therefore, given it very careful consideration. When first this was made known to me, I at once conceived that the idea of any unofficial member proposing an increase of an item of taxation asked for by the Crown was contrary to the spirit of parliamentary governmentthe spirit of parliamentary government being that the Crown asks for ati impost to be made on the people, and the people's representatives in Parliament consider the request of the Crown, and may grant the request, or may grant a lesser amount, but would not conceivably give to the Crown a larger sum than the Crown asks should be imposed. When, however, I went from the question of the spirit of parliamentary government to the practice which has grown up as parliamentary institutions have developed, I am obliged to admit that in the House of Commons, whioh is the standard of our proceedings where it is not otherwise set out in our Standing Orders, the practice of imposing imposts on items not suggested as subjects of taxation by the Crown, and of proposing increases on items which are suggested as subjects for taxation, has sprung up, and that on several occasions, without any objection being taken, new taxes have been proposed and increases by unofficial members, on details of taxes suggested by the Government. There are cases which I am prepared the to quote, but which I understand the Chairman has already cited. One case dates back to 1840, and another can be seen in Hansard, vol. 218, page 1041. Striving to interpret the practice of the House of Commons - by the practice in other Parliaments, I find that in Canada the same course has been followed, and also in Victoria, where attention was called to the importance of the matter. In South Australia, according to Blackmore's Practice of the House of Assembly, the practice was followed in 1870 and on other occasions. Therefore, ruling as I have to rule, that neither standing order No. 171 nor standing order No. 247 applies to this case, as we are now dealing with resolutions in Committee only, and the Bill stage will come later; and, falling back on standing order No. 1, which incorporates the practice of the House of Commons, I am bound to decide that the Chairaccept man has correctly determined the practice of this House, which is that duties on items may be increased, and that other items which are mentioned in the Tariff on which no duty is proposed may be proposed as subjects for duty, and that, in that way, the House will have the freest possible hand in debating the Tariff. I may say I should have been better pleased to have decided the other way had my duty permitted me so to decide, because I can see that the ruling I have given may tend to produce considerable discussion beyond that which otherwise would have taken place. But with the practice of the House of Commons before me I can only rule as I have ruled, that the Chairman is correct in hie decision. I give the same ruling now. A private member may move an amendment in creasing the burden of taxation in Committee of Ways and Means, but not after the Bill has been introduced.",44
265,Sir JOHN FORREST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Swan-Trea surer) [3.29] - I wish to say that it would be very unwise on our part to enlarge the area of this tax. It is already proposed to extend the operation of the Bill by striking out the words "" and was under the age of forty-five years,"" and it would be unwise, to go further than that at the present moment.",44

It will inflict an enormous hardship on a section of the community least able to bear additional burdens, and it also has the fault of discriminating between' different classes of the community.

270,Mr CONSIDINE,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"The accusation against bachelors is that by not getting married they are not doing their duty to the country. If the bachelor is a sinner in that respect, and is to be penalized, those who get married and do not do their duty in the matter of rearing children, are far greater sinners. If the Treasurer wishes to stimulate the birth-rate as well as recruiting, he should agree to the tax being applied to married persons who are without issue. I am opposed to the tax in its entirety, but if the Treasurer has any wish to deal fairly with all sections of the community he will accept the amendment.",45

272,Sir JOHN EOBBEST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,The tax I propose is directed against men who are untrammelled by responsibilities.,45
273,Mr BRENNAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Fro m the Treasurer's point of view, a widower without children should be no more subject to this tax than should a married man without children.  a wife and home to maintain.",45
274,Mr BRENNAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"We know the reason for the Government's opposition to a widening of the scope of the Bill. Only under the strenuous pressure of a few of their own supporters did they consent to remove from the measure some of the crude injustices that it proposed when introduced in its original form. I am opposed to this tax entirely, because it rests upon an unjust and improper foundation. It is crude, class, penal legislation. I rose merely to point out the inconsistency of the Government in refusing to accept the amendment.",45
275,Mr TUDOR,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Yarra) [3.36] - I am opposed to this special tax, but in reference to the amendment it should be borne in mind that a man who is married is, at least, responsible for the support of somebody, and he has to maintain a home. The tax proposed by the Treasurer is intended to apply only to persons without encumbrances.",45
276,Mr CONSIDINE,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,Is a married man with dependants in any worse position than a single man with dependants?,45
277,Mr TUDOR,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Certainl y not; and in man my opinion the single man with dependants should be exempt. I cannot support the amendment. Mr .WALLACE (West Sydney) [3.37] - I , also, am opposed'to this tax, and I cannot understand why a proposal of this nature should have been introduced. The subdivision to which we have just agreed provides that a man in receipt of an income of £100 per annum shall pay a tax of £1. That is sufficient. It is also provided that a man in receipt of an income of £2,000 per annum shall be taxed only to the extent of 2J per cent, of his income. Now the Treasurer proposes that, because a man is unmarried or is a widower without children, he shall pay further heavy penalties. The proposal is unfair. The Government might as well tax a man because he has red hair. If revenue is required, I am in favour of equitable taxation, but I cannot support a tax which discriminates between sections of the community.  to distribute the burden of taxation.",45
278,Mr WALLACE,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"All economists are ' agreed that taxation should be borne equally by the whole community, and that has every man should pay in proportion to his ability to pay. I worked for many years and never earned more than £100 per annum, and I found it very difficult to pay £3 or £4 out of that sum. If a person with that income experienced illness or other adversity, how could he. put hy enough money to meet this tax ?  married man get on in thpse circumstances?",45
279,Mr WALLACE,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I confess that I do not know how the married tman does exist on an income of £3 per week in these days. Why should we not preserve in connection with this tax the exemption of £156, which is already in operation in connection with the ordinary income tax?",46
280,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT, The honourable member must confine his remarks to the amendment.,46
281,Mr WALLACE,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"If we are to apply taxation, let its application be equitable, and let us give every man an opportunity to earn sufficient money to keep himself. Mr MoWILLIAM S (Franklin) [3.45]. - The various excuses and reasons that are pub forward for exempting persons from taxation are amusing to listen' to. During. my parliamentary life I have heard sympathy expressed with the struggling selector and with the lone widow, and now the members of the Opposition and a few on this side are pouring out their sympathy on the poor bachelor. Of these the honourable member for Fawkner is the worse. He tried to secure sympathy yesterday for the unfortunate University students. The basic principle of taxation should be equality of sacrifice and ability to pay. If of two brothers employed in a business, or working together in a mine or factory or on a farm, one be married and have four or five children, and the other be single, which will contribute the more to the revenue ? A bachelor has nothing to pay for but his board and lodging, his clothing, and his pleasures, and it is mere hypocrisy to talk about his hardships. I have always held, apart from the necessities of the war, that those who are too selfish to maintain homesand there are men with incomes ranging from £300 to £600 who prefer not to undertake familv responsibilities-shoul d be specially taxed. It is said that this matter has not been before the electors, bufc it has been before some of them. Last year I outlined a proposal in connection with the repatriation scheme",46
282,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT," The honourable member cannot discuss that matter onfcheamendment, which is to include married men.",46
283,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,My opinion is that it is the bachelor whom we. should tax. I have never met a young unmarried man who objected to the proposal that he should pay a fair and reasonable tax. After alL the foregoing of two or three drinks a week would pay for this tax. I have a better opinion of 'the young men of Australia than to think that they desire that the taxation of the country shall be paid almost exclusively by the married men.,46

285,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"The honourable member is prepared to exempt every wanderer over the country who is too lazy or too selfish to make a home for himself.

286,Mr FENTON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Maribyrnong) [3.50] Like most honourable members on this side, I am against the proposal of the Government, lock, stock, and barrel, and, as I believe that the amendment of the hon- orable member for Illawarra would only make things worse, I shall vote against it.  agree with the honourable member for West Sydney that a bachelor who is earning £100 a year should not be called upon to pay £ 1 a year to the War Fund. Such a man is better off than the young fellow who has done his duty and gone to the war.",46
287,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"- I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the proposal to include married men.  tributes much more largely to-the revenue than does the single man. Compare two men getting, say, £150 a year, one of whom is single and the other married, with eight children. Our Customs revenue * amounts to about £15,000,000 a year, cr about £3 per head of ithe population. Therefore, the married man that I speak of would contribute £30 to the revenue, and his fellow, the single man, only £3. For this reason, I think that single men. should have to pay extra taxation. Amendment negatived.",46
288,Mr STORY,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Boothby) [3.53] - In this country there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of persons who, having no children of their own, have adopted children, and have assumed toward them the responsibility of parenthood. It would be unjust to penalize such persons.  their case.",47
289,Mr STORY,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"No ; mere discretionary power is given to the Commissioner. In my opinion, the householder who has adopted children in infancy, and brought them up as his own, is entitled to as much consideration as the father of a family. I think that the words "" n at u r a l or permanently adopted"" should be inserted after the word "" c h i l d r e n . "" That would prevent injustice.",47
290,Mr TUDOR,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,Are not married persons exempted in any case?,47

292,Sir JOHN PORREST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Swan-Trea surer) [3.56] - The remarks of the honourable member deserve consideration, though I think that hardship is provided against, because, under the income tax legislation, dependants are defined as relations natural or by adoption. Should there be any case of hardship, the Commissioner will have power to deal with it .

293,Mr MANIFOLD,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Corangamite) [ 4 . 2 ] - It seems to me that, quite apart from the amendment, the wording of the sub-paragraph makes it quite clear that the exemption is intended to apply to a man who has enlisted for service on a ship of war outside Australia as well as to a member of the Expeditionary Land Forces. The introduction of the amendment, however, raises a doubt in my .mind as to whether Australians serving with the Allies, but not in any Australian Force, will be exempt. Some thousands of Australians are serving in the British A r m y , as well as with the French. I know of men who have done very fine work in the French air service. One man, whom I knew very well, was sent by the Commonwealth Government to study aviation in Great Britain, and on the outbreak of war was refused an appointment to the British aviation service because he was over age. He then joined the French air service as a pilot, and did very fine work. A f t e r serving for two years in that capacity he has returned to Australia, and now holds the rank of major in the Australian F l y i ng Corps. He was unable to obtain a commission in the French service because his knowledge of the French language was insufficient. All such men should come with in this exemption.",47
294,Sir JOHNFOEBEST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,I find that all such men are included in the exemption.,47
295,Mr MANIFOLD,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,I accept the Treasurer's assurance. I merely desired to be clear on the point that any Australian citizen serving with the fighting forces of the Allies would be exempt from this tax.,47
296,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,The Commissioner FOBBEST) assures me that he will be.,47

Under this sub-paragraph as it stands it is provided that the exemption shall apply to a person . who satisfies the Commissioner^That all his brothers of military age have ' been on active service outside Australia during the present war or are members of an Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia. That was the original proposal of the Government, and we retained it because we thought that the Parliament and the country would desire to show their sympathy with, and admiration and consideration' for, those families who have sent all their men folk to the war. I am sure, however, that no one desires that every son in a family should have to go to the Front. It is open to every son to enlist, but we think that if a majority in a family voluntarily go we should in this way show our respect and admiration for that family.",47
298,Mr SAMPSON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"But why substitute the word "" majority "" for the word "" all "" ?",48
299,Sir JOHN FORREST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"There is no difference in the result as far as three sons going is concerned; but in the case of four or five sons - going, the exemption would be greater if the word "" all "" was retained. If a majority of them have volunteered, that is quite as much as we should expect. I think we should take this opportunity of showing our admiration of, and consideration for, such families. I know of many families every son in which has gone to the Front, and we should express our admiration for the fathers, and especially for the mothers, of these men, who have sent them out on active service. We are saying, in effect, to the mothers and fathers of Australia, "" If you choose to send all your boys to the Front, you may do so, but if you send only a majority of them, we think you have done enough, and that we should not impose any special taxation or restrictions on those who remain behind.""",48
300,Mr MANIFOLD,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Corangamite) [4.11] - I hope that the Treasurer will move to omit the whole sub-paragraph. Now that we have decided to strike out other exemptions, we should also remove this exemption. The Treasurer has made ari emotional speech regarding those who have sent the majority of their sons to the Front. I do not believe that the boys who have gone to the Front were sent there by any one. They went because they wanted to go,, and I do not think their fathers or mothers had anything to do with their volunteering. There are families other than those mentioned by the Treasurer who have made still greater sacrifices. I refer to small families all the male members of which have volunteered, and to large families consisting of a number of girls and only one boy. I know of such families who are attempting to carry on dairying after the only boy has enlisted. Believing it to be their duty to go to the Front, they have done so, and have left their fathers' farms in a worse position, perhaps, than that of those owned by men a majority of whose boys have enlisted. I would point out to the Treasurer that under his amendment this exemption would be extended to a man who has refused to go, and will not go, to the Front; he is going to extend it to men who are working to fill their own pockets and not to assist their parents.",48
301,Mr FLEMING,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,And who are living on the reputation of their brothers who have volunteered.,48
302,Mr MANIFOLD,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"In many cases that is so. In this instance no question of conscription is involved. A man may please himself whether he enlists or not, and if he does not go to the Front he is only' asked to help in repatriating those of his brothers who have"". I know many cases where only a certain number of sons have gone to the Front, because families are like other communities, and every member is not imbued with the same sentiments and purposes. In my opinion, the proposed, lamendmenlt makes the clause even worse than it was before, and I intend to vote against it.",48

307,Mr JOHN THOMSON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"If one son goes to the war, and another son stays at home, and keeps the farm going, he is actually engaged in repatriation . work. When a member of a family goes to the Front, the family income is reduced by the loss of his services ;_and, therefore, I again say that the ""son who remains at home is really doing repatriation work. I know many cases in which brothers have decided amongst themselves that a certain number of them shall enlist.",48

If we place the value of the services these sons afc £100 a year each, with an additional £ 4 0 for their keep, we ' have a total of £420 per annum of replacing their labour.

If we ask ourbrothers selves whether it is really a conscription tax or a bachelor tax, we have to admit that it is a shandygaff. About 50 per cent, of the objections raised yesterday to the original proposals of the Treasurer apply to the proposals put forward today. so; If it is to be purely a bachelor tax, the only exemption allowed should be in reference to a man who changes from bachelorhood into the ranks of the benedicts.

My objection to the tax is that it is aimed at those people who have not gone to the war. The people one of Australia put a bar to our actions, however small, in the direction.of penalizing those who do not go to the war; but within the limits of the people's will the a Government are deserving of every credit profor attempting to raise money for repatriation purposes, and a tax on all unson, married men earning over £100 per annum is a reasonable source of revenue for that purpose.

I agree with the honourable member for Wannon that the taxation of ministers of religion may impose hardship. There are some clergymen who, by the rules of their church, are not permitted to marry. A man who i6 compelled to be a bachelor is entitled to some consideration. Many mjinikte'ris of religion have no money, others are very poorly paid, and have little opportunity of saving money.

There is no valid reason why such an exemption should be allowed. The fact that certain ministers of religion are absolved from responsibility for military service, as well as from the perils of matrimony, is no ground, why they should be exempt from the payment of this tax. The Treasurer stated yesterday, in answer to a question, that this exemption had been included in this resolution because ministers of religion are exempt under the Defence Act. It is most illogical to exempt a man from one obligation for no other reason than that he is exempt from another obligation. To carry that reasoning to its logical conclusion, a man who is absolved from liability for active service and financial contribution should be absolved from every liability. There are many men who, although they are in holy orders, felt so strong an impulse to defend their country that they have gone it into the trenches. At least one clergyman, the Reverend Hulton Sams, of North Queensland, has been killed at the Front, and there are many other clergymen who have not sought exemption from any liability in connection with this war An Honorable MEMBEB - Thousand s of priests are fighting in France.",52

360,Mr RILEY,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"South Sydney) [ 5 . 8 ] object to this subdivision altogether, because it introduces a new form of taxation, in regard to which the electors have not had an opportunity to express an opinion. I do not know of any country worth living in where there is a tax on bachelors, and the Government has not had a mandate fro m the people to propose such a tax here. W it h the exception of the ex-member for Oxley,' no candidate at the last election advocated a tax on bachelors, and I think that his defeat was due largely to several speeches which he made on the subject in this House. This is a departure in 'taxation which is without justification.

They are employed in shearing, mining, and similar occupations, and have no homes, tramping from one part of the country to another to gefc employment;. Ifc will be impossible to collect taxation, from them, because they do not remain sufficiently long in any one place. At the same time, fchis proposal will make criminals of them. Are we to make the building of gaols a Commonwealth in dustry ?",53
363,Mr LAMOND,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"No penalty is provided for the non-payment of the tax. Mr Riley , - Then the law will be a farce. But I do not think that the Government will allow men to escape. We hope that after the war a large population may come to this country, but a poll tax of £ 5 a head on bachelors, with the addition of a minimum income tax of' £ 1 , is not an attractive advertisement. We have got on very well without this class taxation, which would never have been proposed bufc f o rfchedesire to get afc eligibles who have not gone to the war. I should like to be a parliamentary can- I didate who can say that he opposed the tax, because the feeling against it will be very strong. Indeed, by this proposal the Government is digging its own grave. Only £250,000 is estimated to be received, and it will cost a great deal to collect that money. It would be more reasonable to increase the super-income tax and use machinery which we now have in stead of creating new machinery. If the Government needs revenue to provide for repatriation, I suggest an export tax on wool and skins in their raw state.",53
364,Sir ROBERT BEST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,What about wheat?,53
365,Mr RILEY,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,An export tax on wool and leather would stimulate local industries and make the country more self-contained ,53
366,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,And would not prejudicially affect the honourable member's constituents.,53
367,Mr RILEY,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"It would help the tanhonorneries and wool-washing establishments imi n my electorate.. Bachelors have as much right to consideration as any other persons in the community. Honourable members opposite, who were elected by the votes of wealthy men, tried to exclude as many such persons as they from the operation of the war-time profits tax. I would ask my honourable friends opposite to bave some consideration also for the many bachelors who support them. I look upon this as a pernicious tax, altogether unworthy of a progressive community. The Government have no mandate from the country ,to impose what is virtually a tax on bachelors. They have never consulted the people on the question, whereas the Labour party, in imposing the land tax, had a direct mandate from the people to do so. I think the Government would be well advised if they agreed to eliminate this tax on bachelors, and proposed a super-income tax, which all who had the means would cheerfully pay.  gravamen of the charge which the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) has made against the Government is thati they have no mandate from the people to impose this tax. He seems to overlook the fact that the conditions today are altogether different from those prevailing in time of peace. The Imperial Government, I would remind him, have since the war repeatedly imposed taxation for which they had no mandate from the country. We are perfectly justified, in time of war, in resorting to any form of taxation that will swell the revenue. It is quite possible for the Government to anticipate to any extent to what particular form of taxation they will have to resort, they have to legislate from time to time to meet the exigencies of the situation. The Government are justified in resorting even to the imposition of a bachelor tax to assist in raising the money necessary for the prosecution of this war. The honourable member for South Sydney said that bachelors would be unable to pay this tax, and that the bulk of the shearers and shed workers travelling through the country were single men. It was only a few weeks ago that the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court increased the wages of shearers, rouseabouts* and shed hands to the extent of £4,000,000 per annum. A shed hand now receives £ 2 8s. a week, in addition to his keep. Surely he should be able to bear a fair share of the taxation necessary to raise funds for the prosecution of the war. As to the further statement made by the honourable member that many single men are not receiving more than £ 4 0 or £ 5 0 a year, I think that, having regard to the awards of the A r tration Courts and Wages Boards, it would be difficult to find in Australia today any young man who is earning less than from £ 1 2 0 to £ 1 5 0 a year. The minimum wage is 9s. per day-fa r more than I received when I was a young man - and I considerfchafc,in dealing with all these matters, we must not lose sight of the fact that we are at war, and must adopt extraordinary methods fco raise the requisite revenue.",53

Ifc discriminates to no small extent, and particularly against that section of the community which can least afford to pay. Ifc is most extraordinary that the Government should ask single men receiving £ 1 0 0 a year to pay a tax of £ 5 . I know that the Treasurer is very sincere in the measures he puts before us, but I think that, on this occasion, he has overlooked the fact that, in a great many cases, those who will be called upon to pay this tax will be unable fco do so. In those circumstances, they will either be sent away or put in gaol. No provision is made for a deferred payment system. So far as these men are imconcerned, it will be a case of pay up or be shut up. If they do not pay up, they will probably, be sent away to fight. That since is really a system of economic conscription.  ber suggest that a single man cannot pay 2s. a week?",54

They are not all carrying on farming operations upon a huge scale' as the honourable member is doing. If , like h'im, they owned large tracts of land, I do not suppose they would be called upon to pay a tax of this kind. They belong to the working section of the community, and it seems to me that, on each and every occasion, the workers are called upon to bear the burden. It may be said that those who are asked under this subdivision to pay a tax of £ 5 per annum have not contributed their share towards the repatriation of their comrades at the Front. I am prepared to say that, in proportion to their earnings, the bulk of the workers b i - have contributed to repatriation funds to a greater extent than have those wbo possess considerable wealth. In proportion to their means, they have paid more than some people have done.  in the same proportion as have those who possess wealth?",54
370,Mr NICHOLLS,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"They have to a still greater extent.  afraid of this tax? Mr NICHOLLS, - Because they are not in a position to pay it . The primary purpose of this tax is not to raise money for the repatriation of soldiers, but to punish those who have not enlisted. It is most iniquitous that a penalty of £ 5 should be paid by every single man in this country. This tax will affect a young man who is serving his apprenticeship, and is receiving £ 8 0 or £ 9 0 a year, and even less. There are in Australia today men of twenty-one who receive considerably less than £ 1 0 0 a year. A f t e r they have paid for their clothes and their keep, they are not likely to have sufficient money to meet this tax. If they are called upon to pay it , they will probably apply to their employers for an increase of wages to enable them to meet the additional liability thus thrown upon them, and that will have the effect of upsetting quite a number of awards. The Arbitration Court, in giving awards, makes no provision for extra taxation; and it is only reasonable to expect that, if this measure be passed, there will be application after application for variations. can see, this taxation is not going to have the expected effect of stimulating recruiting, but, on the contrary, is going to do recruiting much harm.",55

380,Mr NICHOLLS,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I have decided, and I have said what I desired to say. This taxation is not going to do recruiting any good. The very fact that a man will have ' to pay a penalty for not enlisting twelve or eighteen months ago will annoy him ; and, however good his intentions may have been then, he may possibly decide to think over the position, in view of the extra liability he has to meet. All these circumstances have to be taken seriously into consideration. The proposal, considered as a whole scheme, does not seem to me to be in accordance with the best system of government. Apparently, one section of the community is to' be penalized, while another section is allowed to go scot-free. If it is the desire of the Treasurer to collect revenue, he ought to direct his attention to some other channels, from which larger amounts might be obtained, and not ask workers receiving only £ 1 0 0 a year to bear the burden. There are many men who will not be affected at all by this taxation, although they possess huge amounts of money, and have never contributed anything towards repatriaSo far as I tion, or .other patriotic purposes-wh o have not attempted in any one instance to assist in bringing about an effective settlement of the war. On the other hand, people who have contributed towards these objects according to their means, are to be penalized to the extent of £ 5 . It was the original intention of honourable members opposite to make the amount £ 1 0 , but they realized that such a measure would have no chance of passing. I trust that the Government will turn their attention to those people who possess enormous tracts of land, and control much wealth, in order that sufficient money may be raised to repatriate those who are now fighting in the interests of this country.",55

But the procession had not gone very far before the bells began to crack, and the harness began to get tarbut in the spirit. nished, until the whole of the display had to be temporarily withdrawn for repairs, in order to meet the disapproval evinced by his supporters. The Treasurer, in introducing the measure, said that it repreably, sented the policy of the Government as a whole. He also said that honourable members who had been in public life for a time knew that Ministers were not always in accord with the proposals that they advocated in the House, but that he was in absolute accord with this measure. Evidently, however, the Government were not in accord, for it was deemed necessary to modify the measure, and cut down the original proposal by something like 50 per cent. It is true that the Government have enlarged the scope with a drag-net proposal to embrace men over the age of forty-five. I am not at all concerned about the responsibilities which honourable members opposite will have to carry in connection with these proposals. What I am concerned about is the interests of the people who will be unduly oppressed by this legislation. Honourable members opposite will have to take the responsibility of meeting their electors on the point; but there was an honourable member, now missing from this chamber, who had certain fads in regard to a bachelor tax.",55
382,Mr BOYD,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,Do you think that that affected his election in the slightest degree ?,56
383,Mr BLAKELEY,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"He is not the only member who is missing. It might be said that we are unduly anxious as to how the Government are regarded by the general public, but I do not think that the party on this side has any anxiety on the subject. We can go to the country on our platform.",56
384,The CHAIRMAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT," The honourable member is going outside the question. Mr BLAKELEY. r- When the Prime Minister delivered his slogan to the country, he said that should national necessity arise, the question of conscription would again be placed before the people. Many honourable members opposite went much further than the Prime Minister in promising to oppose conscription by means of the referendum, or by a Bill introduced in this House. The people of Australia accepted the assurance of the Prime Minister, and they rely on the Government to keep their promise, not only to the letter, In my opinion, the proposal immediately before us partly achieves the object which the Government, as a whole, have not the courage to introduce, namely, conscription. Probi f honourable members opposite were a more compact body, they would do directly that which they are endeavouring long to do, as it were, by a side track. The Government proposal has a tendency to force into the fighting ranks those who are eligible, and the fact that the penalty has been reduced does not affect the ethics of the proposal. Whether the penalty be Is. or 200s., as originally proposed, a penalty is there. Those people who refuse to go to the war-wh o refuse to again present themselves for enlistment so that they may receive a new discharge-wil l have to pay £5. Several honourable members, and not only on this side, have asked what are the Government's intentions in regard to the collection of the tax. Personally, I am not at all anxious that the tax should be collected, but the Government, by strength of numbers, can place it on the statute-book. So far, however, they have not told us what they intend to do with those people from whom they cannot collect. I venture to say that there will be great difficulty in collecting this tax, not only from those who are able to pay, bnt from those who cannot pay. A medical student may be",56

386,Mr BLAKELEY,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I was merely giving an illustration, but I shall say a son of working-class parents, who may be a medical student. The parents of that son will have to pay £5, and, if he be in employment, and earning over £100, a tax of 5 per cent. In my opinion, no taxation which is oppressive or unfair should be imposed; and it is usually accepted that every person shall be taxed according to what i e earns, or according to his means. It will be seen that the particular taxation now proposed is not based on the accepted principle. Honourable members opposite have spoken of our being at war, and only a. few minutes ago one reminded us of the fact - The great trouble is that honourable members opposite conveniently forgot that we are at war when the Wartime Profits Tax Assessment Bill was before us, though all that they have been saying today might have been said when that measure was under discussion. This taxation will also affect married Tnen, for there are men, single now, who will be married this year. think it is the intention of the Treasurer to tax such people or those who have - married recently, and I ask him to take their case into consideration. Many men and women, who are now being married, are not able to pay a sum of £5, or & per - cent. on their They are just starting l if e , and are faced with a continuous increase in the cost of living. This proposal of the Government is an attempt to achieve that which honourable members opposite have not had the courage to bring forward. If they were a solid body they would bring down a proposal for straight-out conscription-durin g this debate many of them have asked for it quite candidly-and because they cannot get that they should not attempt to achieve it by means of economic pressure.",56

As the lionorable member has just pointed out, this tax may develop into a tax on married men. A man who has two sons over twenty-one years of age studying at the University will have to pay the tax imposed on those sons, because they will be earning nothing. My idea is that we should exempt any man who is not 6iigaged in some industrial occupation at which he can earn money.",57

391,Mr BOYD,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,I think that the honourable member is right ; but that merely shows that my proposal is too wide. The principle underlying it still remains; parents should not be called upon to pay taxation imposed upon their sons who - are not engaged in an industrial occupation producing wealth. [87],57
392,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,Are not university students as a rule pretty well off?,57

The only way in which he could attend the university was by depriving himself of food, and the fact that salaries. he now occupies one of the best positions out in in this country stands to his credit. If he or his parents had had to pay a tax such as is now proposed, he could not have remained at the university. There are many working men who are struggling to keep their children at universities in order to give them a better opportunity of getting on in the world than they have had. These students should be exempted, and if my amendment is too wide, and will go further than I intend, I am prepared to"" withdraw it if the"" Treasurer will agree that men who are not producing wealth of .any kind, or are not engaged in some occupation shall be exempted.",57
394,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,I do not think that the case of university students is sufficient to justify the insertion of a paragraph specially exempting them.,57
395,Mr BOYD,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"This was originally a tax on eligibles 'with the idea of compelling them to enlist, but by the extension of the age it has become a bachelor tax.

Such a plea, coming from a father, of a large family, is surprising. My view is that the home, and not the den in which the bachelor lives, is the backbone of any community, and the home is where the children are. I ask those who have put up p it if u l appeals for the single man, What man can keep a wife on £ 5 a year? There is no need for honourable members to raise any plea about a bachelor who cannot afford to pay £ 5 a year, seeing that wages in this country were never better than they are today. Men are earning big money, and there is no difference made between married men and single men so far as securing employment is concerned. the other hand, the single man can f r squander his money, while the married man with the responsibility of maintainthat ing a home, wife, and family cannot afford to do so. All this mook sympathy for the single men who cannot afford to pay a tax of £ 5 per annum is not worthy of our consideration. There should be a means of collecting this tax through the men who pay the wages.",57

399,Mr BOYD,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Severa l honourable memwith bers opposite have made a strong point about the inability of the taxation officers to collect this tax, and when he has the assurance that efforts will be made to dodge payment, the Treasurer should be awake to the necessity for providing machinery that will catch these people and prevent them from dodging the tax. There would be no sense in Parliament imposing taxation unless the taxation posed could be collected. However, will be a mistake to levy this tax withearning out providing some exemptions. not worthwhile establishing machinery to collect this taxation from incomes low a certain minimum.

406,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,What is the Treasurer to do if a man has not got the £5 with which to pay this tax?,58
407,Mr WALLACE,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"iTh e tax will not be collectable from many men. The Treasurer expects to get £500,000 from this tax, but he is more likely to have to spend that sum in building gaols to hold the men who do not pay. A man in receipt of a yearly income of £200 or more can very well afford to pay the tax, but an exemption of £ 1 0 0 would not be too much to ask. To take £ 5 from a man who has only earned £ 6 0 , and the same amount from a man who has earned even £ 1 00 is absurd. From an income of £100 the Treasurer will take £ 5 , leaving a balance of £95, Front. of which £65 will be paid for board and lodging; only £35 will be left for clothes and other necessaries - The whole pro-, member posal is impracticable. There is no doubt that this tax savours of economic conscription; but I do not think that giving men the alternative of paying or enlisting will greatly increase number ofrecruits. The Government have-nearly exhausted the eligible mantheir hood of the country. The only men to whom they can now look for further enhood listments are those at Tooronga Park. The saving feature I see in this that it will hit those men pretty hard, because they are well able to pay. A though the Treasurer is exempting engaged on military and naval service, he is not exempting those engaged in serspeaking, vices incidental to the war. I refer to men engaged on ships and on the wharfs, in transporting troops and foodstuffs, and coaling and loading ships. The work they are doing is necessary in connection have given. with the prosecution of the war, and they should be exempt.

That is why I favour the 10 per cent. tax. I believe it would do some good. hope the Treasurer will take special care to see that the tax is collected, because an enormous number of men, like those employed in the coal mines, are .earning more than £200 a year, and they should be compelled to pay.",62

In this case the shield which they hold before themselves is the shield of repatriation; but if ' the party opposite had any sincerity with regard to this matter, the Government would have come down with a taxation Bill capable of producing a useful result. They knew perfectly well that this measure and this clause-limite d as it is to a certain class of persons, but .which, at the behest pf certain members of this House, has been extended to other persons-wil l be of no practical use whatever.",63
455,Sir JOHN FORREST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,Why not?,63
456,Mr BRENNAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,Because the right honourable gentleman took very good care that it would not touch the majority of the people who had money to pay.,63

459,Sir JOHN FORREST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,Do you think is au accurate statement?,63
460,Mr BRENNAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"That would have been the means ofreaching some very wealthy men who would have made, and ought to have been grateful for the oppordid i I tunity to make, some handsome contributions to the revenue for a purpose of the kind. I sympathize with the Treasurer's embarrassment, though I know that he does not desire or value my sympathy. He introduced this Bill , as he did the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill , in a most eloquent speech - on e of the most able, florid, and touching adthe dresses I have ever listened to in this chamber. We had quotations from the Lays of Ancient Borne and some of the best classics, and tliere was a touching cadence in the right honourable gentleman's voice that I have never heard before. Bub, about two hours after he had introduced this measure, directing his special attention to the paragraph now under discussion, he had heard sufficient from his own supporters to make him forget those eloquent periods of his, and to hasten round the benches in an effort to find out where he stood in regard to the proposals. The paragraph is purely penal. I need not pause to argue that point, because it was well demonstrated by my learned senior, the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell), when he spoke yesterday. It is, as a matter of fact, purely penal; and to call it taxation is a mere misuse of language. It is not taxation, but punishment proposed for certain classes of persons because the Government could not reach them in another way with the referendum last year. There has been some doubt expressed as to how the fine is to be recovered. It is to be imposed on ypung men without means. I may digress fco say that this Government enjoys the distinction of ccping with the problem of the unemployed in the most novel way. There is much unemployment and distress outside, and the Government come here with a proposal to penalize by fine men who have been guilty of no offence-law abiding citizens without work and without means.",63

How the real influences that in the minds of honourable members are disclosed fro m time to-time by interjections- "" We will get afc the striker, at the man we have always called the shirker."" The vote of the country at 'the referendum not call him a shirker, but that is the term applied to him by the Government today. How is this fine to be enforced? The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Wise) told us not to be afraid-that there is no imprisonment attached to the penalty, and that if a man cannot pay there is an end to it .",63
463,Mr MATHEWS,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,There will be a distress warrant.,64
464,Mr BRENNAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"There will be more than that. I could tell my lay friend of quite a number of devices that. the law provides for dealing with persons of that kind. It would be absurd enough if the Government proposed a taxation measure without any method of collecting it, but they know that there are methods at their disposal. There is, for instance, in operation in this country what is known as the Fraudulent Debtors Act, When I mentioned that Act yesterday somebody-interjected that the Government would not for one moment think of applying it in respect of men who had no means. But I ask whether the Government, who seek to fine and penalize men with no means, would' not be prepared to resort to that or any other Act to give effect to their desires? The proposed measure will not help the Government in the slightest degree, except as a penal Act. The Government were thwarted by means of the referendum;, and today, by way of giving effect to their promise to win the waron the eve of their slinking into recess with their whole programme unaccomplished and promises unfulfilled-the y come with this paltry penal measure to impose a fine on men on whom they bad hoped the referendum would act. Is the conscription of wealth involved in the section now under discussion? I venture to tell honourable members that the proposal involves conscription of more than the wealth of a certain class of people. It says, "" We do not propose to take your all, but to penalize you in the most drastic way if you have not that ' all ' we desire to take."" ",64
465,Mr BRENNAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"It means that the Government, being wedded to the princases ciple of conscription, and smarting, they are, under the rebuff they received by the decisive vote of the people of country, and not having the courage to risk their own seats by making conscripmother, tion a vital issue before the electors, seek them. to effect their object by means of this taxation. It has been variously said that the clause might or might not be successf u l as a method of economic conscription. When the Leader of the Opposition (MT . Tudor) said that he did not think it would be effective as a means of constraining young men to go to the Front, honourable members opposite asked, ""Them why talk about economic conscription?"" I say that the taxation will not operate, and'would not have operated even in its original form,' in the direction of enhancing to any material extent the number of recruits. Honourable members opposite, and the Government, entirely misapprehend the reasons which move the young men of this country .who have not, up to the present, enlisted for war service. They fail to appreciate the real reasons; indeed, T doubt if they have ever tried to appreciate them.",64
466,Mr LECKIE,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,Giv e us the real reasons.,64
467,Mr BRENNAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I can give some of them, which are suggested to me by the paragraph under discussion. The reasons, cannot be found in those terms of abuse such as "" disloyalist,"" "" shirker,"" "" proGernian,"" and other vindictive and virulent epithets. Some of the reasons are, as I say, suggested to me by the paragraph. I see it is proposed to tax, for instance, &. young unmarried man, who may be the sole support of mother, sister) invalid or crippled brother- a young unmarried man, who may be, in a variety of ways, which this Committee cannot possibly understand, discharging all the duties of citizenship to the very fullest extent.",64
468,Mr RODGERS,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,The Commissioner will judge each case.,64
469,Mr BRENNAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"It is now suggested that the responsibility which the Government dare not take is to be shifted on to the shoulders of the Commissioner. A' typical case is that of a man who has, perhaps, one or more brothers on active: service, or who, indeed, may have no rela-"" tives at the Front, but has great pressing domestic responsibilities. Several suchhave been brought under my notice as since this measure was introduced. There are young fellows, loyal and patriotic to the a degree, but with all their energies utilized in keeping the home together for sister, or others with claims upon But because honourable membersopposite, and tihe Government, have never been able to give such men credit'for sincerity, courage, or any manly feeling, they have become imbued with the notion that such men are actuated by no motives other than the most sordid and unworthy. Thus we have now, at the close of the session, a proposal for the penal taxation of such men. _ ",64
470,Mr BRENNAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I do not know in what respect my statement is incorrect. There is another intense objection I have to this proposal. If an exemption is sought, the tribunal to which application has to be made is a militar y tribunal. The person seeking exemption before the Commissioner has to produce his militar y certificate, and there is no such thing as a civil tribunal in the matter. - Sir JOHN FORREST - In what clause is that provided?",65
471,Mr WISE,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,The honourable member for Batman is absolutely wrong.,65
472,Mr BRENNAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"It is only necessary to read the printed proposal to see that I am right.

476,Mr BRENNAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"It true. The paragraph readsThat he has been on active service outside Australia during the present war or is a member of nn Expeditionary Force raised vice outside Australia. The first thing he has to do is to obtain that information fro m a military source, and produce a military certificate to a. Commissioner, who is a mere public servant, although in a high office. In like manner, the majority of his brothers of military age have to get similar informa- . tion from a military authority.",65

Wise) seems to find great pleasure in therepetition of the offensive observation that I cannot prove my stabemenb, but the only contention I wish to advance is that the basis of the whole thing is one of military discipline and a military certificate, with consent or authority given by the military. I want to rivet special' attention on the fact that, probably for the first time in history, we are proposing to tax men below the standard which judicial tribunals have declared to be the lowest at which a man can decently live. That is a grave scandal, aggravated by the fact that the Treasurer, and his Government have utterly failed to impose taxation upon those persons in the community who can best bear it . To me, it is more than repugnant-it is repulsive-fha t we should be faced with the position that men who have grown to mature years in this country, lived in peaceful times, and accumulated great wealth should, in this hour of dark distress and difficulty, through their representatives in Parliament, be diligently evading their responsibilities to the country, and saddling them upon those who are least able to bear them.

489,Mr BRENNAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I think the Governfor ment argued this way: "" If we are . pelled by a solid Opposition and some few dissentients on our own side to extend the age l i m it, we should take very good, tax. care that the tax will press more lightly upon our venerable bachelor friends than it would have pressed on the younger men."" I shall oppose the paragraph even more strongly thab I opposed the previous one. It is an iniquitous proposal, unworthy of the Government; it is purely vindictive, designed as a penalty against 'the young men of the 'community, and it outrages all the recognised canons of taxaof all tion in that it pays no attention whatto a man's ability to pay. one thab Mr ATKINSON (Wilmot), [8.55] before me This proposal is a great change fro m the another-youn g one debated yesterday, which was supposed to refer only to eligibles. Now poor, manv of us who would have been exwill be roped in . I have no obthe jection to the change. I was quite prepared to support the original, proposal, rebecause though there were perhaps techof nical objections to it , or even objections principle, there was a strong element of justice about it . It was the only way a proof making those people pay who have not forgone to the war, but are making money, and do not even express gratitude to the per men who are endangering their lives at the Front. Many ^ of them have neither term gratitude nor admiration for their defenders. Many are staying on the land and waxing wealthy. Every member can give instances where five or six sons have gone to the war from one family, while, adjacent farms, of five or six sons, none n have gone, although all are just as fit and have as much at stake. There was enough justice in the proposition for the ComTreasurer's - mittee to have supported it yesterday, but the Government thought fib to withbedraw it and substitute a more logical Warscheme. As the tax is going to touch a exgreat many more people-al l bachelors * over twenty-one-ther e is not the same necessiby to maintain the high rate. The Government will raise all they require fro m this source on a 5 per cent, basis, and if that is so, surely they are justified in lowering the rate. The honourable many member for Batman (Mr Brennan) sugt o gesbed that the Government were lowering it in order to benefit their friends. they Just a moment before he complained that £ 5 per year was an awful impost to put on certain young men. Five pounds wil l be ? hard for some people to raise, especially those who, unfortunately, are out comof regular employment; but many ought to I be able to find it , because plenty of them earning wages can easily pay the They should do their duty by helping to repatriate the men who are fighting for them, paying in proportion just as the more wealthy will have to do.",66
490,Mr FINLAYSON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,What - will it cost . you?,66
491,Mr ATKINSON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,I am sorry to say it will not cost me very much.,66
492,Mr CONSIDINE,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,You have an easy remedy if you are sorry.,66
493,Mr ATKINSON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"There is nothing better to subscribe to than the repatriation of the men who have gone away and suffered 6o much, and many of whom will have to suffer for the rest of their lives. A person who cannot go himself should do all he can to put those men back into the positions they occupied previously in civil life, and make the remainder of their days as pleasant as possible. An y man who refuses to do that deserves no consideration. If we take moire from h im no one need worry. I am sorry that I shall not have to pay very much. If I bad to pay more, I should have a substantial income. However, what I will have to pay I shall pay quite willingly. There is no point in what the honourable member for Batman has just been saying about the hardships that some people will suffer. Discretionary power will ' be given to the Commissioner of Taxation, and if any one who cannot pay £ 5 can furnish the Commissioner with substantial reasons for his inability to pay he need not fear imprisonment. It may be just as hard for a man with an income of £400 a year to pay the £ 1 5 that he will be called upon to contribute under this taxation as ' it will be for the great majority of wage-earners to pay even the minimum of £ 5 . ' A man with an in come of £ 4 0 0 a year has already to pay State income tax and Federal income tax, plus 25 per cent., and as he will not be able to look to the Commissioner for relief, the additional £ 1 5 will take a little b it of finding. Seeing the Government were not pledged to any particular form of taxation in this regard, I am sorry that they' cannot see their way clear to withdraw this proposal with a view to bringing down a repatriation tax to apply to every one, - married or single. tax could be graduated in a scientific way, and would be much more equitable than that which is now under consideration. To say that every one should pay £ 5 , or 5 per cent., of his income is a little arbitrary. However, as the Government are anxious to get on with business, I am prepared to vote for the proposition before us; but I would like to see ministers of religion exempted. This tax has been turned into a bachelor tax, and it will be hard on some clergymen, who by the laws of their church cannot possibly change their bachelor state, to compel them to pay this tax. They cannot escape it by marrying, and in all fairness should be exempted. I regret that we could not get a straight-out vote on the sub-paragraph which exempted them, and which has now been deleted along with others. ""T would have voted to retain the exemption of ministers of religion, but I cannot vote against the whole subdivision on the ground of their inclusion. I hope that it is not too late for the Treasurer to take note of the exemption of persons who are permanently incapacitated for work. There are many bachelors who are permanently incapacitated for work, yet have very large in comes. I hold that we should allow a person who is permanently incapacitated for work to have an income of £300 a year, and tax his income beyond that figure.",67
494,Mr CONSIDI NE,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Barrier) [9.8] The paragraph has not been rendered any less objectionable by the exclusion of the exemptions which were in the proposal first brought down by the Treasurer. The opposition to the exclusion of the exemption applying to ministers of religion is rather amusing. Honourable members seem to think that the conscience of the person who, from purely religious motives, objectsto military service is not to be taken into consideration, while that of the clergyman is to have specially favoured treatment. I fail to see why there should be any differentiation between clergymen and conscientious objectors on religious grounds. that We have heard a lot of talk about alleged shirkers, the men .who have not gone across the seas to fight, but we have heard nothing of the fact that the great majority of the people in Australia today have nothing but their jobs to fight for; and while some people speak about Such a liberty and freedom, and about going across the seas to fight for it , they set about robbing the people of that liberty and freedom in Australia. Honourable members opposite talk a lot about repatriation with their tongues in their cheeks; it is only so much dust in the eyes of the people. They try to persuade the people that honourable members on this side are not genuinely patriotic, and that there is a monopoly of patriotism on their side. I admit that they have a monopoly of what they understand as patriotism, and which is nothing but safeguarding their profits, no matter who else suffers. If they were honest in their efforts to help the soldiers, and to secure funds for the purposes of repatriation, and helping soldiers' dependants, they would not have come down with a proposal such as this, saying in the one breath that its purpose is to force single men who have not volunteered to do something for the soldiers, and in the next breath that it is purely and simply a bachelor tax. If they are anxious to raise money for the purpose of doing justice to our soldiers, why do they not bring down a graduated income tax, which will fall upon themselves and upon those who stand behind them, who have made profits from the increased cost of living, not only out of those who remain behind,. and whom they term shirkers, but also out of dependants of the men whom they talk of helping? But we hear nothing about bringing down a genuine' measure to help these men. Instead, we have a vindictive and petty effort to force men to go to the Pront. I call it petty, because a man would not be of much account if he would be forced to go to the Front in order to avoid the payment of £ 5 . It is nothing but a paltry and spiteful effort to get, even with a number of people upon whom honourable members opposite spend most of their time in reflecting.'",67
495,Mr ORCHARD,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,How does the honourable member like the idea of paying ?,68
496,Mr CONSIDINE,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"The tax will not touch me very much, but it will touch those who are in the position which I occupied before I came here. It will not be much trouble for me to pay the 5 per cent. The people of this country have placed me in a position where even to pay a tax of £10 would not be a hardship to me, but it would be a great hardship, to many persons outside who are in the same position as I was in before I was elected to the House to pay even £5. With regard to the tax itself, I say again to the Government, "" Bring down a Graduated Income Tax Bill, and take the surplus over and above what you consider a fair living wage, and I shall be prepared to support it for repatriating the soldiers.""",68

According to honourable members opposite, they have been convicted of a new crime. The only thing which has happened since is that the penalty has been reduced. The proposal, i u principle, is exactly, the same as it was before-that is, an attempt to get behind the verdict of the people given on the 28th October last.

Is any honourable member going to argue that in the incidence of taxation today there is any comparison, between the position of married men and that of single men? Income Tax Act we made a paltry exemption of £26 per child, but it only means exemption from the tax on that sum. As a matter of fact, it is equivalent to an exemption of 13s. Does any honourable member really think that the single man cannot be fair l y asked to contribute more to taxation, especially for repatriation, than the married man? .Can we vote any sum of money which will pay for the lives which have been sacrificed?

523,Mr YATES,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Adelaide) [9.28] - I have not had the honour of listening to 'the deI n our bate on this proposal. I have certainly heard the impassioned remarks of the  ton), but he always gets very impassioned ou this point. Judging from the tone of his remarks to-night, he thinks that it is up to the young fellows who are not going to the war. to pay. When the ex-member for Oxley (Mr Sharpe) promulgated the idea of imposing a bachelor's tax, not only for war ppurposes, but as a just measure of taxation-a n impost which would make the basis of taxation equitable-h e was laughed at. It was only when-the war broke out that the proposal was accepted by the Government as an amendment in an ordinary taxation measure. To all intents and purposes, this is a bachelor's tax, with a minimum of £ 1 per £100, so that single men. may be'taxed, as it is said, in accordance with their responsibilities to the nation. The proposal has been brought forward as a special measure of taxation. Surely to heaven, this Win-the-war Government will not say that it ds a tax to meet the cost of government! Surely they do not claim that it is really intended to help in the repatriation of the soldiers when they retur n ! Every honourable member on the other side knows that it is not the case. He knows that he has his tongue in his .cheek when he says otherwise. It is of no use to deny that this tax means economic conscription pure and simple. The Government are attempting to do by a subterfuge what they have not the courage to do openly, notwithstanding that they claim to have a lily-white con-. science. They ought never to allow the word conscience to pass their lips after the attack they made upon the consciences of every elector in the Commonwealth when they issued pamphlets which attacked men's religion. The Government had no hesitation then in putting out false and black lies-no t to win the war",70
524,The CHAIRMAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT, Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that statement. It is an exceedingly improper expression to use.,71

526,The CHAIRMAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,I do.,71
527,Mr YATES,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"If I bave transgressed any rule of the House I withdraw; but I soldiers. am not aware of any other expression that will fit the action of the Government. This proposal is not a measure for repatable riation, nor is it just and tion. The Government dare not tell the community what is the real motive for the imposition of this tax. Its purpose is plain enough, but the proposal to tax single men to the extent of 10 per cent, of their incomes, with a minimum of £ 1 was too bald, and the Treasurer had do an inglorious climb-down to meet the wishes of the Ministerial Caucus. Government were afraid of what the country would say when next they apalready pealed to the electors if they persisted in inflicting this iniquitous burden upon tha unmarried men of the community. Why have not the Government included within the scope of the tax those young men who have married since the comI mencement of the war, and are without encumbrances ? "" In other words, why have the men who married to dodge enlistwas ment been allowed to escape this tax it because a tax on such men would touch too closely home? This proposal reeks of chicanery. The Government are not deavouring to make tbose who are responquired sible for the expenditure on the war pay for it . I again remind honourable memdom bers of the statement of the Minister Works and Railways (Mr Watt ) that it loan proposals. matters not how taxation is placed upon the people, there is a filtration process which indefinably, but surely, carries the burdens on to the shoulders of the masses of the people. I do not say that that f i l tration process will be in evidence in connection with this tax, because it is in the main a direct tax on the working man. He cannot evade it or pass it on, but will be required to pay every penny of it out of his weekly wage. The purpose of this super-tax is to compel men to go fco a the war, although we have always been told that enlistment ""for active service is a matter for each man's individual decision. I remember seeing outside the - Melbourne Town H all a quotation from a speech by Lloyd George, in which he asked, "" Will you allow another man to do your share of the fighting ?"" A friend who was with me thought; that was an admirable sentiment, and I agreed that it was if all things were equal. Bufc Lloyd George did not say who caused the war. In Great Britain today they will not give a vote to every man who is fighting, or to the wives and widows of",71

533,Mr YATES,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I am contending that section P should not be agreed to because the Government are not sincere, and I am referring to previous proposals i proof of my argument.

534,The CHAIRMAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,I again tell the honourable member that he will not be i order in proceeding along those lines.,72
535,Mr YATES,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"This measure of taxawho tion is not fair when compared with taxation imposed on other sections of the community. Notwithstanding all the taxation that has been levied for war purposes the profits made by the commercial section of the community have increased by no less a sum than £49,000,000 since the war broke out. That represents the increment that has been received by the people who are staying at home, and who are making a profit out of the war. Government ought to be ashamed to introduce a tax like this, while they leave ter) - Order that huge reserve of wealth untouched. It has been said that honourable members on this side of the House have no desire to do a fair thing by those who have gone overseas to fight the battle of those who have remained, at home. They dare not put to the test the liberality of the Labour party in regard to repatriation. When the War Pensions Bill was before Parliament, I proposed that we should pay to any man who was deprived of his eyesight, or had lost both arms or both legs, 10s. per day for the rest of his life. The Government are not game to carry their repatriation proposals to that exfore, tent. I challenge them to put us to the test as to what we are prepared to do the soldiers. The great majority men at the Front are trade unionists, the workers of the community; the men who, prior to the days when trade unionism asserted itself, shore sheep for 10s. per repatriation 1 100, and lived in lousy huts. To-day, they are fighting for the people who consuch ruling. trol the £49,000,000 of increased profits that have been made since the outbreak of the war. That, money has 'come from the pockets of the widows, wives, and be children of the men at the Front. The capitalists do not feed upon themselves. They feed upon the general community, and amongst that community in the bulk are the dependants of our soldiers at the n Front. When it comes to a question of properly doing the thing, I would advise honourable members to read the history of GoSouth Australia. The honourable mem here whilst reference is being made to this matter, because it has some points for and I am sure he would be interested the in it. In the State from which I hail they are juggling with land for repatriation purposes, and the inquiry which is n being conducted into the matter furnishes interesting reading in regard to the action of the win-the-war patriots. These men, were formerly shearing afc 10s. per the 100, who were taken by the workers from factories, and wbo were prepared to abide by majority rule so long as it suited their book to do so, soon, after being elevated to Ministerial office developed such tender consciences that when the question of conscription or no conscription was raised they refused to abide by the decision of the majority of the party The .with which they were associated.'",72
536,The CHAIRMAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"H o n , J . M . ChanI am loath to intervene, but I apprehend that, perhaps, the honourable member does not really know what is before the Chair. The' question of repatriation is not before the Chair ati'all.

But theomore they squeeze him the more he will kick, and when his boot is large enough they will become as extinct as the dodo. This Bill is an attack on the working classes of the Commonwealth. It ought never to have been introduced. The proposal it contains is an immorak-one, which will stink in the nostrils of the community. If it be necessary to impose taxation to enable us to' defray the cost of the war, let such taxation be imposed all round. I do not mind if I am taxed down to my underpants, so long as I am covered from the public gaze, and so long as everybody else is obliged to go about in the same attire. I will guarantee that some persons will not look as handsome as I do. This is the most insincere proposal that the Government have brought forward. It will not meet the circumstances of the case.

A f t e r having criticised this taxation proposal, I am not going to resume my seat without offering my alternative to it . I shall continue to offer that alternative until it has been proved that it is inefficient, impracticable, and unjust.

558,Mr FINLAYSON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Brisbane) [9.59] I have only a very few remarks to make upon this proposal. Whilst listening to the debate upon it , I have been wondering whether I ought to admire the patient resignation of the Treasurer (Sir John Forrest) or to sympathize with him in the position in which he has been placed. One would naturally assume that the right honourable gentleman, with his long record of service behind him, and with the heavy responsibility upon him of financing the Commonwealth through this period of war, would have considered well the proposals which are embodied in this motion. We must assume that they were carefully thought out, that they had been the subject of long and serious consideration, and represented, when tabled, the mature judgment of the Treasurer and his officials, and of the Cabinet. But, alas, what a ragged scheme it is now! What a miserable remnant is left of the once proud motion that was the financial proposal of this Win-the-war Government! What an exhibition of financing! Has the Treasurer run away from his opinions, or has he been forced into his unfortunate position ? , Was he too sanguine in the first instance, or is he too much afraid now ? What soothing syrup did he give to the recalcitrant members of his party who yesterday tore the Bill to tatters, and threatened the defeat' of his financial proposals, that those who were so noisy are now so quiet? They have been bought; concessions have been made to them; the policemen, the lighthouse-keepers, and ministers of religion have been sacrificed to placate them. In to what a ridiculous position has the party placed its Leader! When the Government brings forward a proposal which it considers necessary for the winning of the. war, its supporters tur n on it and rend it . Is this an exhibition of strong government?",74

561,The CHAIRMAN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT, The honourable member is going beyond the motion.,75
562,Mr FINLAYSON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I have two remarks to make. The honourable member  in opposing the motion we shall be voting against repatriation. that suggestion with scorn and indignation. To say that in voting against the motion we show our hostility to repatriation is a disgraceful statement which I cannot allow to go unchallenged. a comment on the suggestion.is' the fact that the proposed tax will yield not more than £500,000, while the needs of repatriation will amount £20,000,000 to £50,000,000! this side, are prepared to support whatever taxation may be necessary to provide money for repatriation, but to suggest that this contribution from the single men of Australia is vital to repatriation is ridiculous. And , as I said, yesterAtkinson, L. day, and as has been said repeatedly .by . members on this side, the proposed tax is merely an attempt at economic conscription. Evidence in supportof that statement is found in the fact that member after member has said that the single men can easily avoid the tax by enlisting. It is "" enlist or pay up ,"" or, as the honourable member for Barrier (Mr . Considine) put it , "" y o u r money or your life."" I protest that no payment, and this least of all, can be accepted as equality of sacrifice with that of the soldier. ' For that reason the proposal is an insult to the men at the Front.",75

I do not doubt the Treasurer's in tention's, but such intentions have often be varied by reason of circumstances that arise. The Government will not be able to say that a penny of the revenue fco be raised in this way is for repatriathe tion purposes unless they bring down a measure so ear-marking it . FORREST, Sir JOHN FORREST - We would have so ear-marked it in this Bill if we could have done so.",76
576,Mr JH CATTS,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"The right honourable gentleman said he would, but he has not done so. The Government could have brought down a short measure of one or two clauses, providing that the revenue obtained from this tax should be appropriated for the special purpose of repatriation. Such a Bill would have gone through without discussion.",76
577,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,Without discus,76
578,Mr JH CATTS,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Yes ; there would been no objection to it from this side of the House. Briefly put, the Government are placing this penal tax on single l l men without a line of legislation provid: ing that the money so raised shall be used that cerfor repatriation purposes.",76
579,Mr GLYNN,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [10.22] - We could not declare in this Bill that the revenue to be raised by the tax for which it provides shall be devoted to repatriation puri l l poses, inasmuch as section 55 of the Consubject. stitution provides thatLaws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provisions dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect, while section 81 of the Constitution provides that all moneys raised by the Government shall form one consolidated f u n d , to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth. As this Bill deals with taxation, no other subject can be in troduced in it , because section 55 of the Constitution provides to the contrary. The Treasurer, therefore, proposes to follow the only constitutional course open to him, by providing in another Bill to be introduced forthwith, that the revenue raised by means of this tax shall be appropriated for repatriation purposes.",76
580,Mr CHARLTON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Hunter) [10.24] I do not intend to allow this measure to pass without making a final protest against it . In the first place, I think the title of the Bill is wrong, since it provides for a tax, not on incomes, biit on bachelors. The original motion introduced by the Treasurer provided for a special tax on all single men, and widowers without children, between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five years. Finding that there was strong opposition to that proposal, the Treasurer, in order to pacify his party, so extended the provision as to include every unmarried person in the Commonwealth, with the exception of old-age pensioners and one or two others. I wish to put my protest on record, so that when' the day of reckoning comes-as it will come when the Government proceed to collect this tax - I shall be able to point to 'the fact that I anticipated that difficulties would present themselves. The Government are proposing that aged men, who are obtaining from a little property just sufficient to make it impossible for them to obtain an old-age pension, a tax of £ 5 per annum. These old men might not have a total income of more than £ 5 0 or £ 6 0 a year. might have a little property, to obtain which they have struggled hard, and the income from which, while barely sufficient to keep them, debars them from obtaining an old-age pension, and the Governmentare now proposing to take from that scanty income £ 5 a year. A sum of. £ 5 may not appear of much consequence to honourable members who enjoy a regular income, but it is a big amount to the poor man who is struggling hard to gain his daily bread.",77
581,Mr SAMPSON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,Such a man as the honourable member has mentioned would be incapacitated for work witbin the meaning of the law.,77
582,Mr CHARLTON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"He would not. Even if he were, he would have to go through certain formalities in order to secure the exemption. It is a disgrace that such a tax as this should be imposed by a Parliament, not one member of which at the recent elections told the people that if returned he would support the imposition of a tax on the single men of Australia.",77
583,Mr BLAKELEY,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,The Government and their supporters had not the courage to do so.,77
584,Mr CHARLTON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"No . If at the last general elections the people had known that the Government intended, if ret u r n e d , ^ impose this taxation, the result would have been different. The Ministerial party would have been in opposition today. As originally introduced, the Government proposal was to impose a special tax of £ 1 0 on all eligibles who had not volunteered. Subsequently it was widened so as to include all single men, and was reduced to £ 5 , or 5 per cent, of the taxable income, whichever is the greater amount. Had the people known that the Government intended to do this, they would not have returned them with a majority.",77
585,Sir JOHN FORREST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I would not trouble about that if I were the honourable member. A f t e r all , it is only a matter of opinion.",77

590,Mr CHARLTON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I am looking after the people who sent me here, just as the right honourable gentleman looks after the interests of the money-bags of Australia who returned him to this Parliament. The Treasurer, who taunts me in this way, has said, time after time, that he would not be prepared to impose any further direct taxation on the wealthy people of this country, either for repatriation or any other purpose. While he takes up that position,, he is quite proud of this measure, of which he claims to be the father, and under which he is going to take £ 5 a year from many young fellows who are not earning more than £ 5 0 or £60 a year.",77

604,Mr CHARLTON,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Yes , a penalty tax, from which there will be no escape for certain people, and in consequence I feel that I have a perfect right to object the measure at every stage if I feel so disposed. We have treated the Treasurer very well in this matter, because we have allowed him to get on with the Bill , but we know that when he gets it through this House and, by reason of the majorit y at""his command, through another place, the day will not be far distant when thousands of people who voted for his party at the last election on the strength of the promise made-that conscription would not be introduced without referring it to the electors-wil l have something to say on this matter. This Bill is really a form of economic conscription. It was in tended as a measure to force men to enlist, £120' though subsequently the Government amended the proposition to make it apply to every single man, including those who are now grey-headed and perhaps tottering to the grave, so are too old to go to the Front and assist their country in this hour Treasurer of its crisis.

651,Sir JOHN FORREST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"Swan-Treasurer ) [11.23] - I am informed by the Commissioner of Taxation that this amendment cannot be moved in this Bill . Honourable members will notice that this measure does not make any mention of the existing exemption of £ 1 5 6 . An opportunity of moving this clause will be afforded later, because the Government propose to introduce an amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act in order to remove some of the anomalies and give effect to the recommendations of the Inter-State Conference, with a view to having uniform assessment legislation for the States and the Commonwealth. We hope that the States will adopt the same Bill . I understand that that will be the proper measure on which to move an amendment such' as the honourable member has proposed. The Bill is already in print, and Blakeley, A. it is necessary that it be submitted to Parliament as an early date.",83
652,Mr TUDOR,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,That amending Bill will not be applicable to the income tax for the year 1917-18.,83
653,Sir JOHN FORREST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,It will. That is one of the reasons why I am anxious thati this Bill shall be passed as quickly as possible. Mr Fenton .(Maribyrnong) [11.25]. - I do not think that the Treasurer is correct in stating that the amendment cannot be moved on this Bill . We are making such excessive demands on certain sections of the community that it is only fair to raise the exemption to £ 2 0 0.,83
654,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT,"I the amendment, [89]- 2 NOES. Mr Glynn - I submit that the amendment is not ,in order. It is opposed to the provisions of the Constitution, and, in any case, it is an amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act.",83

In Committee (Consideration of Senate's amendments) : Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer)' [11.36] - The amendments made by the Senate in this B i ll meet with the concurrence of the Government, and therefore I propose to accept them.",84
658,Mr BOYD,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,Where are they?,84
659,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,"Probably the Committee would like to deal with them seriatem, but I prefer that they should be dealt with en bloc. I do not think bhat they contain anything of which the Committiee w i ll disapprove. Consequenbly I move That the amendments be agreed to.",84
660,Mr BOYD,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,Is it intended to deal with these amendments en bloc?,84
661,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,Yes .,84
662,Mr BOYD,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,We ought to have some explanation of them.,84
663,Sir JOHNFORREST,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,"I shall be happy to give the desired explanation. The first amendment of the Senate is in clause 4, where it is proposed to leave out the words "" of foodstuffs, the produce of Australia, for the purposes of manufacture or sale."" These words have been omitted because they have been in serted in clause 8, and it is unnecessary to duplicate them. The second amendth the ment by the Senate relates to the definition of "" co'-operative company."" It is proposed that the following definition be inserted:- "" 'Partnership' includes beneficiaries under a will , settlement, or other deed of trust, who are carrying on business j o in t l y . "" That is necessary to protect the beneficiaries. The thir d amendment made in the same clause inserts after the word "" Australia "" the words ORDERS. "" so far as regards the manufacture, preparation, or wholesale distribution of foodstuffs, the produce of Australia."" That amendment relates to the definition of a co-operative company, to which I have already referred. That seems fair and reasonable, and has been approved by the Government. It is also proposed to insert in clause 8, after paragraph / , which defines the businesses to which the tax applies, the following new paragraph:""and (g) businesses commenced since the fourth day of August One thousand nine hundred and fourteen for the purposes of mining for wolfram, molybdenite, tungsten, scheelite, or any other rare metal used in the manufacture of munitions of war, if the output of the mine is disposed of to the Imperial Government."" In clauses 12, 15, 16, and 59 the words "" to the satisfaction of the Commissioner "" or "" it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that "" have been struck out, the object of the amendment being to give the taxpayers a wider appeal to the Board of Referees or the Court, as the case may be. The amendment does not interfere with the discretionary powers of the Commissioner generally, but prevents a final determination by him on questions on which the taxpayer may appeal. Clause 15 is amended also in respect of deductions for wear and tear or for expenditure of a capital nature for renewals, & c , by leaving out the words and if allowed shall be only of sueh amount as appears to the Commissioner to be reasonably and properly attributable to the year or accounting period. Then after "" f i r e -"" the word "" f l o o d "" is inserted. We provided for losses by fire, accident, robbery, or embezzlement, but omitted to include losses by floods, - which have often been very serious. The clause is further amended by the addition of the following new sub-clause:(4A). For the purposes of this section "" income tax payable in respect of the profits "" shall be(a) in the case of an individual the amount of tax that would have been payable if the profits had been the only income derived by him from sources within Australia; (6) in the case of a partnership gregate of the amounts of tax that would have been payable by each partner if the share of the profits coming to him had been the only income derived by him from sources within Australia; and (c) in the case of a company, the amount of the tax (if any) paid by the company, together with the aggregate of the amounts of tax that would have been payable by each shareholder if the share of the profits credited or paid to him had the only income derived by him from sources within Australia. In clause 17 this new sub-clause has been inserted:"" (2A.) Where any money paid into or credited to a business is not being drawn upon for the purposes of that business it shall be excluded from the capital of the business for the purposes of this Act."" That means that dead capital cannot be counted as capital. "" S h all "" has substituted for "" may "" in clause 23. An amendment to clause 27, to insert "" o r Boards "" after "" Board,"" empowers the vernment to appoint more than one Board if necessary. The amendments have been thoroughly sifted by the Taxation Departland suggests. ment and by me, and I have no hesitation in recommending honourable members to accept them.",84
664,Mr WISE,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,"Gippsland) [11.48] - In clause 4, as the Bill left company"" was defined as a company in whichnot less than two-thirds of the shares held by members who are bond fide primary ducers or suppliers to the company of foodthat stuffs the produce of Australia for the poses of manufacture or sale. The Senate has amended that definition by leaving out all the words after the word ""suppliers."" Therefore, operative company "" may be a company which two-thirds of the shares are held by members who are suppliers of any comproduce modity. I cannot understand why such facture or sale. a company should be exempted. Many co-operative companies supply electric light and storage, and some of them sell large supplies of general stores.",85
665,Sir JOHN EOBBEST,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,The profits derived from such business would not be exempt from taxation.,85
666,Mr TUDOR,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,"I think that the Treasurer, by accepting the amendment of the Senate, will weaken the clause. Perthe agsonally, I am opposed to the exemption of co-operative companies. Sir JOHNFOEEEST (Swan-Trea surer) [11.49] - The explanation f u r nished to me is that, as the clause originally stood, co-operative companies engaged for the main part in the manufacture, preparation, or wholesale distribution of foodstuffs the produce of Australia been were exempt on all their profits, although part of these might be derived from business other than the handling of such foodstuffs. The amendment limits the exemption to that part of the profits derived from the handling of foodstuffs.",85
667,Mr TUDOR,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,I think that is incorrect.,85
668,Mr WISE,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,"The company may be a town company, supplying anything.",85
669,Mr TUDOR,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,A Leongatba co-operative been company supplies electric light.,85
670,Sir JOHNPOBBEST,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,"I am informed that the .words were lef t out of the origiGonal form of the definition because they were surplusage, and not for any object such as the honourable member for Gipps",85
671,Mr WISE,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,"I do not suggest that the alteration has been made deliberately for that object, but that that is its effect.",85
672,Mr SINCLAIR,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,"I think we had better us, "" co-operative leave them in .",85
673,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,"I have given the Committee all the information I can. are If the honourable member for Gippsland, proas a gentleman learned in the law, thinks it is necessary that the words should purbe left in , I am prepared to leave them in.",85
674,Mr GROOM,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister) [11.52] - As the Bill lef t a ""cothis House the definition of co-operative in company contained the wordsSuppliers to the company of foodstuffs the of Australia for the purpose of manuA question was raised as to whether foodstuffs did not apply only to something that was prepared. There are a great many co-operative companies, such as bacon-curin? companies, whose suppliers supply live animals. There 'are some whose suppliers supply lambs, which the companies prepare and manufacture into foodstuffs. The term "" s up p l i e r "" is well understood by those who have a knowledge of these co-operative concerns to refer to a person who supplies raw material to the company.",85

676,Mr GROOM,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,If honourable members will turn to the exemption in clause 8,86

686,Mr GROOM,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,"No , In order that the company may be exempt, two-thirds of the shares must be held by suppliers to the company. The manufacturing company that supplied an electric lighting plant would not be a shareholder of. the cooperative company. The definition, as amended by the Senate, appears to cover what is intended.

702,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUSPENSION OF STANDING,"Swan-Trea surer) [12.0] - I can explain the matter. It sometimes happens that a considerable sum of money may be standing to the credit of the owner of a business, h u t is not being used for any of the purposes of the business. It would not be proper to treat that money as part of the capital of the business in respect of which a deduction of 10 per cent, on the capital could be made from the war-time profits. As this money is not earning any profits of the business, it should be excluded from the capital of the business in the same manner as the capital which is earning non-taxable profits is excluded.",87
