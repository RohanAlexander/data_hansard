11,Mr RODGERS,NEW ZEALAND AND FIJ I,"I read in yesterday's Age the statement of the New South Wales Treasurer (Mr Lang).that h j was asking for further funds, .and that the State had expended' £248,125 on soldier settlement whioh had not been recouped by the Commonwealth Government.

13,Mr RODGERS,NEW ZEALAND AND FIJ I,"Account s have to be certified by the Auditor-General and the Secretary for Lands of New South Wales. The Colonial Treasurer has also asked for an advance for soldier settlement for the coming year, and that request is receiving the earnest consideration of the Minister for Repatriation and the Treasurer, and will be dealt with as .quickly as possible.

The amount involved in the settlement .of accounts between the Commonwealth, and the State .of New South Wales is not in -.dispute, though the mode of payment is in - dispute. Not only .have recoupmentsbeen made by the .Commonwealth aB certified ' accounts have been presented by the State,- but during the last - year - su,bBtantial advances were made to - the States.

17,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW ZEALAND AND FIJ I,"What we promised Mr Lang, at the Premiers' Conference, I believe, was that when he had settled 8,500 soldiers we would give him another £3,500,000. There have been settled in that State about 6,000 soldiers, so. that, if we have not fulfilled our terms of the arrangement, neither has Mr Lang.

The following are the grounds on which income tax refunds were made:The lodgement of amended returns by taxpayers showing further information.

The reasons why refunds of war-time profits tax were made are as under:In cases where returns - have not been lodged a default assessment is issued; taxpayers then furnish the required particulars necessitating an amended assessment and consequent refund. The receipt of further information from taxpayer after payment of tax-du e mainly to taxpayers' laxness in keeping adequate books of account-par ticularly pre-war periods.

45,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Is this amendment non-party?,24
46,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I trust that it is. - moving it entirely in the interests people of Australia, and of that very large number of people who are thrown out of employment at the present season, and are suffering greatly in consequence. Although the Commonwealth Governof ment are not entirely responsible for that, yet it is largely due to the ineffective carrying out of the functions of the Com800; monwealth. It cannot be denied that throughout all the States, many tens thousands are unemployed at the present time, and the distress is very acute. are passing through the. winter, and only the. unemployed workers, but also their wives and families are suffering greatly. There is no doubt that the majority of the unemployed are and anxious to work if work can be vided for them, and I am not suggesting any form of relief other than the provino sion of employment, carrying out the duties of the Commonwealth Government in the way in which they should be carsuggesting ried out. I realise that the entire responthis sibility does not rest with the Commonargue wealth Government; if I contended that it did I would be indicating that I was unable to gauge the real position.",24
47,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Do not the terms of the honourable member's amendment rather I suggest that the unemployment is the fault of the Commonwealth Government? Australia today. Mr RYA1ST - If - the honourable member will read the amendment he will see that I do not charge the Commonwealth for all the States? with the whole of the responsibility; I say that the present position has arisen "" largely "" through ""their ineffective carrying out of Commonwealth functions. 20,000? I The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) will be afforded an opportunity this afternoon to justify the policy of the Government, if he can, but up to the present I have heard no justification from rehim; on the contrary, he has used every unemopportunity to shuffle his responsibility has on to the States. If any evidence be necesparrysary in regard to the extent of unemployment, I have some particulars of the state to of affairs in Victoria which will be inreteresting to honourable members. There are about ninety unions in that State, and I understand from reliable information, which I have obtained today, that there are about 20,000 workers unemI am ployed. Amongst them are the following of the unionists:-Brick , Tile and Pottery Union, 550; bootmakers, 400; clothing trade, 2,100; rubberworkers, 800; timber workers, 900;' Victoria-Riverina branch the Australian Workers Union, 5,000; carpenters in the metropolitan area, 30.0; shop assistants and warehouse employees, pastry cooks,. 300; liquor trade employees, 400; building industries, of 1,000; manufacturing grocers, 500; and fodder and fuel employees, 500; and I We have the following information in regard not to the Wharf Labourers. Union in Melbourne: The award in that occupation - is based on a thirty-hours' week, great but during the last two months 700 willing members of the union have not proaveraged five hours, per week, and today about 1,000 men are idle, with prospect of getting work this week. That is positive evidence in regard to the state of affairs in Victoria. I am not that conditions are worse in State than in any other. I do not that the fact that there is a large number of unemployed in Victoria is due to the fact that there is not a Labour Administration in that State. I attempt to make no political capital out of the particular party in power in any State; give those figures as illustrative of the fact that unemployment is rampant in",24
48,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Are those figures,24
49,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,No ; for Victoria qnly.,24
50,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"And there are - Mr EYAN/ Yes; 20,000. There is no doubt that unemployment at the present time is partly due to world causespartly the effect of the Avar and its aftermath.",24
51,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Hear , hear!",25
52,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"It is impossible to go through whatwas gone through in the war, with the tremendous amount of destruction that took place, without sacrifices having to be made, not by one section of the community, but by all sections. ' I ! freely admit that; and I also freely admit that there is great-difficulty in getting back to a normal state of affairs after the destruction that took place. The only remark I have to make on that phase of the question is that I think we ought to condemn those who held out such glowing hopes to the workers during the war as to how much better things were going to be immediately after the war. I think that the hopes of the workers were unduly raised; they were told there was going to be a new world, .and that they were going to receive "" a slice of the cake ""-that the workers were not to return to the conditions that obtained before the war. There are many - men in responsible positions who held out such prospects before the workers of - the world, when, as a matter of fact, they must have known, not only that things could not be better, .at all events, immediately after the termination of hostilities, but that,- indeed, they must be worse. It is inevitable that the tremendous destruction and loss that took place must fall on somebody-that there must be general sacrifices made. The lesson, perhaps, has been ""learnt by the workers throughout the world that none has more to lose, and less to gain, by war than they, and this may stimulate them to activity, for the power is theirs, to see that some means is adopted for the permanent preservation of world peace. That will probably be the effect, and I hope it may; and I further hope that in this direction good will come from the severe lesson that is being taught the workers t.o-day. .""Whatever .may be the causes, in a ral way, there is no doubt that a duty rests on ail Governments to, as far as possible, relieve the distress which prevails-to relieve the position that has arisen as a consequence of the conditions that obtain today. It is their duty, not only for the.purpose of actually assisting those who are in distress, but also in order to prevent a breeding ground being created for discontent and for exploitation by that small section-because , after all, it is a small section--wh o advocate the overthrow of all forms of ordered government. Thi3 is the opportunity for those few to suggest that the remedy is to make things worse, and to tear down the existing fabric of our civic arrangements, with a view to setting up something else. There is a class of person who, no doubt, welcomes the existence of sueh unemployment, not because they have any ill-will, or wish evil to those who are suffering distress, but because they view this as a means for obtaining a general reduction of wages. I do pot propose to devote any. of my time to discussing that, particular class,. except to say that they are a minority-ver y largely in a minority-of the public-of this coun-' .try, and that, whatever their political leanings may be, they certainly do not find a place amongst the supporters of the party to which I have the honour to belong. Then, there are those who pose as a kind pf permanent leaders of .the .unemployed, but who in some instances are merely the agents of capitalism and of anti-Labour organizations. Fortunately, these are few; there are mauy genuine leaders of the unemployed, but there are a few who are. not. That few, it is gratifying to know, are not influential; the good sense of the great body of the workers - is such thab they are not to be misled. Then there is the other class to which I have just - referred-and they, too, are fortunately few and also uninfluential-wh o stir up discontent, and take advantage of the distress which exists as an opportunity for preaching doctrines for the overthrow of all ordered forms of government. They, too, have no place amongst the supporters of the party on this side; they have'no countenance from this party, as I have frequently, on previous .occasions, pointed out. On tins point I should like to refer to some remarks which I made, and which I wish gene- to re-endorse, at a meeting held in the Sydney Domain on the 16th December,. 1918, with regard to what are called extremists. I wish to make my position clear as to what I consider an extremist and what I consider an opponent. On that occasion, speaking of the Labour party, I saidWe stand for efficiency. If there are some who are endeavouring to promulgate a doctrine contrary to that, I do not regard them as extremists, because I have respect for the extremist, who is a man who wants to go on the same track as we are going, but wants to go faster. Those who differ and light our methods are opponents, not extremists at all,, and we have got to fight them the same as we fight the capitalists on the other side. We must stick to our programme and our platform. I have got to stand by it ; everybody else must have to stand by it. Ninetenths, or more than nine-tenths, of the workers of Australia agree with that sentiment. We must show ourselves capable of governing, and that we will faithfully observe the responsibility of power placed in our hands, in accordance with the platform upon which the people elected us. I do not care from what quarter the contrary doctrine comes. I will fight it all the time. We must use constitutional methods. We are using them. I take the same attitude today. I regret that circumstances are allowed te rise which provide an opportunity for those few, because they, are a few, to promulgate such doctrines. The overwhelming majority of the people of Australia do not belong to any of those classes; and it is for that overwhelming majority that I propose to speak, trusting that I interpret the views of that majority in saying what I do this afternoon. I think we all admit that it is, perhaps, one of the saddest SDectacles that can present itself that so many thousands-aye , tens of thousands-of able-bodied men, ready, willing, and anxious to work, find themselves unable to obtain employment whereby to sustain their wives and families. It is lamentable that such a state of affairs should obtain in a country like Australia - a country flowing with milk and honey, a wealthy country, a country of vast sources.",25
53,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,And an country.,26
54,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"It is also an empty try. Recent representations to the Comsix monwealth Government, accounts of tice, which we have seen in the press, and rethis presentations that have reached me from various parts of Australia-as late as terday from the Brisbane Unemployed Committee-satisf y me that the unemreport ployed in Australia are of the opinion that the Commonwealth Government has Town been failing in its duty. They therefore wish to have it impressed upon the Government that it must stand up to its responsibilities, and discharge its obligatons. I am principally concerned this afternoon with the question of the responsibility that rests upon the shoulders of the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth Government cannot escape the major portion of the responsibility for the present position. It has arisen out of their conduct during the war, and their conduct since the war, with regard to repatriation. In those two respects the responsibility rests upon this Govermnent. I d o not propose t'o go into what the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) calls ancient history, but it is just as well briefly to remind honourable members and the public generally that the Commonwealth Government, by its inept administration during the war, allowed the depletion of our economic resources. I have dealt with that matter time and again, and I tliink that by-and-bye the people will realise that this Government subordinated the interests of Australia in a wholly unjustifiable way. The primary produoers have reason to realise that they did not obtain what were world prices for their produce. A portion of it was retained on the other side of the world, not for the British Government, but for profiteers oversea. If Australia had received a fair deal in connection with these matters, and I am speaking now of their financial aspect, there would be no shortage of money at the present time for carrying out developmental works in this country. In that respect, then, the Commonwealth has failed to discharge its responsibility and its obligation. In the second place, I say that the Government have failed also in that respect resince the armistice. I am taking up no new attitude; I am only emphasizing an attitude which I have taken up for quite empty a number of years. I propose to refer the Acting Prime Minister to remarks counwhich I made on this very subject some weeks after the signing of the armisbecause I want to make it clear that is no new-fangled idea of mine, or of the party to which I have the honour to yesbelong. In the Sydney Daily Telegraph, of 17th December, 1918, there appeared a of remarks made by me the previous evening at a meeting'in the Sydney H all . The report is headed, "" U n employed Will M a r c h "" ; "" Mr Ryan's Prophecy""; "" The Problem A h e a d "" ; of employment here, plainly and it reads""Unemployment-me n walking the streets in If procession."" Such was the forecast of Ryan, Premier of Queensland, at the Town Hall last night. He. made it clear that he did not think it was necessary that this happen, but expressed the view that unless the problems of today were grappled with worse would be realized. And he did not disguise the opinion that the Federal ment, on whom the responsibility rested, was Australia today. not dealing adequately with the position. Mr have had it for some time. Ryan was thanking, the Sons of Australia a presentation and so onHe remarked that there were problems which Australia must face., yet no one giving a lead as to how to solve them. Twentyfive thousand men were coming back from war next month and A vuice - No preparation.",26
55,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"That' s it ; there's no preparaworkers. tion. They will be absorbed by turning other men wbo have positions. abo'it things being bad : they will be unless these problems are faced. These must be absorbed without turning out nlready employed. I went on to say: Unless these problems are grappled with, tomorrow, but here, and now, you will see what I say is true. The unemployed will be seen in your streets. It is coming unless Government acts at once, and replaces the expenditure with expenditure on reconstrucment tion. The quotation shows that I pointed out immediately after the armistice that Commonwealth Government wfer.e not taking proper steps to insure that they would be able to absorb all the returned men, which, of course, it was their bounden duty to do-and at the same time retain in their positions those - who were here while the war was being carried on. It is a short-sighted policy which would provide for the employment of returned men at pense of turning so many more out of employment. It is not statesmanship, and it was not a sound policy for this ping contracts. country to adopt. The Commonwealth Government, apparently, said to themselves, "" Our only responsibility is to find positions for the returned men we will find those positions by turning others out of employment. make a large army of unemployed. The responsibility is not ours but that of the States.""' I want to make my position clear. - say that the responsibility of re-absorbing all the men who went to the Front, out causing a dislocation of conditions rested on the Commonwealth Government. they fell short of that they Mr T. fell short of the responsibility that fell upon them, and failed to discharge should their obligation. What I said, when speaking in the Sydney Town H all , on the 16th December, 1918, has happened. We Governhave that state of affairs existing in Unfortunately, we I put for it to the House that, if the Commonwealth Government had discharged its responsibilities in these respects, the ahead position which has arisen today would was not have arisen. They have failed, therethe fore, in bheir duty in regard to providing for the absorption of returned men without displacing a large body of other I desire to make it abundantly out clear, lest there be an attempt to You talk worse misrepresent me, that I believe that men it was the duty of the Commonthose wealth to see that all returned soldiers were reinstated in employment of some kind, and to do that without turnnot ing others into the street. Ministers that should have prepared for the rapid de: the velopment of the country; preparations war should have been made for its developby leaps and bounds. But I express the view of a large section of the publie when I say that this Government is in the competent and blundering. Evidence of that is furnished daily. The whole country is crying out against the War Service Homes administration. Ministers were not able to appoint the first War Service Homes Commissioner without making a blunder; they could not appoint his successor without making another blunder; and only this week we had a Bill to in redemnify them, and to validate what has the exbeen done by the Commissioners.",27
56,Mr MAKIN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"And there are the shipMr EYAN"" - Were I to attempt to enumerate the blunders of this Governand ment, the task would occupy all the time at my disposal. An y one of its blunders We will would have been sufficient in ordinary circumstances to bring about the removal of an Administration from office, but because these Ministers have been able to stir up all sorts of issues other than those I which concern the welfare of the people, which it is the chief duty of a Governwithment to promote, they still retain the reins of office. Although there is a great deal of unemployment in the country, and Ministers know that under their policy they have not been able to absorb the returned men and keep others at work, they have gone in for a policy of immigration without making any proper preparation for it. I am one of those who believe that Australia is such a great country that, properly governed, it will afford space for many millions of people. No doubt, one day it will be properly governed, because the good sense of the people cannot be kept down all the time. But immigration must be set about in a different way from that of the .present Government. I shall mention just one matter. I do not wish to occupy too much time, but I am intent on assisting these unfortunate unemployed, and shall, therefore, curtail my remarks. An understanding was arrived at between the Commonwealth Government and the Government, of Queensland to provide funds for railway construction to make the Burnett lands available, the Commonwealth realizing that the responsibility providing capital for that purpose rested on them.",27
57,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The honourable member has either not read the reports of the Conferences between the Commonwealth and State Ministers, or he is misrepresenting what took place.",28
58,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I say myself that this responsibility rests upon the Commonwealth Government.,28
59,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,That is another matter. You said at first that there had been an agreement.,28
60,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The agreement was arrived at because the Commonwealth must have realized the responsibility. A favourable report was made upon these lands, but the Commonwealth Government have done nothing. They say that they cannot do anything because they have not the money. ""Will the Acting Prime Minister have us believe that he is unable to provide £2,000,000 for the development of the largest and richest area that Australia has in one block? These are Crown lands which could be utilized for the settlement of no fewer than 10,000. persons. If that-cannot be done with the credit of this great country it is because of the incompetence of those who occupy the Treasury bench.",28
61,Mr MCGEAXH,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,O r lack of sympathy.,28
62,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Yes. I prefer, however, to make no personal suggestions.",28
63,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,You have done so. You have said that this Government is blundering and - incompetent.,28
64,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"That is something for which, I suppose, the right honourable member is not personally responsible. He and his Ministers are merely not big enough to meet the situation. At all events, while the right honourable gentleman is at the head of the Government of this great continent, unemployment and distress are rampant, and .he contents himself with saying, "" It is not my duty, but that of the States, to provide employment."" He would shuffle off responsibility and put it on some one else. It is time that this state of affairs was brought to an end. If I wished to give another illustration of the incompetence of the Government and of their responsibility for the unemployment which prevails, I would of mention the dismissal, without notice, of nearly 2,000 men who were employed at Cockatoo Island. Representations were made by a Sydney committee for the prompt employment of these men, a member of that committee being Sir Joseph Carruthers, a gentleman who is not a member of the Labour party nor one of it's supporters. Ministers, apparently, acted quite heartlessly. They threw these men out of work without regard to the fact that there was no employment, for them elsewhere. What .did it matter? They, said that .they were .unable to provide funds to pay for the work that was being done, and they had not the energy to appeal to Parliament for money. They therefore threw the men out. However, I have taken the opportunity of dealing with their conduct in a report which I have signed in conjunction with the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony). I mention the matter now ' to show 'how Ministers fail to realise their responsibility for the unemployment which exists. The function of all Governments is to make their peoples happy, contented, and prosperous; but, instead of doing that, our friends opposite talk in "" hifalutin'"" style about the Japanese Treaty and other matters, hoping thus to draw away the attention of the people from the evils which surround them. The object of the amendment is to bring back to the notice of thosu who occupy the Treasury bench a sense of responsibility and obligation. They have failed to realise their responsibilities, and to discharge their obligations, and it is our duty to impress this upon them.",28
65,Mr BLAKELEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Darling) [3.32] - In seconding the amendment, I congratulate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Ryan) on the way in which he has put his case. We who support him deem it to bo our duty to place before Parliament and the people of Australia, in as strong language as possible, the position of unfortunates who are finding it difficult to live. The Acting Prime Minister and his colleagues merely shrug their shoulders and say, "" This is not a question for the Commonwealth, but one for the States to deal with."" ' There are no responsibilities which these Ministers have not striven to shift to other shoulders. The present depression, industrial and financial, is the aftermath of the war; but this Government made certain definite promises. Yet many thousands of men in this State, and elsewhere throughout Australia-re turned"" soldiers and others-ar e begging the Commonwealth and the State Governments to relieve them, and are writing letters to the members of the various Parliaments of Australia. Something like 50,000 men are asking for the right to earn enough to keep, body and soul, together.",29
66,Dr EARLE PAGE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,What is the proportion of unemployed in each State?,29
67,Mr BLAKELEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I do not know; but when our organization met in congress recently in Melbourne, the unemployed of Australia were estimated to be - about 50,000.",29
68,Mr MAHONY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"There are 20,000 in this State. - Mr BLAKELEY - If they were all in the one place, neither these Ministers nor any others could continue to govern the country without doing something for them. If Ministers would try to realise the plight, not only of returned men, but of* many others, they would see the seriousness of the position. This country produces enough food to feed twice its population. It has unlimited land and unlimited wealth. Sir JOSEPH COOK.:-Whic h the Commonwealth does not control.",29
69,Mr BLAKELEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,This wealth is allowed to stay in the land-simply because Ministers will not realise their responsibilities.,29
70,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"We have no responsibilities, because we have no functions in regard to land matters.",29
71,Mr BLAKELEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Of course, the Government will say that they have no responsibility! But this is a national matter, aud the aftermath of the war'.",29
72,Mr CORSER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,It rests with the States.,29
73,Mr BLAKELEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The Commonwealth are in absolute control of the continent. It is futile to say to the Queensland or New South Wales Government, "" This is your funeral."" Who was responsible for the hundreds of thousands of men who left this country for the war? First, the Federal Labour Government, and then their successors, the present Government. And promises were made by each which have not been kept. Reference has been made to a meet? ing of the Australian Workers Union in Queensland, which passed a resolution condemning the Labour Government of that State. It was not an Australian Workers Union meeting, held under its constitution.",29
74,Mr CORSER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Of course not! They were, the samemen, although their meeting was not held under the constitution of - the Australian Workers Union. Mr BLAKELEY!-What is to prevent the honourable member from getting a few members of the Australian Workers Union and persuading them to pass any resolution his. politics may dictate? I . am informed, however, that this meeting consisted principally of men who did not belong, and never have belonged, to the Australian Workers Union. The Government must do something. Apparently, the position will become worse. It has been said by men who are leading the unemployed that they refuse to starve. I say, calmly and dispassionately, that, no man should starve in this country while there is anything to eat. If the Government are not prepared to render some relief, men must keep body and soul together. If I were in the ranks of the unemployed tomorrow, and my wife and children were starving, I would hot peimit them tb continue so if there was anything to beg, borrow, or steal.",29
75,Mr GREGORY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Supposin g that men will not work?,30
76,Mr BLAKELEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"That is futile talk. Ninety-nino per cent, of the men in the ranks of the unemployed are willing to work, and are reasonable about it.",30
77,Mr GREGORY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"If you leave them alone. Mr BLAKELE f - Then I invito the honourable member and. his party to force the Government. to find work, and the facts will demonstrate themselves. I say that no work has been offered to men and refused. For every job offering, hundreds are anxious to get it. If the Government are not prepared to afford work, immediate steps should be taken to remove them. I hope they will realise some of their responsibilities, and take steps in the direction of enabling men to live.",30
78,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Parramatta-Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.40] - I have listened to tirades by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Ryan) and the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley)-tw o honourable members who, under cover of a pretence that they are seeking the welfare of the unfortunate and distressed unemployed, have seen fit to indulge in unadulterated party politics for quite fifty minutes of the sixty which they have occupied.",30
79,Mr MCDONALD,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,You have done nothing else all your life.,30
80,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The honourable member should be a good judge of that kind of thing. The greater part of the speech of the honourable member for West Sydney consisted of an apologia for Ryan and Ryanisni, and it was far removed from any reference to the unemployed. We have had a display of Ryan, the prophet: "" I told you so. Did I not say this, and did I not say that would happen after the war?"" The things which the honourable member did and did not do during the war would fill many volumes - indicated how very efficient he is. Out Honourable members interjecting,",30
81,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON, Order !,30
82,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The things which the honourable member said and did not say would fill as many volumes more.' For instance, he was on both sides of the fence about the conduct of the war. He' straddled both sides in many other ways. Did he not set out to raise the Ryan thousand ? And what sort of a job did he make of it? As a result of all the whipping up, he got about 250 men.",30
83,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,You know that is not true. There were nearly 500.,30
84,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Ver y well! Here is a case of 50 per cent, efficiency. The honourable member has been strong on efficiency this afternoon. Now he' writes himself down, in respect of one of the most important and vital jobs he ever undertook, as a man who is 50 per cent, efficient! Ho-norable members interjecting,",30
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Order I I have repeatedly called honourable members to order. The debate was inaugurated by the making of very serious charges against the Government, and the honourable member who initiated it was listened to attentively,' in a spirit of fair play, aud in compliance with the rules of the House. I ask honourable members now to listen to the reply of the Acting Prime Minister in' the same spirit, and not to force me to insist upon the observance of order.",30
86,Mr MCGRATH,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Would it be out of order for me to ask yoti, sir, to request the Acting Prime Minister to keep to the question under discussion? . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order ! That is a matter within my province. Honourable members again interjecting,",30
87,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Order ? If honourable members refuse to obey I shall be compelled to take the step of naming them.,30
88,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The Government have been denounced as blundering, inefficient, and incompetent. I was merely observing that there are many tests of efficiency, competency, and lack of blundering in the political career of the honourable member for West Sydney - I was pointing out one of the things which of his own mouth he has confessed that he is only 50 per cent, efficient. But there are other things in respect of his competency, efficiency, and freedom frem blundering which can be tested. The most striking illustration of his qualifications is being seen today in the State of Queensland itself. If we desire to see just what this competent, efficient, and blunder-free gentleman has done, we must go to the State which he onoe controlled, and where those attributes of his have been given free range. Most of Queensland's troubles today are traceable to the Government with which he was associated. The honourable member has spoken of the magnificent proposition contained in the Burnett lands. They do afford one of the finest projects in Australia. But why is it that the State Government with which he was associated could not raise sixpence on those lands? The answer is plain: the Ryan Government has destroyed the credit of Queensland! Mr. Theodore, the honourable member's successor, had the courage' to admit the fact. He has said that it is because bf certain things which the Ryan Government did that he cannot obtain loans in England. He cannot borrow, because people will not lend him money. Why will they not do so? Because he has legislated himself out of solemn contracts made with the laud-owners in Queensland.  then the people of Queensland have returned the present Labour Government.",30
89,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Yes, and Queensland is going from bad to worse. It is a case of cause and effect. So much for the efficiency of the honourable member for West Sydney. I propose now to say something upon the question, itself. The honourable member was good enough to present a case for the unemployed, as affecting Victoria. He made the astounding statement that there are 20,000 unemployed in this State alone. I do not believe there are 20,000 men in this State out of work and unable to find it. But, supposing that there are, how do we become responsible for them ? According to the figures quoted by the honourable member there are 550 brick and tile pottery workers out of employment. Does the honourable member allege that something the Commonwealth Government has done or managed the sale of wool. omitted to do has upset the brick and tile yards ?",31
90,Mr MCGRATH,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The Government are not finding money with which to build soldiers' homes. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER' - I again for that. appeal to the honourable member for Balthe larat to refrain from interjecting.,31
91,Mr MCGRATH,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,-The Acting Prime Minister asked a question and I replied to it.,31
92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The time for asking questions has passed. Charges have been made against ""the Government and it is due from the honourable member that he should listen tb the reply. I appeal to honourable members not to compel me to enforce the Standing Orders.",31
93,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"My reply to the allegations in regard to unemployment and our dereliction of duty in relation to the State of Victoria, are contained in the one fact that I have made available this year for expenditure in that State alone a sum approximating £10,000,000 for land settlement, soldiers' homes, and general repatriation. So if there be 20,000 unemployed in that State I may fairly claim that the Commonwealth Government has no obligation or responsibility in regard to. them. The same answer applies relatively to the rest of Australia. The honourable member for West Sydney said that 400 bootmakers are out. of employment; something this Government has done or left undone we are led to suppose has thrown those men out of work! There are 2,000 unemployed in the clothing trade! What have we done to throw them out of employment? I know that we have, with the assistance of honourable members opposite, passed the Tariff which imposes a good stiff duty on woollen goods. There were no more enthusiastic advocates of increased duties than the honourable members of the Opposition. If , therefore, the action of the Government in regard to the Tariff has led to this unemployment, surely those honourable members will share the responsibility with us. We are told that there are 5,000 members of the Victoria-Riverina Branch of the Australian Workers Union out of employment. Are the Government responsible for that?",31
94,Mr MCGRATH,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Yes , because they mis",31
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Order !,31
96,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"In the building trade there are said to be 1,000 unemployed, and in the liquor trades 400. I will admit that something the Government have not done may be responsible Other workers .mentioned are manufacturing grocers and the fodder and fuel employees. It is difficult to find out what is really meant by the Opposition in regard to these matters. I read in the press within the last day or two a violent diatribe against the Government by one of the most respected and capable leaders' of the. Labour Party, 1 Senator Gardiner, who declared that unemployment was - due, not to the blundering and inefficiency of the Government, as his co-leader in this House says, but to the Tariff which honourable members opposite assisted to pass.",31
97,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,.Were not the Government responsible for that?,32
98,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Fro m first to last the request for higher duties came from the Opposition side of the Chamber, and while the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) is flagellating the Government and alleging that the fault lies with us and nobody else, his co-leader in another place says that the present state of affairs is due to the Tariff which honourable members opposite demanded and assisted to pass through this House. Of which of these two leaders am I to take notice? Here are two voices-ou e alleging that the unemployment is due to nothing that the Labour party have done, and another declaring that the present state of affairs has come about because of the Tariff, which honourable members opposite assisted to make as high as possible.",32
99,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I assure the right honourable gentleman that the amendment I moved today has the entire approval of Senator Gardiner - Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order !,32
100,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Does that help matters? The mystery deepens. My old friend in another place evidently has a forked tongue, for, according to the, honourable member, he sneaks in two ways. But I am stressing his own declaration that the unemployment today is solely, or largely, due to the Tariff.",32
101,Mr MCGRATH,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,What about Cockatoo' Island?,32
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Order 1,32
103,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The honourable member for West Sydney delved into ancient history and said that some of the troubles that have arisen today are due to our conduct during the war, to the fact that, we subordinated the interests of Australia, and but for that there would be no unemploy. ment. Was a more astounding statement ever made by a responsible political leader? What the Government did during the war was to .sell £400,000,000 worth of Australian produce, for which we secured the .highest possible price. We fought all - during the war .to get the last shilling obtainable in London for the primary producers of this country, and all the thanks we get from the honourable member for West Sydney is the statement that, in doing that and carrying the producers along during that period, we have caused the unemployment of today. The honourable member knows better than that, and for a leader to try, at this time of the day, to exploit the war sentiment for the purpose of disparaging the Government is one of the most paltry and contemptible things of which any leader could be guilty.",32
104,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I have said the same all along. Sir JOSEPH' COOK,- I have already alluded to the honourable member's dual attitude on the war and during the war. Of course, he never believed that Australia should have done what it did during the war; he has said that.",32
105,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I - never said that.,32
106,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The honourable member said that Australia did too much.,32
107,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I never said it. "" Sir JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member has repeatedly said it.",32
108,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I challenge the Acting Prime Minister to show where I made that statement.,32
109,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The honourable member said, frequently, that Australia had no right to incur-more responsibility than any other portion of the British Dominions. If that does not mean that in doing more we took a responsibility that we should not have taken, I do not know the meaning of words.",32
110,Mr MCGRATH,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member for West Sydney has denied the statement made by the' Acting Prime Minister, and I understand that it is a rule of debate that fi denial by an honourable member shall be accepted. Mr DEPUTY .SPEAKER (Hon. J. M. Chanter) - It is a rule of Parliament that when a statement is denied the denial shall be accepted. If the honourable member for West Sydney denied the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister, I believe the honourable gentleman will accept the denial.",32
111,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Of course: The honourable member for West Sydney accused the Government of humbugging the people.,33
112,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Does not the Acting Prime Minister think that was a very moderate criticism?,33
113,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Comin g from the honourable member, it was; but when he was making those charges I could not help 'remembering some humbugging: that had taken place in another quarter. I remember that a colleague of the honourable member in another State, where most of thetrouble is being experienced today, said during the last State election campaign that if the people would put him into power the Government would deal with unemployment and profiteering in forty-eight liours.",33
114,Mr RYAIT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Who said that?,33
115,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Mr Storey.,33
116,Mr RYAW,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I do not believe he said it.,33

118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Order !,33
119,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,It is on record that Mr Storey said,33
120,Mr BLAKELEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,That is a deliberate falsehood.!,33
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I give the honourable member for Darling (Mr: Blakeley) anotherwarning. I do not wish to resort to extreme measures, but these continuous interjections, and refusal to allow a Minister of the Crown to reply to charges against the Governand ment constitute the.most unfair conduct I have ever witnessed in all my parliaby, mentary life. I appeal, to the sense fair glay of honourable members, and ask them to restrain themselves. Thoy cau exercise tlieir rights later to speak to the the Burnett lands? Not one. question.",33
122,Mr NICHOLLS,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The Acting Prime Minister is not replying fairly.,33
123,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The honourable member for Macquarie is out of order.,33
124,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The honourable member for Darling accused me of a deliberate falsehood. I ask that those words be withdrawn.,33
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I did not understand that remark to to the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister. I understood that it applied to Mr Storey's statement.,33
126,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"It applied to my statement; but let it pass. I repeat that Mr Storey said upon the political platform that if he were returned to power he would deal with profiteering within forty-eight hours. It is quite true that he did something, and the result of his action is seen today in that State. I regret; for the sake of the credit of my own State, that it is in the trouble it is in today. After spending more loan money than ever was spent in any previous year, there is more unemployment in that State than there has ever been before. During the last year the Storey Government have spent £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 of loan moneys, and I , as Commonwealth Treasurer, have given them another £9,000,000 or £10,000.000, and the result of the expenditure of nearly £20,000,000 of loan money by Mr Storey and. his followers is more unemployment in that State tothan there 'has ever been in any single year throughout its existence.",33
127,Mr GABB,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Is not Holman to blame for some of that?,33
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The . honourable member is out of order,.",33
129,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"In the face of these facts the Acting Leader of the Op* position' charges the Commonwealth the Government with having humbugged the people in connection with unemployment with inefficient performance of our functions. Will all this recrimination the honourable member help the unof employed? Has he made a single useful suggestion for dealing with this problem; except by reiterating the statement about He is more concerned with Ryan than with the unemployed; he is more concerned with what he said,, and. in justifying his own attitude, than with the distressful conditions of the people outside. His troubles about the unemployed! His concern, and that of the seconder of. the amendr ment, are always with the political side of the unemployment, and they are exploiting it today for all they are worth.",33
130,Mr BLAKELEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,-What are the Gobe applied vernment doing about it?,33
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I have called the honourable member for Darling to order two or three times. He seems inclined to defy the Chair. I ask him not to repeat his offence.,34
132,Mr BLAKELEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I will not. I do not wish to be put out of the House for a week.,34
133,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The honourable member (Mr Ryan) accuses the Governture ment of making no preparation for the return of the soldiers, and the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) says that we ought to have taken the lands of the States and ourselves operated themthat we ought to have taken the f u l sponsibility on our own shoulders. He, and every honourable memher opposite, knows that we have nothing whatever to do with the administration of the lands of the States; they know that this Golast vernment is limited in its functions and powers, and can do but little in the of land settlement. That function and duty has been laid on the States, and, discharge until something else is done, there the ohief and primary responsibility must lie. Is it to be said that the State would us to do what we liked with the Burnett lands ? That suggestion is not made now; it is not said that the State will t u r those lands to the Commonwealth and to let us do what we choose with our own money on them. What is said is, on contrary, "" Give us the money so that we may develop our own lands."" It is the primary function of these who own the lands to find the money to finance them. If we can, in combination, arrange for the opening up of these lands for some immigration purpose-althoug h no promise has been given, and no obligawritten tion has been undertaken-that is quite different proposition. But the statement is made that the Commonwealth is chiefly responsible for the settlement of soldiers on the lands of Australia. My reply is that we have nothing to do with the administration of land matters-that we can money? only act in so far as the States permit us. money either. What are the causes of unemployment today? They are far deeper and more remote than any actions of this. Governters ment. The causes are ample and simple, if people will only look for them, and strip their minds of local prejudices and political predilection. It is mean and contemptible for any Leader in Parliaorable ment to endeavour to make party political capital out of the distressful conditions obtaining today. The causes are not far to seek, and they have to do with the war. We cannot sell our wool today so remuneratively as we have been selling it , and we cannot get our produce to Europe, the people of which are hungry for it , but have not the money with which to purchase it . All this destruction of credit is the aftermath of the war; but I vento say that this country is suffering least of all the countries on the face of the earth. But the aftermath is there, and it is affecting us along with all other peoples. In my opinion', we in Australia will get over it more quickly than the l repeople of any other country; but, as I say, in the meantime the causes are there and are operating. The present conditions are not due to anything the Government has done. We spent more loan money year for developmental and settlement purposes than in any previous year way of our existence. We have raised money£25,000,000 to £30,000,000-in order to our side of the obligation. Will it be believed that while we have been spending this money in pursuance of our allow obligation to the soldiers, the States themselves have borrowed and spent about £36,000,000 of loan money in addition? n over The causes of the present conditions are be sought elsewhere than in any actions of the Commonwealth Government. They the are to be sought in the destruction of credit which is world-wide, and, so far as they relate themselves to particular places, here the cause of the destruction of credit is to be found in certain legislation which has taken place in Australia itself. It is no use talking - Mr Storey could not get money as he desired, for the simple reason that an act of his Government had down at h i r d of the value of lands a of Australia. These are the causes that are operating to produce unemployment. Mr Theodore cannot get money because he violated land'contracts in Queensland.",34

135,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The accusation made against me now in many quaris that I am getting too much.,34
136,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Y o u say you cannot get money; why not?,34
137,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I tell the honmember that I believe I can get money, and I am getting it in an ample and generous way f o i the discharge of all our obligations to the soldiers. I deny absolutely the allegations of honourable members that the troubles of today are in any way due to what the Commonwealth Government are doing, or have done in the recent past. Those troubles are due to world causes, and they will not be cured by political posturing or political exploitation. They will be cured only by means which have' oured similar troubles many times before, namely, by patient investigation and the application of such remedies as from time to time appear to meet the situation. In my opinion, the greatest remedy of all in Australia would be the reconcilement of conflicting class interests, and a, concentrated effort made to discharge our obligations, and live up to the responsibilities and duties we owe to one another. I believe that in that simple remedy alone lies the way out of much of our troubles, and that that course may soon be taken must be the earnest wish of every man who has a sincere love for his country and a desire to see it advance.",34
138,Mr MCGRATH,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Ballarat) [ 4 . 1 4 ] - I desire to support the amendment. I admit that after every war there is great unemployment; I know of no war that has not been followed immediately by bad industrial conditions. But I claim that the Governments of Australia, and the Federal Government in particular, have a duty in connection with the unemployed question. This same Federal Government was in power through the war. The members of it made every effort to get young men.to leave the country, and made all kinds of promises that they would be fair l y treated on their return. The Government must not imagine that they have done their duty to the returned soldiers by finding work for them for three months.",35
139,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"We have £100,000,000 on the returned soldiers.",35
140,Mr MCGRATH,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The Government have squandered most of that moneyi t has not been spent amongst the returned soldiers. Sir. JOSEPH COOK - That is easy to say.,35
141,Mr MCGRATH,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The Government have bought land at fabulous prices, and squandered money on the building of War Service Homes in every direction. It is most unfair for the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) to infer that this £100,000,000 has been spent amongst the returned soldiers'; as a fact, it has been spent mostly amongst the profiteers of Australia. There are members of the Soldiers Association in this House, and I wish them to take note of what I say today. The Repatriation Department is evidently under the impression that they finalized the returned soldiers when they found them jobs. We must remember that those who went to the Front were not as good men when they came back; and to say that the Repatriation Department has finished with them' when it finds them work for three days, three weeks, or three months, is not in accordance with the promises made by the Govermnent prior to enlistment. That, however, is exactly what has occurred. Men have been found jobs, and perhaps their health has not allowed them to continue at them; but still the Government considers that it is finished with them. That is most unfair and cruel, and a clear breaking of every promise made to the men before they went to the Front. It is useless for the Acting Prime Minister to say that'this unemployment is most acute in Queensland > and New South Wales, where State Labour Ministries are in power. I ask the honourable gentleman to note the fact that the only State that is losing a member in this House is Victoria, where there is an anti-Labour Government in power.",35
142,Dr MALONEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,And it is for the second time.,35
143,Mr MCGRATH,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"That is so.  Wales is getting an extra member. Mr MoGRATH - Yes , and at the expense of Victoria, while the increase of population in Queensland almost obspent tained another member for that State. This shows that in the two States mentioned the legislation has been of such a character as to induce an increase of population much greater than is the case in States governed by the anti-Labour party. The Acting Prime Minister, in the course of his speech, made not one promise regarding unemployment. He did not promise to do one thing to find work or assist the returned men of others. He craftily ignored the aotion of the Government in throwing 1,500 men out of employment at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and went on with a tirade of abuse. I remind the honourable gentleman that these abusive methods do not feed anybody. The state of affairs is most serious in the country today. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) said that he believed that there were 20,000 men unemployed in Victoria alone, arid my opinion is that he under-estimated the number. But whatever the number may be, I can assure this Government, and also the State Governments, that if the unemployment continues through the winter, the men are not going to "" take it lying down."" They refuse to be the only sufferers from the war; they have wives and children to support, and yet they see the Federal Government, in conjunction with the anti-Labour Government of Victoria, spending the people's money in flooding this country with immigrants. If this immigration continues there is going to bemore than trouble. The Government are spending from £20,000 to £50,000 a year on a few officials in London, in order to bring immigrants to Australia, and I can only say I am really sorry for thoseimmicrrants. Here is a letter I .have received, from one: Sir,- I desire to bring under your, notice the fact that I was induced to come to this country by the immigration agents of the State Government of Victoria. They held out glowing prospects to me; yet, sir, I have' tramped all over Victoria looking for work, and I am sorry to report that no work is procurable, in this. State. I consider steps should be taken to arrest the gross misrepresentation of the real state of affairs in this country. I will have to get my passage charges home again from my relatives in the Old Country, and when I do .reach home again I will - endeavour to place the state of Australia, before the English public in the true light. I am, air, yoursrespectfully, That: letter reminds .me of the statement made by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson), and, I think, the, honourable member for Wimmera (Mr . Stewart), that there is any amount of contract work to be obtained in the country.

The fact of thousands of unemployed being in Australia today does not justify the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) i? narrowing down those conditions in the form of a charge that they apply chiefly to Queensland and New South Walesi I would remind him that the latter State has a greater population than ever before.

Is it not much more difficult to administer the affairs of a large State than those small one ? A u d is it not true that things depends on administration? This Administration and this Parliament have their own responsibilities, and it is of use for the Leader of the Government talk of what has been done in New South Wales and Queensland. But, even if the Acting Prime Minister's allegations were correct, ho is not justified in refusing to right. touch upon the main issues in the charges laid against this Government. There are thousands of unemployed in Australia because of the direct acts of the Federal Government, and I maintain that immibears grants should not be brought in today to take the place of Australians or to swell, the ranks of the unemployed.",42

232,Mr CHARLTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The Postmaster General (Mr Wise) may do so. I have sufficient to prove to the h i l trayown of the facts as I recalled them. i l It was owing to the Prime Minister in tervening that the flat rate contract for Is. 3^d. per lb. for our wool fell through; had it been carried to fruition, as the to honourable member for Balaclava intended that it should, it would have meant £50,000,000 or £60,000,000 coming to this country, thus affording additional capital wherewith, to reduce the ranks of unemployment today.",42

We, on the other hand, have to look after the responsibiliexpenditure. 1 ties that are Teposed in us by the Coneconomy; stitution, and the matters to. which I have referred come within the purview of this Parliament. These various causes have like the present. been the means of laying from 10,000 to 15,000 men idle. These arc our responsibilities. What do the Government pose to do to prevent unemployment becoming even more acute? Do they intend to get Commonwealth works started again? Will they give attention to the timber industry in Queensland, in which hundreds of men have been paid off cause there is no work for them? cannot deny that this Parliament has re-' sponsibilities, and the time has arrived when they must be shouldered. can be no escape from that position.",43

244,Mr CHARLTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"At any rate, he says that the State is committed to the I find no fault with true on the contrary, I admit it to - be a good thing; but it is false economy to lay thousands of men idle at a time",43
245,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Mr Lang received £4,250,000 from the Commonwealth for proland settlement alone.",43
246,Mr CHARLTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I do not know whether or not that is so, but if he received the money. I hope he made good use of it. There is another cause of unemployment in connection with .the Rebepatriation Department. The records of We the Department would show that hundreds of returned soldiers, who are partially incapacitated, or almost fully inThere capacitated, have been deprived of their pensions, and have had to seek light emout ployment. These men are not fit to-work, exand should not be working. They should still be receiving their pensions; but the pensions have been withdrawn, and they have to make the best of the circumstances. I have received a letter today about a man who borrowed money from the Department for the furnishing of a and War Service Home. At the time he was receiving a pension of £4 10s. a week, and thought he could meet his obligations; but suddenly his pension was cut off. He is partially incapacitated, but has had to - seek light employment, at which he cannot engage continuously, because his leg fails him at times. His earnings are very modest; but the Repatriation Department pressing him to come to an arrangement for the repayment of the advance furniture on a threat that if he fails to do so the Department will take aotion against him. The man says that he is not earning sufficient .to pay his way, and that but for the fact that business people are giving him credit he would not be - lUe to carry on. At the same time,, the ""War Service Homes Department is threatening him that if he does not pay the instalments that are due upon his house action will be taken against him. He is being squeezed between the two Departments. Instead of the Government being sympathetic towards these men, and assisting them, they are forcing them into the labour market, where they are displacing other men. It is the duty of the Government to see that men ""who are partially or wholly incapacitated are not deprived of their pensions on the pretext that their incapacity is not due to warlike operations, but to causes that were pre-existent. These men were accepted for military service, and sent to the Front to fight, and on their return were paid pensions, which have been suddenly cut off. If it were possible to frame an estimate of these various actions to which I have referred, it would be found that the Commonwealth Government are directly responsible for not less' than 15,000 men having been thrown out of employment. That being so, it is the duty of the Government and .of the House to see that money is made available, and that Commonwealth activities are.put in full, swing in order to help and fortify the people in their present hour of stress.",43
247,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Grampians) [5.11] In. view of the widespread unemployment, and consequent distress, I am grateful to the Acting Leader of the' Opposition (Mr. 1 Ryan) for having brought this matter before the House. I cannot conceive of any subject of greater importance which the House could discuss today than that of unemployment, its causes, and possible remedies. I ' deeply regret however, the atmosphere' in which, so far, the matter has. been debated in this House, and if responsible men in this Chamber and elsewhere are to do anything effective to diminish unemployment, they will have to address themselves to the problem in a spirit different from that which has been exhibited this afternoon. Two lists have been placed before us, one by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, and the other by the Acting Prime Minister, in regard to unemployment in Victoria. I do'not think it"" is material to the argument whether the number of unemployed in particular trades has been - over-stated . or understated.",44
248,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Surely it is important, and material to the argument, to know whether there are 20,000 or only 5,000 out of employment in one State.",44
249,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Certainly , if there are 20^000 men out of employment in Victoria, the problem is more serious and of more pressing importance than .if the unr employed numbers-only 5,000.",44
250,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"If there are 20,000 but of employment, the matter is four times more serious, and the figures are four times more material to the argument.",44
251,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"-What is material to the argument 'is information, as to whether unemployment does exist to a large extent, whether it has increased, whether it can be cured, and whether effective steps to that end are being taken.. I notice that the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) included amongst the Victorian unemployed 5,000 members of the Victoria-Riverina branch of the Australian Workers Union. If that is correct, the total of 13,500 unemployed, mentioned by him cannot be. charged wholly against Victoria. Other, trades quoted by the honourable member, included-building , 1,000 unemployed, and clothing, 2,100. From yesterday's newspaper"" I haye a similar list in regard to New South Wales, and I particularly note that there are in that State not less than 6,000 unemployed transport workers, 585 cold storage employees, and 700 engine-drivers and firemen. In view of the class of occupations in which such"" large numbers are employed, it would appear that unemployment is not greatly due to lack of Govern1 ment expenditure. I propose to consider the extent to which any Government can provide employment for any considerable - number of people.. T.o this question the words of Goldsmith seem appropriateHow small ""of all that human hearts endure That part which laws or' kings can cause or cure. It is claimed by honourable members opposite that the present unemployment can be very laigely cured. They have charged the Commonwealth Government with not having spent enough money in providing work for' the people. To-morrow the same charge may be laid against the State Governments. But, in reality, unemployment can be removed only by attacking the causes. One form of cure suggested by our friends opposite is to induce the State Governments and the Commonwealth Government to spend more money. I submit, however, that, unless Governments are engaged in reproductive undertakings, they cannot in reality provide profitable employment for any one except by depriving other people of profitable employment. True, a Government may"" put a certain number of people on the wages and salary list; but every £1 spent in this way is taken out of the pockets of some one else, and deprives the general citizens of the means of providing private employment. I think the House is fully impressed with that aspect of the question, and I need not dwell on it further. I submit, now, that unemployment is not caused by a lack of Government expenditure. Why, the totals of such expenditure, past and present, are appalling!  Sydney newspapers there is a statement that £3;200,000 is owing by the Federal Gdvernment to the State Government, a promise to pay which has not been-kept. Sir JOSEPH . COOK - The honourable member has made that statement twenty times.",44
252,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"- I am not in a position to confirm or deny the statement}, which, in my opinion, has no bearing on the question before us. i repeat that unemployment is not caused by any lack of Government expenditure, and any such expenditure in the past, or in the future, will not cure - unemployment, but will aggravate ""it.",45
253,Mr RILEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,What will cure unemployment ?,45
254,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"As to that, let me again.refer to the figures which I quoted? We .are told that the number of transport workerf out of employment in Sydney is no less than 6,000, and I ask the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr. Riley) what he thinks are the reasonable and probable causes of this?' Is it not largely due to the falling-off of - employment in everything connected with ship ping? ' Mr Riley - Hig h freights.",45
255,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The honourable member anticipates me - in suggesting that the excessive ocean freights are preventing goods from being snipped from Australia; and we must also take into account the very high Inter-State freights, though personally I have not had so much experience in regard to the latter. However, the result is that goods are not being carried that otherwise would be. Mr RiLEY --There are also high rates of interest.",45
256,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I have been paying interest practically all my life; but I do not consider that the higher rates now prevailing are affecting the conditions to any appreciable extent. The position is that the costs of production throughout the world have been enormously enhanced during and since the war, and have now reached the point at which the consumer refuses to pay. The result is that the shopkeepers are unable to purchase from the producers, or the wholesale people, and thus production in every industry is affected. Some reference was made by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) to the lack of' employment in timber mills, many of which, he said, are being closed. We heard much of this subject during the debate on the Tariff ",45
257,Mr RILEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I thought there would have been plenty of employment' now there are higher duties.,45
258,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"We are not now discussing the Tariff; but, if we were, I should remind honourable members that the advocates of high duties have been able to pile Pelion on Ossa-practicall y every-duty asked for has been given.",45
259,Mr BELL,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"-Oh , no!",45
260,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I admit that even the Committee was staggered at some of the proposals. However, .no one can posssibly say that there is unemployment in Australia because the duties' are not high enough. Inmy opinion, .the unemployment in the .timbertrade is obviously caused by the excessive cost of building. This cost has become so excessive, so preposterous, and extortionate, that people axe refusing - to. buy or - build houses .until Lt is reduced; and the same applies .in almost every industry in Australia at .the present moment. During .the war, and immediately afterwards, the whole world 1 passed - through a phase <of .almost mad extravagance. Money was .circulated - very f r.eely, and vast numbers of .people seemed to think , that the supply would last for ever; they got .the idea that the natural thing was to get rid of what money they had in the quickest possible way, and were willing to pay any price asked. This led the shopkeepers and other traders to raise their prices, and costs of production were raised to follow. It may be that prices were raised first; but, at any rate, all increases were passed on* to the consumers, and so long as they were willing 'to pay, everything was all right. But it was quite impossible for that state of affairs to last; and now the time has come when consumers refuse to pay. I do not dispute the figures as to the number, of those who are out of .employment; but the only way to securing employment is to make it profitable for employers to employ; every other remedy is futile to the last degree. It is 'a matter of re-adjustthis ment; of asking the people of Australia and the rest of the world whether they are prepared to adapt .themselves to the changed conditions, or prefer to run violently down a steep place into the sea of unemployment, distress, and disaster.",45
261,Mr MAKIN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,How would you suggest that the re-adjustment be made?,46
262,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"In the first place, by a reduction in the cost of living; and, in the second place, by a re-adjustment in the cost of production.",46
263,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The cost of production surely determines the cost of:living?,46
264,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Not entirely; the honourable member has put his finger on a very important economic truth, which, however, is subject to conditions and qualifications. In my opinion, it is high time there' was a truce- a party truce and a class-prejudice truce-o n the questions of the cost of living and unemployment. I am. distressed beyond measure at the attitude of speakers this afternoon, in the earlier part of the debate, who regard the serious and important subject before us as a party matter-as a means of attacking or defending the Commonwealth Government or the Government in some bf the States. I deplore any attempt to make this a class question; it is a matter for the whole people to consider and remedy in consultation. Now, how can the cost of living be brought down? In this connection I think all classes are to blame. First, the consumers, the large body of whom are the wage-earners, are largely responsible for the increased cost of living, and they themselves, to a large extent, have the remedy in their own hands.",46
265,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,What does that mean - to go without?,46
266,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,No ; it means to put into operation some organization capable of demanding lower prices.,46
267,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,In some cases such' attempts are boycotted at the sources of supply.,46
268,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"That may be; but, at the same time, I do not consider that the' people of Australia have made anything like a serious attempt to put into practice the principles of distributive co-operation, which would largely solve' the problem of the high cost of living. In connection I should like to refer to an incident which happened earlier in my life. Immediately after I left school I was sent to a small town in the West Riding of Yorkshire to learn the wool trade,"" and I found myself in a centre of cooperative effort. There, the working people, in order to obtain the necessaries and comforts of life at reasonable prices, had saved and invested their money in what are called co-operative stores.",46
269,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Was that Rochdale?.,46
270,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"No ; but it was not 50 miles from Rochdale, and was inhabited by the same class of people.",46
271,Mr RILEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"That idea is as old, as .the hills.",46
272,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I know it is.,46
273,Mr HILL,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,It is not too old to copy.,46
274,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"That is quite true. ,",46
275,Mr RILEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"There are co-operative stores all over England, and still there is unemployment.",46
276,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Le t us go step by step; I am now dealing with a suggestion to reduce the cost of living. These people,' following the example of the Rochdale pioneers, placed themselves in a position to buy goods wholesale for cash, and rented buildings from, which they could distribute them amongst themselves.",46
277,Mr RILEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Supposin g they were all unemployed?,46
278,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"If the people of Australia, and, indeed, of the whole world, took steps to see that they did not pay excessive prices for the goods purchased by them, that would go a long way towards solving the unemployed problem. Eighteen months ago there was not a great deal of unemployment. In Australia, as elsewhere, wages were high and employment was more abundant than at any other time in our history. If the working classes at that time had adopted some such method as I have just mentioned, they would have been in a much better position today to cope with the unemployed difficulty. Although there are large numbers of unemployed, there are enormous numbers who today are not unemployed, butowho are in receipt of good wages, and have the . means of living very comfortably, provided they can buy goods at reasonable prices. If those people would devote some of their savings to co-operative effort they would do well.",46
279,Mr BELL,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Who is to take the first step ?,47
280,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The people themselves, and .this House, instead of engag- ing in party wrangling, should assist them. The discussion of questions of this kind should be absolutely free from party strife and class prejudices. I admit that those who are not in employment cannot do anything in the direction of co-operative effort for obtaining goods at reasonable prices, but unless those of the working classes who are in - employment are prepared, t'o take steps to reduce the cost of living, they will he lacking in their duty' to themselves. That is my point. I come now to another aspect of the cost of living. We have had many Boards and price-fixing regulations, but I think it is now admitted that all price fixing regulations have practically failed. They have failed for several reasons. In the first place, the penalties become inoperative, and, in addition to that, everybody knows that, for all practical purposes, it is impossible to get people to inform - against those who violate a price fixing regulation.",47
281,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Why did the honourable member, and those associated with him, ,fix the price of wool during war time?",47
282,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,We did not. wool-growers of Australia sold their wool; they did .not fix the price against any one.,47
283,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Who fixed the price at Is. 3id..per lb.?,47
284,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,That is the price at which the wool was sold by the wool growers of Australia to the Imperial Government. We provided the Imperial Government and the people of Australia with wool at the cheapest price. There was no price-fixing in the ordinary sense of the term. There was merely a sale.,47
285,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I suppose that incidentally the wool-grower took all that he could get.""",47
286,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I have not met, in any country, any people, whether traders, merchants, distributors, producers, or working men, who have not been prepared to takeall the reward they could get in the shape of prices, profits, or wages. They all consider that what they get is just reward for the services they render the community, and I am not so sure that they are wrong. I repeat that the people should take steps to enable goods to be distributed amongst themselves at a lower cost. I have dealt with the question of the cost of living. I come now to the cause of unemployment in Australia at the present moment, ' and which I fear is not likely to improve under present conditions, nor in view of ' the present attitude of the public mind. Mr Riley,-Would a change of Government help?",47
287,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I do not think it would, . .",47
288,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"A change of Government policy would. ' Mr JOWETT - No r do I consider a change of Government policy would do any, good whatever. What is wanted is a change on the part of the people themselves. The cause df unemployment is that in many important industries and large businesses it does not pay to carry on at present costs' and present prices. If we want the people to be prosperous - and profitably employed we must have the employers of the community engaged in industries that are profitable. From the moment an industry ceases to be pro-, fitable, because the prices which those engaged in it are receiving for their goods do not compensate them for the cost of The producing or selling them, there is a tendency to diminish operations. That, one might almost sayj is a natural law, and is so obvious that it is amazing to find that it is continually disregarded in con<.nexion with unemployment. If *»e want 10100 Supply [REPBESENXATIVES.J the people to be prosperously, employed We must see to it that it pays employers to carry on their business. - Mr Riley - How is that to be done?",47

290,Mr RILEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The honourable member is a practical man; will he tell us how that is to be done?,48
291,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"It is to be done by a total readjustment of costs. I can say no more. Every one' knows what the costs are. , Mp. GrABB.t^-Say, like Barwell, "" Wages - must come down.""",48
292,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I do not think it is a question of. wages more than of anything else. It is a question of the complete re.adjustment of costs. These costs have been raised to meet a period of very high prices."" We are now entering upon a period, of very low prices."" We have already done, so, ""so far as wholesale prices are concerned.",48
293,Mr LAVELLE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,In what respect?,48
294,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"This - afternoon I received from Sydney a letter dated 12th July, in which the) statement appears "" Both the. sheep and cattle market yesterday suffered a severe set back."" This letter is from a reputable firm of fat stock salesmen, and it sets out that "" Prime mutton made 3^d., other mutton 2£d. to 2id.""",48

297,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,At what price is that mutton being retailed ?,48
298,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I cannot say. Every consumer should investigate that - point for himself. I could give some extraordinary instances of the variation, in prices paid for the same commodities in different shops in the same locality.",48
299,Mr LAVELLE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The figures just quoted by the honourable member show how necessary it was to move as we did a week, or two ago that the 'Government should come to the assistance of the graziers who were suffering. Yet the honourable member, and his .party refused to assist us. Mr JOWETT:- I think: that they prove that the consumers themselves (Formal). should take steps to see that they get the benefit of these reduced prices in their , retail purchases. .As long as. they do not do that, they cannot reproach the Government or any one else. There is little that the Government can do to diminish unemployment except by setting in operation the machinery of industry by means of which private employers will find it profitable to go on producing once more to the fullest extent, and so,to give the fullest employment to the people, and that is not to be secured * by introducing into a discussion of this kind party politics^ or any appeal.to class prejudices.",48
300,Dr MALONEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Melbourne) [5.47] For 33 years it has been my object to try to prevent unemployment, and I have come to the conclusion that unemployment in times of peace is as great a curse as bloodshed in'war. I regret that we do not seem to be getting very much ""forrader"" in dealing with this problem. Many schemes for coping with it have been formulated. Among these is the: proposal that we should establish home farms where a mail out of work would be able to go with his wife and family and find employment in some of the minor branches of rural, industry, and if asfche result of this experience he and his wife ; took a liking to country life, the Government should assist him,to settle on the land. While I admit tin a certain extent that .the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) is justified, in blaming the States, and particularly the Victorian State Government, for not doing their, work in connection with soldier settlement, still he cannot deny that it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to settle soldiers on the land. I . have here a letter from a relative in' Sydney whom I advised to go on the ' land, and I shall refer to his case without any desire to criticise the Government. The position is that two married men wanted to take up land. One of them hadhad farm, experience, and so had the wife of the other "" man. The men had been mates at the war; and the wives were friendly, so the four thought that if they took one farm they could work it together. But they found that the regulations prevented that, and that the Lands Department could only offer them single farms. That would have been a happy partnership,' and I cannot see why it could not have been arranged.",48

302,Dr MALONEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Wit h regard to immigration, I think that we are eutitled to demand - from the Government that every returned soldier who wants land shall be settled on it before immigrants are brought here. When that is done, and' so many men have been removed from the army of unemployed, we can hold out our hands in welcome to every person of the white races who will come here. Tho greatest advertisement that Australia has had was given by her soldiers, who blazoned her name in letters of glory by their deeds during the war. I have had letters from the sons of friends in Old England, saying .that they intended to come lo this land^ because a country .that could pay 6s. a day to its soldiers, while British, soldiers were getting only Is. a day, should provide good openings. At thb beginning of the war, Mr Fisheroffered the last man and the last shilling. There vvere then 1,000,000 men in Australia of serviceable age, of whom 700,000 offered their services; 400,000 were accepted, and more than 340,000 left our shores. But what did the wealth of Australia contribute? A levy of 25 per cent, would wipe out entirely the apcursed war debt, which otherwise must lie like a cross upon unborn millions. It would appear from newspaper statements that we are' likely to obtain from Germany £400,000 as our share of the. indemnity paid to Great Britain, and in this connection I wish to offer a business suggestion to the Government. According to. the last advices, the mark today is worth only onethirteenth of its par value, so .that the sum of £400,000. is the equivalent, in marks, of £5,200,000. Let the Government .accept payment in German goods, being careful to see that it does not take goods of a kind manufactured in Australia. bringing of these goods to this. country would provide freight for ships, which could be used to take back our primary products, and the sale of the goods should realise a very .large profit. The Government would control this business as it controlled the sale of our wheat and our wool. If , in the course of years, we obtained £40)000,000 in indemnity, and the mark remained at its present depreciation, we could, in the manner I speak of, wipe out the whole of our loans. I wish, finally, to draw attention to a proposal which I put before the Government in 1914. On the outbreak of war, it was said that the mines of Broken Hill would be - closed. Broken Hill is the only township I know of depending wholly on its mines* and, knowing the troubles that would occur if the mines were closed, I wrote this.letter to the AgeSir - On my opening night I suggested that, to prevent the Broken Hill and other mines closing down, and' so penalizing not only the 40,000 people of Broken Hill, but also the 70,000 human beings dependent upon' the various mines (as mentioned by Mr Baillieu), that, in consideration of these mines keeping in full work, and so saving untold misery to the city of Broken Hill and other places, it . would be wise on the part of the Commonwealth Government to agree to purchase all the silver, at. the market price before the declara: tion of war, on 30th June, viz., 2s. per oz., as shown in your issue of today. As each ounce of silver coins into 5s. 6d., there would be an immediate profit of 175 per cent, (less expense of coinage) for all moneys expended by the Commonwealth Government. In plain words, £1,000,000 spent to buy £1,000,000 worth of silver won by Australian workers from Australian mines would give an immediate profit to the Commonwealth,'of £1,750,000. less cost of minting. As minting in England' cost 3 per cent, for silver, if a deduction of.5 per cent, be made - for all charges, including minting, the total of £2,750,000 of silver coinage, it would leave in the hands of the Commonwealth Government a grand total of silver coin amounting to over .£2,612,500 for every £1,000,000 expended upon the purchase of silver. Whilst recognising that our Australian notes, guaranteed by over 30 tons of gold minted into sovereigns and guarded in the Government strong rooms, and further guaranteed by the Australian continent, which notes' are the safest perhaps in the world, yet it is fair to argue that a large number of our citizens in times of trouble would prefer to have their money in. silver coins rather than in. paper money. The lead, tin, and other products of the various mines could be arranged to be taken over 'by the Commonwealth GoThe vernment at the ruling market rate on 30th June last. The Commonwealth having agreed to purchase the various mineral products, on these or similar lines, with a view to prevent, unemployment of the, workers, with its consequent misery, poverty, and distress, the States, in their sovereign power, contingent on the mine-owners refusing to work the mines, should be prepared to take possession and work the mines at the risk of the owners. The law of eminent domain is as powerful now as in the days of Blackstone, endowing each State in its hour of need to take possession for the bene- creased from about £14,000,000 fit of the community. Should any profit bo made by the State' working the mines, such profit could be handed over to the owners; ami, if a loss occurred, the mine-owners must accept, that misfortune as a penalty for closing down their mines and depriving the workers and. all dependent - upon tliem of their means of existence. There should be small possibility of loss in the case of the State working themines, for they have not to provide any interest on the plant, &c. In conclusion, whilst I am grateful for the efforts made by the various companies, I coneider that true patriotism would be shown by their keeping on full time, and not on half time or less. * House of Representatives, 11th August, The directors of the Broken Hill panics asked me to give them an interunemployment, view, and - after several talks with Baillieu, I was permitted to offer, in of the amendment. their name, to the then Prime Minister (Mr Andrew Pisher) all their metals at 30 per cent, less than pre-war prices in any remedy. England, and they promised to continue to work the mines. On the minting of vernment £1,000,000 worth of silver at Is. 4±d. per oz., that would have given a profit of £2,928,571, less the cost of minting. Unfortunately I could not persuade M Pisher, who followed the advice of M Allen, who could not see very far in this matter, to accept the offer. Had been taken, honourable members can see that the Government would have made tion to absorb. at least £20,000,000 in profits, because silver went as high at 5s. 6d. an ounce, tin to as high as £300 a ton, and lead to as that? high as £ 7 0 a ton. I have made these suggestions hurriedly, because the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Ryan) promised that this debate shall be conget cluded very shortly; but I commend ing them to the attention of Ministers.",49
303,Dr EARLE PAGE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Cowper) [ 6 . 0 ] listened carefully to the speeches of the mover of the amendment and the Leader of the Government to find out what were their remedies for the unemployment that prevails; but the only thing suggested was the further extension of Government enterprise, which is like prescribing, as a 'cure for hydrophobia, a hair of the dog that b it you. Both Commonwealth and State revenue and expenditure have increased enormously during the past few years. In seven years, the New South Wales expenditure has in to £34,000,0.00 and that of the Commonwealth from £15,000,000 to £60,000,000, and there is more unemployment now than there was at ""the beginning of that period. Both publicly and privately our finances are straitened at present. For the past four years the Commonwealth has been financing repatriation, but its money has been used by the States in lieu of expenditure on their own account on developmental works; what they have raised by loan being spent uselessly in administration instead of being devoted to reproductive works. Yours &c, . The larger States have sinned especially W. MALONEY. in this respect. But the Commonwealth 1914. has not done anything in a large way to improve matters."" In . my opinion, accom-' tion could be taken which would remedy though that action is not Mr of the kind contemplated by the mover",50
304,Mr RODGEKS,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,He did not suggest,50
305,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I suggested that the Goshould fulfil its obligatictns.,50
306,Dr EARLE PAGE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The causes of unemployment are world wide.

There has been a period of under-production, followed by a period it of increased production, which the warworn countries have not been in a posiThey are consequently suffering from a sort of indigestion.",50

We can most quickly back to normal conditions by reductaxation to the smallest possible d i mensions, 'and avoiding the borrowing of - I money, because taxation and local loans, especially, take out of circulation capital which would otherwise be devoted to p r i vate enterprise, and would provide employment on reproductive works. Governmental ' action in this direction will do much to re-establish public confidence and credit, and induce outside capital to be invested.",50
309,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Does the honourable member suggest that there should be an absolute cessation of public expenditure on reproductive public works?,50
310,Dr EARLE PAGE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"We should, as far as possible, confine our public expenditure to reproductive works. Whatever money is expended by the Government should be so laid out as to insure that value is received. I was glad to hear the suggestion of the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) concerning the reduction of the cost of living and the means which the Government might employ in that direction. But I am opposed to the provision' of governmental work of a kind such as has been found in Australia before, where works' of a non-productive character were undertaken for the sheer sake of giving the unemployed something to do. About twenty years ago, when unemployment was rife, after the Boer war, many thousands of pounds were spent at Shea's Creek in shifting sand.",51
311,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"That work has. paid for itself over and. over again, I might mention.",51
312,Dr EARLE PAGE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"From what I remember of it, the men would shift sand one day and move it back to its original spot the next. Sir .JOSEPH COOK - Valuabl e land was reclaimed.",51
313,Dr EARLE PAGE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Howeve r that may be, there is plenty of national developmentar work which could be carried tut Without finding tasks' for the unemployed, such as shifting sand. There is; for example, a big project which might well be undertaken in my own electorate.",51
314,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Would the honourable member favour urging the Government to make £2,000,000 available to open up the Burnett lands?",51
315,Dr EARLE PAGE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I suggest a conference with the State authorities whereby each could bring forward the most urgent and promising scheme in each State,, and thus some progressive policy of getting on with the most payable propositions could 'be undertaken.",51
316,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The honourable member does not join with me in urging immediate action respecting the Burnett lauds ?,51
317,Dr EARLE PAGE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I am not prepared to do that without full investigation of the whole facts. Mr Ryan : - I just wanted the honourable member's views, since his party candidate in Maranoa say3 he is in favour of urging Government action. I merely want his leader"" to tell that gentleman that he is wrong.",51
318,Dr EARLE PAGE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The candidate has the advantage of full knowledge of the whole proposition, probably, and my policy is, as I have stated, that a conference should be held with the State authorities, whereby each could bring forward the most promising scheme in each State. One other matter with which I desire to deal refers to the bringing about of a state of affairs whereby industry can fee conducted profitably. During the past 1 teu years the total production of the Commonwealth has actually decreased 25 per cent, in quantity, although there has been an increase in values amounting to almost £100,000,000. For. the falling off in production the Commonwealth Government are, to some extent, responsible. They are responsible with regard to the muddle over the building of War Service Homes. These homes have not been constructed so that it can be said that they provide the greatest value for the money . spent. Moreover, there is a considerable public reaction in that the methods of employment and the handling of materials devoted to the construction of soldiers' homes have interfered with private building projects, and made the cost of building soar out of the reach of many. There are other matter's also which have tended to bring about lessened production. The effect of recent Arbitration Court awards has been to interfere very materially with employment. Industry has been hampered. In the timber industry the last Federal award given was so widg.reaching and vexatious in its application, that dozens of saw-mills which might have been employing any number from ten to twenty-five men each, today have ceased activities. I have known of several instances in which workmen have approached their employers and told them that they recognised the seriousness of the position, and were willing to sign up at the previous wages if only the employers would keep the mills going. Similar remarks apply to the sugaT workers in Queensland. In one mill the workers came to the manager and asked himto fight the latest application to the Court, because they realized that the inevitable result would be the destruction of the in dustry which employed them. We have also such instances as that of M t . Lyell, where the mine authorities, because of the reduced price of copper, expressed willingness to carry on, without suggesting any reduction in wages, if the men would consent to a very slight increase, in the number of hours worked.",51
319,Mr MOGRATH,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Does the honourable member now suggest that, in order to decrease unemployment, it will he well to increase hours of labour?",52
320,Dr EARLE PAGE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I am pointing out that the industry is entirely dependent on the export price of .copper. The directors announced that- . They welcomed the suggestion that an arrangement should the devised for meeting the situation on the basis of increased efliciency, in order to test results. The working arrangements proposed by the company did not entail a reduction of one penny in the .existing rates of wages, and involved only one alteration in working conditions, viz., the underground mento work forty-eight hours in alternate weeks, instead of forty-four hours each week. The offer was made in the belief that the good-will of the unions and the employees in a combined endeavour to co-operate with the company would justify the continuance of operations. - I think that is quite a reasonable proposition, Because, at ""present,- we are right up against things financially. We are in .a very tigh t comer j and there is .only one way to get round it . That is, not for the - leaders of the men to try to antagonize the classes, but to persuade all to pull together. We need to produce more, and to produce more of the right things. There are many men in Queensland who are anxious to work at rates whicITwould be satisfactory to them. The employers cannot pay more, and yet they cannot give employment at those rates, because they would be liable to prosecution for employing hands at less than the award rates. A. valuable suggestion has been made, namely that there should be a tema porary suspension of arbitration awards, so that Australia might be helped around a very dangerous corner. The working man' throughout' Australia has sumcient political power, and the general public has sufficient native fair-mindedness secure for him a fair deal 'when matters - improve.",52
321,Mr RILEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"South Sydney) [6.17] I dssire-to say only a few words ' in the interests of the unemployed in my district. In South Sydney there are numer. ous factories, and I assure the Acting Prime Minister that anything he can do to alleviate distress will be welcomed by every one in the community. It is the duty of the Government to co-operate with and assist State Governments, for the trouble today is an Australian one. The Federal authorities should not stand aloof and upon their dignity. They should consider what national works may be beneficially .started with the help of the Commonwealth. So far I have heard nothing definite proposed, ibut there is one direction in which something might 'be done which, would benefit the - primary producers and, thus, the whole .community. I understand that a progress report has been submitted by the Commissioners who are investigating the - matter of a uniform railway gauge. At any rate, that report is almost complete, and, according to press statements^ the intention is to advocate the adoption of a' 4 f t . 8J in . gauge throughout the 'Commonwealth. If - the Federal authorities can render assistance so that men may >be placed upon the work of standardizing our railway gauges, a great national work will have been inaugurated. Unemployment will have been largely done away with , and .the Commonwealth will be bound to benefit. Before the war ,a . Commonwealth Labour Government. lent the States £18,000,000 for public works, because there was a tendency towards a panic and a slump in public undertakings. Now is the time for Commonwealth and State leaders to show their statesmanship in coping with unemployment and the glut in the labour market. The best brains of the country should be brought to bear on the problem, and a vigorous public works policy undertaken. To a deputation which waited on him a few days ago, Sir Denison Miller, Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, said that he could find the money to carry on the public works of the country if a scheme were put before him. .",52
322,Mr RODGERS,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The Commonwealth Government has found £10,000,000 for to public works, with the principle of preference to soldiers, during the last two years.",52
323,Mr RILEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The unification of the railway gauges is a big national work 1 that should be undertaken at once, for the longer it. is delayed the more costly - it will be.",52
324,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The statement alleged to have been made by Sir Denison Miller was very extraordinary.,53
325,Mr RILEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"He.sai d that he could . find the money' if the proposed works were reproductive and the Government were behind them. There is no doubt that if the Government want money from the. Commonwealth Bank they oan get if. One of the drawbacks of the present situation is that the private banks are contracting the currency; they will not lend out money. A similar eflect has been produced by the action of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) in buying up war bonds. This redemption of bonds may be a good policy from his point of view, but if , instead, of redeeming the bonds, he were to lend the money to the State Governments for the carrying on of public works,, there would be no unemployment in the Commonwealth today. The Treasurer is paying over money to those persons who wish to sell their bonds, which carry interest at 4$ per cent., and he is proposing to float another loan, for which he will pay 6 per cent.",53
326,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The member is suggesting that I should tax the people in order to hand the money « over to the State Governments in the form of ""loans.",53
327,Mr RILEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The States are prepared to pay interest for the money. The people will be taxed to pay the higher rate of interest which the Treasurer will have to pay for the new loans.',53
328,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The redeemed bonds were paid for out of revenue.,53
329,Mr RILEY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I know that; but if , instead of paying £7,500,000 from revenue, the Treasurer had lent that, money to the State Governments for reproductive public works, a big avenue of employment would have been opened up, and money - would have been saved to the Commonwealth.. Would it not have been better to have lent portion of that £7,500,000 to . the Queensland Government for the development of the Burnett i River lands ? I - understand' that: the JSfejr. South - Wales Government were promised Supply [14 JULY, 1921.] (Formal). 101Q5 £3,000,000 would be provided by the Commonwealth Government, and the Treasurer has told us that, as soon as the necessary certificates are received from the State Government, the Commonwealth will pay. If the Treasurer, instead of paying off bond-holders, had kept the money in circulation"", and provided employment for the people, he would have shown better statesmanship. Honourable members in the Corner speak about the necessity for economy. If they are sincere, instead of - proposing that the workers should work longer hours at reduced wages, they might direct their attention to the Military College at Duntroon, where there are 81 students and 170 officials. The military party in this country needs watching, and if I were seeking economy that is the direction in which I would look for it . I hope the Government will make available money for the carrying on of' repatriation work in connection with the erection of soldiers' homes, and that amends will be made for the large number of men thrown out of employment at Cockatoo Island, Williamstown, and elsewhere.",53
330,Mr MAHONY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Dalley) [6.27] - I am sorry that the time allotted to this debate honourable is so limited, because I desired to say - a little about the manner-'in which the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) has dodged his responsibilities. The ""action of the Government in displacing a large number of men from Cockatoo Dock without any legitimate reason, stamps them as men who are not worthy of the confidence of the people. The Treasurer knew a month or two before hand what was to happen at Oockatoo Island. The Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith) and his officers intimated officially to the Treasurer what would happen and what would be the consequences, and the Treasurer sat idly by and allowed thousands of men to be thrown out of employrnenit, - with the result that their wives and families have been short of food ever since.",53

333,Mr LIVINGSTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Barker) [6.28] The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley ) stated that at Duntroon College there are only eighty-one students and 170 officials.

We ought to be ashamed of ourselves for wasting time as we have done today. This is a time when the best .brains of Parliament should be cooperating for the benefit of the people, and I was surprised at the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Eyan) doing what he did, because he has a lot of sound commotn sense. I hope the day will come when we shall all join together to promote the interests of Australia, instead of the different parties fighting each other as they are doing today.

347,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,After report by the,55
348,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"A f t e r report by the of the definite Board. I therefore claim that the pro' visions ""of this measure are a complete fulfilment of the definite promise I made - to the Committee of Ways - and Means. I now propose to deal very briefly with the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, and supported by a number of honourable members opposite; To do what. the. honourable member proposes would be to turn the Tariff Board into an Industrial Court, and also into .a price-fixing Board. There is now ample provision on our own statute-book, and on the statute books of the various States, to deal with wages and conditions of labour, and so on; the workers always have the remedy in their own hands in regard to this matter, whether the industry be a protected or an ""unprotected Then, I do not believe that price-fixing is any remedy for the evil of which the honourable member for Maribyrnong speaks. In any case, such a remedy can only be applied partially; it cannot be applied to imported goods sold alongside Australian goods; and, apart from that altogether, I am entirely opposed to any remedy of this character being applied I do not. believe that price-fixing can accomplish anything along the lines suggested. During the war, while certain phenomenal conditions existed, and a number of commodities - were under controls of various price-fixing was unavoidable. We could not deal with the many problems which we had facing us at that time except by some price-fixing regulations; but when we come to the normal conditions of peace, it is utterly impossible to conduct commerce along those lines. Eor those reasons I am going to ask the House to decline to agree to the amendment of the honourable member for Maribyrnong.",55
349,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The trouble is that a manufacturer who happens to trespass is penalized, while the wholesale and other dealers go scot-free.",56
350,Mr STEWAET,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,That is the weak spot in the whole thing.,56
351,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"There we have the whole difficulty that occurs in regard to commodities, whether imported or manufactured here, and we have"" really to leave the competition which exists amongst traders to settle the limitation of profits.",56
352,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The competition which is supposed to exist!,56
353,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"In regard to the great majority of commodities that competition does exist. Take for instance, the case of .agricultural machinery, 'which, for the most' part, does' not pass . through the hands 'of the middleman:",56
354,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,It goes direct to the farmer.,56
355,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"r-Everybody knows the conditions under which, agricultural machinery is sold. The manufacturers have a price list which they send to their agents, who are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the country, and the agents sell according to the list.",56
356,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"J t is about the only,industry in which that is done.",56
357,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"No , it is not;, there are quite a number of others in which one. there are recognised price lists, and the goods are sold according to those throughout the country. In . regard to industries so managed, it is undoubted that the proposed remedy in the Bill will be sufficient. Supposing, for the sake of argument, that it is alleged that manufacturers .are making undue, profits on agricultural machinery under the Tariff, the - Bill provides means by which the matter can be dealt with by the Board. If any complaint is lodged, the Board may i m mediately investigate it , and has power to see all the books of a manufacturer in order to ascertain exactly what profit kinds, he is making; and if it is found that he is making undue profit, the Board must report to the Minister, who,- under the Bill , is bound with in seven days to lay the report before Parliament if Parliament is sitting,, and the House then has it in its own hands to deal with as seen fit. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - But putting aside agricultural machinery, take another case in which there are no direct agents, but the business is done through bound houses-if those houses refuse to supply the goods, and there is restraint of trade?",56
358,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Unde r the Bill the Minister may refer to the BoardAny complaint that a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him by .the Tariff, and in particular in regard to his(i) charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods; or (ii) acting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public.",56
359,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Is that expressed'?,56
360,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Yes! ,",56
361,Mr RICHASSD FOSTER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Thj m it is all right ,56
362,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Consequentl y if any manufacturer enters into arrangements which in themselves create a monopolistic position, and, as a result, it can be shown that his action is detrimental to the public, the Board may then submit a report to Parliament, which has to decide whether it is desirable to either reduce or abolish the duty.",57
363,Mr STEWART,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Can the Board, in effect, make a manufacturer ""responsible for the prices at which his goods are ultimately sold? ",57
364,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"In the main, yes. I do not say the Bill meets - the case goods which go out in the ordinary course of trade, and are sold in open competiturers tion, without anything being done by the manufacturer' to restrain the nature of the competition in them. In however, it is not in regard to such commodities that there are undue charges."" It is where a manufacter turer either by selling through agents at set list prices, or by entering into some commercial arrangement is definitely in restraint of trader-that is practically the only way in 'which the public can be charged undue prices.",57
365,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"But supposing that in the case of harvesters, for instance, it found that the manufacturers in dealing with wholesale houses participate distributing profits.",57
366,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Is the honourable member talking about rebates?,57
367,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I mean that hat manuwith Parliament. facturers, for instance, may participate in the profits of the wholesale houses through which their hats were sold.",57
368,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"If the manufacturers in such a case. are participating in such profits by means of rebate or discount, it must be shown, in their books, and the Tariff Board, through its' servants, has f power to investigate all books.",57
369,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The manufacturer's books would not show the profits of wholesale houses over whom the Board but has no control. How would you find out whether a manufacturer is participating in the profits ? Mr MASSYGREENE;-rSurely , if any books are kept, it can he definitely .ascertained whether any rebate of the character has cases. been given; and if anything of the kind occurs the Bill provides the remedy. Of course, I do not say that this measure is a sovereign remedy for all the ills the consumer suffers from, but I believe that we have here, for the first time, what will really prove an effective check on the avariciousness of any manufacturer who finds himself in a position to fleece the public. Here we have a definite check. I believe that the honest manufacturer who is trying to do a fair business and treating the public in .a fair way will be pleased rather than otherwise to see this provision in .the Bill. I know of nothing of that could be more detrimental to Australian industries, and to the manufacgenerally, than that consumers should 'be charged, by a few unscrupulous persons, undue prices for goods which are my opinion, made in this country.",57
370,Mr GREGORY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Coul d not the-Minishave included in this Bill the section in the Canadian Act in regard to restraint of trade? Would not that have which made the Bill more complete?,57
371,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I think that what we have in the Bill in regard to restraint of trade is sufficiently comprehensive.,57
372,Mr ATKINSON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The great feature of . is the Bill is that this Parliament is to determine what is to be done when a reporti n the by the Board is presented., - Mr MASSYGREENE - The final judgment regarding a report made by the Tariff Board in any case of this sort will rest",57
373,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The strength of the provision is that the House has the undoubted power to reduce the duty,57
374,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"And there is no question as to the constitutionality of anyu l l thing we may do under this Bill. I do"" not propose to labour the point that was put so ably last night by the the Acting Attorney^General. (Mr Groom), I wish again to refer to the matter on which I interjected when the honor-, able member for West Sydney was talking of our power to levy Excise. He said the case was analogous to that in which this Parliament levied an Excise duty on sugar. There is no analogy in the two",57
375,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,There is.,58
376,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"There is not, for the reason that the Excise was levied, not some sugar, as a penalty, but on all sugar to do so. that was manufactured in this country. We were entitled to levy any taxation that we pleased, provided that it was general; and then this Parliament, way of bounty, gave back, not the whole £5 per ton that it took in the shape - Excise, but £4 per ton by way of bounty on sugar grown by white labour. This Parliament had a perfect right do that. It can levy taxation, provided it is general inits character, in any it pleases. It can give a bounty and conCustoms dition the grant of thatbounty in any way.it pleases. And so that action was perfectly constitutional and could not challenged.",58
377,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Coul d we not follow the and his staff still heavier burdens. same method in this case?,58
378,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Possibly .,58
379,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Then why not do so?,58
380,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"It would be so bersome when we tried to apply it to the industries of the Commonwealth that it would be almost unworkable and enormously costly. The point the honourable member tried to make f was that, because we took that action .in respect to sugar produced in Australia, we couid, by way of Excise duty, penalize, in the same way. manufacturers who did not cdo certain things. In other words, he contended that we had power, by way of taxation, to secure, indirectly, the fixation of prices House. in respect of goods sold in the various States. There is no analogy in those cases; they stand on two quite distinct and separate bases, and I feel that the opinion expressed here last night by the Acting Attorney-General, that if we attempted to do what the honourable member suggests we should find,, in all probability, that it was unconstitutional, is correct. The result would be the same as in the Barger case.",58
381,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The honourable member is ' the only one who shares that opinion.,58
382,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Whether that be - or not, I say the merit of the proposal I am now asking the House to accept that there is no doubt whatever as constitutionality. There is no doubt that if this Parliament finds it necessary to impose this remedial, or, if you please, on penal legislation, it has a perfect right Let me refer now very briefly to the necessity for this Bill. There have been quite a number of statements to the effect by that it is unnecessary, and that it is really too late. Whether it be .too late of or not, I would suggest that there are a a number of cogent reasons why we should proceed to pass this measure into law beto cause of what the future holds. Great and onerous as are the responsibilities way thrown upon the Minister for Trade and and his staff under the law . as it stands today, the legislation that we are be now passing and have already passed, and which is now being considered in another place, throws upon the Minister I draw attention to three things that we are proposing to do. First of all, for ihe first time in the history of the Commonwealth, we have a three-column Tariff. We have cumissued to the Dominions, and to the all world in general, an open invitation to enter into reciprocal Tariff relations with ourselves. That alone will entail a vast that amount of ;work and research and careu l inquiry, and it is in itself a serious and definite, responsibility which the Minister should not be called upon to carry those unless he has given to him some machinery that will enable him to thoroughly investigate all these various matters before he submits them to the",58
383,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The Minister cannot two enter into tbese reciprocal arrangements on behalf of the Commonwealth without confident the permission of Parliament.,58
384,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"He must carry the negotiations up to a certain point, but it is this Parliament alone that can determine whether or not those negotiations shall be ratified. Then, for the first time, also, we have in the Tariff a number of deferred duties-dutie s that have been definitely promised by Parliament provided . certain things are done. The determinaso tion of whether or not those deferred duties shall operate is again a serious reis sponsibility to be thrown only upon the to its shoulders of the Minister. And so I think it is most desirable that he should be supported in the same way by a Board of this character. There is also lation which has already been mentioned in this House, and which we are about consider, dealing with dumping duties, the exchange position, and related matters. There, again, we have a fresh responsibility thrown upon the shoulders of the Minister, and to call upon him alone to bear it would be to ask him carry too great a burden. I think he should have at his command this definite means of having such matters sifted and examined as carefully as possible. He should be able to have such matters sifted by such a Board as this, and reported upon by it, so that if at any time Parliament desired to know on what grounds he was acting he could present the report of the Board for the informaCustoms tion of honourable members. Even supexpense - posing these things were not being done, surely, ' as the industrial life' of this Commonwealth grows, and as the fields which this Parliament asked to cover are broadening every day, honourable members must feel the Necessity of having some examining body that is carefully going through this work and ascertaining exactly the position is. If this were not done, I feel certain that it would be absolutely necessary to strengthen the central staff of the Customs Office to enable, such work to be carried out. In one way or the other, the work must be done. It is absothe lutely necessary and essential, and that why I think it is desirable to appoint Board. There is the further point raised by ing of the Bill. the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), who says, "" Let this purely departmental Board. Do not bring in any one from outside."" one holds a higher opinion than I do M. Chanter) - Order ! of the officers of . the Department Trade and Customs. Having worked in close 'association with them for nearly to do so. three years, I have been able, perhaps better than any one else who has not The worked in such close association with beforeamendment them, to, sum up their merits, ""and I am can the Minister rise and confident we would find in the Departbate? ment officers who are competent to dis. charge these high and responsible duties. I feel, however, that the public, would not think that with such a purely bureauput. cratic body they were getting, the of investigation that they desired.",58
385,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I think the public hold the legisan exactly opposite view.,59
386,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"My impression is that to they do not, and that is why I think it is desirable that we should have this more or less independent body. On the other hand, I agree entirely that unless we have that body closely linked up with the Department it will lead to a great to deal of waste of time, and probably to indifferent results. I am sure that if we had a body that was entirely outside the Department-no t associated with it in any way-the time that would be lost both by the officers of the Department and the Board itself in. ascertaining the this views of the Department on the many purely technical questions which arise from time to time in the consideration of matters would lead to enormous and waste, which I , for one, would never recommend to this House. And that is why I believe it is necessary that one of the members of the. Boardis the chairman^. I think-shoul d be an oflicer of the Department of Trade and Customs, so that when any of these questions arose, as they miust from day to all day, and hour to hour very often, we 1 what should have with the Board a trained - officer who, on the spot, could give an immense amount of information and so prevent much waste of time and energy. I do not wish toi take up any further time.

In Gommittee: . Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to. Clause 4- i For the purposes'of this Act there shall be a Tariff Board consisting of three members. Mr .FRANCIS .(Henty) [8.44] - When speaking on the motion for the second reading, I said that I would 'Support the Bill, but - that, in my view, it required amendment in some particulars. It is proposed: to constitute a Tariff Board of three members; but I think that it would' he well, in this matter, to follow the practice of the House in the appointment of Committees. The Parliamentary Public Works :and Public Accounts. Committees are composed of members representing each branch of the Legislature. Before honourable members decide 'upon the number of individuals' to constitute the Tariff Board, they should consider whether it would , not be well to select them from this Parliament direct. To do so, I am persuaded, would be in the best interests of the Commonwealth, An outside Board would not be so responsible or amenable to Parliament as a Board whose personnel consisted of members of Parliament. The experience of our two permanent Committees' has proved the wisdom of - appointing parliamentary Boards. We should be most chary of creating another outside institution. If the Board be made a parlia15 mentary one, it will do away 'with all i fear of the creation of another new and costly Department. If members of Parliament are capable of passing the Tariff schedule, surely a selection from among them should be fit to act upon the Tariff Board. In the staff of the Customs Department we have excellent officers of proved capacity. If their duties should be added to by the creation of the Board as I desire, honourable members would readily agree to increases of the officers' salaries. The idea of the Government, however, is to set the Customs staff aside, and introduce outsiders. It should be for honourable members to accept the' responsibility of acting on ' the Board. What will be the position, under the Government scheme, if we desire to learn some Tariff particulars? The Minister (Mr Greene) will be able to do as the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen) does today. He will refer us to the Board which we have created. With a Board constituted as the Government propose, I am confident that the cost will range between £20,000 and £25,000 per annum. Before specifically moving my proposed amendment, I would like to ""sound"" the Minister as to whether his preference is for a personnel of seven or five.",59
390,Mr GREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I would rather have five than seven.,61
391,Mr FRANCIS,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"In view of that exnext election. pression of opinion, I move That the following words be added :- "" of There the House of Representatives, bers of the Senate."" My desire is that there shall - be three selected from this Chamber, and two from another place.",61
392,Mr LIVINGSTON,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Barker) [9.0] Whilst I agree that' the Board should appointed from members of this Parliather ment, I entirely disagree with a good deal of what was . said by the mover of the amendment. For a good many years the governing of this country has been handed over to Boards and Conunissions, and members of Parliament have been absoruled lutely ignored. Honourable members will agree that the Minister has very good officers in the Department, and I do know where men as good' will be found outside the Service for making the insay vestigation required. There is no necessity for employing additional' officers all the year round at high salaries: The people ! yon. will: of this country will not stand that sort of thing any longer. How are"" manufacturers to establish .industries if they are to be hampered by a Board such as this* Bill proposes ? If this. Board is created I shall not blame capital for remaining away from .Australia. Ib is time we abandoned government by Boards, and regulations. We are well paid, and people ask what we are elected for. We are absolutely ignored, and it would appear as if the people are not to be trusted in the election of - their representatives. A day will come when we shall see a great difference in the government of this country. We shall live to see elective Ministries, and men from both sides of the House sitting as committees to deal with the business of the country - I hope the Minister will seriously reconsider the question before appointing a Chairman of the Board at £1,450 per annum, and two other members at £5 5s. per sitting, in addition to clerks and other officials. If his proposal is adopted from £10,000 to £15"",000 per annum will be 1 added to the cost of government. That is not economy. The Government should make use of the services of. members in this House.

When honourable members are nominated as candidates for Parliament be they should be compelled to declare-whethey will serve as full-timers, halftimers, or quarter-timers. In my opinion, any legislator drawing £1,000. per annum should not follow any other occupation. I look forward to the time when people will show that they are tired of - being by Boards.

I have been Dewondering why the honourable member now was so anxious that members of Parliamemment should be appointed to the Board. .Is it due to something that occurred in the earliest history of Customs Tariffs? I have here an extract from the Jewish TalmudAbraham, in travelling to Egypt, brought with him a chest. At the Customs. House the omcers exacted a duty. Abraham would have readily paid, but desired they would not open chest. They first insisted on the duty for We have clothes, which Abraham consented to pay, but then they thought by his very acquiescence that of Parliament it might be gold",62

I do not think that the best way of arriving at the results we have in view is by appointing a Parliamentary Committee. It may be that, later on, Parliament in its wisdom may see the desirability of appointing a Tariff Committee. ' of the House. When speaking at an earlier stage I suggested that the reports from the Tariff Board might with advantage be referred to such a Tariff Committee for investigation. I agree with the honourable member for Barker (Mr Livingston) that that course might result in considerable saving of time; and I am sure we could find in the House a number of honourable members 'prepared to devote more time to the consideration of these matters than it is possible for the House as a whole to devote, and on whose judgment we could place considerable reliance.",63

413,Mr HIGGS,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Capricornia) [9.19] The Minister, I think, was bound to carry out his promise to establish some kind of Board to protect the general public. Many of the high duties were passed by honourable members so readily on the understanding that if there was any attempt on the part of a manufacturer to victimize the public, it would be met by a revision of the Tariff. I propose to support the clause if this amendment is not carried, but I should prefer the amendment. We appointed an Inter-State Commission, which made exhaustive inquiries into the Tariff and drew up reports, and, although this must have cost thousands of pounds, I do not believe that honourable members, or the House as a whole, paid any attention to them, or even read them.",63
414,Mr GREGORY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,That is not so.,63
415,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The reports were thought very highly of.,63
416,Mr HIGGS,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"At any rate, I would say that the majority of honourable members did not read those reports. I myself read some of them, but they were connected with current politics at the time, such as the inquiry into the meat business, house rents, and so forth.",63
417,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"May I say that those, reports were so valuable that the Inter-State Commission was got' rid of?",63
418,Mr HIGGS,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Neithe r the reports of the Inter-State Commission nor the reof the Economy Commission were dealt with by the House as they deserved.,63
419,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Mak e no mistake, they did much good !",63
420,Mr HIGGS,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"At the present time there is in existence a Taxation Commission which must be costing many thousands of pounds, and I am rather curious to see what notice will be taken of its report. I am in favour of members of Parliament being members of the investigating body under this Bill. do not for a moment believe that the proposed Board will be occupied every day of the week; and I can well imagine that there will be imposition on the general public with which the manufacturer will have nothing whateverto do. We protect the Australian woollen manufacturer against his foreign competitors, but what happens? The manufacturer sells his goods to the wholesale houses at prices which would enable the public to obtain cheap clothing, but the intermediary charges such a price that one actually has to pay £3 3s. for a pair of pants made in Melbourne.",64
421,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,This Bill will not protect us against that sort of thing.,64
422,Mr HIGGS,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"It will not. At a very early date we shall be called upon, if not by the general public, by the state of the money market, to economize in some directions, because we shall be. tumble to borrow the money to keep up our present expenditure of £98,000,000 per annum. We shall be taken to task, no doubt, if we appoint a Board such as is suggested, the members of which are to be paid, it is said, £3,000, £4,000, or £5,000 per annum. If we do not pay the members of the Board salaries commensurate with their ability and' experience, hew are we* going to get qualified men to perform duties similar to those which devolved on members of the Inter-State Commission? It is true that in the United States of America there is a Tariff Board of a dozen members at £2,000 per annum each; but America has a population of 100,000,000, and is a rich and powerful nation, whereas we are a small community of 5,000,000. I venture to say that such an experiment as that proposed by the honourable member for  some success. If any complaint of victimization were made in any part of the Commonwealth, the members of such a Committee would investigate the matter personally, and would therefore be': heard inParliament with attention; and I urge the Minister (Mr Greene) to give the amendment further consideration. As I have said, I shall not vote against the clause, but I would prefer a parliamentary body, which, like the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts ComI mittee, would involve little more expenditure than that upon travelling - expenses.",64
423,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Grampians) [9.27] I am strongly opposed to a Board which calls for the appointment of what are known as outside people. In the Customs House we have gentlemen who are fully capable of carrying out all the duties proposed to be imposed on this Board, and' do so much more capably than we could expect either on the part of members of the Legislature or of gentlemen of experience and capacity from outside. Earlier in the evening the Minister (Mr Greene) justified his view that such a Board is necessary, and the trend of his argument appeared to be that the necessity arises from the increased and evergrowing responsibility thrown on the Department. It' seems to me, however, that the honourable gentleman himself provided the strongest possible grounds for rejecting the proposal. The tendency in this Legislature in the last few years, and particularly since I entered this House, has been for the Commonwealth Administration to grasp in every possible direction at every possible source of power. In their attempts to control the Administration, and interfere in the affairs of the community in general, the Executive scarcely stops at anything, forgetting that every increase - of power increases responsibility. The remarks.of the Minister to-night on the subject seemed to me almost pathetic.",64
424,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON, Will the honourable member connect his remarks with the amendment ?,64
425,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The amendment is that the Board shall consist of members, of Parliament of the Commonwealth, and we know what the proposal of the Minister is. Without in any 'way desiring to cast any reflection on the Minister, my view is that the proposal in the Bill is practically one to enable the Government to :evade or shirk their responsibilities. It is. admitted that the responsibility of the Trade and Customs Department has become too great for the Minister. The Minister himself desires that this responsir bility should be shared by an .outside Board, which is to be created at considerable cost to the community, and in my opinion at the cost of a considerable inution in efficiency. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis) puts forward the view that since the Government^ say that the responsibility is too great for the Minister to carry, it should be shared by a Board consisting of honourable members of this Parliament, and not of Brennan, F. persons outside the Public Service or the Charlton, M. Parliament itself. W it h that view If u l ly Gabb, J. M. agree. I do not think, however, the honHiggs, orable member's proposal is the best that Lavelle, T. J. could be made. I am strongly in favour Livingston, J. of the matters with which the Board is Mahony, W. G. to deal being left in the hands of the Department itself. No argument has been Bamford, F.

426,Mr FRANCIS,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Henty) [9.33] - This clause involves the expenditure of a good many thousands of pounds per annum, is altogether too important to permit of its passing with a mere wave of the hand. I would remind the Committee that the Commonwealth Public Works Committee consists of members of both Houses of Parliament, and that, under the Act which it was created, all proposed expenment. ditures exceeding £25,000 have to be in vestigated and reported upon by it . That Committee, consisting of members of Parliament, is empowered to report upon the larger works of the Commonwealth, in volving expenditures in some cases of hundreds of thousands of pounds; and surely a Committee of members of Parliament ministrative should be able to carry out the duties which will devolve upon the Tariff Board. On the score of economy alone the Committee should accept my amendment. We have now an opportunity of showing that whether we are in favour of economizing to the extent of some thousands of pounds per annum by providing that the members toms. of this Board shall be members of Parliament, and shall not be selected from - I moveoutside; Let us get the question of economy close to our hearts, and demonstrate to the: people here and. now that we are prepared to economize in every possible wayQuestion-That the words proposed to be added (Mr Francis' amendment) be dimso added-put .

If that amendment be agreed to I shall more that the subclause be further amended, so that it will readThe three persons to be so appointed shall be persons who hold administrative offices in the Department of Trade and Customs. I ask the Committee to pause before voting for the appointment of a Board other than a purely departmental one. Such a Board would be free from responsibility, and would - involve the country in a considerable, and probably growing, expenditure. There has been a demand for economy, and honourable members must be deeply impressed with the seriousness of our financial position and the need for, sooner or later, attacking our overgrown expenditure. would be idle, however, to do this and at the same time to. vote for further expenditure whenever a plausible case was made out for it . No justification has been shown for the proposal of the Minister. The history of outside Boards shows that they are costly, and, in the long run, much less efficient than departmental Boards.",65
429,Mr COHSER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Has not the efficiency of the Customs to be considered ?,66
430,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Yes ; and that is why I say that the responsible officers of the Customs Department should not be superseded in the constitution of this Board by outsiders. My proposal would make for increased efficiency, whereas that of the Minister has a contrary tendency. ' Mr Riley - What would be the personnel of your Board ?",66
431,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,I propose that it shall consist of three officers of the Customs Department. - Mr Riley - Would you name them?,66
432,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"No ; because this Committee is not the proper place for the discussion of the merits of officials. The Board will have serious responsibilities, and the proper performance of its duties will require from its members a sound knowledge, and long experience of Customs matters. No doubt it would be comparatively easy to obtain in the large cities of Australia business men who, for a large salary, would devote themselves entirely to the work of the proposed Board. The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) indicated that, in his opinion, salaries ranging up to £5,000 a year would not be excessive; but there would be extraordinary difficulty in getting suitable persons for much lower salaries, and it would excite the indignation of the people of Australia if it ' were proposed to pay such salaries as have been suggested, or even salaries of £3,000.",66
433,Mr MAHONY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,What would be the advantage of having three departmental officers ?,66
434,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"In my opinion, they are the only persons with sufficient experience and intimate enough acquaintance with the intricacies of Tariffs; and they can be trusted to exercise the strictest impartiality.",66
435,Mr MARR,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,But they would have no industrial training.,66
436,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"What is wanted is an It intimate knowledge of 'the effects of Tariffs rather than industrial experience. No man, whatever his experience, can have an intimate knowledge of all businesses. It may be said that there is a demand for an independent Board. But you cannot obtain wholly unprejudiced persons. The man who for a large part of his life has been engaged, in a certain occupation, and has friends similarl y engaged, is . bound to have become saturated with certain opinions, and when appointed to a position like this will be sure to look at matters in the light of his own experience. I have had a good deal to do with responsible Boards, and I do not believe in them. A Board of Customs officials would be responsible to the Minister, and a Board consisting of members of this House and senators would be responsible to the electors. The Government proposal provides for the creation of an utterly irresponsible Board. The tendency of the members of such Boards is to exhibit arrogance, impatience, and an indisposition to' listen to persons who hold different views from their own. A Board of the character proposed by the Government is the very last kind of Board which could be expected to conduct impartial investigations and to arrive ab unbiassed conclusions. Upon the other hand, the whole training of the Customs House officers would tend to make them absolutely impartial. Consequently I appeal to honourable members to support the amendment.",66
437,Mr FRANCIS,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"He n t y) [9.57] - Now that the Committee has decided that a Tariff Board shall be constituted outside of members of this Parliament, I hope that we shall endeavour to make it as efficient; a. body as possible. Tbat object can be achieved only by the appointment of Customs officials. I am perfectly satisfied that there are no men ""who are more qualified to control matters connected with the inspection and supervision of industry",66
438,Mr CORSER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,It is a question bf decisions by the Board.,67
439,Mr FRANCIS,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"There are no decisions required from the Board. Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Greene) knows as well as I do, that for the office of Chairman of the Board no more competent oflicial could be obtained than Major Oakley. He might very w-ell be appointed along with one or two officers from his own Department. I am satisfied thab if we go outside the Customs Department we shall secure a Board which will be practically useless.",67
440,Mr GREGORY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Dampier) [ 9 . 5 8 ] - If the clause be passed in its present form, will the Minister be prevented from appointing to the Board three members within his own Department? I'would like his assurance that only one member of the Board shall be an officer of the Customs Department, and that the other two members shall be representative of outside interests.",67
441,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I can give the honourable member that definite assurance. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 6 to 8 agreed to. Clause 9(1) The Governor General may suspend any member from office for misbehaviour or incapacity. The Minister shall, within seven days after the suspension, if the Parliament is then sitting, or, if the Parliament is not then sitting, within seven days after the next meeting of the Parliament, cause to be laid before both Houses of the Parliament a full statement of the grounds of suspension. (2) A member who has been suspended shall be' restored to office unless each House of the Parliament, within forty days after the statement has been laid before it, ancl in the same session, passes an address praying for his removal on the grounds of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.",67
442,Mr GREGORY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Dampier) [ 1 0 . 2 ] - I think that the Minister will be acting wisely if in sub-clause 2 he alters the method of procedure to be followed in the case of the suspension of a member of the Board. Under the. provision as it stands, if a bad appointment be made, and the Minister suspends one of the members of t the Board, that member must be reinstated unless within forty days after a statement relating to his suspension has been laid before both branches of the Legislature, and Parliament passes a resolution confirming his suspension. The adoption of that course may mean that a man whom nobody desires to injure , may be dragged through the mire. It would be better if the Minister had power to suspend a member of the Board, and The if that suspension held good, unless within forty days after the matter had been reported to Parliament, his reinstatement were demanded by Parliament.",67
443,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and' Customs) [10.4] - I quite appreciate the point which has been raised by the honourable member. He fears that a man may be appointed to the Board who may prove a failure, and that the Minister may hesitate to suspend him with a view to dispensing with his services, because such action would necessitate a reference to Parliament and a public discussion of the reasons underlying the member's suspension. He apprehends that in such circumstances the Minister may retain an undesirable member of the Board, rather than subject him to the procedure laid down under this Bill. Off-hand I do not know that I can , find a form of words to achieve the object which the honourable member for Dampier has in view, but I may get the defect remedied in another place. In the meantime I will look into the matter with a view to - discovering whether we cannot obtain the procedure that we desire under which any member of the Board will possess a certain measure of independence. Our object is to give members of the Board a definite assurance that they cannot be suspended upon the caprice of the Minister for the time being. Clause agreed to. Clauses 10 to 13 agreed to. Clause 14- (1) The Minister .shall refer to the Board for inquiry and report the following matters :(h) any complaint that a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him by the Tariff",67
444,Mr GREGORY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Dampier) [ 1 0 . 7 ] - I desire to move an amendment, but I am at a loss to know exactly where and how to do so, although my purpose is perfectly definite. A great deal of the high cost of living is due to gentlemanly agreements and combinations in restraint of trade. This sort, of thing is being carried on very widely at present. During the debate upon the Tariff schedule I "" read a copy of an agreement between the Broken Hill Proprietary Company and the steel merchants of Australia', fixing the price of steel and iron. Parliament is protecting industries by the imposition of duties, and 'is giving special advantages to new industries. In his keen desire to build up Australian industry generally, the Minister (Mr Greene) has gone further than any other Minister for Trade and Customs: It is our duty to endeavour to protect the consumer. I desire to quote from the Canadian Tariff Act in support of my own intention:(1) Whenever, from or as a Tesult of a judgment of the Supreme Court or Exchequer Court of Canada, or of any superior Court, or Circuit, District, or County Court in Canada, it appears to the satisfaction of the Governor in Council that, with regard to any article of commerce, there exists any conspiracy, combination, agreement, or arrangement of any kind among manufacturers of such articles'- or dealers therein to unduly promote the advantage of the manufacturers or dealers at the expense of the consumer, the Governor in Council may admit the article free of duty, or soreduce the duty thereon as to give the public the: benefit of reasonable competition in the article, if it appears to the Governor in Council that such disadvantage to the consumer is facilitated by the duties of. Customs imposed on a like article. (2) Whenever the Governor in Council It to be in the public interest to inquire into any conspiracy, combination, agreement, rangement alleged to exist among turers or dealers in any article, of commerce to unduly promote the advantage of the facturers or dealers in such article at the expense of the consumers, the Governor in cil may commission or empower any Judge the Supreme Court or of the Exchequer of Canada, or of any superior Court or County Court in Canada, to hold an inquiry mary way and report to the Governor in Council whether such conspiracy, combination, agreement, or arrangement exists. (3) The Judge may compel the attendance of witnesses, and examine them under oath, and require the production of books and papers, and shall have such other necessary powers as are conferred upon him by the Governor in Council for the purpose of such inquiry. (4) If the Judge reports that such conspiracy, combination, agreement, or arrangement exists in respect of such article, the Governor in Council may admit the article free of duty, or so reduce the duty thereon as to give to the public the benefitof reasonable petition in the article, if it appears to the Governor in Council that such disadvantage to the consumer is facilitated by the duties of Customs imposed on a like article: I am not sure that the amendment which I have framed could not be inserted in the Anti-Dumping Bill.",67
445,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"It could not be put into that measure, because' it is a taxation Bill.",68
446,Mr GREGORY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Then I am in doubt concerning where I can insert it in a reference to the duties of the proposed Tariff Board. All that there is in this Bill isi virtually contained in paragraph h of sub-clause 1 of the clause under discussion, which states[h) any complaint that a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him by the Tariff, and in particular in regard to his(i) charging unnecessarily high - prices for his goods; or (ii) acting in restraint of trade to . the detriment of the public, However, the power which I desire to have set forth is not contained, there. ' Mr MASSYGREENE - The difficulty really is between two procedures. In the Canadian case there is given to a Judge authority to determine the facts. If he finds the facts are as have been alleged, the Gover L nor in Council may deal with the duties. Under this provision the. matter would not go before a Judge, but would be dealt deems with by the 'Tariff B'oard, which would or arreport to Parliament, and this House manufacwould deal with the duties.",68

448,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"They would not be able to take action, under this measure.",68
449,Mr GREGORY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Would it not be wise to insert something here, then?",68
450,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Does the honourable member suggest, that, if advantage is shown to have been taken, of the Protective Tariff, the Governor General in Council should have power to remove the duties t",68

I desire power to be provided that, in the event'of a' report - coming to hand from the Tariff Board, that undue advantage is being taken, according to the terms of paragraph h, the Governor-' Genera] in Council may refer the matter to a Judge, who. should inquire whether there is any conspiracy, combination, or arrangement in restraint of trade.",68
452,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The Tariff Board itself would find those facts, and would report accordingly.",69
453,Mr GREGORY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,".Would it not be better to make the inquiry fuller and more complete? I do not regard the Board as having high judicial functions. It can call evidence, but I would not like to say that on a report by the Board alone I would convict a manufacturer of conspiracy.",69
454,Mr STEWART,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,It would be for House to decide on the evidence submitted by the Board.,69
455,Mr GREGORY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I have not had time to think it out, but I am impressed with the necessity, in connection with . our Tariff legislation, of seeing that the con- Burners are being protected while we give encouragement to - the manufacturers. The consumers have not been properly protected in the past. I should like to be assured that, if there is anything in the nature of these agreements, which are made solely for the'purptase of destroying competition and enabling the manufacturers or dealers,' or both combined, to fleece'the public, an effective check qan be applied. It is the duty of the Minister, if - he believes in imposing a high Protective Tariff to develop industries, to see that all the necessary machinery is provided in the Bill to give the consumer protection. Otherwise, the people must revolt against a measure of this sort.",69
456,Mr MASSYGREENE,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs). [10.19] - I agree with a great deal .of what the honourable member for Dampier has just said. looked carefully at the Canadian procedure, and came to the conclusion that the House would be better satisfied, - at all events in the in it i a l stages of this class of legislation,' to leave the 'final verdict in its own hands. The procedure laid down is this: A complaint is lodged and goes to the Tariff Board. The - Board makes its investigations .and finds the facts proved. . The honourable member suggests that, after this, power should be taken to send the - inatter on to a judicial tribunal to determine in law whether the facts are as stated or not. While it may be easy for us to make up our minds what the facts are, and any one affected would have ampleO opportunity to mafie his views known here, it might be very difficult to get actual legal proof. That is why it is better that the matter should come to the House, and that the House should determine, after public discussion, whether or not it shall apply the penalty of reduc- ing or abolishing the duty. That is better than leaving the matter to the Governor General in Council, even after a judicial determination on the point. ' I believe the way - I have proposed will be more speedy arid effective - We can only try it and see what the result is. I am just as the anxious as the honourable member to see that this Tariff, which gives the manufacturers of Australia perhaps a better opportunity than they have ever had before to make good, does not give them an opportunity to exploit the public. That is why I - am introducing this Bill , and why the Government are endeavouring to have it passed, in this form. I believe the best way is to leave it to the Tariff Board to find out the facts, and then make it compulsory on the Minister to bring the Board's report to the House. A f t e r the Board had reported that the duty should be reduced, it would be i m possible for a Minister or a Government to refuse to bring the Board's report under the notice of Parliament. . I believe this is the best and most effective, and probably the quickest, way of .dealing with the whole matter.",69
457,Mr GREGORY,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Dampier) [10.23] - I move. That in paragraph ' (h), after the word ""Tariff"", the following words be inserted:"" or that the consumer is being charged unfair prices for protected articles."" , I want to give the Board, the fullest power I to inquire into the prices which the consumer is being charged. The wording I suggest will cover cases where the dealer is charging unfair prices.",69

478,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I have"" received at least a dozen hints .from the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) - I am under the impression that it .is still possible, under the Standing Orders, for an honourable member to say a word in behalf of the consumers without being interrupted by gross rudeness aa the part of any member - of the Committee. Notwithstanding that the hour is late, and that there is a determination on the part of some members that, this Bill shall be passed to-night, I shall exer-' cise my privilege in stating to the Committee my conception of the interests of the consumer in this matter. Those interests are not being adequately protected in this measure, but the amendment would give them much more protection.",70
479,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I agree that the Bill does not protect the consumer; but neither does, the amendment.",71
480,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The amendment will help I am satisfied that this matter cannot be adequately discussed at this hour, and I ask that I should have leave to continue the debate when the Bill is again under discussion.",71
481,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,No ,71
482,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"^Then, I must claim the attention of honourable members. I explain that it is the desire of the honourable member for Dampier to include in clause 14 some effective measure protection for the consumer.,",71
483,Mr COKSEB,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,What does the honorto able member suggest?,71
484,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I support the amend those ment, of. the honourable member, for pier. .",71
485,Mr CORSER,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"That will not protect the consumer. Mr GARB.:-I call attention to the state of the Committee. ' [Quorum formed.""] - Mr JOWETT - The investigations the Inter-State Commission and the, Necessary Commodities Commission have turers. revealed over and over again that goods sold by manufacturers at reasonable prices have been charged to consumers at exnot tortionate rates. Wholesale firms acting in combination, or with \Some honourable understanding, have - refused to"" - permit lay down. consumers to get the benefit of the comparatively low prices at which they have obtained goods, from manufacturers. The amendment would permit all such,'cases to be brought under review by the Tariff Board. I can mention a case particularly in point. Evidence was brought before Board. [408] * a certain Commission that woollen goods were being manufactured in a certain town in Victoria. ° A large wholesale draper or tailor carrying on business in that town was also a shareholder in the manufacturing oompany. He desired .to obtain for the benefit of his customers the woollen goods made in the - town, but he could not get' a single yard of those, goods, because they - were all sold to - a Flinders-lane firm.",71
486,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Because the manufacturer exercised his right to sell.,71
487,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Le t me continue the story. I am not an advocate of price fixing, but it turns out that because of the existence of a price-fixing Commis-' sion ijn Victoria the firm purchasing this woollen cloth from'* the manufacturer could not obtain more than a certain profit upon it if they sold it in Victoria. . As a consequence of this, this country storekeeper, living ijn the town in Victoria in which the cloth was> - made, had to buy it in Sydney before he could sell .a single yard of it to his .own customers..",71
488,Mr MAXWELL,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,-How would the honwhile orable member remedy that?,71
489,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"- I say that if the honof orable member for Dampier's amendment is ^accepted - the Board will be. placed in a. position to investigate prices charged consumers by wholesale, firms, as well as prices charged by manufacturers to' firms. It would bring the prices' Damcharged >by retailers to the consumer Y within the purview of the Board.",71
490,Mr MAXWELL,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"When they come with-: . in the purview of the Board, what could the Board do?",71
491,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The Board would be able to do in respect of excessive'-charges to consumers by retailers exactly what of the Bill proposes the Board may do in respect to excessive charges'by manufac- Sir JOSEPH COOK - If the retailer does do what is right, the honourable member will inflict a penalty upon the manufacturer. That is a curious doctrine to",71
492,Mr MAXWELL,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Would - the honourable member abolish the duty in such a case?,71
493,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"I do not propose that the duty'should be abolished, but that prices charged by' retailers to consumers) shall be brought under the purview of the",71
494,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The honourable member's suggestion - is that investigation by the Board of such prices' would throw a fierce the same goods. light on the practice of retailers.,72
495,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Exactly , and"" that is in either case. the only purpose to be served by the Tariff Board. It is to throw a light the proceedings of all these - w i li make a report and recommendation to' the Minister - Nothing can be done unless the Minister approves of the recommendation' of the Board, and his sort is to the abolition of the duty.",72
496,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"The honourable member's contention is that the Commonwealth, has power to investigate and compel answers wlivb. regard to prices charged by retailers ii Australia?",72
497,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,Exactly .,72
498,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The honourable member voted entirely against that proposition only a little time ago.,72
499,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Certainly , not.",72
500,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,We have not the power to do that.,72
501,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"In this Bill the vernment say that tliey have the power with regard to the investigation of prices charged by manufacturers. This Bill ib means what it says, purports to give that power to the Board;' but I am told it ' is unconstitutional the prices charged to the consumers of Australian manufacturers' goods.",72
502,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"We have power over the Tariff, but no power over the of goods. ' Mr JOWETT - I never suggested that we had power over the sale of goods.",72
503,Mr RYAN,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Then how would you comother power. pel persons to answer on oath questions regarding such sales? 1 Mr . JOWETT - Because that would be part of the inquiry. Mr ' RYAN - I am not sure that the orable member is .not r i g h t ; but if he is admitting a much larger power in the Commonwealth than we have, conposition. tended for in supporting the amendment of the honourable member for Maribyrnong(Mr Fenton).' .",72
504,Mr JOWETT,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,The power is admitted when it is proposed to investigate the charges made by manufacturers; and in a few days the consumers of Australia will want to know why excessive charges by manufacturers can be investigated and not the prices charged to consumers for,72
505,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,There is no power,72

507,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"Darlin g Downs-Minister for Works and Railways and Acting ' Attorney-General). [10.47] - The honorreable member (Mr Jowett) apparently does not understand the nature and scope of the Bill . We have passed a Tariff which purports to protect - Australian in dustries, and it is proposed to appoint a Tariff Board, whose duties have reference to the Tariff laws of the Commonwealth. Power is given to investigate any complaint that a, manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the Protection afforded him, particularly in regard to his charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods;.and that is absolutely relative to the Tariff. Now the honourable member desires to carry - that a stage further, and say that when the goods have passed alto-, Gogether out of the control of the manufacturer, and have'., become the property of a private dealer, there must be an inquiry ^ if into the sales by that private dealer.",72

509,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS ON,"But they have passed away from the manufacturer altogether, and are owned by 'the storekeeper, the sale agent, or the wholesaleman.
