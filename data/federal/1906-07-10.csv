2,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"In the Brisbane Courier of the 6th July, the right honourable member for East Sydney is reported to have said at Maryborough that he had given up the present Parliament, and was appealing to the electors.

3,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs when he proposes to lay on the table the regulations under the Commerce Act, and if he has any objection to also laying on the table a copy of the resolutions of the Exporters' and Fruit-growers' Conference, convened by him? [ 3 9 ] -*",13
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I hope thai the Commerce Regulations will be published within the next two or three days. They will then be laid on-the table. I cannot promise to lay on the table all the correspondence which has taken place in connection with the framing of the regulations.,13

9,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Is the Government co-operating with the Government of Queensland in connection with the deportation of Kanakas at the end of this year? Has the Queensland Government made the demand that this Government shall pay a portion of the return fares of the islanders? As the time is fast approaching when deportation must be undertaken, is the Prime Minister prepared to make a statement to the House of the intentions of the Government in regard to the matter?",13
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"We are co-operating with the Government of Queensland, by whom no such demand has been made as that to which the honourable member refers. I hope to make, within .1 few weeks, a complete statement as to what is proposed in connection withi the deportation of Kanakas. PAPUAN APPOINTMENTS.",13
11,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"Can the Prime Minister assure the House that he will defer the making of appointments, to the Executive and Legislative Councils of Papua, and will not fil l the LieutenantGovernorship until the House has had an opportunity to discuss the motion moved by me on Thursday Inst, and made an Order of the Day for the 26th July.",14
12,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Not knowing exactly why the honourable member. prefers this request in regard to appointments to the Legislative Council of Papua, I shall be - glad if he will submit his reasons to me in private. 1I have already undertaken that no appointments to the Public Service of the Territory shall be made until the House has had an opportunity to discuss the subject. That opportunity may be afforded by the introduction of ' the Estimates before the honourable member's motion is disposed of, but, in any case, honourable members will be able to express their views on the matter before any appointments are made. JUDICIARY BILL'. Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of a message from His Excellency the Governor General, recommending that an .ippropriation be made from the Consolidated Revenue for the purposes of this Bill. PARADE ATTENDANCE Mi:. MCDONALD (for Mr MALONEY) asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. What was the date of the last inspection of the Casllcrnainc section of the Eighth Australian Infantry Regiment by the State Commandant ? 2. Was its Commanding Officer present then; and, if not, what reason was given for his absence? 3. Was the Commanding Officer engaged that night at Colac attacking the Government and the Minister for Defence at a political meeting ? 4. What distinction docs the Defence ment make between this officer men discharged from the Warrnnmbool Battery for non-attendance at parade?",14
13,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The answers to the honMountcastle orable member's questions are as 'follow:1. 21st May, 1906. 2. No; the Commanding Officer applied for, thority ? and was granted, special leave by the Commandant, as provided for in paragraph n of Commonwealth Military Regulation, No. 202. The reason given for his absence arranged to deliver an address prior to receiving the date of the Commandant's inspection. 3. The Minister is not aware that the Commanding Officer was so engaged. 4. The Commandant states that in no case has leave from the Commandant's inspection been refused when such leave had been previously applied for. The case of the Warrnambool discharges is not analogous, as the Commanding Officer of the Field Artillery discharged the sixteen men for failing to become efficient, through non-attendance at an Easter camp of continuous training, not at a parade. WARRNAMBOO I. FIEL D ARTILLERY.",14
14,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon uotice-*1. Has any decision been arrived at with regard to the men dismissed from the Wnrrnambool Battery of Field Artillery? 2. Is it the intention of the Military Board to disband this battery and other batteries in the country districts and concentrate them in Melbourne ? 3. Is it a fact that the guns supplied to these batteries arc obsolete and unsafe to use? 4. Can any reason be given for leaving the Warrnambool Battery without a qualified instructor for two years?",14
15,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I am informed1. No; the matter is still the subject of further inquiry. 2. The Military Board does not intend recommending the disbandment of any battery pending the decision of the Government as to the general organization of the Military Forces, after consideration has been given to the recommendations of the Imperial Defence Committee. 3. The guns are obsolete, but are not regarded as unsafe. This battery will be armed with four 4.7 breech-loading guns as soon as the carriages alieady ordeied are Teceived from England. 4. The Comranndant statesIt was proposed to send an instructor to Warrnambool from time to time to hold courses of instruction, but the reason this has not been done is that when the officer commanding No. 4 battery (Warrnambool and Port Fairy) was askerl to se.'ect the most convenient dates he replied "" That it was not possible for members to attend."" HAT CONTRACT.",14
16,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,"the DepartMinister representing the Minister of Deand the sixteen fence, upon notice-t. Whether it is a fact that the Defence De. partment has cancelled the contract of Messrs. and Co., hat manufacturers (whose contract for the South Australian Department had about twelve (12) months to run}? 2. If so, for what reason, and by whose au",14
17,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I am,informedi . Yes, together with that of eighteen other was that he had contractors. 2. (a) Because it has been decided to abolish clothing boards in each State, in order that manding Officers of the respective regiments may make their own contracts for the supply of military clothing required for their respective commands. (4) The conditions of contract provide that the contract may be terminated by either party on giving three (3) months' notice; and such notice was given by the Minister in March last. OVERSEA MAIL CONTRACT.",14
18,Mr DEAKI N,Unknown," I beg to lay on the tableCopy of the articles of an agreement made between the Postmaster-General, on behalf of the Government, and Sir James Laing and Sons Limited, of Sunderland, England, shipbuilders, the contractors under the agreement. For the convenience of honourable members. I shall briefly summarize the salient features of this new and very important contract.",15
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"As it would not be in order for the honourable and learned gentleman to make any comment in laying the paper on the table, it would be well for. him to move that the document be printed, if he desires to give any explanation to the House.",15
20,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I shall take that course. The new contract is for a service between Adelaide and Brindisi, and vice versa, once a fortnight, to alternate with a similar service to be provided by the Imperial Government. It is for a period of ten years, and is to replace the existing service by the Orient Royal Mail Company when it expires in February, 1908. The period of transit is to be 636 hours in both directions, as compared with 696 hours provided for in the existing service under the contract with the Government of the. Commonwealth, and 662 hours as provided in the contract between the Imperial Government and the Peninsular and ! Oriental Company. The price as agreed upon for the new service is ,£125,000 per annum for the transit period above mentioned, but provision has been made for an acceleration of twenty four hours between Brindisi and Adelaide for a reimbursement of actual expenses incurred, to be determined by mutual agreement or arbitration, but not to exceed ,£25,000 per annum. This price must be compared with that now paid to the Orient Royal Mail Company, namely, £ji 20,600 per annum for a service of 696 hours, which is equal to about 3s. 8d. per mile, as compared with 3s. iod. per mile to be paid for an acceleration of sixty hours. Com- The cost of the Imperial service by the Peninsular and Oriental Company cannot be stated, as iit is included in the sum of ,£340,000 per annumwhich includes the India and China services also. Provision is also made in the contract for the new service for a still further acceleration, if any other mail service to Australia is running to a faster time-table than that under which the mails are carried by the contractors, upon conditions fully set forth in the cont-fact. The steamers under the 636 hours' timetable would leave Brindisi, calling en route at Port Said, Colombo, and Fremantle, and would arrive at Adelaide in time for Saturday's express, thus enabling a simultaneous delivery of the mails to be made in both Sydney and Melbourne early on Monday, and permitting of replies from the former place being sent by the outward mail of the same week, an advantage not enjoyed under the existing arrangements. Under the 612 hours' time-table, the steamers would arrive at Adelaide in time for the express on Friday, and the ma""ils could be delivered in Melbourne on Saturday, in Sydney and Brisbane on Monday, with an accelerated train service; and replies could be sent from Brisbane by the outward mail - of the same week. A longer interval would be afforded for replies if an equally favourable alternative service is provided by the Imperial Government. On the outward journey, the steamers will leave Adelaide on Friday, instead of on Thursday, as at present, thus affording a longer interval for replies. In connection with this improved ocean mail service, an improved railway service is contemplated, avoiding delays which now occur, and insuring greater expedition in both directions.",15
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"An improved railway service is contemplated""; it has not yet been arranged for?",15
22,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Not arranged for yet, because three States have to be consulted. Brindisi has been determined upon as the European port for the mails, in order that advantage mav be taken of the special trains provided in connection with the Indian mail service. Provision has been made in the contract for the acquisition of the steamers to be employed under it by purchase, or alternatively for their charter if desired. The port of registrv will, be within the Commonwealth, and the steamers will fly the Commonwealth flag. Australians will feel that they have a national interest in a large fleet of mail steamers, of a speed and tonnage at least equal to any other visiting the ports of this country. .In connection with the cost of the new service, it may be well to mention that the payments to 'be made by Great Britain and other countries will amount to about per annum, while, on the other hand, it is estimated that the payments made by Australia to Great Britain for mails carried by the Peninsular and Oriental pany or other steamers under contract to the Imperial Government, will, at the same, rates, aggregate about ,£15,000 per annum, leaving a balance in our favour of about £10.000 per annum. course, been provided, in accordance with section 16 of the Post and Telegraph Act, that white labour only shall be employed in connection with the carriage of mails by this service. Five tenders were received, and carefully considered, the accepted tender being the lowest. All the usual stipulations common to mail contracts have been included, and all the advertised conditions are provided for in the contact. Clauses^""14, 15, and 16 of the agreement are copies of special conditions approved of by Parliament in the contract made with the Orient-Pacific Company. Under condition of tender No. 4, £2,500 had to be deposited, and the tender was to be accompanied by a bond for ,£25,000 if it provided for mail ships to be built. was deposited. As it was known that mail ships would have to be built, an approved guarantee for ,£25,000 was required, and has been given in London to the Commonwealth representative, to be held until the bond for that amount by approved sureties is given. The .£25,000 guarantee is to be forfeited if the bond for ,£25,000 is not given on demand. .£27,500 is therefore secured. Further, 'after the first bond is given, if , in the opinion of the Postmaster-General, satisfactory is not being made with the building of the mail ships, he may at any time demand a further bond of £25,000 to secure the commencement and performance of the contract, and failing compliance with that demand, within one week, he may cancel the contract-enforce the penaltv provided for failing to commence the service and also enforce the first bond, for £25,000. Government has also received the most satisfactory assurances as to the firm of Sir James Laing and Sons, with whom they have made this agreement'. As bearing upon the conditions of the contract, it is desirMr Deakin. able to state that now that the Commonwealth has been admitted to the U n i versal Postal Union as one Administration, the distinctions hitherto recognised as between the States comprised will cease, and the payments hither£25,000 to made by one State to another for the carriage of its British and foreign mails will be discontinued, as will also the payments that have been made by the United Com- Kingdom and foreign countries for the transit of mails despatched by them after being landed at Adelaide. It will be seen that the stipulations as' to penalties for late arrival are more stringent than those under It has, of the present contract, and altogether the contract, which is for a mail service only, compares most favourably with that now currentI may add that, although the contract is for a mail service only, we are informed that the cool storage accommodation provided on the steamers will be about three times as great as that afforded by the mail steamers at present under contract.",15
23,Mr WATSON,Unknown,What will be the tonnage of the proposed new steamers?,16
24,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"11,00 0 tons.",16
25,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"TH e contractors are not bound in any way to provide cool storage? . Mr DEAKIN - No ; they are not bound. This will be a postal contract pure and simple, and will relate to nothing else. In view, however, of £2,500 the development of our export .trade and the probable demand for cool storage for perishable products, the contractors intend to make provision for refrigerating space upon a very much larger scale than has hitherto been attempted. Moreover, it is intended' that the plans of the steamers in relation to cool storage and all other matters shall be submitted to us for criticism before the new vessels are built.",16
26,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Will the contractors receive any allowance for bringing their progress steamers on to Melbourne and Sydney?,16
27,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No . Nor is there any contract that they shall proceed to Melbourne and Sydney. At the same time. I have every hope that they will not only convey passengers and cargo on to those ports, but that they will go on to Brisbane. Negotiations to that end are now in progress. I have been in communication with the GoThe vernment of Queensland in that connection, and hope to soon have a definite reply from England by cable. If the contractors go on to Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, they will ,do so for their own purposes.",16
28,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Will they go on to New Zealand also?,17
29,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have seen a statement i i i the press to that effect, and am - not in a position to contradict it. If the steamers go on to New Zealand, the contractors will not be in any way relieved - of their responsibilities to us. It would be fortunate if the New Zealand Government could see its way to lend its support to this line of steamers, and so make the service - thoroughly Australasian.",17
30,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,What wages are to be paid to the crews ?,17
31,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The information placed in my hands does not include particulars on that head. The contract is on the table, and will be printed and circulated .among honourable members, and I trust that we shall be able to bring it under consideration next week. It should be dealt with as soon as possible, not only because of its importance to us, but because the contractors should be allowed ample time for the building of the steamers.",17
32,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,Hav e the Government - obtained any guarantee from the States Governments that they will make full use of the storage space?,17
33,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I communicated with all the States, but not one of them was in a position to enter into a definite agreement There is a strong disposition on their part to make use of the cold storage space, and the tendency in that direction will no doubt be increased owing to the rapidity of the transit afforded. I regret that circumstances did not permit the regular shippers of Australia to join together and - engage the whole of the cool storage space for at least a portion of each year. Our output of exportable products has now reached such a stage that shippers might have given a guarantee such as I have de-scribed. and have secured shipping accommodation upon much more favourable terms than has hitherto been possible.",17
34,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"What about droughts ? / Mr DEAKIN - No doubt it was owing to the possibility of such unhappy condiLaing and Sons. tions recurring that our shippers considered that they would not entering into a definite contract. I have every expectation that these travelling at a high rate of speed, will commend themselves to shippers generally.",17
35,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Will the Government have any voice in regard to the plans - of the steamers?,17
36,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The plans are to be submitted to us) and our wishes will be met as f ar as possible. M i . CONROY - Does the Prime Minister think that the new service will result in a reduction of freights?,17
37,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I should say that an increase in .the vessels with cool storage capacity trading to Australia, and the introduction of swift steamers, would tend to reduce freights.",17
38,Mr KNOX,Unknown,Will the contractors be compelled to employ wholly new steamers?,17
39,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,W it h in a very short time the service will be carried on entirely with new steamers-that is the intention of the contractors.,17
40,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,How many steamers are there to be ?,17
41,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That information is not contained in the epitome furnished to me. I move That the document be printed.,17
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [ 5 5 ] - - I - dio ° t intend to take up the 2> n time of the House in discussing this matter at present, but I should like to refer to one or two points, and particularly to the small amount of the deposit which is being required from a company which has yet to be formed, and has yet to build its ships. It strikes me that those who have been able to secure an option of such importance for ,£2,500 have made an exceedingly good bargain.",17
43,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The honourable member must recollect that no deposit whatever was required in connection with the previous contract.,17
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"May I suggest that there was a great difference in the circumstances? In that case, there was a fleet of steamers operating under an existing contract with the Government. In this case, however, so f ar as we know, not one boat has yet been built. We know nothing; 1 about the previous operations of the contractors.",17
45,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We know Sir James,17
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not know be justified in anything about them.,17
47,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"We have ,£27,500 by large steamers, wav of deposit.",17
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Not in cash down.,17
49,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In cash, or its equivalent.",18
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As I understood the terms of the arrangement, the company were required to' make a deposit of only ,£2,500.",18
51,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That was in the first instance. Now we have a bank guarantee for .£25,000, in addition to the .£2,500, which is as good as cash.",18
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If that amount is already in the bank as a bond fide deposit which is liable to forfeiture, I admit that the case is altered to the extent that in regard to a contract which aggregates about .£1,250,000, the contractors have been called upon to pay a deposit equal to about 2 per cent, of the amount involved. I submit that even that is a very small deposit to require in regard to so largely speculative an undertaking as this. It seems to me that the contractor has obtained specially 'favourable terms, and the Postmaster-General will require to justify them when the matter comes on for discussion.",18
53,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The terms were advertised from the first.,18
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I should like to know whether there is any objection to lay the other tenders on the table?,18
55,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I think it is probable that there will be objections, but I shall make inquiries.",18
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I hope that unless such a course would be very unusual, the Prime Minister' will lay the other tenders on the table for the information of honourable members.",18
57,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Were all the tenders for the same period?,18
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should think so. However, this is not the time at which we should enter into details. I observe that a great deal of satisfaction was manifested by honourable members of the Labour Party when mention was made of the socialistic sop included in the contract.",18
59,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The British, Government also included it.",18
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But they did so for reasons very different from those which have actuated the Government. However, if the provision to which I refer appeals to my honourable friends in the corner, it will no doubt accomplish its main purpose-it s grand objective. I hope that the Prime Minister will afford us the fullest possible opportunity to discuss this matter involving, as"" it does, a very grave departure from the conditions we have enjoyed in Australia for many years past. Mr R. EDWAR DS (Oxley) [2.59] I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether it is true that whereas Mr Croker informed the Government that the new mail steamers would proceed to Melbourne and Sydney, no such undertaking was given with regard to Brisbane.",18
61,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am in communication with the Queensland Government upon that point, and shall be prepared to lay on the table all the papers as soon as the negotiations have been completed. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA PRESERVATION BILL . In Committee: (Consideration resumed from 6th July, vide page 1138.) Clause 12In this Part of this Act"" Board "" means a Board appointed under this Part; "" The Comptroller-General "" means the Comptroller-General of Customs; - "" I m p o r t ed goods"" and ""Australian goods"" include goods of those classes respectively, and all parts or ingredients thereof; "" Produced"" includes manufactured, and ""Producer"" includes manufacturer; "" T r a d e "" includes production of every kind.",18
62,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wannon) [3.2] - Does the Minister not intend to give the Committee any explanation of this part of the Bill ? Amendments which form practically a new Part III . to this Bill have been circulated by the Government, and we' are entitled to some explanation of them. Sir ' WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Min ister of Trade and Customs) [3-3] It is true that I have given notice of amendments in this part of the Bill, but they chiefly deal with a proposal in substitution for the Board provided for in the Bill as it stands. As I have previously stated, it was originally intended, if we could have managed it, to have had matters dealt with under this part of the Bill decided by a Judge, rather than by a Board. Lately it has been found possible to secure the acquiescence of the High Court in the request that they should consider these matters, and amendments have been circulated substituting a Justice of the High Court for the Board. Honourable members understand that it is a very difficult thing to secure a satisfactory tribunal for the decision of matters of this kind. Australian Industries",18
63,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is there to be a jury as well as a Justice of the High Court ?,19
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No. ' not go into the details of the amendments at this stage. It is proposed that ques-. tions arising under this part of the Bil l shall be decided by a Justice of the High Court, but there is to be a reservation giving the Executive power at all times to reduce or modify, though not to increase, the penalty inflicted by the Justice.",19
65,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is a permanent appointment to be provided for ? Sir WILLIAM ' LYNE - The Justice will be one of the Justices of the High Court.,19
66,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Will the same Justice act throughout?,19
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am not prepared to answer that question. pose that will be a matter for the High Court Bench to decide. I freely admit the difficulty of getting a satisfactory .tribunal to deal with these matters; but what we propose in the amendments which have been circulated will provide as satisfactory a tribunal as it is possible for us to get.,19
68,Mr WILS ON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Corangamite) [3.5] I am rather disappointed at the remarks made by the Minister. The honourable gentleman, ait an earlier stage, promised us that before trie clauses relating to dumpingwere considered he would give some information with regard to the dumping that is alleged to be going on in Australia.. I asked for that information, and I think it should be supplied before these clauses are gone on with. If . the Minister has this information, why does he withhold it? ,",19
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I gave the information twice.,19
70,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I beg the honourable gentleman's pardon. He mentioned no cases of dumping either in his speech on the second reading of the Bil l or in the speeches which he has subsequently made. I consider that the honourable gentleman is merely flouting the House, in refusing to give this information. He is asking honourable members to pass legislation in the dark, and the manner in which he has treated the Committee calls for an expression of the strongest disapprobation. Let the honourable gentleman open his box and make the Committee acquainted with the horrible cases of dumping which have come under his notice, or let him have a statement of the matter tabled and printed. I [10 JULY, .1906.] Preservation Bill, ""45 ask the Minister to fulfil the promise which he made to honourable members on the second reading of the Bill , and which he I need has not yet fulfilled.",19
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I have done so twice - ',19
72,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable gentle- "" man has done no such thing. If honourable members will look through Hansard, they will find that the Minister has not quoted any cases of dumping. I ask that he should give the Committee all the in . formation he has on the subject before these clauses are proceeded with. .",19
73,Mr MCCAY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Corinella) [3.8] - When speaking on the second reading of this measure I asked the Minister of Trade and Customs if he would give us the cases within his knowledge or within the knowledge of the Department in which dumping has I sup- taken place to the detriment of industries. So far as my memory serves me, the honourable gentleman replied that he would not give the information then, but would give it when he was replying to the debate on the second reading. Perhaps the honourable gentleman will tell me whether I am correct so far. The Minister did not give that information in replying, to the second-reading debate.",19
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Yes ; I did.,19
75,Mr MCCAY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable gentleman did not give us what he promised, namely, specific cases.",19
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I did not promise to give specific cases.,19
77,Mr MCCAY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I shall presently quote exaqtly what is reported in Hansard on the subject. The Minister led honourable members to understand that in replying to the second-reading debate, he would give us instances of injur)' to Australian industries, by means of dumping-that he would give us instances of dumping that was taking place 1 or had taken place. I was very much dis1 appointed when the honourable gentleman replied to the second-reading debate to find that no such! instances were given. I pointed out to him that it would materially assist those who desired to see Australian industries progress if they were able to point to special instances in which injury was being done them by means of unfair competition. The Minister did not give the information ' he .promised then, and he has not given it now. I wish to say that I am no foe to a measure of this kind, but I pointed out on the second reading that I did not like the methods here proposed of providing against dumping. The Bill will improve by the amendments the Government ihave circulated, but, even as now drafted, it is not what it ought to be. When honourable members ask the Minister for information, he should not only be willing to give it, .but it is his duty to give it . ' We are asked by the Minister of Trade and Customs to pass a law on the subject of dumping, and he says that he has information which shows the justification for such a law, but that he will not give us that information. That is what it all boils, down to. know what view of the circumstances is taken by honourable members in other parts of the House, but, so far as my limited experience goes, I have never before known a Minister to dare to take up such a position, with either supporters or opponents.",19
78,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We knew that the honourable gentleman was bluffing all the time.,20
79,Mr MCCAY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not say that. credited the Minister's statement that he had the information of which he spoke, but I demand that it should be given to the Committee in order that we may be able to form an opinion upon it. At page 469 of Hansard, honourable members will find that on the 20th June, speaking on the second reading of the Bill , I said I believe that dumping, as. we understand it that is, dumping at unremunerative prices, for the express purpose of destroying local competitors, and thereafter dumping at highly remunerative prices-is threatened in Australia, and that such a practice as that cannot be met by ordinary Tariff remedies. But I do not believe that it will occur in many cases. So far as I know it has not occurred at the present time. haps the Minister will correct me if I am not as familiar with the facts of Australian commerce in this respect as. he is. I must ask for the Minister's attention to this quotation.",20
80,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We are simplv following what the honourable and learned gentleman is reading.,20
81,Mr MCCAY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I ' went on to sayI will ask him whether there are any cases within his cognisance in which dumping has taken place to the substantial detriment of Australian industries.,20
82,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think so, most certainly.",20

85,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That does not say that I would give individual cases.,20

Then the honourable gentleman indulged in. a little sarcasm, and said I said, "" Yes, Mr MCCay."" The point is. that the honourable gentleman> said "" Yes,"" and he has not done it. Will the honourable gentleman, by a reference to I Hansard, show me when he informed honourable members, subsequent to the 20th.

If we are allowed to discuss these matters on clause 12, - shall we be allowed to transcend that liberty, and have a general discussion as to the advisability of dumping-a whether dumping occurs, and in what particular industries, and how to prevent The topics with which the honourable ber for Corinella is dealing are very esting to me, and, as I 'hear of them for the first time, I very naturally want to know all about them, because my' fiscal predilections do not lead me to swallow all that is said, exactly as if it were jam on the end of a spoon. At the same time, I desire to know whether I shall be permitted to indulge in similar playful excursions, or whether this indulgence is to be confined to gentlemen on the other side, for the remainder of the afternoon.",21

I shall' sit down now, in order to give the Minister an opportunity to give the information, but I do, in all seriousness, protest against this treatment of the Committee. A Minister who* says that he has information, and does not give it , deserves the reprobation of honourable members, whatever may be the state of parties.

I had that expectation especially in view of the fact that, under this part of the Bill , we have a little Tariff, and it would not be unusual for a Minister, under the circumstances, to give some reasons for bringing; forward proposals of"" the kind. I read the report of the Minister's speech, in which he pointed to the fact that -£7,000,000 worth of iron-wareand machinery are imported into the Commonwealth, as a reason for the introduction of Part III . of the Bill .",22
130,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Surel v the Minister did not argue^ that all this importation is dumping ? . Mr HENRY WILLIS - The Minister referred to it as dumping.,22
131,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The whole lot?,22
132,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I suppose it was' in reply to the reauest made by the honourable' member for Corinella. that the Minister, at a later period, again referred' to the importation of the ,£7.000,000Worth of goods-referre d to it in brief, saving that he had not time to go into the matter fully. The 'Minister expressed a: - wish that he had had time to work out the money in Australian coin, so as to show the something actual loss caused by this dumping, compared with the prices at which goods are sold in America and Great tain. The Minister ought, certainlv. give some reasons for the introduction Part III . , which is really a Tariff covering metalware and machinery imwith ports to the value of ,£7,000.000. would How are we to consider this clause hibitive unless the Minister does make a statethe ment? - Are we to be content with the mere-vote'of the brutal majority the of honourable gentleman may have at his Are manufacturers and capitalists-an also producers, who are now included manufacturers-to receive no consideration in this Bill ? Arc the industries referred to by the deputation, to be all ignored? Are men who have entered into manufaccompetition turing enterprises to be discouraged? they to lose the whole of their Minister, capital under Part III . of this mearailway, sure? Is all this to be done withasked out the Minister condescending to make a statement to the Committee? Minister has told us that he proposes to appoint a Judge to take the place of a Board. What dees a Judge know of comcan mercial affairs? The most astute Judge or lawyer, if he is keen in his profession, has had very little time to follow commerwho use oil engines. cial pursuits. What does such a man know of the manufacturing industries Australia? He certainly knows very little of the conditions under which operatives work and live. In the Arbitration Court of New South Wales it was found possible to obtain the services of a Judge, in the person of Mr Justice Cohen, who, as a merchant, had had a commercial career before he became a lawyer. In that rewas gard, I suppose New South Wales was tunate in obtaining the services of such man; and, when he resigned the position was given to Mr Justice Heydon, who also the saving of time. If the Minister will had had the advantage of a previous mercial career. But the Justices of 'the High Court of Australia, who are doing their work so satisfactorily, have not had commercial careers, and are not competent to deliberate on such cases as would brought before them under Part III . the measure. The Minister ought to give some reason 'for appointing a Justice of High Court in preference to a commercial man. If such questions are to be one person, let him be a highly competent commercial man, who knows something of itfhe industries lof Australia-wh o knows about shipping, and who as has travelled widely, and has some the knowledge of the condition of manuBrifactures in other parts of the world. to Nor does the Minister appear at all inof clined to give the Committee any information by which we mav deal satisfactorily this proposal. These'dumping clauses, operate in the same manner as a proTariff.. In his introductory speech, Minister entered into details in support of them. He said that some friends, his had put £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 back ? to use his own figures - into the d industry of bringing shale out of with mines in New South Wales, putting it into a kiln where it would ' be baked, and extracting from it crude kerosene oil. .This oil is to be brought into with oil taken from the oil Are wells of America. These friends of the he told us, have constructed a at a cost of £80,000, and we are to believe that they are to sell their product in competition with oil which is The obtained in America as easily as you can take water out of the sea. If these clauses are to be put into operation against Amerikerosene, the effect will be to increase the cost of oil to settlers in the back country, to farmers, and to all I am inclined to think that the Committee will not be satisof fied with the information with which wo have already been supplied. In the Minister's absence last week we dealt with this phase of the question pretty full v . W<shall be able to make better progress this week if the Minister will make a statement giving us the information, which he 'says-, he has at his disposal. When the T a r if f under discussion it was the usual pracfortice for the Minister in charge to makea a statement upon which a debate occurred.. It was found that that practice conduced to< 1 comaccede to what appears to be the general request of the Committee, and will justify his action in placing these clauses in the Bill - if he will show cause why he should be intrusted with power to keep goods out be of Australia in the manner proposed- I of shall be glad to hear what he has to say. Will the Minister interject to let us know the whether he intends to say anything? Is it his intention to keep put of this country left to £7.000,000 worth of goods per annum under the heading of metals and machinery - good s which are the requisites of settlers and farmers in the iback country ? These clauses will have to be analyzed with the greatest detail unless we have more information.",22
133,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"New England) [3.35]. - I echo what the honourable and learned member for .Corinella has said, that we should have the fullest possible information before we are called upon to pass these clauses. They rest upon the foundation that dumping of a mischievous character is taking place, and that it is injurious to Australian industries. There is absolutely no need for this Bill , unless such dumping does take place. Therefore, if the Minister furnishes us with no information in proof of his statements, we should refuse to proceed with the measure. Personally, I believe that he has no information of the kind. I am of opinion that there is no dumping of such a character as to injure the industries of this country.",24
134,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I will give the honourable member some soap.,24
135,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister has soft-soaped a number of people in this country, but there is one man whom he cannot soft-soap, and that is myself. The honourable gentleman is trying to force this Bill through by bluff. Why does he not bring forward the evidence collected by the Tariff Commission to show that dumping is proceeding to the injury oif Australian industries ? He would not consent that this information obtained at such - cost, and given on oath, should be at our disposal before proceeding with the Bill, because, in my opinion, he was satisfied that if the Tariff Commission's evidence were before us it would be proved conclusively that there was no need for the Bill.",24
136,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member must not discuss the Bill, but the clause before the Committee.",24
137,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister cannot give a single instance of dumping that has injured any industry in Australia. It is true that he has referred to wire nails and a few other commodities, but there was no proof in what he said that injurious clumping takes place. Because goods are sold here for less than the price at which they are sold in America, it does not prove that they are dumped into Australia. It simnlv proves the absurdity of a fiscal nolicv which consists in keeping up prices of goods in a protected country, and enabling the same goods to be sold cheaply abroad.",24
138,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I think the honourable member is proving too much.,24
139,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If there is any dumping whatever, there ought to be plenty of proof of it . Strong free-trader as I am, if it were shown to me that manufacturers abroad were trying to kill our industries with the ulterior purpose of raising prices, I should at once be inclined to stop that kind of thing. If the Minister will take the Committee into his confidence, and will give the information that he has indicated that he possesses, I shall gladly listen to him. But, honestly, my opinion is that he has no such information ; and, therefore, I urge that there is no necessity to pass clauses which will have such an injurious effect upon the trade) and commerce of these States.",24
140,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"West Sydney) [3.40] Honourable members opposite have taken exception, some for one reason, and some for another, to the introduction of these provisions; but it appears to me that the objection to pass the clause, unless the Minister makes a certain statement, whiclfi t is alleged that he promised to make later on, is an argument not deserving ot very much attention.",24
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is a promise nothing ?,24
142,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What I mean is that it is quite immaterial whether the Minister has at his disposal certain instances which would seem to show that it might be desirable that this measure should become operative in the future. It is nothing to the point to say that there is to-dav only one industry that might be affected by the clauses, if tomorrow or next year there may be half-a-dozen other industries affected.

I occupy this singular positionthat I am now exactly what I was when I first entered this Parliament; and that is so far from being true regarding many honourable members opposite, that nine out of every ten of them do not know where they stand. What has happened to some of them? Here, in the honourable member for Gippsland, we have a living answer to the interjection of the honourable member for Parramatta-a n interjection pertinent, as he imagines, but impertinent, as I think. He is the head and front of the offending. I suppose that he is the living embodiment of the protectionist policy. There is another honourable rnember, the honourable and learned member for Corinella, who has lately found that creed, which he conveniently buried beneath the ocean of political exigencies for a little while.",24

The honourable member for Robertson-whos e argument in reference to American oil and locally-made shale oil would appear to represent the opinions of honourable members opposite-seem s to me to have overlooked several most important facts, particularly, one set forth in clause 13. Who is to judge as to what is unfair competition ? The honourable member for Robertson objected to the question being decided by a Justice of the High Court, because he would have had no commercial training. It is a singular thing that, first of all, honourable members on the other side objected to the Minister deciding the question, because he was a partu man. They said that the Minister might hold one opinion today, and that he might be followed by another man with a different opinion tomorrow. , Then they objected to the question being decided by a' Board of business men, because they placed no reliance upon the men of whom it would be composed.

164,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes . I do not say for a moment that I should not vote for this proposal in any case, with this one safeguard-that it must not be put into force unless it be to the interests of the producers, workers, and consumers. Take, for instance, kerosene oil. On the face of it, how can it be to the interests of the consumer to impose such restrictions as will increase the price of kerosene oil by, say, 200 or 300 per cent.",26
165,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does not the honourable and learned member see how absurd the Bill is?,26
166,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not know what the Minister thinks. All I say is that, under the provision, he will not be the one to decide the point. If a man went into the Arbitration Court with a case, such as the honourable member for Robertson has given, He would not succeed. Take the Milk Carters' case, where the men asked for one delivery of milk on Sunday. Amongst other things, it was stated by the employers that this would necessitate the payment of higher wages, and some said, ""We cannot afford to pay an-increase."" The proof of that would settle the case. I apprehend that the same sort of evidence would be effective here. Therefore, if the price of a commodity is going to be enormously increased in that way, I apprehend that, under this section, a decision in favour of a particular manufacture could not be obtained. If such a decision were obtained, and the price of the commodity were effectively increased, then certainlv that could not be consistent with showing a due regard to the interests of the producers, workers, and consumers. With my eyes open, I could not vote for anything that would have such a result.",26
167,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Perth) [3.53] - As one who has been busily engaged for some time in investigating cases of alleged dumping, I also would be glad if the Minister would give some specific instances. He may be in possession of information which has not been laid before the Tariff Commission, and, if so, it ought to be placed before the Committee. Seeing that dumping is alleged to be carried on in Australia to a considerable extent, this question ought, I think, to be threshed out, in view of all possible evidence, for the simple reason that it seems to be very largely a stock argument used by those who desire increased duties. If one is to believe all that has been stated before the Tariff Commission, one is driven to the conclusion that there is hardly such a thing as legitimate trade carried on in the matter of imports. Dumping has been alleged in innumerable cases from rock salt to cotton wadding. Whenever a man wants an increased duty, and seems to be hard pressed for a reason, then dumping is alleged. I can say without hesitation that, when followed up, a great many cases of alleged dumping seem for the most part to have dissipated into thin air. I admit readily that in a country like Great Britain dumping undoubtedly is carried on. That is to say, a country with a large population and free ports offers facilities for those who wish to get rid of surplus stock in other countries and still get the best possible rates. And because this dumping has existed in Great Britain, as has been frequently admitted even by free-traders, it has been found a very useful argument, indeed, I should say almost a scarecrow, to be used in Australia. It has been so introduced and established by the great protectionist organ of Victoria, which, day in and day out, has brought before the eyes of its readers the danger and the detriment of dumping, until the idea has positively obsessed all protectionist politicians. Although I admit readily that dumping has been carried on in the case of Great Britain, and for certain reasons, there are, so far as Australia is concerned, reasons which will tend for manrv a day to come to make dumping a very rare occurrence indeed. I do not want to introduce now in detail any of the evidence which has been submitted to the Tariff Commission. But I want to give what - I might calJ a - priori arguments to show that dumping is not likely to be carAustralian Industries ried on here under present conditions. Dumping is of two kinds. Goods' may be introduced into a country with the object of killing a local industry, or they may simplv be introduced to bring what they will fetch, without reference to whether there are competing industries in the country or not. With regard to the first class of clumping, the conditions under which, it could be carried out are very rare. No one would allege for a moment that any business man in a country outside Australia interested in an industry which is pretty generally conducted throughout the world would send his goods here and sacrifice them, in order to k ill an Australian industry, for the simple reason that he would be doing something which could hardly bring him any advantage. If he killed the local industry he would simply do so, not for his own benefit, but for the benefit of other competitors by whom he was surrounded. I take it that no business man is such an arrant fool as to spend money in killing an industry in Australia when he has stronger and more powerful competitors around him, who would immediate! v step in and get the advantage of his sacrifice. The suggestion is absolutely ridiculous when it is examined from a business point of view. Again, take the dumping of goods into Australia in order that they may bring whatever they will fetch. In Australia the conditions are such as to make that a most improbable act. In the first nlace, if a merchant in a part of the world which produces a superfluity of goods of a certain kind wants to dump, he will look for the biggest market he can possibly find, for the simple reason that if he were to select a limited market and send his goods there, the mere fact that they were thrown at the consumers would tend to bring down their value very considerably.",26

169,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No Australian market presents those necessary conditions to the man who wants to dump goods. The Australian market is too limited to induce a man on the other side of the world to send his goods here, and run the risk of getting for them prices much lower than he could obtain in a larger market. Great Britain is the dumping ground for the surplus products of the protected countries of the worldj because her market is open, and is situated nearer to the manufacturers, while [10 JULY, .1906.] Preservation Bill. ""53 it is also the biggest available. If a manufacturer has a large quantity of goods of which he wishes to dispose, he sends them into that market, because he knows that there the risk of a flooding taking place which would seriously lower their values, is the least possible. But manufacturers know that goods sent to this market are likely to be affected in price by the mere fact that they are being dumped. I desire more information on the whole subject than is yet in our possession, before proceeding with these clauses. I do not wish to vote for a mere electioneering kite, which the Bil l seems to be. It is just possible that those responsible for it have introduced these clauses before the presentation of the reports of the Tariff Commission, fearing that, if they waited, those reports would show no justification for their action.",27
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Parramatta) [4.4] - The honourable member for West Sydney has delivered a most interesting,, though, on the whole, a very peculiar speech. He began by abusing those on this side of the Chamber, and also their attitude in regard to the fiscal question generally, and declared that the right honourable member for East Sydney is still his fiscal leader. It may be that he is following the right honourable gentleman, but, if so, he is following him afar off.",27
171,Mr MCCAY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Following him with a brick.,27
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"For the last year or two he has been following him throughout the Commonwealth with a political brick in his hand. If he regards his present conduct as a backing of his fiscal friends, I say a plague on such backing. He declared himself to be in favour of the Bill, and, in supporting the measure without expressing the slightest desire for its modification, he is not following the Bill into opposition. Throughout "" last week, he was paired with the Government and against the Opposition on these dumping clauses, and in regard to other provisions. No honourable member has "" jumped Jim Crow "" more often than he has done in regard to matters as to which he claims that his conduct has been fair and above board. He came here first as an uncompromising opponent of the Minister of Trade and Customs, but, although no one has belaboured the Minister more, we now find him cheek by jowl w it t him.",27
173,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"He was always my friend. Mr JOSE PH COOK - After he had put the right honourable member for East Sydney out of office in New South Wales, he was so much the Minister's friend as practically to carry on his Government for him for about twelve months. The Minister could not move hand or foot then without consulting the honourable and learned member. But, on entering the Federal arena, he made a sudden turn.",28
174,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,How does the honourable member intend to connect his remarks with the clause?,28
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am replying !to the criticisms of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney of the attitude of those on this side of the Chamber, and am showing that he has not consistently followed the leader of the Opposition. For many years he has had the cordial support of the Free-trade Party of New South Wales, but I shall be surprised if he gets it at the next election.",28
176,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"He w i ll be elected. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I do not say that he will not, but he must rely on support different from that which he has received in the past. it may be that he intends to appeal to a different section of the electors. At any rate, he will not get the free-trade support which has helped him to success in years gone by. He .taunts the members of the Opposition with the fact that they do not all hold the same fiscal opinion; but it does not lie in his mouth to rebuke others for political inconsistency, in view of his present position. He is now assisting the Minister to prevent the landing of goods on the wharfs of West Sydney.",28

178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes . Although he professes to be a free-trader, and a f o l lower of the fiscal leadership of the right honourable member for East Sydney, he is now assisting the Minister of Trade and Customs to strike a blow at« the trade whereby the men who returned him to this Parliament make their living. He tells us that he is now where he has always been.",28
179,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have never been on any but the one side. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Speakin g in a political sense, the honourable and learned 1 member has never remained five minutes in the one place. Even at the present moment he is sitting at the table with the Minister.",28
180,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If it had not been for the honourable member and some others, I should be sitting at t'he table instead of the Minister.",28
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable and learned member has unconsciously blurted out the whole truth. Now that he cannot climb over the backs of the people to places of authority, power, privilege, and pay, he turns round upon those with whom he was accustomed to foregather politically, and taunts them with the company which they are keeping. It would be better for him to pull the beam out of his own eye.",28
182,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,My political opinions are the same that I have always held: but the honourable member has practically bartered his soul for a mess of pottage.,28
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Has the honourable and learned member supported every fiscal provision in the Bill , because his fiscal opinions have never changed?",28
184,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Did not the honourable member vote for the Bill?,28
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No . We have made some drastic amendments in it , and there have been some divisions on which; the honourable and learned member has always been paired for the Government and against the Opposition. For instance, we took a vote the other day",28
186,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member cannot deal with what has alreadv been done by the Committee. He must confine himself to the question before the Chair.,28
187,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I did not know how I was paired; but the honourable member knows the circumstances under which I was absent.,28
188,Mr TOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable and learned - member, and a number of others, do not know what they are doing in respect to the Bill. All they know is that tfiey a.rte supporting the Minister. When they learn the meaning of some of the votes which they have given, as interpreted in plain English, they will feel that they would be very glad if they could repudiate' them. One of the most striking things in connection with the consideration of this measure is that those who taunt honourable members on this side of the Chamber with holding their fiscal views looselvv have voted en bloc for provisions entirely at vana.nce' with the fiscal faith which they possess. That has happened time and again. But many - honourable members have taken so little interest in the discussion of the - details of the measure that they have not known what they were voting for.",28
189,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"How could that happen, since the honourable member's explanations have been so ample ?",29
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not think that any one would be the wiser for having heard what the honourable and learned member has said just now on the Bill . I advise him, instead of making jeering allusions to his fiscal leader, to pay attention to his present position.",29
191,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I shall not look to the honourable member to carry me over any stiles. I shall get over them myself.,29
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I know that. No one will climb the stiles more dexterously than the honourable and learned member will do. He will climb as dexterously over a protectionist at the next election as he did over a free-trader at_ the last election. I think it is only fair to ask the Minister to justify these very drastic proposals. He has been urged to fulfil the promise made to the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and repeated during the debate, that when we reached this stage of the Bill he would give us information which would justify his action. Now, however, the Minister sits back in his chair, and stubbornly refuses to enlighten us. It mav be that he has no special information. If not, I venture to sav that he ought to have. So f ar ns we are able to judge, only ordinary competition has been proceeding in the harvester business, which the Minister seems to have taken specially under his charge. The bulk of the harvester-importing business is concentrated in the hands of the Massev-Harris Company, which is a British company. We have heard a great deal of talk from the Prime Minister, and those who support him, as to the importance of preferential trade, and the necessity of straining and twisting our Tariff with a view to concentrating the trade of the Empire in the hands of the citizens of the Empire. Now, however, we find that the British trade in harvesters is being directly challenged.",29
193,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Britis h trade?,29
194,Mr TOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes, the Massey-Harris Company is a British company.",29
195,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is a Canadian company, supported by the United States.",29
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is a British company operating within the charmed circle of the Empire, for the prosperity of which Ministers profess so much concern. Now, however, they have submitted legislation which is specially aimed at the Canadian exporters of harvesters to Australia. If the Massey-Harris Company are engaged in destructive competition, such as has been so clearly explained by the honourable member for Perth-if they have designs on our harvester trade, and have expressed a determination to drive the local makers out of the market with a view to afterwards increasing the prices of their machines, the Minister might appeal to us to do something. But when he is challenged, he merely quotes figures which show that the trade has been carried on in the ordinary course. He told us that .£85,000 worth of harvesters had been im-' ported into Australia during the last year.",29
197,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"And that £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 had been exported.",29
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It has been proved, in the course of evidence given before the Tariff Commission, that the Australian harvester manufacturers are turning out harvesters to the value of ,£250,000 per annum. It does not appear that they are being subjected to - destructive competition. On the contrary, it is clear that our harvester manufacturers are holding their own against Canadian and American competitors. At any rate, I hope with all my heart that they are. Neither I nor those associated with me on this side of the Chamber, desire to see the local factories closed up ' through the operation of foreign competition. Nothing would please us better than to see the Australian harvester manufacturers flourishing, and able to compete with all 'their outside rivals, so long as they can do so upon terms fair to the public. There is nothing in the present conditions, so f ar as they have been disclosed to us, to indicate that anything beyond ordinary trading operations are being carried on. If there is anything to which objection can be taken, why are we not furnished with information either by the Minister or by the members of the Tariff Commission, who have been engaged in inquiring into the matter ? The Tariff Commission have visited the various States during, the recess, and have, in the most self-sacrificing manner, devoted themselves to the acquirement of information bearing upon the very problem that is now engaging our attention. And yet, on the very eve of the presentation of their report to this House, this Bill is being rushed through. There is no justification for asking us to pass legislation of this kind until 1 we have been placed in possession of the information obtained by the Tariff Commission. The Minister is in duty bound to enlighten us as to the basis upon which he rests his present proposal. does so, we .are entitled to ask that this legislation shall be held over. We shall be justified in adopting every means that may be open to us to insure that the fullest light shall be thrown upon the matter. We ought to be exceedingly chary about passing legislation which in its very essence involves prohibitive protection. which to meet unfair competition abroad is not by passing a Bill which would prevent the possibility of trade, but by so regulating the importations by means of a Tariff-that is, if we believe in regulating such matters-as to insure that the competition shall not be destructive to our industries. That would be a much more straightforward way of meeting the difficulty ; but there is one very important reason why that method should not be adopted by the Government. Minister, more than any other man in this Chamber, is pledged not to raise the Tariff question during the currency of this Parliament. He knows very well that if he brought down a new Tariff schedule without reference to the reports of the Tariff Commission, he would break a pledge which he solemnly gave from all the public platforms upon which he appeared at the last election. Knowing that that pledge is in existence, and feeling that he is bound to observe it-at least, outwardly-he endeavouring by means of the present Bill to sneak behind his promise. This part of the' measure in its present form means prohibitive protection, and therefore Ave are entitled to demand fullest justification shall be offered for its introduction. I again ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to fulfil the promise he made during the second-reading debate. It is his duty to the House and to the country to inform us as to the basis upon which his drastic proposals rest. is due also-and I hope that I may say this without laying myself open to any unfair accusations - to the persons against whom we are raising these barriers that Mr Josefh Cook. they should know the basis upon which we are proceeding. It is only fair that the Massey-Harris Company, as a British firm, should know why we are proposing to ruthlessly shut them out of our markets. If the company are adopting unfair means with a view to bringing about the downfall of our harvester manufacturers, we should be informed as to how they are acting. Apparently, however; those who have Unless he the fullest information on the subject are not permitted to impart it to us. Having regard to all the circumstances surrounding the case, I do not know that if would be contravening any political ethic for the Chairman of the Tariff Commission to give us the information which he has upon this subject. Indeed, it seems to me that The way in he might incur a grave responsibility from if he withheld information which would prevent us from making a grave mistake. That is a matter, of course, which he will have to decide for himself, and I am sure that he and the other members of the Commission will be actuated by considerations of duty, and nothing else. I desire to pay the Commission the compliment of saying that they have performed exceedingly hard work, and the information which they have gathered at so much The Prime cost to themselves should prove very valuable to us. It is disgraceful that we should be debarred from taking advantage of that information, when we are being asked to legislate with regard to matters which the Commission have made the subject of special inquiry. I suppose that it is of no use to make any further appeal to the Minister of Trade and Customs. He has made up his mind as to the course he will pursue, and he has a very effective way of meeting, a situation of this kind, is namely, to sit still and say nothing. He is sure of those who sit behind him. They ask no questions. Free-trader and protectionist behind him are alike dumb, and therefore the Minister thinks that it is best that the to sit tight until honourable members of the Opposition have exhausted themselves.. This legislation will be placed on the statute-book, and, too late, we may find that those who know most about' the subject have declared that it is not necessary so far as some of these enterprises are conIt cerned. After seeing in the daily pressfrom time to time reports of the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, I shall be very much surprised if the members of that Commission report that there.is need' for this special legislative interference the protection of the manufacture of harare vesters in Australia.",29
199,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It d'eals with all agricultural machinery, and not with harability vesters alone.",31
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am aware of that, hut the Minister specially singled harvesters in his speech. The honourable gentleman made that large general stateimportations ment, which we have hea'rd from dumping. platforms a thousand times already, as to the many million pounds' worth of other name. metals and machinery that are being imported to this country. The strange thing about the honourable gentleman's statements is that the figures he gave in his secondcarried reading speech indicated a decline in the importations of metals and machinery, and not an increase. They showed a decline of over .£1,000,000.",31
201,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"They showed an increase for last year over the year before. Mr. JOSEPH ' COOK - I should think that under ordinary conditions of trade I there was room for some improvement. this Three years ago these importations amounted in value to £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, then they went down to £6,000,000. So that if they, did increase to nearly ,£7,000,000 last year, that indicated noout thing in the nature of dumping, but simplv showed a recovery of the ordinary volume of business.",31
202,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable member not think that dumping has been going on for some years ?,31
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I should be very glad indeed to know what the Minister regards as dumping. If the honourable gentleman regards ordinary importations dumping, if all goods coming here from other countries are to be considered of dumped, let us know it. I should like to remind the honourable gentleman that if are going„to shut out all importations, we shall be compelled! to find some way of disposing of exports from Australia. should understand that Australia dumps more than she imports by a very great deal. If we are to prevent even the most innocent and legitimate description of dumping from abroad, what is to become of our dumping in other parts of the world? All"" this talk about dumpingin connection with the great Empire to which we belong reveals only more and more clearly the fact that Great Britain and the for countries forming the Empire as a whole, the greatest dumpers in the world today. Great Britain dumps upon every shore; her life's blood depends upon her to do so; and in Australia our life's blood depends upon our .ability to send our exports to the various countries of the out world. I , therefore, say that the Minister should tell us whether he regards ordinary of metals and machinery as If so, the honourable gentleman had better give this part of the Bill anAnti-competition or antitrade would more correctly describe what it deals with than does "" dumping."" Dumping, as we know, is importation on specially for destructive purposes, or, as was said by the last speaker, importation for the purpose of the disposal of surplus stocks, arising very often from commercial bankruptcy and from over-production-the importation of something which must be got rid of even below the usual price. If that is what the Minister of Trade and Customs means by dumping. admit that if he can make out his case for Bill , we are here to consider it full y with him. But if , as we may judge from and the honourable gentleman's interjections, he regards all importations to Australia in the nature of dumping, we had better find before we pass a Bill of so far-reaching a character as this, what we are going to do about our own dumping abroad. Two can play at this kind of game, and if we decline point blank to engage in the ordinary competitive enterprises of the world, the world mav be disposed to pay us bark in our own coin. I ask the Minister, before we proceed with the detailed consi-, deration of these clauses, to tell us what he as regards as dumping. That he should do so has become the more necessary. by reason his interjections and his general attitude in dealing with the Bill. If the honourable we gentleman confines his definition of dumping to sinister operations which would have the effect of sweeping our Australian indusHe tries out of existence if allowed free pla.v. let him make out a case to show that that kind of thing is going on, and then honourable members, with all the knowledge of the Department available to them-and I strongly suggest with the knowledge which can be given by the Tariff Commission also available-ma y proceed to a full , fair, and free discussion of this matter unhampered by ignorance, as they are today, and may be able to give it their best attention in the interest of legitimate competiton and of legitimate trade and commerce.",31
204,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Dalley) [4.37] - For the last two and a-half hours we have been witnesses of a very sad spectacle. Minister of Trade and Customs has been appealed to by various members of the Committee for information in regard' to legislation of a most drastic character. The honourable gentleman has - been coaxed, cajoled, and cuffed, but we cannot get any answer from him. He absolutely refuses to give the Committee the information which it is necessary that we should have before voting upon so important a measure as that before us. The Attorney-General has tried his hand with the honourable gentleman, and so has his friend the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, known locally as "" 66 Boirake-street."" But even the combination of the Attorney-General and "" 66 Bourke street"" could not wring from the Minister what evidence of dumping he has. A fortnight ago I moved an amendment on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, to secure delav in the passing of the measure until we could get some information from the Tariff Commission on the subject of metals and machinery. There is the same reason for delay today, for the honourable member for 'Perth, who is a member of the Commission appointed to inquire into this matter, has said that the Commission have never yet received a singje bit of evidence in regard to dumping in Australia.",32
205,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No ; I did not say that.,32
206,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I understood the honourable member to say that the Tariff Commission has received no evidence to warrant the statement that dumping is taking place in Australia.,32
207,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I made no such sweeping statement as that.,32
208,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member now uses the word "" sweeping."" I understood from his remarks thatj the Tariff Commission had received no evidence of this character, because he said that he looked to the Minister of Trade and Customs to present it.",32
209,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I say I would like to hear what information the Minister has in connection with the matter.,32
210,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member bears out what I have said. He would like to know what information the Minister has, and that pre-supposes that the honourable member, who has for about two and a-half years been working as a member of the Commission, has not yet 'received such information. The Sir JOHN QUICK - No , not for so long. Mr .WILKS - The honourable member for Perth has condemned himself out of his own mouth, because if , as a member of the Tariff Commission, he had obtained this information, it would not be necessary for him to ask it from the Minister. .The honourable and learned member for Corinella had the Minister on the gridiron like a live eel over a slow fire, but while the honourable gentleman twisted and squirmed, he made no answer. The Minister knows that he has behind him an army of blind supporters. The honourable member for Parramatta has just said that they are dumb, and I say that they are also blind'The honourable and learned member for Corinella appealed to the Minister, if he had any information, to give it to the Committee, and if the honourable gentleman had done so, two hours of the time of the Committee would have been saved. Either the information which the honourable gentleman has is 'of so weak a character that he is afraid to mention it, or else, as the honourable member for Parramatta has suggested, he considers all importations in the nature of dumping. If that be so, it but proves the argument used from this side that this measure is a surreptitious attempt to get round the Tariff, and to give the Minister the fullest prohibitory powers he could possibly obtain. No wonder the Minister said eighteen months ago that he would not attempt the Tariff issue in this House. The honourable gentleman knew what he had before him. If honourable members are sent here by their constituents to give effect to protectionist principles, they have a perfect right to do so, but they should not do it by means of such a measure as this. If the Minister considers that all imports come under"" the category of dumping, and wishes to prevent that kind of dumping, he is, in this Bill, smuggling through Parliament a policy of prohibitive protection, and is asking us to be as blind as are his supporters. The honourable gentleman will not give the information for which he has been asked, and he is not now even in an irritated mood. The honourable and learned member for Corinella warmed the honourable gentleman up more than I ever saw him warmed up lipfore. but he ' appears to have recovered himself, and I must admit that I should like to see him annoyed, because that is only chance of getting any information from him. The honourable gentleman does blurt out information when he is annoyed, but when he is in the passive mood in which we now find him like a pig upon a block of ice, we can get nothing from but a grunt. The honourable member f o Parramatta .appealed to the honourable gentleman in a most pathetic manner for information which the Minister will not give. I think that it should be known to the public that the Minister in charge of this measure desires to impose legislation upon a certain' class in the munity, and will not give any justification foF it . How can honourable members go fore their constituents and say that they passed legislation of this character because it would be useful to the community, when the Minister in charge of it will not supply any information which will justify its troduction ?",32
211,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"How can I , honourable members opposite are all talking",33
212,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"At first the honourable gentleman said that he would not give the information, then he said that he had given it, and now he asks how he can give it when we are all talking.",33
213,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I cannot speak while the honourable member is speaking.,33
214,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then I shall pause to give the Minister an opportunity now. Minister apparently regards me as he would one of his blind supporters, and desires me to sit down, so that he may take further notice of the matter. Air. MCCAY - But the honourable member can speak again.",33
215,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is fortunate' that may speak as often as we like in Comevidence mittee. How can the Minister expect honourable members, either on this or the other side, to vote for a measure this character unless he presents the proper data? If the Minister possesses the formation which is asked for. what is his reason for keeping it back? Is it because, as the honourable member for Parramatta has suggested, the Minister is such an dent protectionist that he would go to ' length in order to get the fullest measure of protection ? Is it because the Minister, who. from his experience, is so acute, knows that on an open vote, within these walls or in the country. he could not pose the fiscal prohibition he desires, is. now seeking to attain his end by means our of this Bill ? The Minister has often appealed to American legislation and American precedents, and I ask him whether this, to use an Americanism, is not another way of ""whipping the devil around a stump "" ? As the representative of an electorate which him is much concerned in shipping, I ask r whether I can be expected to accept the interpretation of dumping presented by. the Minister. We cannot expect one-sided trade. Ships will not come here empty, simplv in made order to take away our produce. However, I do not wish to'enter into the larger economic question, nor to discuss the procompriety or otherwise of dumping. That can be done on the next clause. I never knew bea Minister, either in State or Commonwealth, who received such a cajoling, coaxing, and cuffing as the Minister has been subjected to in the course of this discussion*. Appeal's have been made to him from alt insides, including the Attorney-General, and the leader of the organization, which has its when head-quarters at 66 Bourke-street. Under ? pressure of public opinion, I think the Minister will be compelled to supply the necessary information as to which firms, if any, have carried on dumping to the detriment of Australian industries. The Tariff Commission has been sitting for two years, and if those interested in Australian, industries have suffered from dumping of a detrimental character, they would have been only too pleased to lay - their care before The that Commission. Judging from the newspaper reports of the evidence taken by the Royal Commission in regard to metals and no machinery, no dumping of a detrimental character has been disclosed. Doubtlesssuch a prominent and keen protectionist c organ as the Melbourne Age would have we ' been delighted to blazon forth any such in the largest type. It is of no use making general statements; and I am on with those honourable members who, whileof perfectly willing to vote for a free-trade or revenue Tariff, are just as concerned inas are honourable members opposite in extending natural assistance to Australian industries if it be shown that the prerent Tariff is being used as a lever for the dearstruction of those industries. But we areanv not to be deluded into sanctioning the imposition of higher duties under cover of this clause of the Bill . If such a course were taken the investigations of the Tariff Commission! would represent so much waste imof monev, and, in view of the power sought and to be given to the Minister of Trade and* Customs, there would be no need for a Tariff to be passed by this Chamber. I do not know whether the Minister's own sweet reasonableness will come to our rescue, or whether he is going to prove so adamantine as to require some political dynamite in the form of a vote of censure, to extract the information. am really beginning to think that a vote of censure is the only way by which we can attain our desire. If a vote of censure were tabled,. I guarantee that even members of the Labour Party would be compelled to vote for it, in view of the treatment which has been meted out to honourable members and the public. If it became known in the constituencies that members of the Labour Party were, to use another Americanism which the Minister will understand, ""going blind""'-were voting in the dark, simply on the ipse dixit of the Minister-thei r supporters side would be far from satisfied. That, however, is the concern of the Labour Party. I am responsible to my constituents, and I refuse to vote for any portion of this clause in the absence of the necessary information. The Minister's silence lends support to the idea that he is simply using speculative arguments; and I hope the honourable gentleman will at once tell us all he knows about this matter, and thus save, perhaps, a long debate.",33
216,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Bendigo) [4.57] I cannot help feeling sorry that this part of the Bill has been brought forward in anticipation of the receipt of the reports of the Tariff Commission. I say. that partly because, to some extent, I feel embarrassed, and almost tongue-tied, in dealing with certain questions which are now really under the deliberation of the Royal Commission; and I cannot, in justice to my colleagues on the Commission, freely, fully, and exhaustively discuss here questions which they have yet to settle. There are certain members of the Royal Commission who are not Members of Parliament, and who cannot make use of the opportunity, which is presented to us, to ventilate their opinions. It would, I think, be a mistake, in propriety as well as in etiquette, to now fully and exhaustively discuss those questions on the.floor of this Chamber. At the same time, I shall endeavour, as cautiously as I can without trenching on the prerogative of the Royal Commission, to make a few remark's in reference to this question. Honourable members are distinctly at a disadvantage in dealing with this part of the Bill in the absence, not only of the report of the Commission, but of the evidence given before the Commission. Some honourable members have sugI gested that the dumping question is not a normal part of the Tariff question-no t a normal part of the Tariff conditions. So fair as my recollection serves me, there has been a considerable amount of testimony tendered to the Commission concerning proceedings under the name of "" dumping ' ' ; but there seems to be considerable difference of opinion as tb the exact meaning of the word. Some of the witnesses used the word "" dumping "" in a comfortable, self-assured manner-muc h in the same way as the old lady used the ""blessed word Mesopotamia."" But so far as I can understand out- from reliable evidence given before the Commission, the true definition of "" dumping "" is the export of surplus stock from one country into another, and the sale of that surplus stock in the importing country at prices lower than the prices of that stock in the home country or country of origin.",34
217,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is how dumping is referred' to in all the consular reports.,34
218,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,""" Dumping "" does not mean the sale of those goods at a. loss, or at a price below the cost of production, but it certainly does 'mean the sale of goods in the market of the importing country at prices lower than the sale prices'- within the country of origin. I should like to draw honourable members' attention to paragraph 17 of the Tariff Commission Report No. 2, which has already been presented' to' Parliament, in reference to spirits and the distillation of spirits. In that paragraph honourable members will find a preliminary reference to this question of dumping, and a definition in reference to the transport or export of surplus stocks of spirits. The paragraph is as follows: When the stocks of the Scotch distilleries are heavy they ship their surplus out to Australia. They do not care at what price they sell, because it is only their surplus. Once fixed charges are paid, anything over the cost of labour and material is profit. When a distiller in a large wav of business has manufactured a certain number of gallons, and has earned sufficient to cover his fixed charges, any further quantity made is not charged with these expenses, and can therefore be sold at a much cheaper rate. He is at a great advantage compared with a distillery in a small way, and only running to half its capacity. The foregoing is an illustration of dumping given by Mr Joshua -(Q.1260) . It will be observed that it is suggested, not that "" d u m p in g"" means selling below actual cost of production, but that it means selling at a lower rate than that obtaining in the exporting country. The Bill, as it is drawn, does not meet a case of that k in d ; consequently, although this part of the Bil l is headed "" Dumping,"" it is really not , a Bill or part of a Bill dealing witrl dumping. There is very little evidence, indeed, so far as I can remember, Before The Commission of the sale within Australia of goods, wares, or merchandise produced in countries beyond the seas, (at prices actually below the cost of production, but there is evidence of goods sold in Australia at prices below the market prices Tn the country of origin.",34
219,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Jus t as our exports are sold at lower prices.,35
220,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Dumpin g does not necesTariff sarily mean selling without profit.,35
221,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is so. As the extract shows, having provided for the fixed charges in the country of origin, and after exacting, sometimes, a higher price that country, producers there are enaBled to sell at a lower price tn the counerv to which they send their goods; and, as a matter of fact, the Bill , as I read it not meet that case. I mav say that, going although we have taken evidence under this"" heading in all parts of Australia, and examined upwards of 600 witnesses, not one witness suggested a remedy of the kind that is now embodied in the Bill . There were numbers of witnesses who came forWe ward and referred to this exporting and! ing of surplus stock, and who suggested demanded higher duties; but none asked for a prohibition provision such as that about embodied in the Bill. So far - as the evireallv dence goes under these various headings, the Tariff Commission will deal fully, carefully, and exhaustively with every item of alleged export of surplus stock, and its sale at lower prices in the country consumption than in the country of export.",35
222,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Will the honourable and learned member allow me? If that export and sale is unfair in the circumstances, is included in the Bill. In clause 14, graph b, the widest power is given to the Judge to sav what is unfair in the circumsee stances, and, if the export and sale is unfair, it is included in the Bill .",35
223,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But it is not included in sub-clauses a to / .,35
224,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Not specifically.,35
225,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Evidentl y the draftsman did not understand the true definition of "" dumping,"" as applied to trade and commerce. I admit that there may be 1 a number of cases which require consideration ; but they do not disclose "" dumping ""within the true commercial definition of the term, as given in the evidence before the Tariff Commission. Of course, selling at a price below the cost of production could not last long, and could not form part of a continuous commercial system; only in rare and extraordinary instances, such as bargain sales, would goods be sent here and sold at prices below the cost of production. As I say, such sales could not continue long, and would not require a Bill of this kind to deed with them. I am a firm believer that the Tariff is the best remedy-that the itself is, and ought to Be, the true means and method of grappling with and settling all these grievances. I believe in straight-out, honest protectionsubstantial protection in all instances where in a good case has been made out-bu t I do not desire to be a party to passing a general clause such as this for the redress of Tariff grievances. It is only fair that , does we should tell the whole world that we are in for high duties in certain cases, because there may be a certain kind of have competition with which it is desired to deal. That would be fairer to outside countries having trade and commerce with Australia ; and it would be more effective also. want to put on stiff, straight, and if sellnecessary, high' protective duties, rather and than to resort to or rely upon a measure such as this. I have my own suspicions the origin of this. Bill . I believe it originated from a desire to supersede the Tariff Commission. When the Tariff Commission was engaged in its investigations in Western Australia and South Australia, there was an agitation in the course of of which it was alleged that the Commission was not working hard enough, or fast enough, or was not sending in reports: and this Bill was launchedas a sort of counter-blast to the Commission, under it the aporehension that it would not report parain sufficient time for its reports to be dealt with by this Parliament. But I can now that this Bill , if persisted in . will tend to delay rather than to hasten the redress of Tariff grievances. We 'have had evidence in connection with many branches of the metals and machinery industry, which I must decline at the present stage to discuss. But this Bill will not meet those grievances, nor will it remove those complaints. It will not satisfy those who have made them. It will be a disappointment and a disillusionment to a number of people who are now waiting for remedial legislation. This Bill rather stands in the way of the redress of grievances, than tends to give relief. I want this House and this Government to facilitate the early consideration of the Tariff Commission's reports: and I say that there is enough work to go on with now. There is almost a month's work in the reports furnished by the Commission, dealing with spirits distillation and wine. Why should not Parliament have an opportunity to discuss them? Although only a part of the report of the Commission has been presented, and it is a partial and incomplete report, there is sufficient material for the House to deal with. Why does not the Government at once propose that the House shall gp into Committee of Ways and Means for the purpose of redressing grievances in an industry which is crying for relief, and in which upwards of a quarter a million of capital has been invested ? Why does not the Government deal with that, and propose some practical measure of relief, instead of wasting time over this anti-Trust Bill?",35
226,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) [5.4] - I am sorry that so much heat has been imported into this debate, and chiefly at the instigation of the honourable member for Corinella, who has misrepresented me very grossly. He stated that I had promised to do certain things, and that I had not done them. I did not make any such promise as the honourable member has said.",36
227,Mr MCCAY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I read from Hansard.,36
228,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have Hansard before me. There is more than one copv of Hansard, fortunatelv.",36
229,Mr MCCAY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Do they differ ?,36
230,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No ; except the honourable member alters his speeches; and then they may. When the honourable memter was speaking on the 20th June, according to Hansard, page 469, he said, referring to myselfI would ask him whether there are any cases in his cognisance in which dumping has taken place to the substantial detriment of Australian industries. I said I think so, most certainly. Then the honourable member asked me whether I knew of any special cases. After my interjection, he saidThat is information ' which honourable members are entitled to have in their possession. If the evil be pressing we are justified in taking more strenuous steps, and incurring more risks to cope with it than it would be the case if it were not more urgent and pressing. Would the Minister be good enough to tell the House in what industries his experience leads him to suppose that dumping of the kind to which he objects is taking place? To that I said I shall reply to that question at the close of the debate'? I did not tell the honourable member that I was going to give specific cases. Then the honourable member went onI presume that he is cognisant of cases, though he did not tell us what they were when he moved the second reading of the Bill . I replied that I had no,t done so because, if I had, I should not have anything to say subsequently. Further on the honourable member said It was his duty in introducing the Bill to give us all the information in his possession. I am just as earnest as he is in my desire to support a fair protectionist policy in this country, and I resent being placed at a disadvantage by his refusal to give information which it is his duty to supply. I repliedI am very glad to hear that the honourable member is a protectionist. I did not know it before.",36
231,Mr MCCAY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is incorrect. The honourable gentleman did know it before.,36
232,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I did not know it, and I do not think it.",36
233,Mr MCCAY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Was the Minister in the House during the Tariff debates in 1901-2?,36
234,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member must allow me to have my own opinion. I have quoted what I said. There was no definite promise to give specific instances. That is what the honourable member tried to pin me down to. It was vetly unfair of him; but I am not going to be bullied or dictated to by him. When I replied on the whole debate, the honourable member, I suppose, was at home in bed. The hour was late. When I spoke there were some interjections, as the report shows: Mr KING O'MALLEY - Tak e a vote !  his own Bill . "" I said that I had not had time to deal generally-I'di d not say specifically-wit h this question on the second reading, in consequence of the debate being so inordinately extended. I nevef made any definite promise, such as.has been imputed to me. That is my reply to the remark of the honourable member for Corinella in that regard. I also referred to the matter on going into Committee. I said, as to the dumping provisions: I do not desire, and I do not intend at present,, to say anything with reference to that part of the measure, but shall leave any explanation I may have to make at a later stage. I had intended to make a statement at that time, but it was objected to on the ground that it would create a general discussion.",36
235,Mr SKENE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Le t us have the explanation now. Sir WILLIAM ' LYNE - I am going to justify myself. I am not going to have words put into my mouth, or intentions put into my mind, that were never there. If the honourable member for Corinella had been doing his duty here he would have known that in my second-reading speech I gave specific cases. For instance, on page 254 of Hansard, he will find a l is t - I do not wish to go into the matter a second time-showin g goods that are sent here from the United States of America, and are purchased in that country at an average of less than, the price of the same articles in the American market, the price obtained here being sometimes one-third and sometimes one-half of that obtained there.",37
236,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Where did the honourable member get the information from ?,37
237,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member will find the information in the report of j h e inspector, instructed bj' the late Mr Seddon.",37
238,Mr LIDDELL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Were the goods purchased in Australia ?,37
239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"They are purchased in the United States for sale in Australia-purchase d ait a price which, in some cases, was only half of the selling price of the same articles in the United States. I will not go through the list again; I have referred to the page in Hansard so that honourable members can look it up. I gave that information so that honourable members might see where dumping was taking place.",37
240,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,How much dumping ?,37
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"A great deal. How is it possible for me to state exactly and precisely the amount of dumping? I am going to refer to another thing that is not exactly dumping, but is a system carried on by 'British firms at the present time with which we ought to deal. I have not traced it elsewhere, although I think it is also taking place on the part of German firms. We are getting a large quantity of Japanese manufactures here which are supposed to be of English and German make.",37
242,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What are they?,37
243,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have here a sample which I will exhibit directly. I am not going to mention the names of the firms, but I have information showing that there is a firm in Great Britain that is having goods made in Japan and sent out here at ai very low price.",37
244,Mr BAMFORD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Quite likelv.,37
245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is so. The price of the goods is below what they can be produced for im this country.,37
246,Mr CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Are not the manufacturers compelled to mark the goods "" Made in Japan "" ?",37
247,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,- Not if they are made for sale in Australia; they are compelled so to mark them if for sale in Great Britain.,37
248,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Will not the Commerce Act cover such cases?,37
249,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I hope that it will. I am going to make the Commerce Act deal with them, if I can. I am giving honourable members facts which have come before me in connection with this question. I also wish to reply to the statements of the honourable member for Bendigo. I have asked the Comptroller-General of Customs to give me any information he could as to this dumping practice. The following is his memorandum to me upon the subject. It is a well-established practice, especially with American manufacturers, to send goods to Australia in order to sell at a price which is much less than that charged in the Home markets. This is especially the case in regard to manufacturers of certain classes of machinery (apart from harvesters), and in consequence of this practice it was that the Canadian Parliament passed its anti-dumping legislation. Sewing machines, typewriting machines, and o i l , are cases where it is alleged on good authority this practice exists. It is evidence and well known that this practice largely prevails, and unless prevented it is sure to continue, inasmuch as it is important to manufacturers to get rid of their surplus stock without depreciating local sates; nails also, and many similar classes of goods. The representatives of two firms came to me in Sydney the other day, and told me that dumping was going on to such an extent in connection with nails as to crush out the local industry. They have given me particulars showing that it is possible to get nails delivered in Sydney cheaper than we can get the imported metal from which to make them. This practice is crushing out nail-making in Australia.",37
250,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What kind nails?,38
251,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I cannot tell the honourable member exactly what kind of nails. I have a memorandum embodying the information given to me by these firms, though I cannot find it amongst my papers just now. At the present time steel from which these nails are made is being sold in Sydney at a higher price than that for which the manufactured nails are being sent from Germany.",38
252,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,W h e r e do make them in Germany ?,38
253,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I know where they are made in Australia. Has not the honourable member seen the correspondence that has taker! place, and the evidence given in connection with, I think, Holdsworth, Macpherson and Company ? It is all very well for the honourable member to laugh. Really he must be oblivious to everything that is going on. He knows nothing about the Tariff business or anything else, so that it is of no use for him to talk on the subject. If we were to manufacture all the nails that we require, it will be seen from the list of imports that it would give employment to a very large number of men. Rut that cannot be done while the dumping process is continued. Mi . 1 CAMERON - And the benefits all the time.",38
254,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not expect to convince a free-trader, and I never try to do so.",38
255,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Minister does not believe that dumping injures us.,38
256,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I believe that it injures vis seriously. members will go into Pitt-street or Castlereagh-street, in Sydney, particularly Pittstreet, they will find a large number of indent agents who have been sent 'here from all parts of the world-fro m Germany, to a large extent, and from the United States. There are not many sent from Great Britain I believe. These men hire A boy to look after one room which is used as an office. out the goods at the cheap rates which I have quoted, and sometimes at one-half of the price charged in the' country of production, and thereby seriously injure those firms which have provided all the machinery required to manufacture the articles in Australia. The indent agents dump the .goods on to wharfs in Sydney Harbor, and are themselves of no good to of this country as consumers, having only one room and an office boy. Whilst they are dumping down these imports they arte seriously injuring legitimate traders and manufacturers to a large extent, and also reducing the rates of wages. Many things besides those I have mentioned are dumped here. If my honourable friends desire to do any good for our people I am quite satisfied that this Bil l will have a very wholesome effect.",38
257,Mr CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The protectionists will they do the same thing as soon as they have overtaken the demand; they will export to England. Sir WILLIAM LY N E - As regards any attempt to reduce wages or to sweat in Australia, we can legislate when the emergency arises, but we cannot deal with the question of wages in the United States or elsewhere.",38
258,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If I remember correctly imported nails are sold, almost invariably, at a higher price than locally-manufactured nails.",38
259,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Because they are better.,38
260,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Importe d nails better than ours !,38
261,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not say that Australian nails are better, but I assert that almost invariably they are sold at a higher consumer price.",38
262,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is no use to try to wriggle over this question, because I am giving my honourable friend a home thrust which he cannot answer. If honourable members on the other side care to keep an open mind they will find that this is only one direction in which dumping If honourable is going on. I look upon dumping in somewhat a ""different light from ' that stated the other night by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and tonight by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. It does not matter under what set of circumstances we get a cheap article here which is going to injure our factories, and reduce the rate of wages, and which is selling at a price lower than They bring that at which it should be sold. If it is proved that it is going to be injurious to our people, that is dumping. the importers get a profit upon the price which they paid or not, to my mind, it does not matter, as far as the injury is concerned. If we are to have Australia for the Australians to a greater extent than we have now, we must see that they are protected against the system which I have been describing.",38
263,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Are we not to consider the consumer at all ?,39
264,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member is always talking about the conmission sumer, but the latter gets cheaper articles here when we have local competition.",39
265,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then , where is the nespirits cessity for this legislation ?",39
266,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That I have ance, proved times without number. keep the production to our own people and reserve the home market to ourselves, the tendency is not to increase the cost of the article, but to decrease the cost, if it legitimate industry.",39
267,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member has been complaining of the cheapness. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I am complaingoods ing of the nastiness.,39
268,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Cheapnes s is what honourable member has complained o|f beof thousands of pounds' worth. fore.,39
269,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has said' that the Bill will not meet the case, but I must differ from h i p . If he will look at paragraph e of clause 14, he will see a provision to meet cases of the kindI f the imported goods are being sold in ""Auspublic! tralia at a price which is less than gives the person importing or selling them a fair profit upon their fair foreign market value, or their cost of production, together with all charges after shipment from the place whence the goods are exported directly to Australia (including toms duty). As regards the honourable and Iea'rned ber's statement that we should the report of the Tariff Commission, there again, I must differ from him. I feel petition sure that the honourable and learned memcheap ber and his compeers on that Commission have done an ardent and' useful work, will give us a good deal of information, but it must not be forgotten by him and others that perhaps the Department o Trade and Customs has as much informastroyed tion as they can get. Mr . KELLY - Why does not the Minister give that information to the Committee? ' Whether Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I was against the appointment of the Tariff Commission, because I maintain that in the Department of Trade and Customs there is all the information which is required for dealing with the Tariff. The information which has come from the Tariff Commission, will, no doubt, be very useful, but it does not follow that we should wait until it is received before we decide what to do in a case of this kind. As regards the statement that the reports of the Tariff Comto hand should be dealt with, I have only to say that they will be dealt with as soon as possible. I do not look upon the reports relating to wines and as being very urgent. I wish to see reports upon questions of far more importhaving regard to the general good of If we can the public, than the question of the Customs and Excise duties on wines and spirits. The report on the latter subjects is important, but it is not as important as the reis a ports of the Commission on other subjects are likely to be. There are other forms of dumping which' I need not enumerate. In the Department, we know well that are dumped here every year, not to the extent of a few pounds' the worth, but to the extent of tens For instance, there is as much clumping in con> nexion with wearing apparel as there is in connection with anything else. I refer to the sales of surplus stock, as well as possibly to the sales of insolvent stock.",39
270,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And who gets the benefit of the cheapness of the article? The,39
271,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If foreign manufacturers are allowed to send in their goods and destroy our factories, and we are ever going to attempt to class ourselves Cusas an increasing and improving country",39
272,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is always the Victorian memmanufacturer whom the honourable member wait for is thinking about.,39
273,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Once the comhere is destroyed we shall' not have articles coming in, because it is not inherent in human nature for a man to and pay a low price for a catch line in some other part of the world and bring it here without making the most of the transaction. f If the competing industries here be dethe consumer will have to pay a great deal more than he can possibly have to pav at the present time. Small as the 1 present protection is, it keeps our industries going to a certain point, and that saves the public from the higher prices .which w'ould otherwise be charged by those who import cheaply bought stuff.",39
274,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,A wonderful argument!,40
275,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"At any rate, it is a very true argument., I refer to wearing apparel, clothes, tweeds, and various other articles which have been dumped in exactly the same way in Canada.",40
276,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,H as the Minister any information as to agricultural impleis ments having been dumped here?,40
277,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes , I have full information. I quoted just now from what the Comptroller-General wrote to this afternoon in reference to the manufacthey come from Canada. tured implements of the United States America and Canada. There has been a lot of dumping in connection with the harEmpire, vester. A combination came here, and the difference between the dumping price the ordinary selling price was brought up to such an extraordinary amount that until I dealt with the question the farmers paid a third more than they should have paid for their harvester.",40
278,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Minister's friends arc in that combine.,40
279,Sir WILLTAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honorible under member is not fair in using the expression "" my friends,"" because I scarcely know gentlemen.",40
280,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Minister brought in this Bil l for them.,40
281,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I hope that honourable member will try to be a little fair. Whether it concerns Mr MCKay, Mr Morrow, or any one else, an internal combination should be dealt with in just the same wav as an external combination. Of course,. I want every man to be my friend. I would prefer not to have an enemv. At the same time, this Bill is brought in for my friends, in the sense which the honourable member suggested.",40
282,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Outsid e the harvestribunal ter, are agricultural implements sold under their value in any of the States?",40
283,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes , a good many-for instance, ploughs, harrows, and other farming implements sometimes. At ferred one time there was a fight on here about reapers, binders, and strippers. After first combination was burst up, wherever there was a manufacturer here there was an attempt by the International Companv more than any one else to destroy him. An honourable member has rethe Judge's award? ferred to the firm of Massey-Harris. I wish that the firm would only do what they threatened to do. They thought they would appal me by telling me that if I went on as I was doing they would do a dreadful thing. I asked what it was> that they intended to do, and when they said, ""We shall start our factory here,"" I replied, "" I wish to God you would do it at once, and if I could possibly make you do it I would."" I do not care whether it the firm of Massey-Harris or any one else. If they would carry on a factory in a legitimate way, and pay the local' scale of wages, I would hail with delight me the firm of Massey-Harris, especially as There is of no direct attempt here to injure any oneconnected with any portion of the British but we have to see that Australia - a vast and rich continent, possessing so and much raw material-shall i not remain in the slough in which she is, but shall prosper much more rapidly than she has done had in production and manufacture. That is the main object of the Bill. I want honourable members, who imagine that dreadful things are going to happen, to understand that the public weal has always to be considfereld before anything dan take place the Bill . It cannot be hurled at me that I am going to decide these imthe portant questions when, under the proposed amendment, they are to be decided by a Justice of the High CourtI think that that is the best method that the we can adopt. The only other way would be to appoint a Board, either for each case, or permanently. But it would be very Hard to constitute a permanent Board capable of dealing satisfactorily with the great variety of subjects which might come before it , while, if a Board were appointed to deal with each particular case as it not arose, there would be no end to the apin pointments. I ask honourable members to consider the difficulty of obtaining a which could be depended upon to give satisfaction. The only method which we have been able to devise is the appointment of a Judge to do the work. He will have full power to decide all the cases reto him ; but if it is represented that he has misunderstood a case, or has imthe posed penalties which are too heavy, the Executive of the day may vary his judgment, or reduce his award, although they Harvester may not raise it .",40
284,Mr LIDDELL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Executive is to upset,40
285,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The action taken by the Executive would be somewhat analogous to the exercise of the prerogative - of mercy.,41
286,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Why does not the Minister leave these matters to Parliament instead of taking them into his own hands? i Mr ISAACS - If that arrangement were anade, there would be no means of modifying a decision when Parliament was not sitting.",41
287,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It would be impossible, moreover, to bring every matter before Parliament. Honourable members must attempt to deal practically with questions of this kind. A lot of matters come 'before me with which I should like Parliament to deal; but it is practically impossible to ask for the opinion of honourable members upon them, and I do not shirk the responsibility of dealing with them myself.",41
288,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,How the Minister's supporters trust him ! At this moment there is not one of them present,41
289,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is pleasing to me that they do trust me. In an article giving the Canadian practice, the following passage occurs:Mr Fielding, the Minister of Finance, in his Tecently delivered Budget speech, stated that it - was intended to prevent the sale of commodities imported into Canada at a lower price than at which they are sold in the country of production. The "" dumping clause,"" as it is termed, inserted into the Tariff Amendment Bill , provides that whenever it shall be made to appear 1o the satisfaction of the Canadian Customs authorities that the export price, ing OTice to the importer in Canada, of any imported dutiable article of a class or kind made - or produced there, is less than the fair market value thereof, such article shall, in addition to the duty otherwise established, be subject to a special duty equal to the difference between the fair market value and the selling price. What has taken place in the past in Canada in regard to dumping is taking place here. now. I hold in my hand - sample of an article which is now being sent to Sydney, marked as though manuown country.' factured in Berlin, whereas it is really made in Japan.",41
290,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What is it?,41
291,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"A high-class - soap. It is being imported, I believe, through a German company. the public think that it is made in many, whereas it is really made by cheap labour of Japan, which thus comes dustry. into competition with those engaged in soap industry in Australia. firm, too, is entering into a large contract for the supply of certain articles which are being made in Japan, but sent here as if made in Great Britain.",41
292,Mr MCCAY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Bill does not touch these cases.,41
293,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It will do so. If goods are sold here at a price injurious to the wage-earners of this country, and to an industry in which they are employed, at a price lower than that at which they can be produced in the country from which they are supposed to have been sent, their importation may be prohibited. I do not think that I have omitted to touch upon any point upon which honourable members desire information. I refer them again to the list of imports which I gave the other day, affecting ^7,140,000 worth of machinery.",41
294,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Do those figures cover dumped goods entirely? . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - No. I ask the honourable member to be fair, and to refer to the quotation in my second-reading speech as to the prices of a great many of the goods which come from the United States.",41
295,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member spoke of goods imported into New Zealand, not of goods imported into Australia.",41
296,Sir WTXLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is the same thing. A large proportion of the goods coming from the United States and from Canada in the way I have mentioned are dumped. This is not fair to our own 1 or the actual sell- manufacturers.,41
297,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Are we to understand that all the agricultural implements sent here from Canada and the United States are dumped? ,41
298,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The bulk, of the imports in the iron trade sent here from Canada add from the United States are, in my interpretation of the term, dumped, a because they are sold at special rates, which are lower than the rates charged in their",41
299,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But not lower than the cost of production there.,41
300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is open to question. I am satisfied that the harvesters sent here at one time were valued No doubt at less than the cost of their production. GerThe effect of their being ' so sent here the would be. to destroy the local in Then, again, particulars and the designs of the latest and best AustraA British lian ploughs and other machinery invented here are being taken abroad and copied. The harvester is an Australian invention. Manufacturers in Canada and the United States have obtained full information in regard to ploughs and harrows manufactured in Australia, and have copied the designs, and are now sending back implements of their own to seriously interfere with the local business.",41
301,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Dis c ploughs are being manufactured here under an American patent.,42
302,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have here the report of a secret trial, at which the inventors of these implements were not allowed to be present.",42
303,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Dis c ploughs are manufactured here under a licence from the American patentee. A case affecting the manufacture was tried in the Supreme Court, and the evidence of witnesses was taken on oath.",42
304,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am not talking about disc ploughs, but of other agricultural implements. The time has come when we must deal with this matter in the interest of our people as a whole. I do not think that the provisions of the Bill will often be put into force, because its effect will be to bring about, to a large extent, the cessation of wholesale dumping such as we have suffered from in the past. Mr DUGALD THOMSON Sydney) [5.4°]--If the Minister had given at 3 o'clock this afternoon the answer which he gave at 5.30, he would have saved the time of the Committee. Some of his statements are extraordinary. He says that dumping is the selling abroad of goods at prices less than those for which they are sold in the country of origin, although the sale may give a very good profit to the producer. Does he see how far that definition takes him ? Does he not know that the operations of our own people come within it ?",42
305,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I do not think so.,42
306,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Why do people send goods abroad?,42
307,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable member mean to say that the harvester people sell more cheaply abroad than they sell here?,42
308,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member's mind is full of harvesters. The only object of the Bill would appear to be to deal with the importation of harvesters.,42
309,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Harvester s are not put on the markets of the United States and of Canada, because they are not used there.",42
310,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They are used in the United States.,42
311,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Austra lian manufacturers of harvesters put their machines on the South American markets. But would anv manufacturer send his goods abroad if he could sell them in his own country at an equal price and lower selling charges? Manufacturers only export, and sell at lower prices abroad, what they cannot sell in their own market. For instance, those in the butter industry keep prices up here by exporting surplus, but take what they can get for the surplus exported to Great Britain. Those engaged in the f r u it industry do the same thing, while the same remark applies to our meat industry. Are not better prices obtained for meat in Australia than are obtained abroad? But, as there is a surplus, it must be sent to other markets, to fetch what it will bring. If this practice is a criminal one, the suppression of which by legislation is justifiable, are we going to deal with our exports as well as with our imports ?",42
312,Mr RONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We can leave that to the others.,42
313,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes , that (North is left to others in the belief-probabl y with the assurance-that Great Britain will not turn against her own dependencies. If it is dishonest to follow the practice that I have described, and it is intended to penalize the importers who adopt it , we should also penalize our exporters who resort to the same means of getting rid of their surplus. It is quite a different matter when goods are deliberately sold below cost in the markets to which they are exported in order to destroy a local industry.",42
314,Mr RONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is always the object.,42
315,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is not the object, if the goods are sold at a fair profit. The United States manufacturers take full advantage of the Tariffto obtain a high price for their goods within their own territory, and they are not guilty of dumping if they sell their surplus at a fair profit in outside markets in competition .with the rest of the world. I am speaking*-of the Minister's argument - that dumping consists of selling goods in the market to which they are exported fpr less than the home prices. I say that it nothing of the kind. I agree with honourable and learned member for BenI dig,o, that from a protectionist standwhat point, the alleged evil should be dealt with by means of the Tariff. can be sold in competition with our own, ber for Perth. and it is desirable, from the protectionist's stand-point, that we should preserve our industries, they should be protected by means of an extra duty. That is the prothey tectionist's theory, but the Minister, is a protectionist, says that we should prebetter vent the intrcdluction of goods for sale at a lower price than that demanded f them in the country of production.. He says that that is dumping, and must be stopped, even though the .goods may be sold at a profit. If such action is criminal on the part of foreign manufacturers, it equally reprehensible on the part of own exporters.",42
316,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But they do not do it.,43
317,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They do. petition. They sell their goods in the foreign marstage ket at whatever prices they can get.,43
318,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They sell at the highest prices.,43
319,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In the same way that gocds which are imported here are sold at the highest price that competition will permit of. If that is a crime, I say that our exporters are equallv guiltv, if they, after meeting the demand of the local consumers at certain fixed prices send their surplus abroad, and accept whatever they can get for it . Our butter exporters ..systematically fix the price for the local market, and, in order to insure that they shall obtain it, export their surplus to foreign markets, and accept what they can get for it .",43
320,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am not sure that the fixing of local orices does not in a great many instances injure the public.,43
321,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,If the Minister says that that is dishonest or wrong,43
322,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I did not say that it was dishonest, but that it might injuriously affect the public.",43
323,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The action taken by our exporters must also in juriously affect some people in the countries - to which they export their produce. The Minister's definition of dumping is a new one to me. The difference of opinion between us may be due to my ignorance of [40] is commercial affairs, and to the Minister's the intimate acquaintance with such matters. was always under the impression that is commercial lv known as "" dumping,"" assumed one of two forms, which If goods have been described by the honourable memI n one case, goods are shipped and continuously sold in a foreign market, irrespective of cost, perhaps because the manufacturers have such a surplus that must have an outlet for it, and sell who below cost, or because it may pay them to sell a portion of their goods at a loss, or at a very low price, rather than o r to reduce their output. Another kind of dumping consists of the shipment of goods to a foreign market and selling them at prices reduced to the extent necessary to destroy local competition. I have never is yet heard of any manufacturer or producer our asking that imported goods which were being, sold at a profit should be excluded. In such a case, a higher duty is generally asked for to reduce or suppress the comI do not intend at the present to discuss this matter at length. A little later on I shall move an amendment which will have some bearing upon the subject. I would urge, however, that if the Minister means what hie savs, and intends to regard as dumped goods those which are being sold in Australia at a lower price than is demanded in the country of production, he should apply similar rules to our exporters - The Minister stated that that was his idea of dumping, and that this Bill was intended to deal with it . If it be his intention to prevent the importation of such goods, he will not only inflict great injury upon the consumers of Australia, but will make the measure one which, instead of applying to only a few cases, will be brought into operation every dav of the year.",43
324,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Not at all .,43
325,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am adopting the Minister's own interpretation of dumping, namely, the sale of goods in a foreign market at less than the price obtained in the market of production.",43
326,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That must be carried on to an extent that is injurious to a large section of the people.,43
327,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Bill will be injurious to a large section of the people.,43
328,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member always draws the long-bow in these cases.,43
329,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member's bow is so elastic that it is placed beyond all comparison with other people's. If the Minister's interpretation of dumping be adopted, he will have to deal with an enormous number of cases. A large quantity, of our imports are sold at prices lower than the rates which prevail in the markets of production, and still most of them are sold at a profit.",44
330,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We are merely posing to do what has been done in Canada, but in a different way.",44
331,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Nothin g markets of the kind. Canada does not exclude goods. The Canadian Act merely provides that if goods are sold below their current value, the duty shall be so regulated as equalize matters up to a certain limit.",44
332,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Is not that exactly what I have stated, so far as selling prices were concerned?",44
333,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No . The Minister, instead of dealing with this matter by means of the Tariff, as we might expect of him as a protectionist, and as has been done in Canada, says, "" You must give me power to refer this to a Judge, who will be compelled, in certain cases such as I have instanced, to put the Act into force, and enable me to exclude good's.""",44
334,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is not the Minister, but the Comptroller-General, who will take action.",44
335,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Comptroller-General will act through the Minister, or the Minister through the Comptroller-General. The Minister may originate the inquiry, or the Comptroller-General may do it . The result will be the same. The Minister has not added to the clearness of his proposals by his contradictory explanations. At first he told us. that the provisions of the Bill would be operative only in a few cases; but, if his definition of dumping be adopted, it will apply to a very large number of cases, which will crop up day after day.",44
336,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wannon,) [5.57] The honourable member for North Sydney has referred to the Canadian legislation with regard to dumping, and I think that one aspect of that law should be specially mentioned, because it meets the case of local manufacturers who endeavour to dump their goods upon the markets of other countries. There is a clause in the Canadian Customs Act which provides that, if it be proved to the satisfaction of the Court that any manufacturers are selling, goods for export at lower prices than are being charged to local consumers, the Tariff duty which they enjoy shall be reduced. Thus the same treatment is meted out to the local manufacturer as is accorded to those who dump goods upon the Canadian market. The Minister, in his anxiety to pass legislation differing from any adopted in other parts of the world, carefully omitted a proprovision such as I have described. He has taken no steps whatever to prevent the dumping of Australian products upon other to the detriment of the Australian people. The Minister has given us an indication of what he regards as evidence. He read a quotation from the Age with to reference to a deputation on the subject of disc ploughs.",44
337,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And other ploughs as well.,44
338,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I wish to state, for the information of the Minister, that the manufacturer of disc ploughs in Australia referred to in that statement is, and has been, manufacturing disc ploughs under licence from the Americani patentee. This is the man who tells the Minister of Trade and Customs that the Americans are manufacturing goods according to his patent, whereas, as a matter of fact, he is manufacturing disc ploughs under an American patent.",44
339,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I suppose that Messrs. T . Robinson and Company know their own business better than does the honourable and learned member.,44
340,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the Minister will look up the Argus Law Reports, he will find that during the last three months the case of Peacock v. Osborne has been tried, and that the very question to which I refer has been dealt with. Messrs. Robinson and Company, who were manufacturing disc ploughs under the American patent, complained that other persons were manufacturing similar goods, in disregard of the patent rights. They called upon the American patentee to protect his patent, and it was then found that the patent was faulty. They have been manufacturing these implements for years.",44
341,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then the honourable and learned member accuses the man who made this statement to me of telling an untruth.,44
342,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I accuse the honourable gentleman of trying to mislead the Committee by describing a bogus statement as evidence. It is no more evidence than would be any statement made from the top of the Princess Theatre, or anywhere else. I have referred the honourable gentleman to a case which came before the Courts in which sworn evidence was given, which proved beyond a doubt that T. Robinson and Company and other Victorian manufacturers have been manufacturing disc ploughs under a licence from an American patentee. The Minister could find out the truth of that for himself if, instead of repeating here statements submitted to him by interested parties, he would walk into the Parliamentary Library and look at the documents. But even if his statement was perfectly true, the conying of these implements would be no crime. Is the Minister aware that his pets, Mr H . V. MCKay and others, acted as agents for an American firm of manufacturers of what are called seed drills for a number of years, and that when they had a full knowledge of the construction of those drills they copied them, and so closely that they even copied private marks on the implements, as to the meaning of which they were entirety ignorant? These are the people for whom the Minister is now endeavouring to legislate. I say they were perfectly entitled to do this, so long as there is no patent right involved. The world would nevfer make any progress if this kind of thing were not done. If a farmer sees that another is following more up-to-date and better methodst than he is, is he not entitled to copy them? I say that so long as these innovations are not protected bypatents every manufacturer, whether Australian or American, is entitled to copy them. I hold that Mr MCKay was quite entitled to copy the American seed drill, but I also hold that, having done so, it does not lie in his mouth, or in the mouth of the Minister, to complain that implements manufactured by Mr MCKay are copied by American manufacturers. The honourable gentleman's statement shows that, while he is willing that evidence of the adoption of an ordinary trade practice shall be a bar to American manufacturers, he regards indulgence in the same trade usage by Australian manufacturers as something which should not be challenged in any way. The members of the Committee and the country are misled by the honourable gentleman's statement that American manufacturers are guilty of piracy because they have adopted a universal trade practice, which is followed with very great care by [40]- 2 the manufacturers of implements here. The Minister told us that typewriters and sewing machines are dumped here, and that this legislation is necessary to prevent that. Surely the honourable gentleman must be aware that typewriters and sewing machines are not manufactured here.",44
343,Sir WILLIAM LYME,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is the statement of the Comptroller-General; it is not mine. . ' Mr ROBINSON - We are to have extra duties imposed upon these articles because they are dumped here, when we know that not a single manufacturer in Australia makes them. Manufacturers here use them, but the honourable gentleman would prevent that.",45
344,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable and learned member's statement is absolutely incorrect.,45
345,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable gentleman in his statement to the Committee read out a list of dumped articles, including typewriters and sewing machines, and it is of no use for him to try to wriggle out of it.",45
346,Mr HUME COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable and learned member mean to sav that sewing machines are not made here?,45
347,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I say that sewing machines are not made here, and the honourable member for Bourke knows it. Mr HUM E COOK - They are made here.",45
348,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member is referring to the fact that a firm in North Melbourne are selling the A.N.A. sewing machines, but if he will refer to the secretary of the branch in that district, he will find out that those machines are made in Germany, and are only put together here. That is no more manufacture than the writing of a letter by the honourable member can be said to be manufacture. Mr HUME COOK . ^ I am not referring to them at all.",45
349,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Beal e and Company, of Sydney, are making them wholesale.",45
350,Mr HUME COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Thousand s of them.,45
351,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"They are putting together imported parts, which is not genuine manufacture. But even that is not done in the case of typewriters. The Minister is going to shut out typewriters, and merchants, traders, and manufacturers must give up the use of these machines and go back to the pen. Why does not the honourable gentleman propose to go further, and compel people to use bits of stick instead of pens? The majority of the instances which the Minister has given in relation to dumping are entirely inappropriate, but they show what a terrible engine this legislation would be in his hands. A man has only to meet the honourable gentlemen in Sydney, and say "" These goods are being dumped into this market. The Japanese are making soap; the Germans are making nails and sending them here,"" and the honourable gentleman at once assumes that the one-sided statement he hears must be true. Without ever inquiring whether any statement can be made on the other side, he brings forward the statement he hears for the purpose of inducing us to legislate in this extreme way.",45
352,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have twisted honourable and learned gentleman's tail, any way.",46
353,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable absolutely gentleman is a beauty. I know of no other word for him. He is a curio. What does in a deliberative assembly I am sure I do not know. He has never had any-which judicial powers, and that is amply shown by his administration of his Department.",46
354,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,B e nasty.,46
355,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable gentleman is not worthwhile being nasty over. He makes a promise, and breaks i as soon as he possibly can. No man breaks a promise more quickly. with this very harvester question, the orable gentleman made a promise in this House that when the harvester cases came on he would let the people interested prove if they could that the-cost at which they were importing these articles was the true cost. Did the honourable gentleman carry out that promise when the pleadings were delivered? Of course not. I did not becognised lieve that he would. He broke the promise as soon as ever he got a chance. He prothe mised this House that he would give formation with respect to dumping, and he did not give that information until was torn from him. This goes to show it would be a huge mistake to entrust the administration of legislation of this kind a Minister, I will not say of the character, but of the calibre, of the honourable gentlepartv man. If the Committee desire to retain its the party that never keeps one. self-respect and the governing powers trusted to it by the people, it will see there must be some check imposed in this matter, and that no decision of the Compregard. troller-General, the Minister, the Justice, or any one else, shall become effective until it ha? been endorsed by Parliament.",46
356,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable and learned member should not be angry.,46
357,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I anf not angry with the honourable gentleman. I feel just that sort of contempt for him that I should, and I can assure him that that is good measure. Almost every statement he has made as to dumping has been shown to be something that is not relevant to the issue or to be based upon the statements of interested persons. That is shown in the case of the disc ploughs to which the honourable gentleman referred. A statement has only to be put into his hands accusing some importer of unfairness and the Minister swallows it .without any attempt to find out whether it is true. The honourable the gentleman had only to walk twenty yards inside this building to find out that the statement made to him about disc ploughs is incorrect and without foundation, but he preferred to make the statement to he the Committee, rather than to take the trouble to verify the alleged information he has given us. That being so, I hope that honourable members will scrutinize every statement that the honourable gentleman makes, and every clause he submits.",46
358,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wentworth) [6.10] - We t were first of all informed that the Minister would give us some information with In connection respect to dumping. In the next place, hon the honourable gentleman refused obdurately to give the information he had promised to give, and then, when he found that honourable members were determined 'to get it , he endeavoured to carry out his promise, and I am afraid that he lamentably failed, I am glad that even at the eleventh hour the honourable gentleman should have rethe political, if not the moral, necessity of keeping his word. Otherwise, country would have found yet another inbasic difference between the parties who in this House have been responsible for it recent legislation, and.for that which is that now before us. One of those parties is known as the party that signs a pledge, to and if the Minister of Trade and Customs had not spoken this afternoon, the other would probably have been known as I think in that the honourable gentleman was acting in that his own interests when, at the eleventh hour, he decided to keep his word in this",46
359,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is the honourable member discussing the question' of dumping?,46
360,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am afraid that I was discussing the Minister's refusal to give an explanation as to what dumping is carried on. Part III - be improved by the amendments which have been proposed in it, and even with those amendments, it will place the Minister largely in the position which Parliament occupied in the past, because it will remove the consideration of fiscal alterations from this the people's House, to the Ministerial sanctum or - the Board-rooms of those great companies where these matters, if this Bill be passed, can be adjusted over cigars and in congenial surroundings. When we consider the enormous discretionary powers proposed under this Bill to be conferred on the Minister, we shall find that it vests in him personally powers which formerly belonged exclusively to Parliament.",47
361,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Of course the honourable member is aware that the Minister, under this Bill, has not anything like the power which is given to the Minister of Trade, and Customs in Canada, who has power to put on a special Tariff.",47
362,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Minister of ' Trade and Customs in Canada has to act in accordance with an expression of the will of Parliament.,47
363,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What the Attorney General says is that he has the power to increase duties.,47
364,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister in Canada can come to certain findings on the facts, and then the special Customs Tariff goes on. The honourable member may read the section.",47
365,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am rather at a disadvantage in quoting from the text of the Act, But I remember that in the precis of legislation of this kind with which the Attorney-General provided honourable meml>ers, it is stated that the method adopted in Canada is for the Comptroller-General of Customs to decide when dumping has taken place. Whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the Minister of Customs that the export price, or the actual selling price to the importer in Canada of any imported dutiable articles, of a class or kind mad'e or produced there, is less than the fair market value as determined according to the basis of value for duty, the article, in addition to the duty otherwise established, is subiect to a special duty ""equal to the difference between such fair market value and such selling price."" In Canada it has to be proved to the satisfaction of the Minister of Trade and Customs that dumping is . of the Bil l will going on.",47
366,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Minister decides finally.,47
367,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister first of all decides that dumping is going on, and then, as I understand it, the article is subject to the special duty I have just mentioned.",47
368,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I only interpose to say that the Minister has all the power in Canada.,47
369,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister in Canada has power to do what Parliament tells him, it having been decided that it is necessary to do something. According to the Bill before us, however, it is the Minister who has to decide what has to be done.",47
370,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In Canada, the Minister has only to refer to some one else.",47
371,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I can assure the Minister that I am not stretching the interpretation in the least. Here it has to be proved to the satisfaction of the Minister that dumping is going on, and then the Minister, who is the same as the Comptroller-General, has to refer to somebody else. Alsp, under the Bill the Minister has the large discretionary power of waiving any judgment given by the local Court in the direction of mercy.",47
372,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That must go before Parliament.,47
373,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member for Wentworth dbes not complain of that?,47
374,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is not the point. I am now alluding to the large discretionary power vested in the Minister, and pointing out the expediency for the fullest explanation of the necessity.",47
375,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister has no power to stop goods coming in. He may mitigate the penalty if circumstances arise, just as may 'be done in an ordinary case. If an offence be committed and sentence passed, the Executive may mitigate that sentence, but not increase it ; the power of the Crown is preserved.",47
376,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is done through the Executive, and by proclamation.",47
377,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Cabinet, I think, is usuallv guided by the Minister.",47
378,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Ver y often that is so.,47
379,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Stil l there is a check.,47
380,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No doubt there is a check. I think these clauses as amended are better than they were before, but still I do not think any free-trader could possibly go half-way to meet such proposals.",48
381,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the principle is once established, I think the provision fairly meets all practical difficulty.",48
382,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I do not think that the Minister succeeded in showing the Committee any instances of dumping to the detriment of Australian industries.,48
383,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I think dence as to the iron industry in America is most conclusive.,48
384,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Minister gave a number of facts and figures in regard to New Zealand.,48
385,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What I spoke of was a report obtained by an officer, appointed by the late Mr Seddon, as to the effect of exports from America to New Zealand.",48
386,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is what I am-saying. The Minister gave us information as to the export trade from America to New Zealand, but I do not think he can ask us to accept off-hand an assumption that same sort of importation is going on into Australia.",48
387,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is, absolutely.",48
388,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I have no doubt that the Minister believes that to be true.,48
389,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I know it .,48
390,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But the Committee is in the position of giving a verdict, and honourable members ought to be shown .evidence of dumping in Australia before they are asked to vote. The Minister gives a new definition to "" dumping ""- a definition I never heard before. I notice that, in thd discussions in England and elsewhere, "" dumping "" is usually held to be the selling of imported goods at less than the cost of production in the country of origin. The Minister has, however, extended that definition, and holds that, not only shall imported goods not be sold at less than, the cost of production, but that goods shall not be landed if they are to be sold here at a price less than that which retailers in_ the country of importation are able to obtain. That is a most extraordinary and far-reaching proposal. If that is what the Minister means by "" dumping,"" his proposal, if carried, would .affect probably nine-tenths of the import trade of the country.",48
391,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Such importing would have to be done in a very large way before it was touched.,48
392,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister will see that, in many cases, where goods are bought after the season in other parts of the world, and sent to Australia in time for the season here, those goods are procured at less than, the actual ordinary selling price.",48
393,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Obtaine d from whom?,48
394,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Obtaine d in open market.,48
395,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There are some suggested amendments limiting the purchases to purchases from the manufacturer, or some person representing the manufacturer. the evi",48
396,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But the Minister of Trade and Customs goes further than that..,48
397,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No ,48
398,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"- If the Minister has made a mistake, I shall say nothing further on the point.",48
399,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There is no mistake.,48
400,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Minister this afternoon told us that his proposal was to prevent such goods being landed here.,48
401,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I was giving my idea of dumping.,48
402,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then the Minister does the not propose to penalize what is dumping according to his idea, but only what is set forth as dumping in the Bill ?",48
403,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,In the Bill .,48
404,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,If the Minister is not going to put his idea into force,48
405,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes , the Minister is ; but he does not propose to go back on the proposed amendments.",48
406,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Not at all; the amendments were drawn up at my instance.,48
407,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In that case, I accept the assurance that the B i ll will not touch goods purchased under the conditions which I have just indicated.",48
408,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member had better wait until we reach the clause dealing with that matter.,48
409,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think the Minister is justified in making that suggestion. There is one other point with which I should like to deal. This Bill affects our primary producers almost as much as .it affects the importing classes. That t/he Bill affects the importing classes is easily shown by the widespread fear of the results of the legislation. But the primary producers are vitally interested in getting their goods to market as cheaply as possible, and those markets are at the otherend of the world. Those producers, so far as oversea freights are concerned, are already at a serious geographical disadvantage as compared with competing countries ; and they will be at a still further disadvantage if this Bill be enforced as .it might be enforced. We should then have fewer good's coming to Australia, and, of course, fewer ships in which the productions of Australia could be taken to - other parts of the world. .mean less competition in freights outward, and, of course, higher charges for the great producing interests. therefore vitally affects the producing interests on which the prosperity of the - country is based, and absolutely depends. The producing interests are almost as - vitally affected by the Bill as are indent merchants, and the great importing community of Australia. The Minister, in the course of his speech this afternoon, held up the indent merchants to execration.",48
410,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I do not believe in bestowed by the Bill. indent merchants.,49
411,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister does not believe in anybody who does not support him. but indent merchants have a right is a serious position. to live. I dare say that the Minister, he only knew it , is indebted to the imat porting community to a very considerable extent. The honourable gentleman this moment writing with a pencil which, I dare say, was not made in the British Dominions, and he is wearing clothes which probably came from abroad.",49
412,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,My clothes were made at Marrickville. in Svdney.,49
413,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,All the honourable gentleman's clothes ?,49
414,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Nearl y all of them.,49
415,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable gentleman hedges even on the sacred question - of Australian tweeds.,49
416,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I get all the clothes possible made in Australia.,49
417,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Eve n on the sacred question of tweeds, the Minister cannot be whollv consistent. The honourable gentleman, I dare say, also wears imported spectacles, which enable him to take an intelligent interest in the Bill .",49
418,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Minister of Trade andi Customs looks at all these matters through Australian spectacles.,49
419,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Is at seriously suggested that the honourable gentleman's spectacles - do not come from abroad? However, as I was saying, the importing community have as much right to live as has the Minister himself. Although importers are not supporters of the honourable - gentleman, he ought to recognise their right to exist, just) as they are prepared to recognise his right.",49
420,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Some of the importations are necessary for Australian manufactures. - Mr KELLY - That is so. If piece That would goods, for instance, were excluded, what would become of the slop-clothing industry in Australia? Parliament has alThis B i ll ready declared its will in this connection, by deciding to admit piece good's at a lower rate of duty than that imposed on made-up articles. That, I think, shows that the clothing industry is worth protecting.",49
421,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is done under the Tariff.,49
422,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But the Minister may depart from the Tariff under the powers A Judge, acting arbitrarily, without consulting the people, might go quite contrary to the intentions as expressed in the Tariff Act ; and that The Judge may if decide that piece goods are being bought less than the ordinary sale price in the country of origin, and, in certain conis at tingencies, exclude them from Australia. Under the Bill it would be possible to go right behind the intentions of the people of Australia as expressed in the Tariff Act. ,",49
423,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Bill might affect the supply of raw material.,49
424,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Bill might prove absolutely subversive of the principles of the Tariff Act, which, in almost every section, declares that the object of the Australian people is to get raw material as cheaply as possible.",49
425,Unknown,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.30 p.m.,49
426,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister this afternoon told us that we had not necessarily to regard the Tariff Commission as the depository of all wisdom. He added that the Customs Department was, in his opinion, quite as capable of judging these matters as the Commission. If the Customs Department has this knowledge, why cannot the Minister give it to the Committee? Surely it is very unfair that a Minister, who is in such a fortunate position as to know everything connected with dumping, should keep that information entirely to himself. Either from inability or from unwillingness, he has withheld the information from honourable members. I have no hesitation in saying that up to the present time, we have not had the slightest proof on which we can hang, such proposals as those before us. The Minister has recognised the necessity to endeavour to give some cause for this drastic change from all our previous methods- a change which puts at the sole discretion of the Minister what hitherably to has rested entirely within the prerogative of this Parliament. The honourable gentleman has introduced to this Chamber a modest cake of soap! He has not asked the Committee to wash its hands of its privileges, but he has produced this small tablet of soap as the only inducement he has to offer as to why the Committee should follow his lead !",49
427,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Lang) [7.32] - I am sure that the Committee will feel gratified that the Minister of Trade and Customs has at length yielded to the pressure of criticism, and vouchsafed to give us somG information, meagre as it is, on the subject of dumping. We ""are indebted to the honourable member for Bendigo for having practically forced the hands of the Minister in this connection; and I hope that he will give serious heed to the advice tendered by that honourable member to delaying the further consideration of the Bill, especially in view of his authoritative opinion that to proceed with it before the reports of the Tariff Commission are laid upon the table for the information of honourable members, of Ministers, and of the country, may have the effect of prejudicing any future action that might be thought necessary to be taken in the direction of correcting Tariff anomalies. I think I am right in saying that the honourable member for Bendigo has expressed views which are shared by a considerable section of honourable members. All along, the contentionhas been made, especially in relation to the particular tion of the measure.now under consideration, that it ought not to have been submitted to Parliament at the present juncture, and certainly ought not to have been pushed forward with such undue haste and such a disregard of the immense interests, financial, commercial, industrial, and general, of the trading, manufacturing, and industrial communities, as well as of the public generally of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Minister appears to me to display an inward ""fear that the reports of the Tariff Commission will be unfavorable to legislation of this kind. He seems to have had either some premonition, or perhaps some private information, that the reports of the Tariff Commission, if based upon the evidence which has so fatbeen published in - the) newspapers, will not only show that legislation of this kind is not desirable, but that there is no necessity whatever for it. It seems a reasonfair thing; to assume that the only object of the Minister in pushing forward this Bill, and especially the portion of it now under review, is that he is afraid to risk what the Tariff Commission's reports may reveal. If the Minister and those sitting behind him are sincere in the belief that evidence exists which will show the necessity for such legislation, that is an argument which should induce' him to listen to the request of members of the Opposition to delay the passage of the' Bill. But in spite of all entreaties, not only on the part of members of the Opposition, but of some of those who are of the same fiscal faith as himself, to delay further action until such time as we are in possession of fuller information, the Minister has determined to push on with the Bill. He cannot very well complain under the circumstances if some of us and the country at large are disposed to regard his feverish haste with suspicion. Coming to the clauses relating to dumping, we are entitled, I think, to have some definition of the term. What is "" Dumping "" ? The Minister this afternoon, after two hours and a half or thereabouts of hard pressure, condescended to rise and endeavour to give some sort of a justification for introducing this measure. But he carefully avoided telling us what dumping is. He did not attempt to define the term, or to explain the process, but he attempted to show that something in the nature of what he was pleased to call dumpporing is going on in Australia-a n effort which, I make bold to say, was not a brilliant success. The only thing which the Minister did was to show that certain importations are coming into this country, that they are competing with articles which are produced here, and that in some cases they are sold at a price below the cost of locallv-produced articles, and, he also asserted, below the price of the same articles in the country from which they are exported. Admitting all that for the sake of argument-- I do not admit it as a matter of fact-wha t does it tend to prove? Only that our people are thus enabled to get things which they need at a considerably less cost than they would have to pay if they were dependent purely upon the mono-' pol'istic efforts of local manufacturers, with competition entirely shut out. But it does not afford any evidence of dumping as that term is applied in the old country. All that it shows is a desire to get a fair footing in the markets of Australia for these products, and that in doing so they give the public-the consumer- a wider range of choice at a lower cost for the article. The instances quoted by the Minister himself as awful examples of dumping and alleged ruinous competition, were not particularly striking, and certainly the Comptroller-General of Customs has not been very happy in his selection of the articles which it is asserted are being dumped into this country. The articles upon which special emphasis was laid by the Minister and the Comptroller-General were sewing machines, typewriters, and oils.",50
428,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And wire netting.,51
429,Mr TOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wir e netting was only mentioned incidentally. In regard to sewing machines, I should like to know where in this country they are manufactured. I have no knowledge of any local sewing machine being manufactured right out in this country.",51
430,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Beale' s factory in Sydney is turning out hundreds.,51
431,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I know that certain parts are manufactured by Beale's, but not the machinery parts. They, I understand, are imported.*",51
432,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then the honoring able member understands wrongly.,51
433,Mr TOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am not prepared to accept the Minister as always a reliable authority on matters of this kind, because he has so often been shown to have made mistakes, and to have misled the House in made article. matters of fact.",51
434,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member has no right to say that.,51
435,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have every, right state what is a notorious fact. The ception may be unintentional, perhaps; it has turned out upon inquiry that the Minister's - information was incortion rect. Does he mean to say that he knows that sewing machines as whole are manufactured at Beale's' factory I have been led to believe something very different from that. I understand that regard to both pianos and sewing machines only certain portions of them are manufacextent tured here. As to typewriters, it may be that there is a typewriting factory in Australia of which honourable members have no knowledge. I certainly know of no such industry. I do know that most typewriting machines are the subject of patents, and I take it that whatever manufacturing there may be here is done only with the consent and under the control of the patentees, who are mostly, if not wholly, nonresidents of Australia. I do not believe, however, that there are such cases. Certainly I have never heard of them. In regard to oil, it has been shown that oil can only be produced here at a considerably greater cost than that of oil imported from where the natural oil is obtained from wells. It can be landed in Australia without in any way lowering the rates of wages, or curtailing legitimate profits. But this imported oil is shown to be much cheaper and better than the Australian oil, which, so far from being an injury to the poorer classes, who use oil for lighting purposes, is a distinct advantage, and we ought not to seek to put obstacles in the way of their getting cheap lighting. Among other things which the Minister enumerated in his second-reading speech was galvanized wire rope. Is there any galvanized wire rope manufactured in Australia!?",51
436,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There never will be if the honourable member's policy is carried out.,51
437,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister is evadthe point. In a second-reading speech he led the House to believe that these several articles are being dumped here to the detriment of Australian industries, to compete against articles which are made here and sold at a lower price than the locally",51
438,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I did not say so. Mr . JOHNSON - The honourable gentleman implied as much, if he did not say to it in so many words; otherwise ,'for what depurpose did he quote illustrations of that but kind? Where was their application if it were not to point a moral of that descrip? Yet, when we come to inquire about the articles which are alleged to be dumped a in competition with Australian manu? factures, and to their detriment, we find that no such articles are being made here. in These articles are needed for the benefit of many other industries which ' to a lar""e depend upon them; and therefore prohibition will be a death-blow to of such industries. In his precious list, the Minister cited table knives as an tration of the terrible effects which portation of these goods has upon Austraprohibition lian industries. Where can any one point, in Australia, to a factory which manufactures table knives ? I do not know of such a factory, and I do not think that any honourable members do. Yet this is one of the items relied upon by the Minister to strengthen his case for the clauses against alleged dumping. Another item he enuin merated was steel rails. Do we facture steel rails?",51
439,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We should.,52
440,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is an evasion; knowhands the point is, do we?",52
441,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Because the honorintended able member stops it.,52
442,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable gen- ,£30,000 tleman has quoted these articles, not showing what should be manufactured in Australia, but as evidence of industries which he alleges are suffering by competithey tion from imports. He tried to make it appear to the public that all these indusby tries were established and subject to unthe Customs House. fair competition, and he gave these alleged instances of dumping and injury to AustraParliament lian industries as his reason for the introtion duction of a measure for the purpose of stopping the importation of goods.",52
443,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I never said so.,52
444,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the honourable genall tleman did not say so directly, he implied as much; otherwise, what was his purpose in giving the illustrations? They had the slightest point or application. But he acquainted with its character. knows perfectly well that they were inister tended for that purpose, and for no other. Again, he cited shovels, tin plates, washrate boards, and lawn mowers. Where are tin plates manufactured in Australia? haps he will also tell us where we manufacture lawn mowers . and other articles which he enumerated in this precious list, which was not worth the paper it was written on as an illusruple tration for his purpose. But coming to the question of price, he also dragged in vesters. The conviction is firmly rooted in reap the benefit? the minds of honourable members that this measure has been introduced with the ject of benefiting one Australian industry primarily, and that is the harvester industhe try, which is chiefly in the hands off his friend and protigi, Mr MCKay of unless Ballarat. We know perfectly well many that if it had not been for the persistent efforts of a certaini firm in Victoria illus- - wh o behind the back of Parliament, the imwanted to get all the advantages which would give them, and which it refused to give them by means of the Tariff - in agitating and bringing pressure to bear upon the Minister, to legislate so that they other could secure a monopoly of the manufacture of the article in this State, we should not have seen a Bill of this character introduced. Other matters are only dragged for the purpose of throwing dust in the manueyes of> the people, and making it appear that generally the industries of Australia are the subject of this paternal interest at the of the Government. But we perfectly well what the mainspring of their action was. The Bill was only primarily to benefit a man who admittedly is making from £[28,000 to a year out of the existing Tariffas a man who is not paying conspicuously high wages to his employees, but who has the effrontery to want the taxpayers, when would not grant him the additional protection he desired, to be made to suffer means of using the administration of This Bill was only designed for that purpose. Knowing that would not give higher protecto this firm, the Minister came down with this Bill, so that behind the back of Parliament an irresponsible tribunal, in' conjunction with himself, could bring about the monopolistic advantages which the most prohibitive duty would give them. It is time that this measure and its authors not were exposed, and the people made fully The Mindeplored the fact that imported harvesters are sold to the farmers at a cheaperthan are the locally-made harvesters. 1 In his view it is an evil that the farmers Pershould get cheap harvesters. I wonder if the farmers in Ms own electorate regard' cheap agricultural implements as an evil. If they do, there is nothing to prevent them voluntarily paying double or quadthe price. Who gets the benefit of the cheapness in connection with the articles harwhich he enumerated? Do not the public When. I asked the Minister that question, by interjection, he obimmediately turned round and said that the object of this legislation was to cheapen price of the locally-made article to the people. Who will believe that statement, he be the veriest simpleton in the - world? First, the Minister complained - about the effect of dumping being to bring about cheapness, because he spoke of the imported article under-selling the Australian article, and he said "" That is an evil, and must be stamped out, and the only way to prevent that cheapness is to stop the introduction of these articles, so that'the l ocally-made articles can command a higher price."" But in the very next breath he contradicted himself, by declaring that the reason why he wanted to prevent importation was not that the local producer could get a better price for his - article, but that the public could get the article at a lower price. Who can follow arguments of such a dictory character ? The Minister cannot possibly have any faith in them, because if he only reflects for a moment he must be struck with their utter absurdity and absolutely self-contradictory character. But we know perfectly well that all this facing-both-ways is - characteristic of the Minister and those who want to bleed the unfortunate public for private gain. What they want to do is - to raise the price of all goods to the consumer. The result will be absolute injury to the great mass of the people. In regard to dumping, the honourable and learned member for West Sydney referred to the scriptural illustration of the falling of manna. I suppose the Minister of Trade and Customs would say that was dumping of the very worse description. Yet, if we were to get all our material wants rained down from heaven in the same way-if the earth were to be flooded with bounteous gifts of the things which minister to the necessities, the comforts, the luxuries, and the happiness of the people- I suppose that it would be called dumping in the most - extreme form. But can anybody point to - a single person who would be hurt or injured by such a process of dumping? I wish that those who object to dumping would only dump into my back yard all those useful things which go to minister to the wants and luxuries of mankind. I - should receive them most thankfully. - should not take it ill if my grocer, my butcher, my baker, my tailor, - or any one else to whom I usually have to give something in exchange when I want his goods, were to insist upon dumping them into my back yard every hour <>f the week at a fraction of cost or at no - cost at all to me. I wonder who would get poor first- I cr the dumpers? Why, sir, it is absolutely absurd to argue that any system of importing the things which the people need at the lowest possible rates can do injury to the community. Is it to be supposed for a moment that a country will dump its goods into Australia without getting some equivalent in return ? Does not the Minister know sufficient of economics to be aware that imports are paid for by exports, and that no country can be a purely exporting country unless it chooses to pay about twice or, perhaps, even more, the rate of freight which otherwise would be charged, even if trade could be carried on at all of such a one-sided character? contra- Only this afternoon, in connection with the mail contract, we had from the Prime Minister a statement in which he said that certain ships with a very large tonnage would have to be built, and provided with an immense amount of storage space for the purpose, of-what?-takin g away Australian perishable products in exchange for .goods produced in other countries. How are the sales going to be effected? The Minister knows perfectly well that such sales are effected by means of exchanges, and that the exports in the mail ships will have to be paid for by goods imported from other countries in exchange. Does he suppose that these magnificent ships will leave London, and other ports, and come to Australia with thenholds empty? Yet the very object of this measure is to try to bring about such a state of things ! We know perfectly well that they could not carry on trade and commerce on those lines for a month without going bankrupt, and doing immense damage not only to themselves, but to the trade and prestige of Australia. This afternoon we had the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, a professed out-and-out free-trader, defending legislation of this character, certainly in a more or less unconvincing and, perhaps, half-hearted way. Has he considered what the effect would, be upon the particular class of persons whom he comes I here specially to represent? One of the effects of any diminution of importation by means of the prohibitive power proposed to be granted to the Minister would be to largely paralyze the trade, commerce, and industry of this country. There would be fewer ships coming here to land goods. A multitude of the men who find employment on the wharfs of Melbourne, Adelaide, and Sydney would have to seek other avenues of labour. Our graving docks and ship-repairing yards would suffer severely through a diminution in the volume of work which ordinarily went to them. The hands who are now employed in industries which are more or less dependent upon shipping, and the success of which must either be promoted or diminished as our shipping is encouraged or discouraged, would be very seriously affected by the operations of the Bill. Honourable members must know that any interference with the trade and commerce of this country would involve not only the importers, with the immense army of employees dependent on the importing trade, and an immense number of carters and others, but also various branches of industry which are directly and indirectly associated with, and dependent upon, shipping. This would affect all our ports and all the people of Australia. I do not wish to pursue the subject at any great length at the present stage, but I would seriously urge the Minister to give due weight to the speech of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. Coming from the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, as it did, it certainly should carry a very large amount of weight with the Minister. I urge the honourable gentleman to give due consideration to the appeal to delay the further consideration of the measure until honourable members generally have had an opportunity of studying the reports of the Tariff Commission, and then seeing whether any such necessity exists for this legislation as he alleges does exist. I do not for a moment believe that there can be brought forward any evidence which will justify the introduction of a Bill containing clauses of this description'. I do not believe that the Minister knows of a tangible case of dumping which will justify the enactment of such legislation. In the face of anv evidence to the contrary, we can only assume, and we are warranted in assuming, that there must be some sinister influences outside the House which have not been disclosed by the Minister, or anv of his supporters, to account for this indecent and undignified haste in pushing forward a measure for which no reason whatever has been shown to exist.",52
445,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Kooyong) [8.5] - Although we have had a very instructive debate 1 Part III . o£ the Bill, no utterance to which honourable members have listened deserves more serious consideration than that of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, supported as it was by the speech of the honourable member for Perth. Surely the Government must feel that in disregarding those remarks it is practically flouting the Tariff Commission. The honourable and learned member adduced weighty arguments to prove that at this stage we require more information than we at present possess in regard to the dumping which Part III . is intended to guard against. With the utmost respect for the members of other Royal Commissions/ I say that it will be generally admitted - that no Commissioners have more thoughtfully, carefully, and attentively carried out the tasks allotted to them than have those appointed to consider the effect of our Tariff upon Australian industries. There have always been large attendances at the meetings of the Commission, and the desire to secure evidence on both sides of the questions coming before it has been evident from the first. Therefore, the appeal of the Chairman for the postponement of the consideration of this important measure deserves more respect than has been shown to it. I do not wish to speak unkindly, but the action of the Minister forces us back to the belief that the Government is being compelled by others to push fKe measure forward before information, which would be available after a very short delay, can be obtained. The Minister was challenged to give instances of dumping such as the Bill would deal with, and replied most weakly. He referred to one or two industries which, in the proper sense of the words, are, not manufacturing, but assembling, industries, the work of whose operatives is to put together imported parts. While I admit that such industries are serviceable to the community, they are not such as justify the enactment of legislation like that before us. I ventured to suggest, when speaking on the second reading, that the Committee would be found unanimously opposed to the deliberate importation of goods for the purpose of destroying Australian industries; but the measure provides for a direct restraint of trade, and gives to the Minister powers which he should not be permitted to exercise, even with the safeguards arranged for. If it is really the desire of the Government to give relief to industries re' quiring assistance and further protection, on why db not Ministers orinp; forward for consideration the reports of the Tariff Commission already to hand? The honourable and learned member for Bendigo thinks that it will take at least a month to consider those reports, and to give effect by legislation to any decisions arrived at in regard to them, and I , for one, am prepared to pay serious attention to the recommendations of the Commission, with the desire to do all that is necessary to give help to industries requiring it. By the time the three reports now before us had been dealt with, the Commission, I have reason to believe, would have presented other reports.",54
446,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If Parliament commenced to deal with the Commission's reports tomorrow, I think that I can safely say that the Commission would undertake to keep it supplied with work for the rest of the session.",55
447,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is a declaration to which the Ministry should pay serious heed, arid I have no doubt that it will be endorsed by the chairman of the Tariff Commission.",55
448,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Hear , hear.",55
449,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Surely the statements that have been made by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo and the honourable member for Perth, as chairman and member of the Tariff Commission respectively, amount to a challenge to the Government, who profess to desire to assist our industries, to postpone the consideration of the Bill for' the present, and engage in the more practical work of dealing with the reports of the Tariff Commission. If Ministers adopt this course, I am sure that they will receive the assistance of a number of honourable members on this side of the House. The Government are flouting the business men of Australia, and are unnecessarily interfering with the course of trade and commerce by unduly pressing forward legislation of this kind. The object of the part of the Bill now under discussion is to prevent the importation of goods which are deliberately brought here for the purpose of destroying our manufactures, and Ministers will best accomplish their end by giving reasonable consideration to the requests of honourable members. I do not believe ' that mere cheapness should be our sole aim. I desire that the fullest justice should be done to all our producers and manufacturers, but I do not think that we should be .called upon to deal out of hand with an incomplete and ill-considered measure such as that now before us. It would be an outrage, not only upon the House, but upon the community generally, to pass the Bill under present conditions^ and any w^rong that may be inflicted as the result of the Government persisting in their present course will inevitably react upon the members of the Labour Party, who are pressing, them forward. It seems to be imagined that both our manufacturers and the working classes will be benefited by the prohibition of imports which it is intended to' exclude by means of the dumping provisions; but it is questionable whether the Bill will confer the benefits that are expected to flow from it. I trust that the Government will cease their efforts to bulldoze honourable members into passing this ill-considered Bill.",55
450,Mr CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wilmot) [8.22] - l'n common with most honourable members on this side of the Chamber, I am bitterly opposed to the Bill , and think that we are being unfairly treated by the Government. The honourable and learned member for Corinella asked the Minister of Customs to afford us certain information, and the Minister has made a statement in which he has done little more than repeat what he stated during the second-reading debate. He threw very little additional light on the subject. He produced a bit of soap which, although it bore a German label, he toid us had been made in Japan.",55
451,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And a very fine piece of soap it was.,55
452,Mr CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"So far as I was .able to judge, the soap was fairly good. I did not test it by making use of it, because, fortunately, I do not require so much washing as do certain Ministers. The Minister endeavoured to impress upon us the fact that dumping was being carried on to an extent that was proving disastrous to many of our industries. If he had desired to convince honourable members upon that point he should have proved his case by bringing forward incontrovertible testimony, instead of merely producing a piece of soap. Although he stated that the soap had been made in Japan, it bore a label printed partly in French and partly in. German, and there was absolutely no evidence that the article was the product of Japanese tabour. The Minister should not content himself by making mere assertions, but should submit absolute proofs. Of course, the object of the Minister was to excite the feelings of honourable members against the introduction into the Commonwealth of the products of cheap labour. If he knew anything about Japan, he would be aware that the Japanese, who live principally on rice and fish, have a very small number of cattle and sheep, and are therefore not able to produce large quantities of tallow with which to manufacture soap for export. If the soap produced by the Minister was made in Japan, its principal constituent, namely, tallow, must have been first imported either from Australia or South America. The Minister should be in a position to substantiate his statements. I should like to point out that three classes of the community are deeply interested in this measure. The first class, the manufacturers, is a comparatively small one. The second class, the employees in our manufacturing industries, is not a very large one; and the third class, the consumers, is by far the largest and most important. It appears to me that the Minister of Trade and Customs has gone mad on the subject of protection, and that in his desire to bolster up Australian industries, he has entirely lost sight of the interests of the largest class in the communitv. who will undoubtedly suffer seriously if this precious Bill becomes law. Dumping is generally understood to consist of placing upon the market a large quantity of a given commodity within a very short time. can be no question that when a market is flooded in this way, the tendency is to depress prices for the time being. may not be of any benefit to the manufacturers, or their employees, but it is certainly good for the great bulk of the consumers. The Minister says that if , as the result of dumping, our manufacturers are ruined, the importers who have been flooding the market will in a very short time raise their prices, and the consumers will eventually be no better off than if they had paid reasonable prices all along. We know, however, that if prices were unduly raised, those who had been responsible for the dumping, with the object of securing the market for themselves, would very soon be exposed to competition from other quarters. Most European countries are unable to consume all the manufactured goods that they produce, and would very readily seize an opportunity to enter into competition with anv bodv of men who might seek to monopolize our market in the manner indicated. I do not know of any article except oil, the price of which could be unduly inflated for any Mr Cameron. length of time, because competition would undoubtedly operate to bring prices down to a normal level. For these reasons, it appears to me that we need not be afraid that any very disastrous effects will follow from dumping. The honourable and learned member for Wannon, before the adjournment for dinner, made an extremely eloquent speech, in which he conclusively proved that statements which the Minister had accepted as gospel were utterly without foundation. Manufacturers abroad, by the aid of better machinery, or owing to the fact that they are able to manufacture on a large scale, are enabled to produce certain articles very much more cheaply than they can be produced here, and if we pass this Bill we shall say to those persons, "" We shall not allow you to sell your goods at a price which yields you a fair profit, and-which you are prepared to accept, but we shall compel you to raise your price to that of the Australian manufacturers of the same goods."" If we take ploughs, for example, which are amongst the most useful implements employed in one of our primary industries, we shall find that Australian ploughs at the present time cannot be sold at much less than from £ 6 10s. to £ j . We are told that they are superior to the implements imported from America and Canada. Whether that be so are not, I am unable to say. The workmanship of There the imported implements may not be quite as good as that of the implements locally manufactured, but they answer their purThis pose, and American and Canadian ploughs can be sold here at from £4. 10s. to If this Bill is to have any effect at all, action may be taken under it to compel American and Canadian manufacturers of ploughs to put their price for those implements up to the price charged by Australian manufacturers. Who will suffer by that ? - It will be the farmers of Australia, of whom I am one. I therefore say that if this Bill is allowed to become law, its effect may be to inflict injustice on one of the most deserving classes in the community. I recognise that honourable members can speak more than once to the same question in Committee, and I shall, therefore, not speak at length at this stage, but, before resuming my seat, - I do urge upon the'free traders in the labour ranks opposite to consult the best interests of the people of Australia, and vote against these anti-dumping clauses.",55
453,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Angas) [8.35] - I do not propose to go into the question as to what is dumping and what is not, I think that the definition given by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, though it may be somewhat too wide, will fairly swer the purpose. Some reference has been,, made to the dumping of wire nails and tacks by German manufacturers, but, acwitnesses cording to consular reports, that was dumping, but the reference was not to Australia. It was pointed out in some of the English consular reports that wire nails and tacks largely exported from Germany were sold in the Home marthese ket at a profit of 1,200,000 marks in months, and at a loss on export of 859,000 marks. That was dumping, and the class of dumping to which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo referred. The in a very happy state. Minister gave no instance of that sort dumping. The' reference to harvesters does not apply, because they are not manuas factured in America for consumption locally, and we therefore cannot have the saysdifference in price, which is the very essence of clumping. Throughout this Bill there are references to labour and to a fair remunerawhere tion for labour. If this is a Bill to promills tect labour, we should be very careful that on it does protect labour. I remember that they some time last year a Trade Union Congress sat in England, and when the question the efficacy of protection in its various forms as a remedy for some of the capital, acknowledged grievances of labour in the United Kingdom was considered, that can here. remedy was rejected by the Congress by a vote of, I thinjc, 1,250,000 to about ' or 28,000. That being so, I do not we should trust too much to a measure oif this sort, and to the benevolence of capitalists, who have been so instrumental in pushing it on, to deal fairly with labour, but should put within its corners a provision that will secure bour what it is justly entitled to, and about which its advocates are so solicitous. member, on glancing through some of evidence given before the Tariff Commisthe sion, finding that the figures quoted witnesses did not show that labour was a very happy condition in some of chinery factories, whose proprietors been pressing this legislation upon the vernment. The aggregate figures as to wages paid, taken in connection with the number of employees, showed the payments to amount, in some cases, to from ^70 ^75 per year per man. I have seen figures given by some of the witnesses which in this Bill. would not work out at even £ 5 0 per year per man. I do not know what wages are really paid, (but these figures were, {for 1902, and I should think that wages did annot vary very much up to 1904, when the alleged competition was in existence. I could refer honourable members to the particular who supplied the figures which I have quoted, but, following the suggestion of the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, I do not propose to make more than a cursory reference to the evidence given before that body. In America all agencies are at work, and in addition six to very stiff protection the Wilson Act, which is framed upon somewhat similar lines to this Bill, operates. But labour at Pittsburg, for instance, does not seem to be In a work just of published by a Mr Shadwell, on Industrial Efficiency, reference is made to Pittsburg "" Hell with the lid off,"" and to Homestead as "" Hell with the hatches on."" He Here is nothing hut unrelieved gloom and grind; on one side the fuming, groaning walls, men sweat at the furnaces and rolling twelve hours a day for seven days a week; the other side, rows of wretched hovels, where eat and sleep, having neither time nor energy left for anything else. of This is the state of labour in the iron works of America, where they do protect and where they cannot, under their constitutional laws, protect labour, as we",56
454,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Would the honourable and 27,000 learned member allow goods made under think those conditions to come in here?",57
455,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I wish the honourable the member for Melbourne Ports to assist me in preventing that kind of thing being even possible here.' I want the four honourable member and the public who to laare delighted by his advocacy of their cause, in the propagandism that is going on I reoutside, to see that this Bill does protect the labour, and not merelv capital. That is point. I say that there exists in Amebyrica, according to the evidence supplied by in Mr Shadwell in his two volumes recently the mapublished, that state of affairs. In have Pittsburg, which is the very home .of Go the iron industry, along with a very liberal the protection under the Tariff and the operation of the Wilson law, which is somewhat similar to this Bill, labour is degraded. to That is the position in America. We can cure that by operating"""" upon the definitions Very often the definitions in a Bill look quite as simple as does the Minister in charge of it , but they mean a very great deal. I shall not detain the Committee any longer at this stage, but I indicate that, to test the feeling of honourable members, I shall move an amendment upon this clause, providing for a definition of labour. The alphabetical arrangement is not followed in the clause, and I propose to move, after the definition of the word "" trade,"" the insertion of these words"" Labour"" means labour in Australian industries to which a Commonwealth or Slate law providing for the fixing of the remuneration of labour by an award of a Court of Arbitration, an industrial agreement, or a Board applies, or, if no such law applies, in which in the opinion of the Justice the remuneration of labour prior to the alleged unfair competition was fair. We find that on the subject of harvesters some of the gentlemen who gave evidence before the Tariff Commission, and who are advocating prohibitive duties, submitted figures from which it appeared that about 25 per cent, only of the product was represented by labour. Let us now protect that 25 per cent., and not give the whole of the protection to the other 75 per cent. I have no wish to be unreasonable, and I have therefore framed the amendment so that it shall apply not merely to industries protected under an Arbitration Act with provision for awards in favour of labour, by an industrial agreement also sanctioned by an Act, or by Wages Board, but that it shall also apply where these means of protection do not exist if the Justice thinks that the remuneration of labour prior to the alleged unfair competition was fair.",57
456,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It would' have the same effect as the institution of a Wages Board.,58
457,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Practicall y the same effect. As we now find gentlemen, and amongst them politicians, in their spare time perambulating the country, organizing labour and telling labourers that all sorts of things will follow the prohibition of imports, and the increase of Customs duties, that if we reverse the rule which hitherto we have thought led to productive progress, the millennium will come about, I propose to move the amendment in order that the hopes which, have been raised amongst the labouring classes by these perambulating and somewhat loquacious persons shall not be falsified. Amendment (by ...

I think that the Minister will recognise the importance of that amendment, and I hope he will give it the favourable consideration which, in my opinion, it deserves.",58
459,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Canad a has passed special laws to protect herself against the dumping of goods from the United Kingdom.,58
460,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I will deal with that matter when I .come to consider the Canadian legislation. It must be remembered that the provisions of this Bill are to operate in addition to the Customs duties which we have imposed, or may impose, on imports from foreign countries, Great Britain, and dependencies of the Empire. I do not think that the instances of dumping in Australia of exports from the United Kingdom are more than the instances of dumping of Australian goods in Great Britain, and the Minister has said nothing to shake that belief. There is, therefore, no serious reason for excluding British goods under the provisions of Part III . of the Bill . Harvesters, which seem always to be at the back of the Minister's mind, are not sent here from the United Kingdom. The first very important reason which I would urge in support of my amendment is the treatment which Australia and the other dependencies of the Empire have received from the mother-land. Great Britain gave us this great continent as a heritage. She has handed over to us and to our descendants a country which today is rich and prosperous, and gives every promise of increasing in prosperity and supporting an enormous population.",58
461,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But the English people will not give us preferential trade.,58
462,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They give us what is a much greater advantage-fre e entry for our goods into their markets.,58
463,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"According to the honourable member's belief, we.should allow everything to be imported here free of duty.",58
464,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If we E) had any gratitude to the mother-land, we should do so as regards her products.",58
465,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Has the fulness of time,58
466,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not know when the honourable member would consider that the fulness of time had come. We can only be certain that he will not be here then, though we hope that he will have preference in a better place.",59
467,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable member think that the fulness of time has come to reap the advantage of pauper labour?,59
468,Mr FULLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is a cry upon which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has lived all his life.,59
469,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"When he speaks "" pauper,"" he means protected labour.",59
470,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honhas orable member, as a protectionist, has every opportunity, by the imposition of Customs duties, to get rid of the effect of the differadmitted ence between the cost of labour in Ausf tralia and its cost in Great Britain. has already exercised that privilege to the full , and intends to exercise it to excess.",59
471,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,He intends to exercise it reasonably.,59
472,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Not only has Great Britain given us this as a heritage, but, with surprising generosity, she has allowed us full rights self-government If she had considered her self-interest alone, it would have instiby gated her to withhold from us the power tax her goods, and to frame our Constitution so as to provide for the free entrv British goods into Australia. She has given us the right to legislate, not only for own advantage, but even to her injury. No doubt her statesmen anticipated that having been treated generously, would a generous return. This measure will show that Great Britain cannot expect from this part of the Empire generosity such as she has herself displayed. The has given all these things, and which we are attempting to smite, shelters us from tial trade. our enemies.

477,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We are not talking about generosity.,59
478,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am talking about generosity. There is much reason to do so.,59

480,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"A little generosity may surely be expected in return of for the great generosity extended to us.

I should like the Minister to say what proportion of our exports goes to Great Britain. Those goods are dumped on her shores, if we accept the Ministen's definition of dumping. Is Great Britain to receive no consideration from this dependency, to which she has shown so much?",59
491,Mr EWING,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Million s of loyal Englishmen are opposed to dumping. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - I give the honourable member credit for knowing a little about business matters- I could not say so much for every honourable member-bu t is he aware that the Minister has defined dumping as the sending of surplus products to another market, to be sold there at whatever prices they will fetch, and often at lower prices than can be obtained for similar goods in the country of production ? Sin WILLIAM LYNE - I said "" always,"" not "" often."" Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - The Minister said that sometimes dumped goods are sold at a profit.",60
492,Mr EWING,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Million s of loyal Englishmen are opposed to dumping, and a very strong party in England is adverse to it .",60
493,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If they are opposed to dumping in the sense in which the Minister of Trade and Customs uses the term, they must be opposed to the exportation of Australian surplus products to Great Britain, to the disturbance and disorganization of Home industries. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, who represents an electoral division in which there are many butter factories, knows that an association determines what quantity of butter is likely to be absorbed by this market, and fixes the price for it, the balance being exported to Great Britain, to be sold there at what it will fetch. That, according to the definition of the - Minister of Trade and Customs, is dumping. Similarly, we send our f r u it to Great Britain-no t that for which we can obtain a good market here, but the surplus, which could not be disposed Of here, and the offering for sale of which would depress local prices. Our surplus f r u it is sold in Great Britain for whatever price can be obtained for it , and sometimes for considerably less than is obtained in our own market.",60
494,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No , no. ' Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - I yes.",60
495,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is ways a higher price.,60
496,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I say no; on many occasions the price is considerably lower, and heavy losses have been made on shipments, not when goods were damaged, but when they were sound. Sir . WILLIAM LYNE - When they were damaged.",60
497,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Unfor tunately, the Minister brings little study or knowledge to bear on the subject.",60
498,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I know just as much as does the honourable member, and a little more.",60
499,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister will see from the press reports that the same classes of apples, for instance, are quoted often at a higher rate in Australia than in Great Britain.",60
500,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Ver y seldom.,60
501,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I say that often the same classes of apples are quoted at a higher rate in Australia than that at which they are sold in London.,60
502,Mr CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What about meat?,60
503,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes , what about meat? Will the Minister tell me that the prices obtained in Australia for meat are not higher than those obtained in the London market?",60
504,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Not always, but sometimes.",60
505,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The same price is obtained! so seldom that we may say it is never obtained.,60
506,Mr KENNEDY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Does the honourable member say that the price of Australian meat is lower in London than in Australia ? Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - Yes , I say that the price in London is relatively lower, when the cost of sending the meat there is deducted; and I make that statement on the highest authoritv. namely, that of the exporters.",60
507,Mr KENNEDY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member is taking special cases. In Queensland the price of beef is considerably lower than in Victoria, and the relative cost of transport is greater.",60

509,Mr KENNEDY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Tak e the whole of the Victorian export.,60

516,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Tha just it ; and when they export, it shows that if they retained all the products here, they would get a worse price here they do in Europe; otherwise they would sell all they produce here. If the Minister will agree to this amendment, I un-, dertake to prove my statement to the satisfaction of the Government.",61
517,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I tempted to accept that offer.,61
518,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Le t the Minister do so. I . have no desire to discourage or interfere with such exports; but how do they affect the English producer? The importation of Australian ibeef, lambs, and so forth, into England has, bit by bit, taken the trade out of the hands of the English grower. The importation of Australian frui t into England operates.in the same way, but not to the same degree, because it arrives there out of the English season, when there is not much English frui t to offer.",61
519,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable ber say the same about butter?,61
520,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Yes .,61
521,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Danes do not say talk such rubbish! that the importation of Australian butter takes the business away from the English producer, but that it takes the business away from them.",61
522,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honthat, orable member can easily satisfy himself on that point.",61
523,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I have done so.,61
524,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then the honourable member must have found that what he states is not altogether the case. If we have regard to the importation of Danish butter into England before Ausof tralian and New Zealand butter went there, the enoimous increase from the latter places is not nearly accounted for by any drop in Danish importations.",61
525,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is it accounted for by the drop in the English production?,61
526,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Austra lian butter interferes with the imporfafion be of Danish butter, but it interferes to a greater degree, probably, with the Engget lish production, because it is sold at a lower price than is the Danish. How can the honourable member ask any Parliament to conceive that the large quantity of butter which Australia and New Zealand exports to England does not, in combination the Danish importations, interfere with production in England? Where was the butter obtained previously, if not from t is English and Irish producers?",61
527,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The English farmer has another tale to tell from that of the honthan orable member for Laanecoorie.,61
528,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Of course. Great Britain does not interfere with these importations; but if the tenets of some men were to become those of the British people as a whole, there would be am almost retaliation. This ungenerous treatment in return for the most kindly treatment, almost makes me a retaliationist. Great Britain might take a stand, and say, "" We cannot any longer tolerate this; we have treated you well in welcoming your productions freely to our markets, to the injury of our producing classes; and when you not only impose duties which, in some cases, are sufficiently high to prohibit, but, where you cannot exclude by duties, you seek to exclude absolutely by a Bill such as this, it is time we dealt with your goods in the same way."" If that attitude were taken by Great Britain, we should Be membrought to our knees immediately. Sir WILLIAM LYNE.^-Nonsense; do not",61
529,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister of Trade and Customs is a great authority on rubbish; but if he cannot make a more intelligent interjection than I ask ' him to turn his mind to his Bill- a task which he has not attempted yet. What I say is that we should be brought to our knees immediately if we were to receive from Great Britain the treatment that we mete out to her. To show that I am not without precedent in my proposal, I shall quote the legislation Canada. In the Dominion there are provisions which are not called in the measure anti-dumping provisions, but which have been called so here.",61
530,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Mr Fielding so describes the provisions.,62
531,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Canadian Minister and some member of the Dominion Parliament may so describe the provisions. I am not finding fault with the description, and I am quite willing to call them anti-dumping provisions, if the Minister chooses. How does Canada deal with the question? The Dominion Act of Parliament is more a measure for the equalization of prices than anything else. The section of the Canadian Act which deals with this matter is as fellows: Whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the Minister of Customs, or of any officer of Customs authorized to collect Customs dues, that the export price, or the actual selling price to the importer in Canada, of any imported dutiable articles of a class or kind made or produced in Canada, is less than the fair market value thereof, as determined according to the basis of value for duty, provided in the Customs Act in respect of imported goods subjected to an advalorem duty, such article shall, in addition to the duty otherwise established, be subject to a special duty of Customs equal to the difference between such fair market value and such selling price. It will be seen that this aims at an equalization of prices, and even to that there is some limitation in the following:Provided, however, that the special Customs duty on any article shall not exceed one-half of the Customs duty otherwise established in respect of the article, except in regard to the articles mentioned in items 224 (pig-iron and cast scrap iron), 226 (iron or steel ingots, and other forms less finished than iron or steel bars, and 231 (rolled iron or steel plates), in Schedule A to the Customs Tariff 1897, the special duty of Customs on which shall not exceed 15 per cent, ad valorem, nor more than the difference between the selling price and the fair market value of the article. The effect of these provisions is simply to equalize, by the duty, the prices of the imports, and even that is subject to some limitation. Canada does not attempt to exclude: she admits the goods, and only attempts to equalize prices. But what is Canada's treatment of Great Britain? Although, these duties are imposed, Canada charges Great Britain only two-thirds of the duty which is charged to other nations.",62
532,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But Canada put up the duties first.,62
533,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There is a distinction, in any case. I am merely stating the facts, and not. arguing whether Canada is right or wrong, or is too geneMinister rous, or not sufficiently generous. I only desire to impress on the Minister the fact that Canada does to some degree recognise Great 'Britain in this connection. Now we come to the New Zealand measure. We often hear New Zealand measures lauded by members of this Parliament, and frequently by members' of the. Government. It is evident, from the data which has been placed before us that the Government consulted the New Zealand measure before they drafted these anti-dumping clauses. The Government have not adopted the New Zealand provisions, and one reason for that may be that, while the Bill proposes to affect all gocds, New Zealand only saw reason to deal with agricultural implements-that is, to deal with them if the occasion arose. I do not think that New Zealand has yet applied the provisions, and that is, I suppose, because there has' not been found any necessity to do so.",62
534,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But New Zealand passed the Act, and if we pass the Bill we may not find it necessary to put it into operation.",62
535,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What ? With the present Minister of Trade and Customs in office !,62
536,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the Minister stands by the speech he has made, the Bill will be put into operation every day in the year.",62
537,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No , no.",62
538,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We all know that there is the greatest difficulty in understanding what the Minister of Trade and Customs does say. At any rate, all & c ) , this is apart from the question, before us. New Zealand has not considered her legislation any too liberal, at any rate to the mother country. What are the provisions of the New Zealand Act? It is provided ' that if a certain Board finds that implements have been uodulv and improperlyreduced in price by the importers, the price shall not be increased to the consumer by excluding competitors, but a bonus, up to one-third, may be granted to the New Zealand implement makers to sustain them through the unfair competition. What a difference there is in the treatment of Great Britain by New Zealand as compared with the treatment proposed in ""the Bill ! Let the Minister listen to this- I do not know whether he has noticed it before.",62
539,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Oh , yes.",62
540,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then the has read it, and deliberately rejected it. We will see what that provision is. The New Zealand Act in section 9 providesFor the purpose of this Act, implements of British manufacture shall be deemed to be manufactured in New Zealand,' and the importers of such implements shall be deemed to be manufacturers thereof in New Zealand. It will be observed that not only does the New Zealand Act provide that implements of British manufacture shall be "" deemed to be manufactured in New Zealand,"" but it makes the further provision that the importer of such implements shall be deemed to be a manufacturer in New Zealand. That means that if a bonus is given to prevent the destruction of industries by foreign importations, the importer of a British implement gets that bonus as well as does the New Zealand manufacturer.",62
541,Mr SKENE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What does ""British "" include ?",63
542,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am not making my amendment as wide as that, because it might be considered to embrace something which was not desirable.",63
543,Mr HIGGINS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,How would the honourable member prove that the goods were really British?,63
544,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"How is it proved in New Zealand? How are a great many things to be proved that this Bill deals with? There are far greater difficulties in the Bill than that. I think that my phrase, "" Imported from and the product of the United Kingdom "" is sufficiently clear to enable the Customs officers to get proof.",63

546,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Commerce Act, which the honourable member assisted to pass, presents the same difficulty. If the Customs Department cannot ascertain with sufficient clearness to satisfy itself that particular goods are the products of Great Britain, it is mot nearly so alert and capable as I suppose it to be. Will the honourable member for Northern Melbourne tell me this: Which is the greater difficulty, to say what is the ordinary cost of a product in English or foreign markets or to say whether the product is imported from Great Britain or from a foreign country ? I know which task I would rather undertake.",63
547,Mr HIGGINS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,You can ascertain the value of goods from other people.,63
548,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"You cannot find out the cost of production of certain manufactures from the productions of other manufacturers in the case of complicated articles of trade. In the New Zealand Act there is a generous recognition of the mother country. Whatever we may think of the New Zealand legislation, and of its nature and necessity, surely we must recognise, as New Zealand has done, the generosity of Great Britain, the support we get from the British Empire, and the protection it gives to us. New Zealand has recognised that within the four comers of an Act dealing with importations such as we are considering now.",63
549,Mr SKENE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And British people emigiate to New Zealand.,63
550,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Naturally ; they ought to be attracted to a country of that character. Any Briton ought to be. In a Bill such as this, where no need can be shown as regards British goods for such provisions as those which we are considering, we ought to recognise our debt to the mother country. Is the Government prepared to say deliberately in this measure that British goods shall be prevented from coming-here under the very same conditions as those under which we send goods to Great Britain ? Is the Minister of Trade and Customs prepared to say that there shall be no difference between the treatment of the mother country and that which is shown to foreign nations? Is he prepared to say that the policy of preference-of concession for concession-whic h this Government has supported, is so much empty sham, and that we shall take the first opportunity we get, not to assist Great Britain to send goods here, but to shut out British goods from our markets when there is no need for it ? It has not been shown that there has been any dumping of British goods into Australia, except that dumping which consists in the export of a surplus, and the obtaining of the best possible price in the market to which the goods are exported; which is the class of dumping that we carry on with the great bulk of our exported products. I will ask whether there is any evidence of an intention to carrv the preferential trade policy of the Government into effect; does the Government propose to follow the example set by preferentialists like the late Mr Seddon of New Zealand ? He showed that he was not merely a citizen of a portion of the Empire, trying to benefit the people of that portion, no matter at what expense to the rest of the Empire; but that he was the citizen of a greater country, willing to take into account the advancement of every portion of it .

551,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honshould orable member has the best answer in the action of the late Premier of New Zealand.

Our duty to Australia is to be Australians first; our duty here is to protect the industries of our land and the interests of our workers, and, whether the intent comes from New Zealand, Canada, or the mother country, I , for one, will not agree to permit the destruction to go on to the injury of my country.",65

580,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is, I think a short answer to the speech of the honourable member for North Sydney. This is not an attempt to keep out any goods from any part of the world, provided that the competition' is fair.",65
581,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Look at what unfair competition is stated to be in paragraph a of proposed new clause 14. It applies to all our imports.,65

583,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Will the honourable and learned gentleman read it ?,65
584,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am very glad that my honourable friend has referred to the paragraph, because it shows exactly what I mean. It says that competition is unfair ifunder ordinary circumstances of tradethis is no boom matter, but ordinary circumstances of trade with the best machinery and methods that we can procureit would probably lead to the Australian goods being no longer produced or being withdrawn from the market, or being sold at a loss unless produced at a lower remuneration for labour.

Whatever our wages are under ordinary conditions, with the best unmachinery and appliances we can procure, and the best methods we can adopt, if anywill one comes here with the intent to break down an industry which it is desirable, in the interests of producers, workers, and consumers should be preserved, and if he attempts to break it down by means of asystem of competition which nothing canavert, except the cutting down of Australian rates of labour, I say for myself and the Government, "" We do not care whether it comes from the mother country or anywhere else, we will not permit it .

589,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Werriwa) [9.40] - The remark was made last week that the Minister nominally in charge of the Bill was practically absent during the greater part of the time devoted to its consideration, and was, in fact, represented by counsel, while tonight again the speech of the honourable member for North Sydney has been replied to, not by him, but by the Attorney-General. This seems to me only right, because the Minister of Trade and Customs, in introducing the Bill, stood very much in the position of a criminal in the dock. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr. MAUGER) - The honourable and learned member must withdraw that remark.",66
590,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I will substitute "" accused "" for "" criminal."" I am using the term only by way of illustration. sons in that position can always be represented by counsel, and it is right that the Minister should be so represented. told us six months ago that he could bring forward dozens of instances in support of legislation of this character, and he repeated that statement in introducing the Bill j but he has not yet been able to furnish a single instance. Every one knows the real purpose of the measure. It is not an anti-dumping Bill, but a measure to secure that Mr H . V. MCKay, of harvester fame, shall not have competition to meet. It must be remembered, too, that Mr. MCKay carries on his operations in a district in which there is no Wages Board. The great bulk of the Labour Party are so false to their principles that they suppout this Bill to allow a certain capitalist to increase as he pleases the price of his machines. With the exception of the honourable member for Perth, and one or two others, labour members have given no sign of their intention to support the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Angas, providing that anv extra profits made as the result of the measure shall go to the workers, and not to the capitalist. It is pitiable that a large section of honourable members should so dread a dissolution that, at the dictation of the Minister of Trade and Customs, they will swallow whatever legislation he puts before them, even when, as in this case, it will benefit only a few, and greatly oppress the community as a whole. I was astounded at some of the remarks made by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney this afternoon. He has asserted a thousand times that legislation of this kind is beneficial only to the few,-, and makes it difficult for the man of small capital to exist. Measures like this always bring about combinations of capitalists which create monopolies, and that will be the effect of the Bill . No thought is being given to the interests of the great bulk of the workers. Now'let us see what dumping means. The Minister mentioned the case of sewing machines, and I would ask honourable members whether it would not be of the greatest advantage to our householders if sewing machines could be introduced here, and sold at half the present price. If , on the other hand, a prohibition law were brought into force, the present price would probably be quadrupled, to the detriment of the general public, but to the benefit of Per- one manufacturer who happens to be a friend to the Minister. Even he does* not manufacture the machines, in a strict sense He of the term, but by a little persuasion he will be able to induce the Minister to place sewing machines on the list of prohibited imports. Sewing machines would be excluded merely because a local manufacturer reported to the Minister that he was being injured by their introduction. No consideration would be given to the hundreds of householders who would gladly buy machines if they could be sold at a reduction upon their present price. I wonder whether the honourable member for Yarra would object if any one attempted to dump a first class sewing machine, or even twenty sewing machines, into his house. Would he not open his doors as widely as possible, and sav. "" This is a good thing for me""? If , in addition to doing that, some one were to dump into his house all the clothes that he and his family required, would he not be delighted? If he had no need for such articles himself, hundreds of his poprer brethren would be only too delighted to have many pounds' worth of clothing dumped into their homes. I have a paddock large enough to hold all the goods that could be dumped here from any part of the world, and I should be glad to receive them. I know of thousands of worthy individuals who would be only too glad to select what they required from such a store. If any such dumping operations were entered upon I should be able to confer great benefit upon my neighbours by making a free distribution of valuable and usef u l articles among them. I would not keep them for myself, because no man can eat or drink more than a certain amount, nor can he derive any advantage from having am inordinately large stock of wearing apparel. I venture to say that the doctrine which is being preached by Ministers, if carried to its ultimate conclusion, would result in los3 to us. Any operations must result in loss, unless they are founded upon the lines of true commercial morality. When I heard the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who professes to be a Christian, speaking in harsh terms of people in other parts of the world, I felt inclined to apply to him a certain phrase contained in the Bible. Whenever I hear a man who professes the doctrine of Christianity preaching the doctrine of selfishness, I conclude that he must have an utter contempt for the great principles of morality in which he professes to believe.",66
591,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What is the honourable and learned member talking about?,67
592,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the cap fits, the honourable member can wear it. I will guarantee that if the Denton hat mills dumped all the hats they made into his shop, and charged him nothing for them, he would open his door widely enough, and would take care that he did not dump the goods upon any one else without getting something in return. It is utter cant and humbug for honourable members to speak as they have done. Where are these people who are willing to dump their goods upon our markets? All my life I have endeavoured to buy the goods I required as cheaply as possible. obtain an article that is worth to me more than I pay for it, I regard myself as an absolute .gainer by the transaction. Where is the man who does not take the same view, and who does not act upon that principle in his daily life? If he carried the doctrine of altruism to the extent of utterly ignoring the ego, he would starve in the streets. Therefore, we mav regard all this humbugging talk about anti-dumping as an attempt to trick and deceive the great mass of the people into the belief that we are going to do something which will prevent them from being injured, whereas if we could cheapen the* imported goods required by them by one-half, we should double the value of the produce which we export in payment for them. Our wheat and our gold would increase in 93 value two-fold. I can conceive of the joy with which protectionists would view such a state of affairs, and how they would glory in the fact that our products, instead of being worth ^40,000,000 were worth ^80,000,000^. If I could buy for £ 1 a suit of clothes for which I formerly paid £,2 , the value of my sovereigns would be increased two-fold. It is because we generally use gold as a measure of value that many persons fall into the mistake of supposing that it is the only measure of value. I would point out, however, that in many cases a workman who receives £ 2 per week i-i one place is receiving greater value than a workman who receives - £ 4 in another place. Many of the Bendigo miners who went over to Western Australia found that they were better off in Bendigo with £ 2 a week than they were at Cue or similar places with £ 4 per week. Under the dumping provisions of the Bill , it is proposed to stoD the importation of certain goods. Unfortunately, as the Bill stands, it will be within the power of the Minister to take the initiative. That is the principle of which I complain more bitterly than of anything else. The Minister, through the Comptroller-General, will set the law in motion. Of course, we are told that the Comptroller-General "" when he has reason to believe,"" will take action. That means that he will have reason to believe when he is told by the Minister that certain action is necessary. The Minister in his turn will ""have reason to believe "" when a friend of his conies along and tells him that it is necessary to exclude certain goods. The Minister believed what Mr MCKav told him, namely, If I that the harvesters that were being.imported from Canada were being .greatlv undervalued. So strong was he in this belief that he declined to credit the reports of the Canadian Minister, the sworn invoices which indicated that £ 3 6 or £ 3 7 was a fair valuation, and also the evidence of his own officer, Mr Smart. He deliberately set all this testimony on one side. sim.plv because a section of the Customs Act gave him power to use his own discretion. That is what I object to. When that section of the Customs Act was under consideration in this Chamber, I pointed out-becaus e of what had happened in New South Wales-that this very same man, the Minister of Trade and Customs, would take mighty good care to use the power that would be conferred upon him. I did not then point out that two of the Minister's colleagues in New South Wales had been accused of fraud in connection even - with the discharge of their Ministerial - duties, because the public were not then so well aware of the facts as they are to him, - day. I did indicate, however, that Minister would be the'very man to act I had suggested, and he has done so. The members of the Labour Party are - allowing this kind of thing to go on, but they would not have permitted it but for the peculiar circumstances in which they - are placed. The sooner this Parliament is dissolved the better it will be for the country, because we cannot workmen. expect any sound or honest legislasoon tion to be passed whilst the present going on. state of affairs continues. Three years elapsed after my prediction had been tered before what I had foretold took place. Despite the sworn testimony of the offiamongst cials in Canada and in Melbourne, and devote for it . spite the sworn testimony of Mr MCKay himself before the Tariff Commission that his harvesters did not cost him more to vote for it? than about ^ 2 9 to manufacture, the Minister acted in the way I have described. I was aware that Mr MCKay, when he - was endeavouring to induce people to invest money in his business, pledged his - word that the cost of manufacturing the machines would not exceed ^ 2 9 each, and. that is why I persuaded a member of the Commission to address the question to I do not blame Mr MCKay for having given such a low estimate to those whom he was endeavouring to persuade to invest money in his business, because his statesaid ment appears to have been fairly accurate, and he has since admitted that it was fectly true. In spite of the fact that MCKay could produce harvesters at , £ 2 9 pleased. 1 each, the Minister declined to believe that similar machines could be manufactured Canada for even £ 6 or £ 7 above that cost. An inquiry should' certainly have refers. been .made as to the grounds upon which the Minister had exercised his power the Customs Act. It cannot be said that the Minister acted in defiance of the law, because we embodied in the Act the section which places the discretion in his hands.",67
593,Mr ISAACS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That argument has not much to do with this clause.,68
594,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Has it not? proposed in this Bill to confer the power upon the Minister that is given him by the Customs Act, and I am deavouring to show that what has happened 'under the Customs Act will occur to an greater degree under the present Bill . Mr MCKay was able to represent matters to the Minister, who readily lent his ear to and paid no attention to the fact that the Mr MCKay was not subject to the deas termination of any Wages Board, so far as his treatment of his employees was concerned. If the members of the Labour Party did their duty they would insist upon ' inserting a clause in the Bill providing that the whole of the extra profits derived by the manufacturer as the result of the exclusion of imported goods should go to the If that were done we should put an end to the log-rolling which is",68

602,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It says much for the persuasive powers, and the oratorical and argumentative ability of the honourable and learned gentleman that, after he had spoken, I should have found myself in full accord with him on the occasion to which he It is refers, though at first I differed from him. same The honourable ,and learned gentleman to should not reproach me with having agreed enwith him. There is no provision in this measure by which the workers are protected or considered in any way. When one attacks members of the Labour Party for having departed from the traditions with which they entered public life a few years ago, it is some consolation to know that they have sufficient conscience to feel the sting keenly, and leave the Chamber. Some members of the party are so keenlyalive to the position in which they are placed, that, while they never speak in defence of their action, they nave grace enough to be ashamed of it.",68
603,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Is the honourable learned member aware that an amendment has been circulated by a member of the Labour Party, the object of which will be to give the workers some protection under this Bill?",69
604,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is why I have made an honourable exception of two or three members of the Labour Party. I specially exclude the honourable member for Perth from any connection with the remarks I have ""just made, because, in my opinion, he deserves the thanks of the bulk of the workers of Australia for the manly stand he has taken in connection with this measure. The honourable member has protested as far as he could against any taxation of the workers under such a scheme.",69

608,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What possible objection can there be to the amendment on the part of any honourable member of the Committee? The Attorney-General tried to show that we gain nothing from the open markets of Gieat Britain. I hold strongly that the reason why Great Britain is amongst the first of the nations today, and occupies the premier position in commerce, is simply and solely because she has done away with all restrictions on her trade. Yet, I say that none the lesswe are bound to recognise the advantages we gain from the position she has taken up The Attorney-General asked, "" Where is the preference to us?"" I put this question to the honourable and learned gentleman : Suppose, for instance, that Mr . Chamberlain had been successful during the recent elections in Great Britain, and had been able to impose a heavy Tariff,, would he not admit that the extension of the open market to us by England, would have been a preference' so great and so valuable, that we should have had tobuy it if we could not have obtained it in any other way? I think that the honourable and learned gentleman must admit that he would.",69
609,Mr FRAZER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Has Great Britain givenus the open door out of consideration for and us, or in her own interests ?",69
610,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In my opinion, it has been not only to her interests, but in the interests of the world.",69
611,Mr FRAZER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,For whose interest was it intended ?,69
612,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It was following the doctrine of unselfishness, the great moral"" doctrine, ""Love your neighbour as yourself. »' Look at the results which have followed the practice of this doctrine. It may be that the people of Great Britain are not more strong, vigorous, and upright, than are those of'other nations, but they are now better fed than they were, because the products of the world are open to them.",69

I have yet to learn that many of the Labour Party_ in Australia are prepared to follow such a doctrine as that. I admit that the spirit of serfdom influences mien for years, and even for centuries, after the real conditions of serfdom have passed away. The spirit of cringing is sometimes so strong in men, that if you take from them the landlord, they will put a manufacturing lord in his place, because they mifst crawl and cringe to somebody. We are, however, hopeful that we are getting away from such a condition of things, and that there is a sufficient body of men animated by the spirit of freedom to trv and* keep open markets everywhere.",69

He said that we would have an opportunity to vote upon this matter, but why not now ?

618,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Attorney-General says that he cannot accept it, and, in an advocate's argument he puts forward as a reason that at some future nebulous time, which even he does not mention, we shall be enabled to deal with the question in another place.",70
619,Mr FRAZER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable and learned member say that British monopolists are preferable to American monopolists?,70
620,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not say that monopolists are preferable to anybody, but what I do say is that, whilst the Australian monopolist would have absolute control of the market under the prohibition of importations, the British monopolists would have to compete with the American and Canadian monopolists. I might illustrate the position by reference to what occurred when we were dealing with the subject of the duty upon blankets, and an attempt was made to impose aheavy duty. Honourable members may not be aware that at the time the supply of blankets in Australia was so short that the manufacturers were unable to meet the demand, and, though mills were working full time and overtime, they were obliged in many cases to forfeit a certain amount of money because they were unable to f u l f their contracts. Cables had to be sent Home for blankets that the people might be supplied with them for the winter. The same kind of thing might happen frequently if this clause were allowed to 'go through as it stands. Why should not this amendment be accepted, when it overcomes all the difficulties which have been suggested ? There can be no allegation of clumping by any British manufacturer in Australia. I ask for the name of one man in Great Britain or in America who wants to dump goods in Australia? I should be prepared to pay the duty in every case, provided I were not asked for anything more. Even though I did not want, the goods, I am sure I would be able to distribute them amongst the hundreds of people I know. Bill, Times have not been so good everywhere that men have not felt a little of the pinch of want. Honourable members opposite speak as though a continuous supply of goods at a moderate price would be a manifest injury to them. Are we never to conHonorable members should remember that, according as a pays less for some articles he requires, he has the more to spend in the purchase of other articles. The result of cheap production in the one line is to increase the demand for labour for production in other lines. Instances of this are numerous. We ""have only to look at the development which has taken place in the last seventy or eighty years, during which the rise in wages has been one hundred-fold, and the price of the general run of articles, that is to say, the cost of living, has decreased by nearly one-half. Let honourable members consider what an enormous difference that has made to the great mass of the people. After all, I presume that it is not intended to apply these so-called a'nti-dumping provisions unless goods are brought in in great profusion. If goods are imported in that way it will be only because they are largely demanded, and because the mass of the people use them. That is so self-evident that one feels rather pained - to have to repeat it so often. The necessity for doing so can only be attributed to the absence of study of a few simple economical principles, which after all are only called economic laws because they are the result of the experience of mankind. What is theory but the explanation of the relation which facts bear to one another ? Economic laws are i l so termed because they are sound and solid explanations; and when they cease to explain they cease to exist. Those who fail to recognise that the Bill will place a most serious weapon in the hands of the Minister fai l to recognise what, to my mind, seems beyond question. The amendment submitted would have the effect of minimizing the evil effects of the 'Bill, and every honourable member who believes in preferential trade should heartily support it. If my reading of preferential trade be correct-namely, that the other fellow shall always give the preference to me-ther e need be no Act of Parliament, and every one may subscribe to the amendment. If the Prime Minister, who often talks about preferential trade, were to accept the amendment, he would be doing something more solid that he has ever done before to promote that cause. The Prime Minister, however, has never made any attempt beyond speechifying to give practical realization to his proposals. His idea has always been rather to increase duties against the foreigner, than to lower duties as against England; in fact, to practice another fraud on the public. Trade is carried on only because men gain by it, and yet it is contended that a number of laws are required to regulate trade. Before Federation, if any one had sent .£1:0,000 worth of goods from Victoria tjb the honourable member for Riverina, would he, staunch protectionist as he is, have declined them on the ground that they represented dumping? If tomorrow the honourable member were offered goods at half their value, would he insist on giving twice the price asked ?",70
621,Mr CHANTER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Le t the honourable member try me with a thousand sheep !,71
622,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am afraid the honourable member would regard such a proceeding, not as dumping, but as a friendly action. If I would not dump goods in' that way down at the door of the honourable member, whom I know, how much less likely are people of other nations, who do not know him, to do so.",71
623,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,How would the honourable member like cheap law in New South Wales ?,71
624,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have been, struggling in New South Wales for cheap law, and I - hope to do something to that end in this Parliament by supporting the appointment of a couple of additional Judges. Why cannot the Minister accept the amendment? The Attorney-General says that we may be asked to deal with the matter in another place. That, I suppose, would be after the election, and the talk would go on election after election. The Prime Minister, as a member of the Coalition Party, two or three years ago made a similar proposal, and asked that time should be set aside for its consideration. The honourable gentleman has been Prime Minister now for twelve months, and yet he is not one whit further advanced, and there is not much hope of anything in this direction for him. With all the time the Minister of Trade and Customs has had at his disposal, he is not able to find a case of a British manufacturer dumping goods in Australia. True, the honourable gentleman has said something about sewing machines, as if it would be a bad thing if the value of these articles were reduced throughout Australia.",71
625,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,How much are women paying for sewing machines now that they are free of duty ?,71
626,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am told that the cost of distribution is fairly heavy. Of course, if sewing machines are bought on time payment",71
627,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No , for cash.",71
628,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In some of the big stores of Melbourne and Sydney, sewing machines can be obtained at fairly reasonable prices. If the Dresent prices are too high, how much more injurious would be the effect if they were raised two-fold or three-fold ?",71
629,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable and learned member ought to know that the landed cost of sewing machines is not one-fifth of the price at which they are sold.,71
630,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member is, I think, making a mistake.",71
631,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I can give documentary evidence in proof of my statement.,71
632,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The prices of sewing machines vary very much. I have seen prices from 17s. 6d. to jQ].,71
633,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Sewin g machines landed at £ 2 are.sold at JCIO.,71
634,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is a very fine profit, and the honourable member ought to engage in the trade.",71
635,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is no answer.,71
636,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is an answer, because, if there is that profit, thousands would be glad to engage in the business.",71
637,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Reaper s and binders were in the same position.,71
638,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That was when there was a limited! supplv, and before it was certain whether those reapers and binders would take the market.",71
639,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That was the case for years after the reapers and binders got the market.,71
640,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But when competition came, how quickly the prices were brought down. If competition had been shut out, the prices would have been much higher today. If the power proposed be given to the Minister, it will rest entirely with him whether improvements shall be introduced. The treatment we receive from England is beneficial to England herself, because under her present policy, she has prospered more than any similar country in the world. That is all due to the spirit of freedom; and the nation which most freely trades with us, is the nation in regard to which we might deservedly make a favourable exception. If the Attorney-General. is correct that these clauses will not often be applied, there is all the more reason for accepting the amendment. On the other hand, if the clauses are meant to be largely applied, there is ground for exemption in favour of British manufacturers. We derive great benefit from the fact that the mantle of the British Empire is thrown over usi; but for that protection we could not have carried out some of our legislation in regard to aliens. It would ill become us to do anything that might cause that protection to be removed. Trade, of course, does not always follow the flag, because in these days men are learning to trade where it pays them best. We trad'e with England on that .ground, and to a large extent, the same principle animates England herself. Under the circumstances, it would ill become anv one who desires the preservation of the Empire to do anything to weaken the bond of union in the slightest degree.",72
641,Mr SOLMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Laanecoorie) [10.28] The honourable member for North Sydney made a somewhat impassioned appeal to us to recognise the generous treatment meted out to us, as citizens of the Empire, by the mother country. That is an appeal that will never be made in vain to me; I have always recognised the deep debt of gratitude we owe to the mother country. But I cannot see that on the present occasion there is any justification for .such an appeal on the part of the honourable member to anv one who, like myself, is truly patriotic.",72
642,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,N e w Zealand exempts British products.,72
643,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is an inconvenient interjection for the honourable member for Laanecoorie.,72
644,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I would rather not have any impertinent interjections. When the honourable member for North Sydney was speaking, I interjected because he was making statements which I thought very remarkable from one who is regarded, and correctly so, as a commercial authority. The honourable member desired to point out that certain products sent to England from Australia had a prejudicial effect on the British producer, in driving him out of his own home market. The honourable member gave several instances, and I challenged him on one, namely, the butter industry. We realise that Australia and other parts of the Empire have done a great deal in supplying the wants of British consumers in this particular article. But I do not think the honourable member for North Sydney was justified in his statement that the Australian butter-maker is thrusting the English butter-maker out of his home market. I have since consulted the last returns.",72
645,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What I said was that the returns showed that that was not entirely so.,72
646,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Accordin g to my recollection, the honourable member said at first ""wholly,"" and then ""almost."" On consulting the last return presented to both Houses of Parliament in the old country, I find that the quantity of butter sent from the British Possessions as a whole- I am dealing not only with Australian butter, because I take it that the matter really affects the whole of the Possessions of the mother country, and that it has a direct bearing on the ratio of the amount sent from European countries-wa s in 1901 631.985 cwt.; whilst the quantity sent from foreign countries was 3,070,905. In 1902the quantity sent from British Possessions was 525,035 cwt, and from foreign countries 3,449,898 cwt. In 1903 the quantity sent from British Possessions was 557,828^ cwt., and from foreign countries 3,502,866. In 1904 we were recovering from the drought years.",72
647,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The figures already quote'd included the drought years.,72
648,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am quoting the figures for the five years which were available .in the return which I have mentioned. I am not omitting any item which I believe would have any effect on the calculation.,72
649,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But the fact is that there were drought years.,73
650,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Reall y that argument does not affect the sum. The honourable member will see exactly where the difference comes in. In 1904 the importations of butter from British Possessions ran up to 1,045,758 cwt., and from foreign countries the imports fell to 3,195,207 cwt. There was an increase of imports from British Possessions, and a relative decrease of imports from foreign countries. In 1905 the imports from British Possessions totalled 1,054,209 cwt., and there was almost a relative diminution from foreign countries-3,093,65 7 cwt. It was not the British producer who was affected by this particular product being sent from Australia and other British Possessions to England, but the foreign producer--that foreign half-past producer for whom., I am rather sorry to o'clock. say, my honourable friends opposite seem to be solicitous on all occasions.",73
651,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.35] - apthat pears that there is not much chance of the debate on this amendment finishing toout. night. But I ask honourable members to allow us to come to a division early morrow. I understand from the honourable member for North Sydney, who has consulted with honourable members opposite, that an effort will be made to prevent vote on this clause being unduly deferred. Under these circumstances, I move that progress be reported. Progress reported. INTER-PARLIAMENTARY",73
652,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The House will remember that a short time since the Prime Minister intimated that he had' received telegram from the Inter-ParliamentaryUnion with reference to a meeting various Parliaments to take place in Britain shortly. I have today received by mail the formal invitation extended all members of the Commonwealth Parliament to take part in that gathering. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.,73
653,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [10.37] - I desire, leave, to move a motion with reference our sitting on Thursday next. Honourable members have received an invitation for Thursday afternoon. It will, of course, rest with them whether they accept it or not. Doubtless there will be sufficient honourable members to continue the business of the House on Thursday, but to provide against accident, I desire to move that the House shall sit at half-past seven as well as at the usual hour. The result will be that if through any misadventure we should lack a quorum at anytime on Thursday afternoon, Government business will come on as usual at half-past seven. Under the special circumstances, I hope that leave will be given to me to move that motion. Leave given. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the House, on Thursday next, sit at seven, as well as at half-past two",73
654,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does that mean that Thursday wil 1 count as two sitting days ?,73
655,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No . It simply mears Government business will be taken at xt the usual time if there has been no count,73
656,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,So that there will not to be five sittings in one week?,73
657,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Not in that case.,73
658,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Barrier) [10.39] - It a seems to me to be a pi£y that we cannot adjourn until half-past seven o'clock on Thursday. If it is determined that we shall sit at half-past two, it will prevent Mr Speaker, and, probably, the members of the Ministry, from going to Queenscliff to see the wireless telegraphyinaugurated. Mr Speaker and the offiUNION. cials will have to come here at half-past two o'clock instead of half-past seven.",73
659,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I will try tomorrow to a ascertain the wish of the House.,73
660,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am - interested in of some private business standing on the Great paper on Thursday, but I am prepared to give way in order to allow honourable to members to go to Queenscliff.",73
661,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Hindmarsh) [10.40] - The motion of the Prime Minister places some of us in an awkward position. On Thursday's business-paper there is a question' as to which, I should bylike to have something to say. If that to business is gone on with in my absence there may not be another opportunity open to me. While I should like to accept the invitation to go to Queenscliff on Thursday, I should not like to lose my chance to speak on the matter to which I refer. I think it would be better for the House to adjourn until half-past seven.",73
662,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I will make an effort to ascertain the wish of honourable members tomorrow. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. POSTAGE OF OPALS : MAIL CONTRACTOR'S REMUNERATION. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN ) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.,74
663,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Barrier) [10.41] - I desire to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General a matter relating to the postage of opals from Australia to America. I am informed by the Post and Telegraph Department that we cannot send opals through the post to a greater value than £ 1 0 . I have been informed by the opal buyers at White Cliffs that while they are unable to send opals from Australia to America by parcels' post to a greater value than £ 1 0 , they can send them to England to a much higher value. The people at White Cliffs are extremely anxious to develop in America as well as in Germany a trade in opals. I understand from what I am told, that they are hindered in that respect now. They are very anxious, however, that the American market should be open to them. I have alreadv made representations to the Post and Telegraph Department with reference to this matter, and I understand that the fault does not lie with Australia, but that it is a regulation of the American Postal Department that opals to a greater value than £ 1 0 cannot be sent there from Australia. I wish to know wheinquiry, ther the Postmaster-General is make representations to the American Government in order that opals may be sent through the parcels' post direct from Australia to America in the same wav as they can be sent via England to America?",74
664,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Edenpresentations Monaro - Postmaster-General) [10.44] The honourable member for Barrier was good enough to give me notice of tion, and I wish to say in answer to him that some months ago he brought the matter under the notice of the Department, and we have been endeavouring to bring about a better arrangement both in the interests of America and of ""Australia. At the present time we have a convention with the United States, which prevents parcels of a greater value than £ 1 0 being sent to that country. Owing to the representations of the honourable member, I discussed this and other matters with the representatives of the United States at the recent Postal Congress in Rome, and I believe that our conversation will help materially in arriving at better arrangements. A further effort will be made on our part to point out that this, and other matters, might be placed on a very much better footing. There appears to be a disposition on their part now to meet us, especially as it seems that it would result in benefit to both countries. I shall give every attention to the further representations of the honourable member, and place the facts he has submitted before the American Postal Department, with a view to seeing whether something cannot be done to meet his wishes, and to supply'a convenience, not only to his constituents, but also to many other persons in the Commonwealth who desire to send parcels of greater value to the United States.",74
665,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Corangamite) [10.46] I desire to bring a small matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General, and to correct a mistake which I made when speaking on the Supply Bill. I refer to the case of a man who has a contract for carrying mails to and from a post office in the Western District. He has to make four trips a day from the township to the station; in other words, he has to travel the distance at least eight times a day: and for this service he gets the munificent sum of 7s. 6d. per week. I think that the Postmaster-General might well institute an and see if something better cannot prepared to be done for the man.",74
666,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Othe r honourable members have cases of sweating to complain of.,74
667,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No doubt other honourable members know of cases which are equally bad, but this is a case in which re have already been made here, and I hope that it will be looked into by the Minister, to whom I shall be glad to his quesgive further details later on. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.47 P- m",74
