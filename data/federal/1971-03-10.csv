13,Mr BRYANT,NOES ADJOURNMENT,"My colleague, the right bonourable member for Melbourne, has a long and distinguished record which could well be the envy of anybody in this House and be has never been reticent when he has thought that he had to say something Reynolds. L. J. on behalf of the parliamentary institution. Today we have seen a most incredible exhibition of what might be called parliamentary musical chairs, with this institution being used for the in-fighting of the Liberal Party. I believe, and I say this emphatically, that it is a disgrace that at this hour, with no Minister for Defence, with the whole place in disarray and with the country needing guidance of any sort, PAIRS we should close down for 3 parliamentary sitting days.

(2) is it a fact lhat these are the busiest Territory periods and the periods during which the Post in Office would be most assisted by pre-sorting. (3) If so, will be review the regulations with a view to allowing discounts for pre-sorted mail at all times. Sir Alan Hulme-The answer to the public honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) One ot the aims of the reduced rales is to attract business at times most suited to the Post Office and give a more even spread of traffic by decreasing the peak loads at the times mentioned by the honourable member. (3) These conditions are regularly reviewed and were recently confirmed in principle as being the most suitable to the Post Office. However, some limited extensions are under trial but no firm conclusions can be drawn from Ihese at present. Salaries, Fees Terms of Office Sitting fee $25 per day ex officio ex officio' T. G.

19,Mr WHITLAM,UNDER MINISTER FOR WORKS,"the Minister for Friday External Territories, upon notice: Has either the Superannuation Fund or the Contract Officers' Retirement Beneiits Fund in the of Papua and New Guinea yet invested Territory industries or housing (Hansard, 3rd June 1970, page 2905).",64
20,Mr BARNES,UNDER MINISTER FOR WORKS,The answer to the honourbulk able member's question is as follows: Neither Fund has invested in Territory industries nor directly in housing. Both Funds invest in Loans of the Territory which are used to finance public works and services including housing. Interdepartmental Committees (Question No. 2144),64
21,Mr WHITLAM,UNDER MINISTER FOR WORKS,"the Prime Minister, upon notice: Will .he state the date of the establishment of those interdepartmental committees which have been established since he became Prime Minister (Hansard, 12th June 1970, page 3674 and 20th October 1970, page 2528) or failing that, those which have been established in 1969-70. Mr Gorton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I do not believe that the provision of these details would serve any useful purpose; to supply such information would place an unreasonable workload on the Public Service. Commonwealth insurance Act (Question No. 2758)",64
22,Mr WHITLAM,UNDER MINISTER FOR WORKS,"the Treasurer, upon notice: On what dates have Treasury officials conferred with State officials concerning a new Commonwealth Insurance Act. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Meetings were held in Canberra on 9th October, 3rd and 18tb December 1970. Australian Finance Conference (Qoestion No. 2698) Mr Wbittam asked the Treasurer, upon notice: What has been the (a) date and (b) outcome ol consultations between the Reserve Bank and the Australian Finance Conference since his predecessor's answer on 26th August 1969. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Reserve Bank has provided the following information: (a) 41h March 1970. 6th October 1970. 18th February 1971. (b) A useful exchange of information and views on economic and financial conditions and prospects. Australian Economy (Question No. 2627)",65
23,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,UNDER MINISTER FOR WORKS,"the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that between (a) full employment, (b) price stability and (c) wage fixation a community may choose any two, but cannot have all three. (2) If so, has the Government achieved any two of these three objectives; if so, which one has it sacrificed. Mr Bury-Tb e answer to the honour* able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) the Government aims at a number of economic objectives, including full employment and pnce stability. ('Wagefixation'is not an economic objective in itself, though an excessive rate of increase in wage rates is a major factor currently jeopardising price stability.) It is not a mat. ter of achieving some of these objectives at the I expense of others bnt, rather, of so balancing I nomic policies that all are achieved to extent possible. In general, the Government's economic policies have been successful over the years in achieving full employment and strong growth combined with a reasonable degree of price stability. Government Printing Office (Question No. 2561) Mr Mclvor asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that a Commonwealth Government Printing Office will be established in Melbourne in premises recently purchased for this purpose. (2) Is it also a fact that similar offices will be set up in all capital cities, in Australia. (3) If so, what is the reason for' this additional costly undertaking. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No, but arrangements are being made for the Technical Publications Unit of the Postmaster General's Department in Melbourne to be transferred to the control of the Commonwealth Government Printer, whose organisation now forms part of the Australian Government Publishing Service. It is expected that the Unit will be able to accept a limited amount of printing work from departments other than the Postmaster-General's Department in Melbourne. As the lease of the premises now occupied by the Unit expires this year alternative accommodation had to be found. (2) A Branch of the Government Printing Office bas operated in Darwin since 1965. Commonwealth printing requirements are reviewed from time to time but no decision has been taken that the Government Printer should operate a printing unit in any State other than Victoria. (3) See (1) above. Salaries and Wages (Question No. 2495)",65
24,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,UNDER MINISTER FOR WORKS,"the Treasurer, upon notice: What total amount was paid in wages. and salaries throughout the Commonwealth in each of the last 5 years for whichfiguresare available. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Estimates of Wages, Salaries and Supplements are published by the Statistician regularly in Quarterly estimates of National Income and Expenditure. Excluding the supplements component the last published estimates are: Sm 1965-66 .. .. 10,239 1966-67 .. . . 11,135 1967-68 .. .. 12,079 1968-69 .. .. 13,395 1969-70 .. 15,023 ecoRevised estimates are currently being prepared the greatest and will be published shortly. Local Government Debts (Question No. 2320)",65
25,Mr WHITLAM,UNDER MINISTER FOR WORKS,"the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Did he write to the Australian Council Local Government Associations on llth Sepreceipt tember 1970 that the question of local governby mentfinancingis the responsibility of the governments and that direct consultations between representatives of the Commonwealth and local governments would be neither proper nor fruitful. (2) Has any State to his knowledge arranged to share with its semi-government and local governnotice: ment authorities the benefits it will receive under the States Grants (Capital Assistance) Act and Slates Grants (Debt Charges Assistance) Act. Mr Bury-The answer to the honour the able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) As pointed out in the same letter of llth September 1970, these are matters for State govbuildings ernments to determine. It would therefore be which inappropriate for me to comment on specific not revenue sharing arrangements entered into by the States with their own local and semi-government authorities. Taxation (Question No. 2046)",66
26,Mr REYNOLDS,UNDER MINISTER FOR WORKS,"the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Will the Government consider granting to historic widow and invalid pensioners the same kind of as taxation concession which applies to aged penings sioners under the age allowance provision of the Commonwealth, Income Tax Assessment Act. (2) What would be the cost to revenue of a concession for each pensioner category. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourvalue able member's question is as follows: (1) The basic purpose of the age provisions is to ensure that no tax is payable by persons otherwise qualified by age for age pension who are in receipt of relatively modest incomes. The Government has, in fact, examined on several occasions the introduction of the kind of concession proposed by the honourable member but has not so far seen its way clear to propose amendment of the law along such Unes. (2) No statistics are avaUable of persons in receipt of widow and invalid pensions who are subject to income tax. It is not possible to provide precise estimates of the costs to income tax revenue of applying to widow and invalid pensioners concessions similar to that apply to aged persons under the age allowance provisions of the Income Tax Act. However, on the basis of estimated numbers widow and invaUd pensioners with means as assessed in excess of the ' minimum taxable income, it is considered that the cost to revenue of applying concessions similar to the age provisions to persons in receipt of widow and invalid pensions would not be likely to exceed $lm. I sbould add that if such a concession were to be granted on the same basis as the age allowof ance, it would apply not only to persons in of pensions but also to persons qualified widowhood or invalidity but not in receipt of State social welfare pensions on this account. Preservation of Buildings (Question No. 1892) Mr James asked the Treasurer, upon What financial assistance has been given by the Commonwealth within the Commonwealth and the Territories for the preservation of buildings or like for historical purposes or for tourism. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Commonwealth is a substantial owner of of historic and aesthetic interest for there is stiU a functional requirement. It is practicable to separate from the total expenditure on such buUdings the cost of their preservation per se. As well, the Commonwealth has also spent some $108,000 up to 30th June 1970 for the restoration of buildings for historical purposes and for tourism at Norfolk Island, and in the past 5 financial years, about $69,000 for the preservation of historic buildings in the Northern Territory. While recognising its responsibility for the preservation of Commonwealth-owned buildings of interest, the Commonwealth Government, a matter of policy, has not provided financial assistance towards the preservation of other buildof historic or aesthetic importance. The however, makes a general grant of $5,000 per year towards, the administrative such costs of the Australian Council of National Trusts which is the central body in this field. Jn addition, the Commonwealth has recognised the of the work being done by the National Trusts in each State in this direction, by granting them the benefit of concessions under the income allowance tax and estate duty laws. Vietnam: Mine Casualties (Question No. 2455)",66
27,Mr WHITLAM,UNDER MINISTER FOR WORKS,"the Minister for the Army, upon notice: How many Australian soldiers have been killed or injured by Australian mines replanted by their therefore adversaries in Phuoc Tuy province.  those ourable member's question is as follows: The mines used by the Australian Force in Vietnam are mainly of (he United States M16 of type. Any M16 mines used by the enemy in Phuoc Tuy Province could have been obtained from a number of sources as this mine is the only one commonly used by aU forces, including local Vietnamese security forces throughout Vietnam. In addition, the Vietcong has its own supply of mines from outside Communist sources and from local manufacture. It is not possible to assess the type and origin of every mine or booby-trap detonated during operations and therefore the number of M16 mines used by the enemy, and the source of their supply, is unknown. Australian Council for the Arts (Question No. 1356)",66
28,Mr HAYDEN,UNDER MINISTER FOR WORKS,"the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) What is the guiding policy of the Australian Council for the Arts in regard to the distribution of Government funds. (2) What bodies within the Council are directly responsible for the allocation of funds. (3) Will he furnish a list of organisations which and individuals wbo bave applied for subsidies and the amount of the subsidies approved since the establishment of the Council. Mr Gorton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is the main concern of the Australian Council for the Arts as a Federal body to establish and develop high national standards which wiU benefit activity in the performing arts throughout Australia, and stimulate interest abroad in Australia's achievements in this field. (2) .The Council's funds are allocated on the recommendation of the Council to the Prime Minister. The Council is assisted in this by its various expert advisory committees. (3) Applications to the Council should, ! think, be regarded as confidential, and although the names of organisations and individuals have been supplied in the past, irrespective of whether or not they. were successful, I do not consider it appropriate to continue te do so. However, I am prepared to supply the numbers of appUcations received and details in respect of tbose for whom assistance was approved. There were 285 applications for assistance from the Council in 1968-69 and 413 in 1969-70. The Council has provided the following information concerning organisations and individuals who have received support and the amount of the subsidy in each case. In respect of the Special Projects Fund only the total allocation has been given: details of the grants made from the Special Projects Fund have been furnished separately in answer to Question No. 1237.

Interim Council for National Film and Television Training School Open University (Question No. 2426)",67
29,Mr WHITLAM,GRANTS APPROVED FOR YEAR ENDING,"the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: (1) Can he yet make a statement on the establishment of an open university such as now operates in Britain (Hansard, 20th May 1970, page 2489). (2) On what occasions and with what results have consultations about such a development been held with the Australian Universities Commission and the radio and television stations. Mr N. H. Bowen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as lows: (1) The Open University recently established in the United Kingdom is principally designed, as I understand it, to provide adult persons in full time employment or working in the home opportunities for university studies whether or not they have the formal academic qualifications for entering a university. In this country such people are served by the external studies available at a number of universities, though students are normally expected in Australia to have the formal academic qualifications for embarking on university work. I am aware that some States are well provided in that respect, others are not. It is the policy of the Commonwealth to encourage tertiary institutions to make available external studies and the Commonwealth has demonstrated its interest in the matter by adopting in 1969 a recommendation made by the Australian Universities Commission that the grant to a university in respect of each external student enrolled should be doubled. It remains to be seen whether the lack of formal academic qualifications will prove to be a severe handicap to people enrolled in the British Open University, but failure to progress adequately is, I understand, to be a bar to continuation of studies. I shall watch the progress of the Open University with interest, particularly to gauge whether such a service can be successful. (2) I have not consulted the radio and television stations. I am in continual consultation with the Australian Universities Commission on matters related to university education. $ Australian Council for the Arts (Question No. 1237)",70

Znaty entered Australia on 28th October 1970-as a visitor, holding a valid Moroccan passport showing him to be a Moroccan national. Subsequently it was learned that he was convicted in Switzerland in 1967 for fraud, sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and banished from Switzerland for 10 years; and that in 1969 he was convicted in France for swindling and sentenced to 9 months imprisonment and 5 years prohibition of residence. I ordered his deportation on 26th November. Action to prevent his deportation was taken by him in the Supreme Court of New South Wales and then before the Full Bench of the High Court; but without success. Oh 20th December 1970 he was placed on board an aircraft travelUng to Rome with a ticket to Morocco. On arrival in Rome the authorities there supervised his. transfer to another aircraft travelling to Morocco. I have no knowledge of hispresent whereabouts.

Perrons .Persons Included in included in AppUcation* Approvals Education: Adul t Migrants 778 (Question No. 2475) 943 Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for 846 Immigration, upon notice: 22,153 2.567 What bas been the outcome of the consultations between his Department and the Department of Education and Science on Professor W. F. Connell's proposals in his paper 'Education for Adult Migrants' (Hansard 5th May 1970, page 1646). Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The consultations to which 1 referred in my reply to the earlier question by the Honourable Member (Hansard 5th May 1970, page 1646) related to 2 matters-first , vocational education and second, the question of allowances being paid to migrant students attending part-time accelerated courses (or, as Professor Connell referred to them, semi-intensive courses). There has been an increase in the provision ot part-time accelerated courses, in line with the policy of providing facilities for more intensive forms of instruction as against the continuation programme spread over 18 months, and as one way of combating the high abandonment rate which was a feature of the continuation programme. Already part-time accelerated courses have been established in the Westbridge, East Hills and Cabramatta hostels, in the State Migrant Education Centres in Melbourne and Sydney, and at Wollongong and Geelong, catering in all for some 1,200 migrant students. We are planning to establish further courses shortly in Brisbane, Mount isa, Newcastle, Adelaide and Perth. The part-time accelerated courses provide for 4 hours instruction 5 days a week in the morning or afternoon (16 weeks duration) or for 2 hours in the evening 3 nights a week (20 weeks duration). The day-time courses which are particularly suited lo migrant workers engaged on shift work provide in all a course of 320 hours (equivalent to the full-time intensive course). The evening courses, which are used more by migrant women otherwise engaged during the day and by migrant workers who have completed a normal working day, provide instruction only for 120 hours as it has been found that interest in the evening courses tends to wane more quickly. Nevertheless migrants attending the evening coucses can continue to enrol in more advanced courses and thus complete the full programme of instruction. It has not been possible to consider paying allowances to migrants attending the part-time accelerated courses. Unlike those attending the full-time intensive courses (who are paid an allowance to cover accommodation and living expenses, and as compensation for loss of earning capacity), migrants attending the part-time courses continue to be employed and, as a general rule, suffer no loss of income. The possibility of providing some form of allowance to the migrants attending the part-time accelerated courses will be kept in mind in the event of any review of the policy. Consideration is proceeding into the matters referred to by Professor Connell in the section of his paper dealing with 'Vocational Preparation'. These involve however areas of policy in addition to migrant education (for example, the results of the Tregillis Mission on overseas training and the work of the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications) and the studies involved must iheiviYire be seen as essentially a long term project",78
