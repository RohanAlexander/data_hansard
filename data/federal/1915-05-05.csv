PREFERENCE TO UNIONISTS .",4
1,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I ask th© Attorney General if he has observed that th© brokers of Australia have refused to work for th© Queensland Government with "" blackleg "" brokers, and I should like to know whether, in matters of this kind, in which the Commonwealth Government is concerned, Ministers will see' that the principle of preference to unionists is observed ?",4
2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"T h © scop© of Commonwealth power is not so wide as th© honourable member seems to imagine. lief. So far as I can gather, the subject to which the honourable member refers is industrial one, and our powers over such matters are most limited. It can hardly done. be suggested that anything has occurred which would j u s t if y the calling out of the military to suppress rioting by the brokers to whom he has referred. No doubt these gentlemen, as well as all others, when personal interests are affected, give effect to the principle in which we believe, that of preference to unionists.

Will the Postmaster-General-ye s or no-conside r the giving of relief to these men? They were prepared for variations, but what has happened has gone beyond their calculations.",4

6,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Is the Assistant M i nister of Defence in a position to reply to the question which I asked on Friday last, namely, whether th© Government will pay to Imperial Reserve officers domiciled in Australia the difference between the Imperial and Australian rates of pay, which is done in the case of Imperial Reserve men who are domiciled here?",4
7,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,The Minister is considering the matter.,5
8,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,The Assistant M in ister told us last week that the separation allowance to wives and widowed mothers would be increased from th© 1st May. At what date is ib intended to make the first payments at the increased rates?,5
9,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,On the 14th May.,5
10,Mr OZANNE,Unknown,"Is the Assistant M in - tended ? ister aware that complaints about the quality of th© food provided on the transports are very general, some men having said that it is not fit for pigs. It is also asserted that the number of life-boats provided is not sufficient to accommodate all the men carried. Will the Assistant Minister look into these complaints, and have the grievances remedied at once?",5
11,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The Department is paving Ithe shipping companies sums - vhich are quite sufficient to enable them to provide proper food for every soldier on board the In that respect we are making ample provision. As to the complaint that the number of life-boats carried is insufficient, I shall cause inquiries to be made; but I am confident that we are doing everything possible to insure that the men shall obtain good and wholesome food while on the transports.  Minister of Trad© and Customs whether any action has been taken to allow soldiers at the front to send small parcels of curios free of duty to their parents or friends in Australia.",5
12,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The matter was considered by th© Government two or three months ago. We communicated with Sir George Reid while he was in Egypt, and I understand that he then announced to th© troops that we had decided to allow each soldier to bring back or to send to friends in Australia £ 1 0 worth of goods, the duty paid on which would be refunded by the Government. We have no power to suspend any duty in this regard, but a record will be kept of the amounts so paid, and the Government will place on the Estimates a vote to provide for a refund.",5
13,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Is the Assistant Minister of Defence in a position to in form the House whether the Australian troops serving in the Dardanelles consist wholly of infantry , or whether the forces also comprise light-horse regiments?",5
14,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I am not in a position to give the information sought.,5
15,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"In view of the many messages of congratulation that we have received regarding the bravery of our troops in action in the Dardanelles, is the Assistant Minister of Defence in a position to tell the House with what result th© bravery of our men has been at",5
16,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I am not.,5
17,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"Havin g regard to the fact that a complete list of the casualties sustained by the New Zealand troops in the Dardanelles, with particulars of their injuries, has been published in Melbourne, I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Defence why we have not received, up to the present, even the names of the rank and file belonging to the Australian Forces who have been wounded, and why we have no particulars at all as to the character of the wounds suffered by those whose names have been transports. published ?",5
18,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,The reason is that the information has not been sent from the seat of war to the Minister of Defence.,5
19,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Is the Assistant M in ister of Defence in a position to give the House any particulars in relation tc? the death at Broadmeadows of a soldier named Dancocks, to which reference was made in the daily newspapers last week ?",5
20,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The honourable member questioned me about this inatter, and I promised to have it inquired into. It is true that the Argus recently made some serious comments regarding this case, and for the information of the House, and the public generally, I think it w©ll that I should read the following report which the Secretary of the Department has received from the Inspector-General, Colonel LeggeIn accordance with the Minister's instructions, I inquired today into the complaint made by Miss Dancocks as to her brother's treatment. I do not consider that her brother, the late Private Dancocks, suffered from any neglect at the hands of the A.M.C. at Broadmeadows. Major Maguire, A.M.C, was examined by me, and I ascertained from him that with reference to Miss Dancocks' statement that the patients were attended by untrained nurses, that the attendants in hospitals in Broadmeadows Camp, although not actually trained in hospitals, but undergoing training there, are fully qualified for medical duties under medical direction. As regards the statement that the patient was unwashed, this is quite correct at the time. The patient, however, was washed regularly. He was unshaven, and, of course, suffering from a severe illness, appeared to be neglected. It is not usual, however, to shave patients whilst subject to fever. As regards nourishment, the patient was getting the full diet that was ordered by the medical officers, and the necessary comforts were available nnd issued. As regards the attendance of medical omcers, the patient was seen at least six times in twenty-four hours, and from the 6th April one medical officer was detailed to attend to hiin only. As regards the statement that patients were attended by students, all were fully qualified, and men in private practice. It is true that permission was refused to allow the patient to go to Miss Duff's house. The medical officer considered he was not in a fit state to travel. There is no place in Melbourne to which he could have been taken at any stage of his disease. The public hospitals will not receive measles cases. For this reason a separate enclosure has been provided at the new base hospital nt Broadmeadows, which is not yet in actual work. The patient was moved into one of these buildings, which is of galvanized iron, in order to satisfy his relatives, but he would Imve done just as well remaining in the tent. For such cases, tents are as good us any hospital. The alleged statement of a person described ap a trained nurse that nothing had been done for him is incorrect. His heart was strong, and it wns this that kept him alive so long, but it was the disease in his lungs which killed him. Female nurses are not considered necessary in the Broadmeadows Camp. During the last fifty days there have been over 200 cases sent to hospitals in the camp, and only two deaths, notwithstanding the fact that the percentage of deaths in pneumonia cases is, under ordinary circumstances, very high. The camp adjutant stated that LieutenantColonel Hardy, who was the senior medical officer in camp, came up personally and telephoned to Casterton that he was himself taking a personal interest in the case. The patient was only admitted to hospital on the 2Sth March. It was, therefore, not correct for his sister to state that he laid battling for life for fourteen days, but had only been in hospital for five days when the message wns sent. Captain Bond, 6th Field Ambulance, states Captain Fogarty was in charge of the measles cases. Dancocks received the usual treatment for measles nnd broncho-pneumonia. On his admission he was very ill. He kept on changing his condition, with rising and falling temperature, probably with septic pneumonia. The patient had been ordered to attend sick parade on the 28th, but absented himself. He came along to the hospital later. I was detailed to attend him from the Gth April. He was clean when I saw him, and had certainly not been unattended for a fortnight. He was, of course, unshaved. Captain Fogarty told me that he had been sponged. . . . The report goes on to say that there was no neglect shown, and that everything possible was done for Private Dancocks.",5
21,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Will the Assistant M in ister of Defence send a communication to the authorities representing the Commonwealth Government at the Dardanelles, and ascertain as quickly as possible the true facts relating to the men who have fallen in action ?",6
22,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,The Minister of Defence is doing everything possible. As the news comes through he is only too willing to give it to the public after he has given it to the nearest relatives of those who have suffered. One can only assumeOthat everything is being done at the front in order to supply information to the Australian people as quickly as possible.,6
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is the Postmaster-General aware of the disability connected with the cheap week-end cables allowed to our troops, in that cables arriving on Sunday are not allowed to be made public, or even to reach their destination, until Monday morning? Can he see his way clear to modify the rule so that at least intimations of casualties coming from the Dardanelles and elsewhere may reach their destinations before Monday morning ?",6
24,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,We have not complete control of the cables.,6
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is your office that imposes this restriction.,6
26,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"If I find that we do control the matter, I shall see that during the present crisis the facilities desired are given.  Minister say whether the Light Horse regiments are at the Dardanelles?",6
27,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I cannot answer that question.,6
28,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Is it a fact that persons who submit themselves in country districts to medical officers who are authorized and empowered to examine applicants for military service, have to resubmit themselves for medical examination in the metropolis; that they are liable to rejection after having been passed in the country, and thus are subjected to a great deal of hardship ?",6
29,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I believe that that is the case. SHORTAGE OF SUGAR CROP.,6
30,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Is the Minister of Trade and Customs aware that owing to the spread of the "" little drought "" in the ooastal areas there will be a shortage of something like 70,000 tons in the sugar crop this season ? Further, in view of the fact that the Necessary Commodities Commissions in Victoria and New South Wales have refused to allow the price of sugar to go beyond £22 10s. per ton, and that it will be necessary very shortly to import sugar, I desire to ask what action the Government propose to take in regard to the duty on this commodity?",7
31,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The Government do not propose to alter the rate of duty^as was suggested prior to their consideration of the question. WOODLARK ISLAND : SICKNESS AMONGST EMPLOYES.,7
32,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Will the Postmaster-General inform the House whether the complaints that have been made in reference to sickness and other matters at Woodlark Island have been attended to?,7
33,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The whole matter has been considered. Having regard to the fact that a good deal of sickness in the shape of malaria has taken place among the employees, I have made complete provision for the payment of wages at local rates, which are much higher than those which the contractor was asked to pay. I have also provided for the payment of these higher rates as from the beginning of operations. NA",7
34,Mr FOWLER,POSTAL EMPLOYESANDTHE,"I wish to ask the postmaster-General whether it is correct, as reported, that he has refused permission to a member of the Postal Department to join the Expeditionary Forces on the ground that his services, although he is receiving only something like £100 per annum, are indispensable? Is it - correct, as reported, that the honourable gentleman stated that if there were an urgent demand for men other arrangements might be made ?",7
35,Mr SPENCE,POSTAL EMPLOYESANDTHE,"The case referred to is a very old one. Of postal employees engaged practically within the metropolitan area in this State, 116 officials have gone to' the front , and in view of this some objections were raised to leave of absence being granted to the particular officer, aboub whom the press has been making some fuss. This clerk is employed in a rather important branch of the Department, from which five clerks had already enlisted, and the officer in charge reported against his going away on the ground that his place could not be immediately filled. But there is no objection to postal employees generally volunteering for active service. INTERNMENT CAMPS.",7
36,Mr KELLY,POSTAL EMPLOYESANDTHE,"Is the Assistant M in ister of Defence in a position to make any statement with reference to the location and capacity of, and numbers in , enemy concentration camps in Australia ?",7
37,Mr JENSEN,POSTAL EMPLOYESANDTHE,"I have had the information compiled, and I shall be glad to show it to any honourable member p r i vately. It is not for publication. SYDNEY WATER SUPPLY GUARD .",7
38,Mr BRUCESMITH,POSTAL EMPLOYESANDTHE,"Is it correct, as stated in the Sydney press, that the Federal Government, while claiming the right to pass troops over State railways free of charge, are submitting a financial claim for guarding the waterworks of Sydney ?",7
39,Mr JENSEN,POSTAL EMPLOYESANDTHE,"I am not aware of it , but I shall ascertain particulars for the honourable member. EXPORT OF BUTTE R.",7
40,Mr MCGRATH,POSTAL EMPLOYESANDTHE,"Has the Minister of Trade and Customs noticed the recent in crease in the price of butter; and also WAR. that in Brisbane recently the quantity of butter stored was 500,000 lbs., which quantity was increased a week later to 600,000 lbs. ? In view of this fact, has the Minister any intention of prohibiting the export of butter ?",7
41,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL EMPLOYESANDTHE,"I understand that there is no butter being exported from Ausalso tralia. In fact, there has been none exported for the last three weeks, and prices are higher in Australia than anywhere else. As to what may be done in any particular State, the honourable member knows that the States have complete power to do what they like ; and, unfortunately, the Commonwealth Government cannot intervene, even although the quantity of butter stated was being held up. FLINDERS NAVAL BASE.",7
42,Mr WATT,POSTAL EMPLOYESANDTHE,Is it a fact that alien onernies are still employed on the Naval Base at Westernport?,8
43,Mr JENSEN,POSTAL EMPLOYESANDTHE,Not to my knowledge.,8
44,Mr WATT,POSTAL EMPLOYESANDTHE,Will the Assistant M i nister inquire into the matter ?,8
45,Mr JENSEN,POSTAL EMPLOYESANDTHE,Yes . NA,8
46,Mr SINCLAIR,ENOGGERA CAMPBREAD,Is there any t r u in the rumour that in order to grant ference to unionists the Government are paying £ 5 8s. per ton more for bread at wireless. the Enoggera camp than they need do; and is the Assistant Minister of Defence prepared to lay on the table of the Housa the papers connected with the Enoggera camp bread contract?,8
47,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CAMPBREAD,I have no knowledge of the matter; but if the honourable memexpedition ? ber will place his question on the notice paper it will receive attention. DAYLIG HT SAVING.,8
48,Mr RODGERS,ENOGGERA CAMPBREAD,"I notice that the to this Leader of the House, who, also, is the leader of the Labour movement in Auswireless tralia, has gone to Sydney to confer w the Premiers of the States on one subject, vour? among others, namely, daylight saving. In view of the Labour agitation for a hours day, can the Attorney-General say in my mind, but I do not think so. iiow the Government propose to allot the hours of daylight saved?",8
49,Mr HUGHES,ENOGGERA CAMPBREAD,That is a question which I think the honourable member may refer to my distinguished leader on his return. PRICES OF SUGAR.,8
50,Dr MALONEY,ENOGGERA CAMPBREAD,"May I ask the M i nister of Trade and Customs if he will obtain, for the information of the House, a record of the prices paid for sugar in New Zealand compared with tralia, and also a statement as to the duties charged in New Zealand and Australia, so that members may undersult stand what a huge profit is being made the Colonial Sugar Refining Company?",8
51,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CAMPBREAD,"I will endeavour tain the information, and will make available for the House. LOSS OF THE ENDEAVOUR. Mr BRU CE SMITH - Has the M in ister of Trade and Customs observed in the report regarding the loss of the Endeavour that no inquiry seems to have been made as to why the Government had not caused wireless apparatus to be put into the vessel, although other shipowners are required to provide a wireless installation ?",8
52,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CAMPBREAD,"The honourable member SUPPL Y. is as well informed in navigation matters as any other honourable member, and he t h knows perfectly well that no Government prein the world compels any vessel of the size of the Endeavour to be fitted with",8
53,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ENOGGERA CAMPBREAD,"Althoug h the matter has been wholly omitted from the scope of the inquiry, is it not the fact that those in charge of the Endeavour asked for a wireless apparatus to be in stalled before they started on their ocean",8
54,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CAMPBREAD,"So far as I know, they never made any such request.",8
55,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENOGGERA CAMPBREAD,Is it a fact that in the new Navigation Bill to be submitted Chamber the Minister proposes to make provision for compelling apparatus'to be fitted upon vesi t h sels very much smaller than the Endea,8
56,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CAMPBREAD,"I cannot carry the prosixvisions of the proposed Navigation Act I think there is a l i m it to the number of passengers a vessel may carry without the wireless installation being fitted, but I do not think there is any reference to tonnage. The Endeavour really carried only one passenger. I agree, of course, with the honourable member that, as far as possible, every vessel should be fitted with wireless apparatus. NA GERMANS.",8
57,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF NATURALIZE D,"Is the Attorney-GeneAusral aware of the kind of treatment that is being meted out to certain naturalized Germans and their dependents, as the reof which a number of men have been by practically debarred from earning a livelihood for themselves and their families? to obCan the Government do anything to it maintain these people in the same way that interned Germans are maintained?",8
58,Mr HUGHES,TREATMENT OF NATURALIZE D,"I am aware that in certain cases naturalized Germans have been debarred from earning their livelihood, and I believe that in some cases these men aro married to British subjects. I have no doubt, also, that in some cases the effect of this prohibition has been to place both the man and his wife and family in very unfortunate circumstances; but, although one feels in such a case that action of some sort ought to be taken, it is very difficult to decide what action is proper in the circumstances. I can only say that I will bring the matter before the Government as such, with a view to seeing how far it is possible to proceed by way of assisting the families of those persons who are, by some act on the part of their fellow workmen-it is, I presume, to such action that the honourable member refers",9
59,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF NATURALIZE D,To a large extent that is so.,9
60,Mr HUGHES,TREATMENT OF NATURALIZE D,I will bring the matter before the Government to see what can be done.,9
61,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT OF NATURALIZE D,Will make some provision for Australians who are prevented by the same people from earning their living? VACCINATION OF TROOPS.,9
62,Mr MCGRATH,TREATMENT OF NATURALIZE D,I have received a letter from one of my constituents who is opposed to vaccination. He wants to know if the high death-rate amongst the troops in Egypt is due to vaccination. Has the Assistant Minister any information on the point?,9
63,Mr JENSEN,TREATMENT OF NATURALIZE D,"I will endeavour to get the information for the honourable member. ELECTOR AL ROLL S. Sir JOHN FORREST asked the M in ister of Home Affairs, upon noticeWill he give instructions to the Divisional Returning Omcers throughout the Commonwealth to issue quarterly a list of all persons struck off the electoral lists of each subdivision, as well as of all names added to such lists, thereby enabling the public to know the state of the Electoral Bolls at the end of each quarter ?",9
64,Mr ARCHIBALD,TREATMENT OF NATURALIZE D,"The heavy expenditure involved is not at present considered justifiable in view of the fact that a notice is issued to every person whose name is removed from the f o i l , and that an acknowledgment is sent to every person at the time of his enrolment. The matter will , however, receive further consideration in connection with the movement now in progress for co-operation in the preparation, maintenance, and printing of joint Commonwealth and State electoral rolls.

90,Sir JOHN FORREST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Will the CommitComtee be able to look into matters of the past as well as of the future?,11
91,Mr TUDOR,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I presume the Committee will be able to ascertain what the buildings have cost up to the present time, and to consider whether the site Prime chosen was the best obtainable, and whether it is advisable to extend the facand I tory at that point.",11
92,Sir JOHN FORREST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,What matter would the Committee not be allowed to,11
93,Mr TUDOR,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Accordin g to the Act rethe Committee may inquire into praceverything in connection with this work, and when the Committee reports, it devolve on the Government to take action in Parliament. As the estimated involved is more than £20,000, it is obligatory to refer the work to the Committee, and, in order to expedite the reand ference, the Prime Minister has brought the matter forward in this form. Mr JENSEN/ (Bass-Assistant Minister) [3.49] - I have been in communicawith the Minister of Defence regardthis proposal, which has also been deunder the consideration of Cabinet. The Government considered this project so important as to justify inquiry by the Works Committee as to whether, an extension of the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow should made, or whether another factory should be established in some other portion of Australia. I suppose that during; the inquiry the Committee will have latitndc to do much more than is involved by the bare terms of the motion. Their in quiry will not be confined to the buildings and plant, but may touch every phase of the question. The Government thought it desirable to obtain a report from the Public Works Committee before extending the existing establishment. It may be that the Public Works Committee will not recommend the extension of ' the present factory, but that it should be established in Federal Territory, or somewhere else in Australia. At any rate, honourable members will have the benefit of any information on the subject that the Committee can obtain; and the Government think that, at the present juncture, the motion represents the proper step to be taken.",11
94,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Edenfinitely. Monaro) [3.51] - What I desire to know is. what, the motion really means. What the motion proposes shall be referred to the Public Works Committee is the conments sideration of the "" Small Arms Pactory, Lithgow : Extension of buildings, plant, &c""; and now the Assistant ter tells us, after having had some conversation with the Minister of the matter. Defence, that he supposes the motion since last to mean that the Committee are to inquire, not only as to the extension or otherwise of the factory at Lithgow, but as to whether it might not be adgestion visable to erect it at Canberra, or some other place. We ought to have something more than a mere supposition put before us, or we should add words extending the scope of the inquiry to cover Canberra any other place in Australia. In my stances. opinion, Lithgow is not the proper place ior an extension of this factory, although, of course, it is fortunate that there is establishment there with many facilities for the manufacture of the necessary modities. In any case, I do not think we quire. ought to have all our ""eggs in one realise basket.""",12
95,Mr JENSEN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,It will be within jurisdiction of the Committee to recommend that the factory be placed anythere where. ' Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Then why the Cook Government. not amend the motion so that it may in conformity with that idea ?,12
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I thin k the able member was a member of the Gowealth, vernment which decided that the factory should be at Lithgow.",12
97,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"That only shows that, unlike the honourable member, I am not parochial. At that time, I thought Lithgow a very good place for the purpose; but it will be remembered that, supported by a good many other honourable members, I very strongly protested that all Commonwealth factories should be situated on Federal soil, other things being equal. It is claimed that the Government are pushing on vigorously with the preparation of the Capital Site; and I see no reason why this and similar factories should not be situated there. Will the Minister say definitely that this motion leaves it open to the Committee to recommend Canberra, or any other place, as the site ?",12
98,Mr JENSEN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Yes ; I do say so de,12
99,Mr KELLY,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Wentworth) [3.54] - I take it that this request for £100,000 is really the outcome of the special requirebrought about by the war situation.",12
100,Mr JENSEN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That is so.,12
101,Mr KELLY,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"If that be so, my only Miniscomment is that we have been extraordinarily slow in dealing with We have been at war August, and it surely shows some slackness when we find the Governmenb, some eight or nine months afterwards, coming forward with a sugto extend the factory to meet the abnormal position. I might be permitted to express disappointment, which I think will be shared by honourable members generally, at the slackness of whoever is reor sponsible under the pressing circumDuring the Boer war it was found possible to manufacture a very efficient field gun in Kimberley during the an siege; but we in Australia have been content to sit down and wring our hands at comour inability to manufacture what we reThe Minister of Defence must that the delay does not reflect any credit on the Department, and is hardly the worthy of the people of Australia.",12

As showing the insincerity of the late Government in respect to the war, I may point out that, during their term of office, they endeavoured to block operations at Cockatoo Island",12
103,Mr SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The honourable member must confine himself to the matter before the Chair.,13
104,Mr WEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I can hardly think that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is really serious in his suggestion that this factory should be transferred to Canberra. My own opinion is' that the inquiry of the Public Works Committee should be confined to the extension of the present premises at Lithgow, with a view to an augmented production of war materiel. It would be most unwise, in my opinion, to give the Public Works Committee a roving commission, in view of the urgency of the situation; and I can only think that the honourable member for Eden Monaro is merely trying to liven up a somewhat dull House. The motion ought to be passed at once, so that the proposed extension may be inquired into and carried out as rapidly as possible.",13
105,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Franklin) [3.59]. - I am very glad that the motion has been submitted in its present shape. Last session, in answer to a question, I elicited a reply that the rifles which were being turned out at the Lithgow factory had cost something like £100 each.",13
106,Mr SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The honourable member must not go into that question.,13
107,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"May I say that it was then pointed out that the comparison was unfair, seeing that we were also informed that a huge plant had been put up suflicient to turn our rifles for Australia for many years to come. We now find, however, that, at the first stress, it is necessary to practically rebuild, or, at all events, to greatly extend the factory. One of the many good services that will doubtless be rendered by the Public Works Committee will be that of eliciting facts connected with our Defence Department - facts which hitherto honourable members have been unable to ascertain, no matter what Government has been in office. I trust that the Committee will be able to determine exactly what this Small Arms Factory is costing. Last year information was adduced which showed clearly that the cost of manufacturing rifles at Lithgow panned out at more than £100 each, notwithstanding that equally good weapons could be imported for about £3 each. The provision in our law which requires the reference to our Public Works Committee of all works involving any considerable expenditure is, in my judgment, an admirable one. Had such a system been in operation years ago, it would have saved the Commonwealth millions of pounds. Indeed, it will effect a saving of millions of pounds in the future. In my judgment, the Committee may be trusted to conduct an exhaustive inquiry into this matter. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has raised the very important question of whether Lithgow is a suitable site for the Small Arms Factory. In my opinion, there is much to be said in favour of establishing all national works in Federal territory. Other things being equal, I believe that it would be better to so establish all national factories, thus assisting to attract population to that territory.",13
108,Mr CARR,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Macquarie) [4.3] - As this proposal is one that vitally concerns an industrial centre of my electorate, I feel that I ought to say a word or two upon it, and particularly upon the suggestion of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that national works should not be confined to one locality. I take it that his suggestion is merely one of his characteristic serio-comic efforts which we may dismiss from our consideration.",13
109,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The honourable member ought to be a good judge of that sort of thing. He often indulges in it here.,13
110,Mr CARR,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The honourable member need not get excited. This question was thoroughly threshed out before the Small Arms Factory was established at Lithgow.,13
111,Mr SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I ask the honourable member not to enter into an argument regarding the establishment of works there. The proposal before us is one to refer a certain work to the Public Works Committee.,13
112,Mr CARR,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I was under the impression that, in view of the proposed extension of the Small Arms Factory, the question of where it should be established naturally arose. If it does not, I merely wish to say that, situated as it is, behind the natural ramparts of the Blue Mountains, with deposits of iron, coal, and shale in close proximity,'no better site could be desired. We all recognise the necessity which exists for getting a move on in regard to our supply of armaments. There are facts connected with this matter which, in view of existing conditions, it would not he wise to discuss here. But I heartily welcome any suggestion which would have the effect of facilitating the manufacture of armaments. I do not think that it becomes honourable members to raise the slightest question upon this proposal. If the Government undertook the extension of the factory of their own volition, and without referring the matter to the Public ""Works Committee, their action would be abundantly justified. I object to the delay which will be involved in the procedure which is now proposed.",13
113,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,We have waited for months - surely we can wait a few weeks longer.,14
114,Mr CARR,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Eve n a day or two in the arrival of armaments at the front may mean all the difference between the loss and the saving of valuable lives. This is not a proposal which should be discussed. It should be agreed to without debate.,14
115,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Parkes) [4.6] I understand from your ruling, sir, that under this proposal honourable members are not at liberty to discuss the broader question of where the Small Arms Pacthe tory ought to be established. I am concerned with whether we have only institution of this kind in the Commonbers wealth, or whether every honourable memtunity ber has a small arms factory in his constituency. That seems to be the of some honourable members. The motion sion on a motion of this character. affords me a convenient peg upon which cannot allow it . to hang a question of great interest to the public. I listened attentively to observations of the Assistant Minister Defence, who did not tell us whether the money. adoption of this motion will have th© effect of increasing the supply of rifles that are available for use in the Commonwealth. Apropos of quite ber of questions which have been p u him from both sides of the House, I wish to point out that rifle clubs have been established all over the country, and that Arms Pactory. their great need at the present time sufficient supply of rifles. If this posal be adopted, can the Assistant ister hold out any hope that a greater supply of these weapons will be forthcomvernment ing to rifle clubs, so that in future institutions may not die of inanition ?",14
116,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"And ranges, too.",14
117,Mr SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Order ! I must ask the honourable member not to discuss details.,14
118,Mr BRUC ESMITH,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I do not intend to do so. All I desire to know is' whether the Government propose to continue their support of these clubs without providing them with the means for continuing their existence.,14
119,Mr SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Order ! The honourable member must uot go into that matter. Mr BRU CE SMITH - Can the Assistant Minister of Defence hold out to these clubs any hope that they will be granted a larger supply of rifles in the near future ?,14
120,Mr SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I would point out that the honourable member is discussing a question which is entirely foreign to this motion. If I permit him to do that, I cannot reasonably decline to allow other honourable members a similar degree of latitude.",14
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,It relates to the motion.,14
122,Mr SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Las t year Parliament enacted legislation which provides that all works involving an expenditure in excess of £20,000 shall be referred to Public Works Committee for in not quiry.

124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am afraid, a numsir, that you miss my point. We are t to asked to refer to the Public Works Committee, for inquiry, a proposal to duplicate the rifle plant at the Lithgow Small In New South Wales, is a where an analogous body has been in proexistence for twenty-five years, th© rula M i ninvariably followed in connection .with similar undertakings has been for the Goto submit a detailed proposal these to the House, including plans, specifications, & c , so that honourable members might be seized of the desirablenessor otherwise of assenting to it . The Prime Minister, on Priday last, presented estimates of cost running up to £100,000, and there is a detailed plan submitted showing exactly what is to he done. This surely is for the purpose of inquiry at this stage as to whether the House would be. justified in incurring any further expenditure of the kind, or whether it would be better to spend the money in some otlier way ; otherwise, why make provision for, at this stage, dealing with such matters?",14
125,Mr SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am in somewhat of a difficulty in dealing with the matter, as this is the first time the question has been raised. I take it that the House is prepared to create its own procedure, and, until the House otherwise orders, I am not prepared, in dealing with such a motion, to permit a general discussion enabling honourable members to roam over the whole of the activities of the Defence Department. I am unable to say what is covered by the papers which have been submitted in connection with the motion. It is no part of my duty to go through 3uch papers to enable me to decide whether matters to which honourable members would like to refer are relevant to what is contained in them. If on such a. motion I am to allow a general discussion upon matters controlled by the Defence Department, I shall do so only by direction of the House.",15
126,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That is not proposed.,15
127,Mr SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"On e honourable member commenced a discussion about the manufacture of rifles, and. the honourable member for Parkes touched upon that in cidentally, and upon the question of the supply of rifles to members of rifle clubs. Every honourable member of the House is deeply interested in the promotion of rifle clubs, but that has nothing whatever to do with the motion now before the House. Other side issues might be in - factory. troduced in the same way, and I believe I am, in the circumstances, compelled to ask honourable members to confine their remarks to the necessity or otherwise of submitting those works proposals to the Public Works Committee. The Committee, after inquiry, will bring up a report, and in dealing with that report an opportunity will be given for a full discussion of all matters referred to in it . Mr JOSE PH COOK - I do not think, sir, that you are far off the mark in your last statement. I remind honourable members that the Public Works Committee is a Committee of the House, and, therefore, the Government are submitting this proposal to the House. The House, in turn, if the motion is carried, will submit the proposal to the Committee. Clearly, before the House is able to do so intelligently, honourable members must be given an opportunity to understand the proposal by the process of discussion. I take it , therefore, that anything is relevant to the motion which is contained in the papers presented by Ministers.",15
128,Mr SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That is a very difficult matter for me to follow.,15
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"It is, and I think the only thing to do is to follow the excellent precedents which have already been laid down, under similar Acts, in two or three of the State Parliaments, and followed successfully for a quarter of a century. An important question confronts U3 at the outset . in considering tihis motion. According to reports submitted a little while ago in connection with the Small Arms Factory, the Commonwealth has. already incurred responsibility for an expenditure of £300,000 upon it . Here we have a proposal to add, at least, another £100,000 to that expenditure. That is the official estimate by Mr . W r i g ht of the cost of the proposed extension of the factory. Mr MCWrLLiAais - How many rifles have been turned out by the factory?",15
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I know, but at this particular time. I do not think that such a matter should be discussed here. I shall only add that I , for one, am profoundly disappointed with the results to date of the Small Arms Factory at L it h gow. One thing which disappoints me bitterly is the fact that at the present time one shift only is being worked at the That information is public property.",15
131,Mr WEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,This is a motion for referrin g these works to the Public Works Committee.,15
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am talking about the capacity of the existing plant, and if the honourable member does not understand the matter, let him hold his tongue. He is blundering in as usual. While Lord Kitchener, at the other end of the world, is exhorting people to work during week ends, and at all times, our Small Arms Factory at Lithgow works but one shift per day, and closes its gates religiously from noon every Saturday until the following Monday morning. No man in these times can be perfectly satisfied with such a condition of things as that. There may he reasons for it, but if there are we are not permitted to know them. ""We can only form a judgment as outsiders, and I say that in war time, when rifles are of the very essence of our preparations for war, this is not to me a satisfactory reflection. It is about five years since it was decided to erect the factory. It is, I think, four years since the machinery arrived here, and the plant has been completed for three years. Large additions have already been made to the original plant, and one cannot but express disappointment at the poor results achieved up to date. Here we have a proposal to practically duplicate the existing plant at a cost of an additional £100,000. If it were not war time. I should ask some very plain and pertinent questions regarding the use which is being made of the plant we already have. I am not sure that I ought, not to ask them even now. The Minister has said that after inquiry he is satisfied that the best is being done at Lithgow.",15
133,Mr JENSEN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The Minister of Defence recently visited the factory with a view of seeing whether it would not be possible' to increase the output.,16
134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am disposed to think that the best is not being done. The fact may be mentioned that once the machinery is erected there is nothing very difficult about the work of a Small Arms Factory. That was brought out very clearly in connection with one of the disputes which came up for arbitration at the Lithgow Factory. I may say that if ever there was a place where there has been a crop of little troubles to settle the Lithgow Small Arms Factory is such a place. Whatever else State Socialism does for us it does not prevent industrial troubles. In connection with one of these troubles the question arose as to what should be an engineer's work. It was asserted very distinctly at the time by the manager of the factory that it was not difficult for any man to learn the work of sharpening the tools required to be used, which, it waa stated, was largely the work to be done on the engineering side. In the circumstances, why it is not possible, after three years, to work a couple of shifts at this factory, where no greattechnical skill is required, I do not know.",16
135,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The technical skill required in some branches is great.,16
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"In some it is; but for those branches the Government have the engineers' associations of the whole of Australia to draw upon. It is only the other technical branches that are to be learnt on the spot. Sharpening and setting tools is the main thing that is novel or new up there; and I remember that the manager was emphatic that that should not take a man very long to learn. Yet, for some reason or other, after three years' experimentation at the factory, we are able to work only one shift, and close the gates at noon oh Saturday. In the absence of any other reason that I know of, this state of affairs strikes me as not satisfactory, to say the least of it. Here is a proposition that, so far as we know-and this is the answer to the°honourable member for Nepean-wil l make no impression whatever on the war. Mr. Wright's own estimate is that it will take from twelve to eighteen months to erect the new plant - There is the preliminary inquiry; there are all the details of ordering the plant, which has to come ove» the sea and be put into working order.",16
137,Mr GREENE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The other took a good deal longer.,16
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Severa l years. But this is only the addition of another section to fit into the old plan; yet Mr. Wright says it will take from twelve to eighteen months, and cost £100,000. I am not so sure that in the circumstances there is all the urgency that has been alleged. I hope the war is not going to last another eighteen months. Altogether, I feel that the matter is going very properly to a committee of inquiry, who, if they do their duty, will view the whole plant, and review the totality of its functions from the time it was first attempted.",16
139,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,They will be able to get information that no Minister has been able to get.,16
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am inclined to think that that is so. I do not see how else they are to make their inquirj thorough, and inform the House intelligently of the result. I am glad the Government are sending the matter to an inquiry in this particular way, and hope that when the Committee have made it they will he able to inform the House on all the points raised so pertinaciously by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and on many others besides. I observe that the final minute on the subject by Senator Pearce is dated 1st April. I hope it is a wise and intelligent proposition. understand that the site is safe and secure, and adjacent to many natural advantages. Eveu there I am not quite sure that all expectations have been realized. One of the strong reasons for putting the site at Lithgow was that we should be able to manufacture our own steel suitable for rifle-making, but I have uot heard that any steel of the kind has been manufactured at the local works, nor, so far as I can ascertain, is it likely to be for some time to come. There is not sufficient demand here to compensate the proprietors of steel works for making the particular kind of steel required. It is too late to attempt to uproot the plant; it is there, and the duty is laid on this or any other Government that may happen to be in power to make whatever additions are necessary to equip it and make it an up-to-date rifle-producing factory that will enable Australia to be self-supporting in every respect relating to preparation for war. I shall raise no objection to the motion, and congratulate the Government on sending the question on for full and complete inquiry, which I hope will result in a full and intelligent report to the House, giving us an infinitely better understanding of the works at Lithgow, and perhaps a greater degree of satisfaction with them, than I , at any rate, have at present.",16
141,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Balaclava) [4.27] - I support the motion; but, at the same time, it is not quite clear that the Government are adopting the right procedure. It is possible for them to undertake the work themselves without any preliminary inquiry under the Act. If the Minister is as desirous of despatch as he suggests, and as some of his colleagues behind him recommend, it is possible for the Governor General in Council to exempt the vote from the operation of the Act, as an item required for the military and naval defence of the Commonwealth. Having, however, brought it before the House, and followed the procedure suggested by the Public Works Committee Act, it seems to me that the discussion ought to be as wide as you, sir, in your judgment can allow. The Committee are directed by the Act, in considering and reporting on any work, to have regard to its stated purpose, the necessity or advisableness of carrying it out, and, where it purports to I be reproductive or revenue-producing, the amount of revenue likely to be produced, and its present or prospective public value. They have generally to take such measures, and procure such information, as may enable them to inform or satisfy Parliament as to the expediency of carrying out the work. This is an expenditure to increase the output of small arms in Australia. Whether we be at war or not, the whole question of the production of small arms, whether their quality or quantity has been satisfactory in the past or may be made so in the future, whether they will be needed in the future, and how they shall be used if and when produced, ought to come within the ambit of the discussion. I , therefore, suggest that honourable members who desire to see the necessities of rifle clubs considered, apart from the needs of our trained troops here or overseas ",17
142,Mr SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The honourable member must not discuss the question of rifle clubs.,17
143,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I shall take care not to, sir, if you are in that mood, as I do not desire to transgress your ruling. But if we cannot discuss the use to be made of rifles produced as the result of this extension, we shall be limited in one of the most important sections of the discussion we wish to undertake.",17
144,Mr WEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The Public Works Committee will consider that matter and report upon it.,17
145,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"We have had every reason to be bitterly disappointed with the result of the work at the Small Arms Factory under Government control. All our calculations, so far as we are able to ascertain, have been falsified by experience as to the amount of money necessary to equip this factory, the number of men to be employed, and the quantity and quality of the production. No man has been satisfied that the anticipations have been fulfilled , and, as an illustration of faulty management or administration, we had the astounding fact a week ago that the report for the year ending 30th June, 1913, was laid before Parliament twenty-one months after the period named. Surely it is time we had a more up-to-date report of the management than that for the information of honourable members. That circumstance alone should be sufficient to arrest the attention and excite the anxiety of honourable members, especially when taken in conjunction with the fact, whether we like it published or not, that the quality of the article turned out of the factory up to date has been unsatisfactory to experts. searching examination by the Ministry, apart from a searching examination by the Committee, is demanded.",17
146,Mr CABB,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,It is supposed to have had that.,18
147,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,No ; a non-expert examination would not be sufficient to elucidate the causes of failure and apply a ready means for its removal.,18
148,Mr CABB,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Are you satisfied it has not had all that?,18
149,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"No , it has not had that ; aud, if the honourable member can tell me where and by whom, I would be glad to know. A visit by the Minister could not afford that, and a visit by this Committee would not. The Government should order, as early as possible, a complete and searching investigation by expert officers of the Department into the matter, particularly into the question of the quality of metals, in order that they may be satisfied that the articles turned out are likely to be of durable value, and will not fail our men at a critical time. Now, as to the quantity of articles produced. I do not know whether the M i nister or the manager of the works is responsible for the fact that the factory is only working one shift. can trust the cables from Great Britain , all the authorities of the Mother Country, from Lord Kitchener down, desire that every part of the Empire should turn out all the small arms that our soldiers are likely to require. If that is so, why cannot we work two or three shifts in Australia ? Are the men not obtainable? I venture to say that no attempt has been made to add to the expertness of the existing staff, or to in crease it , by bringing in workers from allied industries.",18
150,Mr CABB,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,What is the good of talking about that now?,18
151,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Because we want to prevent any recurrence of the difficulty, and I hope that will be the attitude of honourable members on both sides of the House. I notice that in the Imperial House of Commons the Government have invited criticism and co-operation in connection with important naval and military affairs. That is an attitude which should be adopted here. If in connection with the Small Arms Factory material is lacking, the Government should take steps at once to increase it . I believe the Minister and his colleagues are The most endeavouring to do their best in a most difficult situation. In the gravity of the position as it exists in the minds of some members of the lower House, I do not know that any money should be spared to make this factory, as early as possible, capable of producing, in as large a quant it y as may be required, the highest class bf small arms that our workers can turn out. Particularly should this be so with the Forces that have gone overseas, and for the reinforcements, because, as experience has shown, the life of a rifle in trench fighting is very short. Just as in the War Precautions Bill we took notice of certain civil and other offences for the safety of this country, so we should do everything we can to encourage the movement for our second line of defence, by providing equipment for those who join it . I hope that the Committee, when this motion passes, will regard the investigation as an urgent one, and, regardless of the feelings of officials or Ministers, or anybody else, will conduct a most searching inquiry. I hope, also, that the Minister will act with that promptitude which the occasion demands, and I feel sure that the House will give due expedition to any measures that may be necessary to increase rapidly the production of small arms in Australia. If we Question resolved in the affirmative. PATENTS, TRADE MARKS, AND DESIGNS BILL (No. 3).

By the amending Act of last year the patent rights of enemy subjects were made liable to suspension or avoidance, at the discretion of the Minister, who was empowered to appoint licensees to exercise them. A similar position was created in regard to trade marks and designs. But it is found that, when patent rights have been suspended or avoided, every person in the community may make or vend the patented article, which makes a Crown licence of little or no value. No person would be willing to invest a capital of, say, £50,000 in the production of a patented article unless he were assured of a market in which he would be protected, and in which his outlay could bo recouped. If a licensee is to be in no better position than any other person in respect to the production of patented articles, there will be no inducement to obtain licences.",18
153,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Are the royalties being retained until the war is over ? That was the understanding in England.,19
154,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"AV e have no power to demand royalties from any person other than a licensee, and the royalties paid will remain in a trust fund, to be administered at the close of the war as circumstances may determine and Parliament may dictate. There is another phase of the matter. Suppose A to be the patentee of an article, the production of which demands a capital of £50,000 or thereabouts. If A's patent rights are suspended, and a. licence to manufacture the patented article is granted to B, on condition that he pays a royalty to the Crown, B will manufacture only if he is protected against competition, or if the competition is limited to Crown licensees. Now, any person may infringe the patent rights. Where a patent has been avoided and a licence to manufacture has been granted to a Government official as representative and agent for the Crown, other persons may manufacture the patented article, and cannot be proceeded against, either civilly or criminally. The Crown cannot sue for infringement, because the right to do that was vested solely in the patentee, and does not pass to the Crowa on the avoidance or suspension of a",19
155,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I called attention to that weakness in this legislation during the second-reading debate of the Bill of last year.,19
156,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"That is so. The honourable member then said that the right of action for infringement was gone. But it has not gone permanently; it has goneonly during the war, or during the period of suspension or avoidance of the patent. After the war, patentees will be able to call to account any person who, without their permission and without licence from the Crown, has infringed a patent. Action against a licensee would, of course, be barred by Statute. The Bill has been introduced to give the Crown power to punish unlicensed persona for infringing patent rights which have been suspended in favour of any person or persons. It thus safeguards to some extent the rights of patentees as well as those of licensees. Whatever be determined as to the distribution of the royalties collected under the amending Act of 1914, the patentee whose patent has been suspended or avoided is placed by this Bill in a better position to recover after the war whatever he may be entitled to. The measure also assures a monopoly in the production of the patented article to the Crown lieensee, and is thus a necessary complement to the Act of last year. The intention to give the licensee a monopoly, and to transfer to him all the rights of the patentee, was imperilled by a defect in .the Act of 1914. That Act took his monopoly from the patentee whose patent was avoided or suspended, but left the community free to make, vend, or use the patented article, nob only when the patent was-avoided, but whenit was suspended - in favour of a Crownlicensee. In this explanation of the Bill I have confined my remarks to patent rights, and have not referred to trade marks and designs, because, so far as this Bill goes, the difference between them is not one of principle. If it can be shown that the measure can be made more effective, I shall be glad to adopt amendments to that end. The Act of last year was introduced to enable the community to continue to enjoy the benefits of patented articles affected by the war, to offer sufficient inducements to licensees in whose favour the patent waa suspended to put their money into the manufacture of these articles, so that Australia should gain not only by opportunities for use of the article, but also by the establishment of industries for its manufacture, and where this could only be effected by suspension and not by avoidance. The 1914 Act has been found defective in so far that a licence now granted to a person under it does not give that person such a monopoly as would induce him to invest his capital, nor does it protect the community, because, since it enables any man to use the patent involved, it , in effect, in many cases, will prevent any from doing so.",19
157,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Flinders) [ 4 . 5 5 ] - I am not at all sure that not agree with the Attorney-General relimitation garding the main object that he has i view. The honourable gentleman tically stated that object in the concluding words of his speech when he said that mediate where we suspend the right of an enemy patentee to enforce his patent, and merely grant a bare licence to some one else to use it , we may not give encouragement to any person to enter upon the manufacture of articles that may be useful to the Oomand monwealth. I admit that that is so, and, therefore, although the Bill involves new and a very serious inroad upon the principle of the Crown granting monobefore polies which will need to be watched the utmost care by the Ministry and Parthat liament, I do not think that at the present time. I should oppose such legislation. wish to point out, however, that while the object which the Minister has tion in view is that which he has stated and - and in that I shall be prepared quiries to make some suggestions to assist can him-the Bill , as it is worded, to a length which, I feel confident, neither the Attorney-General nor his supporters appreciate. As it is worded, this sure revives some of the most mischievous features of the practice of the Crown creating indefeasible monopolies in in dividuals, which existed at the time of Tudors, and which, after a great constiwe tutional struggle by the Commons against the Crown, was at last limited-in many respects it was abolished-by the famous Statute known as the Statute of Monoown polies. That Statute, which was passed in the time of Elizabeth, provided that Crown should not be permitted to grant any monoplies except subject to a certain definite limitation. The Crown had been granting monopolies and making revenues out of the practice. I am not suggesting that anything of the kind is likely to happen here. But the principle involved in this Bill is one that has been fought for and maintained throughout the history of, not merely Great Britain , but every modern civilized country-the principle that the granting of monopolies by the State must be limited within a veiy defined area. That defined area is that a monopoly shall be granted only as a reward for a new and useful invention. Both those words are used in the Statute of Monopolies, and they have been taken by the Jurisprudence of every civilized I do modern country to be a fair mark of to the State's right to grant n monopolies. They are, indeed, the basis pracof all our patent laws, and I have referred to them because they have an i m bearing on this Bill . Every person to whom a monopoly in the shape of letters patent is granted, by the Crown never has that right absolutely granted to him . It could not lie guaranteed by the State, but must be subject to the condition that the invention which is claimed to be new useful is, in fact, new and useful; that the patentee has not got letters patent for a something which, in reality or in effect, was in the possession of the public mind those letters patent were granted. with Honourable members will recognise that is a perfectly reasonable position. In granting a patent for an invention the I Crown says, in effect, to the applicant: "" We do not know whether your invenis new or not. Y o u say that it is, we have an office which will make in for you, as far as such inquiries be made, to ascertain Avhether, in fact, goes your invention is new and useful."" The Examiner of Patents in every country examines the official records to determine, meaas far as can be determined from them, whether an invention claimed to be new is new in fact. The Crown says to an ap- plicant for a patent, "" That is all we can the do for you. If your invention is new, shall give you a monopoly in respect to it for fourteen years, with a right, under certain circumstances, to have it renewed, but you must take it at your risk. "" It will be seen that the real safety to the public and the Crown the against the granting of improper monopolies lies in the fact that there is thrown upon the person who secures a patent right the condition that if his invention is challenged he must show that it was new when the patent was granted in respect of it . Every patentee, whether an enemy or a friendly patentee, is subject to that condition. The first thing that an inventor does nowadays is to patent his invention in every country. We have hundreds of German patents here, and doubtless there are hundreds of British patents in operation in Germany. Many of these patents are not worth the paper on which they are written. Many of thera are absolutely worthless. patentees have paid their fees, and have obtained their patents for what they are worth. If any one chooses to exercise such an invention, the patentee cannot say to him, "" Here is my patent, and that must be quite enough to you. You must pay me a royalty."" ' On the contrary, the person seeking to exercise an invention has the right to say to the patentee, "" Your invention was not new when you obtained a patent for it in Australia."" The Attorney-General will agree with me that of the German patents with which we are now dealing there are hundreds in Australia which are probably as bad as possible, and which every Australian citizen has a right to challenge. I understand that this Bill has an immediate connection with what is known as the Thermit case, and I cannot help regarding this measure as an illustration of the danger that always attaches to the passing of a Bill , in general to deal with a particular subject-matter. If the Government wish to deal with a particular matter, Parliament should be so informed, and a measure relating specifically to it should be introduced. But when we have brought forward a general change of the law to meet a particular difficulty arising in a particular case we are apt to fall into serious dangers. Before alluding to the facts which I tliink have led to the introduction of this Bill , I wish to point out that there are hundreds of German inventions patented in Australia which any oue has a right to use. We can say in respect of many of them that the invention to which the patent relates was published in a scientific magazine here before the patent was granted, or that something almost exactly similar was being used, say, in the Castlemaine Foundry before the invention patented. Sir William Irvine.",20
158,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Would that be only in war time?,21
159,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"At any time. The Crown, in granting a patent to any man, has always said, in effect, to him, "" You have a monopoly in respect to it only if you can prove that your in vention is new. An y man has a right to do that, in respect of which you claim a monopoly, if he can show that your in vention is not new."" This Bill has nothing to do with the war, except in so far as it takes its origin from the fact of certain patentees being enemies of The ours. The Commonwealth Act of 1914, copying the Imperial Act, enabled the Minister to make a regulation under the general patent law providing for the suspension or cancellation of the patent rights of the subject of any State at war with us-to put it shortly, the patent rights of any German-or , in the alternative, to grant a licence without suspending a patent",21
160,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Not alternatively. The word "" and "" is used. We may suspend without giving a licence; we may suspend and give a licence or avoid a patent altogether.",21
161,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The Attorney-General is in error. Section 3 of the Act of 1914 provides that regulations may be made(a) for avoiding or suspending in whole or in part any patent or licence the person entitled to the benefit of which is the subject of any State at war with the King; terms, In other words, a German patent may be avoided or suspended. The section provides, further, for the making of regulations(b) for avoiding or suspending the registration, and all or any rights conferred by the registration, of any trade mark or design the proprietor whereof is a subject as aforesaid; _ (c) for avoiding or suspending any application made by any such person under any of the Acts referred to in this section, andParagraph c deals with applications and has nothing to do with the point with which I am dealing(d) for enabling the Minister to grant in favour of persons, other than such persons as aforesaid, on sueh terms and conditions, and either for the whole term of the patent or registration or for such less period, as the Minister thinks fit, licences to make use exercise or vend patented invenwas tions and registered designs so liable to avoidance or suspension as aforesaid. The word "" and "" merely connects the different paragraphs, giving power to make regulations. It will thus be seen that the Minister has power to make regu lations to suspend or cancel a German patent, or, allowing a German patent to remain in force, to grant a licence to any individual. If a German patent be annulled, a licence in respect of it cannot be granted. A licence has force only as long as there is in force a patent relating to it . Obviously, we cannot grant a licence if we annul the patent.",21
162,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"We can annul or suspend a patent, and yet not grant a licence.",22
163,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Q u it e so. I understood the honourable gentleman to go further, but I accept the statement just made by him. We can annul or suspend a patent, and yet refrain from granting a licence in respect to it . If we annul or suspend a patent we may not grant a licence, but we may leave a patent in force.",22
164,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Unles s we annul or suspend our authority to grant a licence does not arise.,22
165,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I take a totally different view from that just expressed by the Attorney-General. If we annul or suspend a patent, the necessity for granting a licence to use the invention relating to it does not exist. The operation of the patent destroyed altogether or suspended during the operation of the war. If it is suspended any person may, without licence, use the invention to which it relates.",22
166,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I was speaking of the Statute.,22
167,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"It is only where a patent is not suspended or nulled that the Minister may grant a licence that may be of any purpose. That being so, I come now to the point which I wish to direct special attention, because I believe it has been overlooked. This legislation, if carried in its present form , will have extraordinary, far-reachpatent ing effects. If a patent be annulled cancelled, or suspended, or if a licence granted without annulling or suspending the patent concerned, then any perwards son who gets that licence is merely exempt from being sued patentee. . He has no If we suspend the patent we abolish monopoly for the time being. If we nul the patent we abolish the monopoly altogether. If we do not suspend annul a patent, but grant a licence to a particular person, still under the existing Act, every other Australian citizen has exactly the same right as he had without that Act to make the thing which is supposed to be protected by the patent, but only at his own risk.",22
168,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Do you mean at the risk of civil recovery?,22
169,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Purely civil. But the criminal element has also been introduced, and I shall deal with that later.",22
170,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,But that applies to the term of the war only.,22
171,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Only in the case of a suspension. If a patent is annulled, the original patentee is out of Court altogether, but suspending a patent during the currency of the war does uot suspend the right of the patentee to sue during the war; it merely suspends his monopoly during the war, because no object can be gained by suspending the patentee's right to sue, seeing that, being an enemy, he has no right to sue during the war; he cannot be heard in our Courts.",22
172,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"That is true, but if a licence is granted, will it hold good only 1 during the term of the war? Can the is either patentee come in afterwards and sue for the use of his patent?",22
173,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"C e r t a in l y not. In the new Act, Parliament has said that the Minister may "" g r a n t licences"" - he may grant a licence to a particular person, authorizing that peranson to manufacture the patent, but that licence does not give the licensee a monopoly; it simply authorizes him to to manufacture without paying royalty to the patentee. If the Minister grants a licence under statutory authority to a man to manufacture, notwithstanding a which still remains in existence, or the man has an absolute right to do it be under the existing Act, and the patentee is absolutely precluded from suing afterwith regard to the actions of the licensee. Of course, after the terminaby the tion of the licence, the patent, if it has monopoly. not been annulled, will come into full the force, and from that time onward the anpatentee will have the right to sue any person for manufacturing the article or covered by the patent.",22
174,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The honourable member is not forgetting that everything turns on the fact that the power given to the Minister is to suspend, in whole or in part, in favour of a particular person.",23
175,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Of course, if the Minister grants a licence, it is in favour of the person to whom he gives it. The words "" in p a r t "" cannot mean "" in favour of any particular person."" To suspend a monopoly even in part means to allow everybody to do the thing which the monopoly claims to do.",23
176,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,We are dealing patent rights.,23
177,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I am endeavouring to put my own view. I have no doubt as to it .,23
178,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The effect of the limitations in the Bill are such that they conflict with the argument of the honourable member.,23
179,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I had some difficulty in understanding what was the meaning of suspending a patent "" in part."" It can only mean that, if a patent consists of several subordinate monopolies or claims, it may be suspended in regard to some of the' claims,, though not in regard to the whole patent. It cannot mean suspension in regard to any particular person, because, once suspended, it is suspended in regard to everybody, or not at all. If honourable members will give me a little more attention upon this very technical subject, I shall lie able to explain this very dangerous quality in the Bill , and I have no doubt that the Government, if they view the matter as I do, upon explanation, will be prepared to make the necessary modifications to gain their real end. According to clause 4Where a patent, or the registration, and all or any of the rights conferred by the registration, of a trade mark or design, has been suspended in favour of any person Mark these words-in favour of any person-becaus e there is nothing in the existing law which speaks of suspending a patent "" in favour of any person "" ; the words are meaningless. There cannot be a licence where a monopoly is suspended. It is not required. A licence is permission to do something which, but for the licence, one would be prevented from doing by law. The clause proceedsany person other than the person in whose favour the patent, or the registration, as said, has been so suspended, who, during such suspension, makes, uses, exercises, or vends the invention forming the subject-matter of the patent, shall be guilty of an offence. Penalty : £500. If it be passed in this form, the clause will achieve two objects which could not have been contemplated by Ministers. It will deprive the people of Australia of the righ t which they have always had against any patentee, no matter how usef u l his invention may have been, to say that, so far as Australia was concerned, it was not new at the time the patent was obtained. This provision not only takes with over a German patent, which may be good or bad, and vests it in some licensee, but . it also arms that licensee with a power and authority such as - no patentee has ever had in any British or modern community.",23
180,Mr MATHEWS,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,It gives him stronger patent rights?,23
181,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Unassail able patent rights-so much so that no Australian citizen can say, "" Y o u r in vention was never a new invention here."" Not only does it deprive every man of the right of claiming to dispute a monopoly on the ground on which similar monopolies have always been open to challenge, namely, that it was not new when the patent was obtained, and that it was in the possession of the public previously, but it also adds, or perhaps substitutesi t is difficult to say-bu t it certainly creates a new and drastic enforcement of the monopoly such as exists in no other jurisdiction, for we make any encroachment on the patent a criminal offence with a penalty of £ 5 0 0 , whereas, under the existing law, the sole right that any patentee has to support his monopoly is a civil action for damages. He may say, "" Y o u have made use of my invention; it was new, and I have a patent for it ; by using it you have caused me a certain amount of damage, and I shall sue you for damages, and claim an injunction against you in order to prevent you making furthe r use of it . "" That relief the patentee has subject to the inherent right of the man whom he attacks to say, "" You have never had a valid patent, because the invention was not new at the time you got it in Australia.""",23
182,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Do you mean to infer that if this righ t is granted to a certain party, protected by this Act, no man in afore- Australia can come along and ask for an improvement?",23
183,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"No ; that is not my meaning. An improvement is an entirely different thing. A patent may be issued for an improvement on an existing patent, so long as it is new; but the existing patent cannot be used without the payment of royalties to the patentee.  the onus of proof from the patentee to the other person.",24
184,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"It is not much a question of proof. This Bill now proposes to give to the patent the guarantee that it is. a good patent, whether it is new or not, and the man who gets a licence will uot only have the right to manufacture without paying royalty to the patentee-that is to say, he will have the right to do what no other man will have the right to do if the patent is good - but , also, he will have a.monopoly which is conferred on him in a way which it is not now conferred on any patentee. No one will be able to dispute the validity of the patent, whether it be good or bad. The right which we all have to dispute any German patent in the hands of a German patentee will be gone. Thus hundreds of these patents, .which may be good or bad-that many of them are bad has been proved in our Courts of law - ma y be taken over under this Bill, and vested in licensees, and at once be made impregnable.",24
185,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Would not the Crown have the right to get. the royalties the original patentee would have received?,24
186,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Probably ; but why should the Crown have that right against the public? That is the danger. We are creating a new monopoly for inventions which are not new. A German may have a German patent for something which has been used in Australia in various forms before. It may be thoroughly bad, but the German patentee comes here and gets a patent at the Patents Omen. It is often done, because the examination is necessarily bad; it is an examination of documents only, and numbers of these patents are very easily .attackable and capable of being upset. Nevertheless, the patent stands, but any one has the right to go on making Thermit- I merely take this as an example; I do not know whether the patent is bad-and if the patentee chooses to sue for damages the other party may be in a position to prove that it is a bad patent. Now, however, under this Bill, once the patent is vested in the licensee it becomes impregnable. It may be as rotten as possible, but it is at once built up into an impregnable fortress so long as the licence is held.",24
187,Sir JOHN FOKREST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,How long would that be?,24
188,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"It may be for the unexpired period of the patent, so anything up to fourteen years. As the Attorney-General has pointed ctot, if we desire people to put capital into the manufacture of tliese articles, w© must give them something worth going for, and probably licences will be granted for as long a period as possible; therefore, the monopoly may rest for all that time, and it is an impregnable monopoly. It is very dangerous, indeed, to vest in the Crown, in, any shape or form, the right to grant monopolies, except subject to conditions which have been attached in every country to the grant-for instance, the condition of giving something to the public in return for the monopoly. The patentee gives the public the benefit of a new invention, but for that alone does he get the right to prevent other people from using it?",24
189,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The onus of proof is upon the patentee.,24
190,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I do not think there is any question of the onus: of proof. It is not merely the onus of proof that is thrown upon him,24
191,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Assum e it goes to Court.,24
192,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Suppose the licensee goes to Court, do you mean ?""",24
193,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"No . The patentee takes the person to Court and says "" You are using my patent."" The onus of proving that he is rests upon the patentee.",24
194,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Are you. speaking of the existing law ?,24
195,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Yes . The onus of proof would be on the patentee.,24
196,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"No . Under the existing law, the person who assails a patent has to prove that it is not new. That is the ordinary law. He has alwaysthe right to call evidence that it is not new: but the position created under this Bill is that nobody can prove that theoriginal German invention was not new.",24
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Does the Labour party wish to give a monopoly?,24
198,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I do not. wish to use language of party controversy in this matter. I merely wish to point out to my friends on this side of the House, as well as to those on the other, that this power, whether in the hands of a Government supported by honourable members on that side, or by honourable members on this side, is an equally dangerous power. That is what I want to point out. I propose to take up a few minutes by referring to an instance of what I mean. I do not think there is any disputing the fact that the occasion responsible for this Bill is in connection with the question that has arisen regarding a German invention named Thermit. I know very little about the subject of the invention, excepting that it is a kind of chemical or physical preparation by which enormous heat is generated, and that it is largely used in the welding of iron and steel. An HONOBABLE MEMBEB - It is used on our tram-lines.",24
199,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"That is the history of the Thermit controversy. After the last Act was passed in 1914, two applications were made under it, and under regulations raised hy it, in respect of this particular invention. One application was made by Mr Teesdale Smith, the other by Mr Henry Chinn. Both were made to avoid the Thermit patent. If either had succeeded, in effect, it would have meant that Teesdale Smith, or Chinn, or anybody else, might have used the patent-that is, under the operation of the Act. Both the applications were opposed by a number of persons. First of all by the patentees, then by the Australian Thermit Company, who were, I imagine, tha exclusive licensees of the patent in Australia. They were opposed by the Minister of Railways in New South Wales, by the Commissioner of Railways in that State, and also by the Malvern Tramways Trust. Mr Chinn opposed Mr. Teesdale Smith's application.",25
200,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Were these opponents persons who had applied for licences or persons wishing to apply ?,25
201,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I do not know what relation these people stood towards one another, or towards the original patentee. They all opposed the applications, and Mr Chinn opposed Mr Teesdale Smith's application, though the granting of Mr Teesdale Smith's application would have had exactly the same effect as the granting of Mr Chinn's application. They were all persons who opposed the applications to avoid or suspend the Thermit patents. At that stage there were no applications for licences. The applications, I am informed, aud this information has been supplied to me by a gentleman engaged professionally in the litigation",25
202,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,What was the first application before the Commissioner fort,25
203,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,To avoid or suspend.,25
204,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Exactly . But some of these persons were applicants.,25
205,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"At this time the only applications were to avoid' or to suspend the granting of either of which would, of course, have thrown the whole thing upon the world at large.",25
206,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The honourable gentleman has coupled them both together.,25
207,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I say two persons made application to avoid or suspend. One was Mr Teesdale Smith, the other Mr Chinn.",25
208,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Yes , that is so; but the application was not granted.",25
209,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am not making any accusation against the Attorney-General. I am sure he did what he thought was right in this case; but I want to show what might be done. The applications, as I have said, were opposed by quite a number of persons. For some remarkable reason, Mr Chinn opposed Mr Smith's application, the granting of which would have had exactly the same effect as if Chinn's application had been granted. The contractors to the Malvern Tramways Trust also for some reason opposed Smith's application. These, however, are details that do not matter. The fact is that the applications were opposed by quite a number of persons. The applications were made to the Attorney-General himself. Very properly, he referred them to the Commissioner for Patents for inquiry; but Mr Teesdale Smith, before the hearing before the Commissioner for Patents, withdrew his application. The next step was that in which the Commissioner would have heard Mr Chinn's application, which up to that time had been merely an application to suspend or avoid a patent - that is, to open the door to the world. Mr Chinn asked the Commissioner for an exclusive licence to be granted to himself. An "" exclusive licence"" means nothing. I do not know whether Mr Chinn knew that it nothing, but that is what he asked for. There was no power under the existing law to grant an "" exclusive licence."" There was power to grant a licence, but this power to grant an ""exclusive licence"" is only now being asked for. A f t e r the matter had been further dealt with , a decision was given, the effect of which was, shortly, that the Attorney-General refused to grant Mr Chinn's application, but suspended the patent "" so far as regards and in favour of (a) the Engineerin-Chief of the Commonwealth railways; and (b) such persons as the Minister may license."" Now that again was meaningless. I say so with great respect to the Attorney-General; but to say that under the existing law you can suspend a patent "" as far as regards and in favour of "" any particular person, has no meaning. Under the existing law, all a Minister can do is to suspend a patent-that is, he can open the door, but he cannot open the door to any one particular person. suspends the patent; he annuls it",25
210,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Excep t by refusing an application to grant a licence!,26
211,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Of course, if he granted a licence, he would open the door to one person and close it to the rest of the world, but leaving to the rest of the world the right to put the law into operation to show that there is nothing in the door, so to speak-in other words, to show that the patent is bad. I have the orders made by the Minister here, and, assuming that he possesses the power, I want hi m to understand that I take no exception whatever either to the form or substance in which he proposes to take this power, provided he has thoroughly looked into the matter. It may be highly desirable to invest the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways with the exclusive power to utilize this Thermit patent in Australia. may, or it may not be. If the Minister has looked into the matter, and has come to the conclusion that it ' is, I do not quarrel with his decision. It may be desirable that he should possess power to grant an exclusive licence to some other person beside the Engineer-in-Chief. I do not dispute that. But he had no power to do it at the time that order was made, and this Bill is, of course, couched in language which is intended obviously to validate that order, because it now^ for the first time, speaks of a case in which a meant patent has been suspended in favour of any person. As far as I know, no patent has ever been suspended in favour of any person except the Thermit patent.",26
212,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,A r e you talking about the Bill or the Act?,26
213,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The Bill . I want to say this, putting it shortly, that if the Minister wants merely to grant the same rights as the patentee had for the purpose of enabling that person-subjec t to all the disabilities of the patent, subject to the right of anybody to prove that there is nothing at all in it , that there is no monopoly in it - if he wants to transfer the right of a German enemy to a citizen of Australia, I have nothing to say in opposition, but, as I said before, it is a power in the hands of any Government, or any Ministry, which ought to be exercised with the utmost caution and watched with the utmost jealousy. It may be a power which it is very desirable for the Minister to posHe sess; but, in order to grant that power, all Parliament has to do is to say that the Minister may invest some person witli the same rights in a patent that the German patentee had. That is what should be done. It would not take the Parliamentary Draftsman five minutes to put that simple thing into a form which would give the Minister all he wants. If , as he pointed out, he wants to invest some person with that power, and to give him the necessary inducement to invest his capital, and, with that end in view, to grant him a monopoly, let him grant £he monopoly subject to the same conditions and the same risks that now exist in the German patentee from whom he proposes to take the patent. But, if you go beyond that, and say that the Minister or the Government may take any German patent out of the hundreds that exist in this country, and may transfer it to a particular individual, and render him abIt solutely safe from any attack, no matter how vicious, then the licensee to whom you grant that power will not only have his ordinary rights to sue for damages against an infringer if his patent is good, but you are also going to protect him by granting an inviolable monopoly with a penal provision, fixing the penalty for infringement at £ 5 0 0 . By doing this you are not only introducing a very grave novelty into legislation- I do not know of any country in the world which has adopted anything like it in its patent laws-bu t you are introducing a power which, with this or any other Governto ment in office, is a power which ought not to be given.",26
214,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Eve n if the licensee is an officer of the Crown?,27
215,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"If you are giving the power you are giving it in general terms. The exercise of that power when in the hands of an officer of Crown may be harmless, but the power self is a mischievous one.",27
216,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"FO T what purpose is the transfer of a right made from a patentee to a licensee? Does it not arise out of the circumstances of war, and is it not for the benefit of the community?",27
217,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The Attorney-General can only carry the principle of emergency to a certain extent. He cannot cover up everything by the war.,27
218,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I do not wish it for one minute.,27
219,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am prepared to support the Government in granting everything they ask that is essential, or that they consider is essential, for the prosecution of this war.",27
220,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Does not the honourable gentleman see that we are keeping these German patents alive ?,27
221,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Yes ; I want him to keep the German patents alive; but ought we not to keep them alive for our own benefit?,27
222,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,And how is that to be done other than by granting certain licences ?,27
223,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"- If the Germember man patent is worth anything, if the German monopoly ought to exist here at all, I have shown you how you can transfer it to any body you like, and how you can give all the protection to which a German patentee would be entitled. What more do you want to give him? Do you want to give him a protection to which the German patentee would not be entitled? I say you are introducing a very mis chievous principle into this legislation.",27
224,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"We are not considering the German patentee. We are considering the community and the position arising out of the power to infringe a patent with, impunity.",27
225,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"There is always power to infringe a bad patent with impunity, but there is never power infringe a good patent with impunity.",27
226,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"People do that, and chance the consequences.",27
227,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"They do, but they have to take their chances. What I should like to know from the Attorney-General is, whether he desires to go further in this Bill than to take the the right to transfer a German patent itwith all the protection which the patentee had in it.",27
228,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"So far as the licensee is concerned, yes; but so far as concerns the patentee, no.",27
229,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Is there any necessity to create a new and previously unknown monopoly - in other words, to make a rotten patent a good one?",27
230,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Does the honourable member suggest that the Crown should be content with civil remedies?,27
231,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Certainly . If the Crown is not content with a civil remedy for an ordinary civil right,27
232,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,But these are something more than ordinary civil rights.,27
233,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The Attorney-General wishes to make them something more than ordinary civil rights, and that is what I object to. I am prepared to help the honourable member, if he desires facilities to invest persons with the ordinary patent monopoly-bu t no more than that-whic h the German patentee had, in order to encourage them, in the interests of the community, to make those articles which the honourable says ought to be made, but if the honourable member wishes to invest the Government with power to create unassailable monopolies protected by law, the House ought to pause before giving sanction to any such provision. I venture to think that had a Liberal Government introduced a measure of this sort, they would have received criticism from the Attorney-General, compared with which my remarks on this measure this evening are milk and water.",27
234,Mr WEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,You charge us with changing our opinions when we change our,27
235,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"It seems as if honourable members opposite are changing not only their opinions, but their principles. However, I wish to prive this discussion of all flavour of party politics, and I ask honourable memafter bers, on the statement of the Attorneyto General himself, whether it is necessary for him to ask the House to give greater power to the Government than that of vesting in those people whom he wishes to encourage to manufacture thermit any other article the full authority the patentee, whose patent is being susone pended, possesses?",27
236,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Angas) [5.45] - The clusive licence. honourable member for Flinders has clearly shown that the. Bill ought to be with the drawn for the present and further sidered, and I emphasize that statement by mentioning that Imperial legislation has not been amended in the direction proposed in this measure. Since the war broke out, three Acts dealing with the subject of patents have been passed by the Imperial Parliament-on e in August and two in November. Immediately afterwards a Bill based on legislation was introduced into this Parliament, and on the second reading pointed out that, whilst war practically took away the right of the patentee to during the war, any member of the public might use a patent, subject to the liability to be sued afterwaras for infringeafter ment during the war. Whether or not good the Imperial Government intended to render a patent open to use, and not give an exclusive licence, I am not sure. It has been stated in England, amongst Act. others., by Mr Baty, in an article of on the subject, that the intention was to grant an exclusive licence, but i is rather significant that the Imperial vernment have never brought in a B i to do that. As a matter of fact, the .which we passed last year does not, i its present form, authorize the granting of an exclusive licence. It has been said in England that the assumption was that there was power given to grant exclusive licences, but the matter has been i doubt, as, indeed, all this patents legison lation has been, because it has never been land to annul these patents. clearly shown what is the object sought by this legislation. In my opinion, what the Government are really aiming at is this: In the first place, following national comity, to protect when the war is over the rights of the patentee, to quire in the meantime any benefits that might accrue for the benefit of the pubdelic, and to provide for any paynients which may be made to be retained u n t i l the war, when they will be payable the patentees again. In the next place, we have to provide for the granting of permission, by the suspension of the patents, to persons who wish to use those patents, and regulations have been made or which provide for an application to be which made for suspension of a patent by some who, in his application, states that he intends to use the patent. That person is not necessarily entitled to an exI n fact, at the end of the regulations there is a provision that Attorney-General or Comptroller may congrant "" a licence "" to any person.",28
237,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I do not think the Comptroller can do that.,28
238,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"At all events, the At torney-General may grant "" a licence "" it does not say exclusive licence-to any person. But there seems to be some assumption that the person who made the application to suspend was entitled to an the Imperial exclusive licence.",28
239,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"That does not follow. II t was not done in the Thermit ease. Mr Henry Chinn and Mr Teesdale sue Smith were applicants for suspension, and both their applications were refused.",28
240,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I was asked, soon the Act was passed, what was the of passing the Act if the applicant was not to obtain immediately an excluto sive licence. I never for a moment thought that that was the object of the We have to protect the interests the man whose r i g h t to sue in a Court is suspended during the war, but whose t patent remains, and remains because some Goof the English orders provide for giving l l a licence to a person, to an enemy subAct ject even, to pay fees in England upon n a German registration, and there are reciprocal orders permitting Englishmen to pay fees in Germany during the duration of the war to keep alive their patents in the enemy country. That bears out my n contention that there was no intention the part of either Germany' or EngI n fact, I do not believe that any application to avoid was ever successful in England. .",28
241,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I believe the Thermit interpatent was wholly avoided.,28
242,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That may have been acdone for reasons independent of the legislation passed since the war broke out.,28
243,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"It was done quite recently, and we must assume, it was byvirtue of a power given in recent amending legislation.",29
244,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"It has been declared that the power to avoid under the regulations is ultra vires. As a matter of common sense, you would not avoid a patent if you were going to give a licence for its use. This Bill does not deal at all with the avoidance of a patent, but only with its suspension.",29
245,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,You may avoid a thing in parts.,29
246,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I do not think that was ever intended. My impression is that the word "" avoid "" ought never to have been put in the Act we passed at the end of last year.",29
247,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"So far as this Bill is concerned, it is clearly directed to the power of suspension.",29
248,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"That is all. The point to which I am calling the attention of the Attorney-General is this: One of the considerations in passing this Bill was to protect the right of patentees during the war, because at such time they had no right of action.",29
249,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That was not the main reason.,29
250,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"On the 23rd of last December, orders were published in England permitting the payment of the necessary fees for obtaining a renewal or a continuance of a patent in an enemy country, and also reciprocal permission was given to pay enemy fees in England on patents held by enemy subjects, so that the suspension of the rights of the patentees should not, except by precluding them from taking action for infringement, be prejudiced by the duration of the war. Primarily, what we are doing is fulfillin g the international rule that, unless we deliberately abrogate contracts, the patents also should be protected during the war.",29
251,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,There is no suggestion of abrogating contracts.,29
252,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Not in this Bill , is a rule of law that contracts are not necessarily abrogated. The next reason is that adduced by the Attorney-General - to induce people to take up these patents by issuing licences to them. For that reason the Act allows licences to be granted for the full term of the patent, and the> allegation is that, unless that were done, people would not embark on the expenditure necessary in order to use the patent. The point I would impress on the Attorney-General is, that if such licences are granted, he must not interfere with the rights of a patentee, or do anything which would be in the nature of giving away those rights.",29
253,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I have always held that as one of the guiding principles.,29
254,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"That is another reason why I believe this legislation was introduced. Only the right of action for in fringement is suspended; at the end of the war that right accrues again, and its revival enables action to be taken in respect of infringements during the war.",29
255,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Is that so?,29
256,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Accordin g to some authorities. Perhaps such action is not possible, but I have seen opinions to that effect from eminent men.",29
257,Sir WILLIAM IHVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I feel certain that is not so.,29
258,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I do not say that it is absolutely clear, but the opinion has been expressed that on the revival of the patent, as the remedy only during the war was suspended, the right to take action i u respect of an infringement will be restored.",29
259,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The patentee's rights continue' during the war, but his right to take action in regard to them does not.",29
260,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Assumin g that is so, then any one who uses a patent now would be subject to that liability after the war, and legislation was passed to enable licensees to be protected against being subsequently sued. These are three of the probable objects or reasons which influenced Ministers in England in putting this measure on the statute-book. As the honourable member for Flinders has shown, we have far exceeded these objects, because we are really putting beyond all doubts patents that may be open to challenge. Again, we may be inadequately protecting the rights but it of the patentee whose rights are merely suspended. If we grant an exclusive licence for an inadequate fee, we are not only preventing others, but we are not compensating the man who is deprived of all his remedies. The Imperial Parliament did not intend that, because, if so, they would not have allowed an enemy subject to keep alive a patent by paying fees, nor would they have allowed a British subject to keep alive a German patent which had not been cancelled by the war. My impression is that it would be far better to withdraw the measure and amend it . If we impose a fine of £500 for in any way using a patented article, the right which is given to another to use it under licence amounts to an exclusive licence.",29
261,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Does the honourable member suggest that the patentee should still have the right to issue a licence?,30
262,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I do not, but the honourable member for Flinders suggested that, if a licence is granted, the licensee ought to be placed in the same position as the patentee, but not a better. And we ought to see that the licensee pays an adequate consideration; otherwise we defeat one of the objects, which is to protect the patentee.",30
263,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I shall endeavour to show that the position of the patentee and the position of the licensee are not the same-that one has an effective remedy, while the other has not. Mr GLYNJ5T - At any rate, my impression is that, under the circumstances, this may be regarded as rather hasty legislation.",30
264,Sir ROBERT BEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Kooyong) [5.59] - I am at a disadvantage in not having heard the remarks of the Attorney-General, though I did hear a portion of the speech of the honourable member for Flinders. From a legal stand-point, there is not the slightest doubt that the honourable member for Flinders has established a very strong position, indeed-a n almost unassailable position. But if we depart from the strict legal aspect, and' put aside for the moment the technical objection to the introduction of the penal terms, and regard the matter from a somewhat more practical point of view, I must say that I am not prepared to condemn, in the same wholesale fashion, the provisions of the Bill as they appear. I admit that the terms of the Bill indicate a better title for the licensee than that of the original patentee, and that strikes one at first as somewhat anomalous. But we have to distinguish between the two, in the emergency that has arisen. The original German patentee holds a monopoly, and has data and material at his disposal, in order to establish his that the licensee could not hope to have. The object of our legislation is to induce our own people, in the case of large and valuable patents, to invest, possibly, large sums of money, with a view to giving the Commonwealth the benefit of the patent. If the licensee is to be harassed, and doubts thrown on his title, we are placing him in a very serious position. Sir WILLI AM IBVINE - Does the honourable member wish the Crown to grant the licensee a new monopoly for an old invention ?",30
265,Sir ROBERT BEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I even go so far as to say, in the circumstances, that that might be justifiable, in order to insure that we are not deprived of the benefits of the patent. Some assurance should be given to the Commonwealth citizen who invests his capital in the production of the commodity.",30
266,Mr WAITT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Would you pay that price for making good all patents now bad?,30
267,Sir ROBERT BEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am not referring to all patents, but valuable German monopolies. It is from the practical, or public-policy, stand-point that I wish to deal with the question. First of all, we desire to encourage the investment of capital in a particular patent which we believe to be a good one; and a man, before he invests his money, desires to know that he is reasonably secure. This is either a good or a bad policy. If it is a good policy in the interests of the public, we should encourage the production in every way, and, practically, give to the licensee a new patent in order to encourage him to invest his capital, establish an industry, and give the public the benefit of the patented article.",30
268,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Would the honourable member give encouragement in the form of a monopoly in the case of an invention as old as th© hills?,30
269,Sir ROBERT BEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Le t us start from the position that the German patentee has already got his monopoly, and that that monopoly has - not, up to date, been assailed. We will take it that the product of the monopoly is good and desirable for Australia; and we should, I submit, provide a scheme of protection for the establishment of a valuable industry, and thus give the public the benefit of the product, and workers the title, benefit of employment. We can only hope that people wil l invest their money in this way if we give some assurance as to the t it l e ; and, if necessary, we should even be prepared to go as far as I have suggested. To all intents and purposes the licensee should get a new patent; and that is a position we can justify from the public stand-point. As a matter of public policy, we give the licensee protection in order to bring about that production which previously was exclusively vested in the German patentee, and probably only known in the form of German imports.",30
270,Mr BRENNAN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Why does the honourable member wish to give the licensee more protection than we give to one of our own patentees?,31
271,Sir ROBERTBEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I start fro m the stand-point that, first of all, the German patentee has had a monopoly, and that the product of the patent is desirable for Australia. Therefore, we tell our capitalists that we will give them some assurance as to title, inasmuch as they are placed at a serious disadvantage in not being able to establish a title to the original patent in the absence of the. original material. Sometimes we give protection by means of the Tariff, but in the particular case before us, we give protection by an assurance of title.",31
272,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Sometime s we give protection by means of a bonus.,31
273,Sir ROBERT BEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"That is so; and, after all, the licence is only a different form of protection in order that the in dustry may be-encouraged, and the benefits of it enjoyed by the Commonwealth. From a public policy point of view, there is much to be said in favour of the Bill as it is presented. I do not attempt to justify the Bill from a technical or legal stand-point; but, with a view to the protection and creation of an industry, I am quite prepared to support the terms of the measure.",31
274,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Balaclava) [6.6] - The House is very much indebted to the honourable member for Flinders, who, out of the wealth of his legal knowledge in this particular direction, has given us valuable advice and guidance. Everybody knows of his wide practice and knowledge, and I think we may accept, without qualification or reservation, the legal advice that he has tendered. But I wish at once to join issue with the honourable member for Kooyong, who, unfortunately, did not hear the most telling portion of the speech of the honourable member for Flinders, and may, in his concluding sentences, have misinterpreted the honourable gentleman. The honourable member for Kooyong takes the view that it is desirable to give a doubtful title an unassailable position under the new law.",31
275,Sir ROBERT BEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,W it h the object of establishing an industry.,31
276,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"W it h the object of inducing capitalists to take up suspended or voided patents and granting them a monopoly during the currency of the licence or the period of suspension. In a general fashion, of course, we all desire to encourage the increase of manufacture, particularly of patented goods. The honourable member, however, advocates a most extraordinary view. For the sake of getting capital introduced into an industry he is prepared to grant to one person a monopoly, exclusive and unassailable.",31
277,Sir ROBERT BEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That is our patent law.,31
278,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"No , it is not. And the honourable member would refuse to, probably scores or hundreds of others, the right to embark in competitive investments. Sir WI . LI . IAMIRVINE - O u r patent law applies only to inventions that are new.",31
279,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The view of the honourable member for Kooyong on the point was that accepted u n t i l about 350 years ago. There came a time when great evils grew under the old copyrights and patents - whe n privileges and monopolies ramified in the Mother Country-and the British Parliament decided to destroy those ancient and enduring titles, good or bad, and to establish a patent Jaw on & totally different footing. First of all, there was fixed a time l i m it , and, at the expiration of the fixed period, the community was given the great benefits which it was deemed to have been paying for, by way of royalties, for fourteen years. Then we arrived at conditions which were practically copied by the civilized world as manufacture spread itself abroad. So fa r as I understand, all that any community has done in the last century in regard to terminable rights is to consent to give the patentee a certificate. But the man who undertakes the utilization of it does so with all the risks of infringementsuccessful or unsuccessful. In our patent law we do not presume to say that when a anan issues from the Patents Office with a - certificate of patent he is immune from .all attempts at competition, or the destruction of his particular rights by in-dividuals who believe that they had the thing before he invented, or perfected, or patented it. Thus we have men trading on patent rights, with vast sums of money invested in their industries, who are subject to all the risks of this kind of competitive manufacture. I think it is good that it should be so. If a patent be good, it will stand the test of the Law Courts; if it be not, it will go down. Surely is in the interests of competitive invention. But the Attorney-General and the honourable member for Kooyong apparently wish to change all that.",31
280,Sir ROBERT BEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Not at all.,32
281,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"In order to encourage the introduction of fresh capital, the honourable member is prepared, in these times of stress, to say that we should proclaim as good all these patents, which are the subject of weekly contests in the Law Courts, and which eventually find their way into the High Court. Irrespective of whether they be good or bad, we are going to proclaim them good.",32
282,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,We do not contemplate anything of the sort.,32
283,Mr SAMPSON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I do not suppose that the Government are likely to do any such thing in a wholesale way.,32
284,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I am not discussing the magnitude of the effort; I am merely showing the practical effect of the Government proposal.,32
285,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Before that could happen, licences would require to be issued.",32
286,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"It may be that a process dealing with leather or textile fabrics is held by an Austrian subject in this country, and that an application is made to suspend or void his patent. Thereupon the Attorney-General, aided by his Commissioner of Patents, may say, "" We will do neither of the things which we are asked, bnt we will issue to A, B, and Company a licence for thirteen years, which represents the unexpired portion of the title."" Now there may be half-a-dozen other applicants for suspension or voidance of that same patent. All of them may be desirous of laying down machinery and of entering into production under licence conditions, and yet the Attorney-General may say to them, ""We will give A, B, and Company a licence for that period."" That could be done whether the patent were good or bad. Under existing patent law, if it were bad, A , B, and Company would not take the risk. But if effect were given to the Government proposal, and the licence were issued, we should probably be giving a title to something which was not new, but which was probably useful",32
287,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The honourable member for Plinders will not say that. So far as the patent is concerned, the patent that rights are the basis upon which the whole fabric rests.",32
288,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I wish the honourable member for Plinders had heard that statement. What the Attorney-General says is that the Government merely propose to give a monopoly of rights as they exist.,32
289,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,We should all be content with that.,32
290,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Certainly . We cannot give more than we have.,32
291,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That was the whole burden of the argument of the honourable member for Plinders.,32
292,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"That honourable member forgot that he was in a deliberative assembly, and not in the Law Courts. Let us suppose that a licensee applies for a certain patent. Either he gets it , or he does not. If he gets it , and the patent right be bad, he gets it with that defect in it .",32
293,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Then the Attorney General does not say that in the Bill. Those who are opposing it are prepared to grant him that power. What the honourable gentleman said in reply to the honourable member for Flinders was that the Crown ought to have an unassailable right to ask for something which the subject patent holder does not possess.,32
294,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I was speaking then of civil as opposed to criminal rights.,32
295,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"And the honourable member for Kooyong suggested that this unassailable title should be given to an assailable patent. He pointed out that the original holder was possessed of the details of the process involved, whereas the transferee was not.",32
296,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I agree with the point urged by the honourable member for Kooyong, but it does not touch my point, that the licence cannot cover anything more than the patentee had.",32
297,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Let us look at tke clause, which reads(1) Where a patent, or the registration, all or any of the rights conferred by the registration, of a trade mark or design, has been suspended in favour of any person, any person other than the person in whose favour the patent, or the registration, as said, has beeu so suspended, who during such suspension(a) in the case of a patent, makes, shall be guilty of an offence. Take the case of an avoidable patent, which, for the purpose of argument, we will say is bad in point of law. A man who obtains a suspension of that patent in his favour will get the additional protection that is afforded by the circumstance that the individual who opposes him is guilty of an offence. A criminal prosecution may be launched againsb him, and in case of conviction the penalty is £500.",33
298,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I do not think that honourable member can call it a criminal prosecution.,33
299,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,It is certainly the criminal law that is exercised him ,33
300,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Hi s position is similar to that of a man who does not get his child vaccinated.,33
301,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am like one grenadiers in the celebrated charge of Balaclava in that there are cannons to the right of me, cannons to the left of me, aud, indeed, cannons all round me. I wish that these legal giants would persight, mit a layman like myself to express practical opinion. The clause affirms that where the suspension of a patent is made in favour of a particular person, any other person who exercises or vends that patent shall be guilty of a particular offence. Now, the present law does not been done to a patent. say that. If the Attorney-General has patent for any particular process, and say that I am going to take all the risks heavy penalties. of infringing it , I am not subject to criminal prosecution and to a heavy penalty, but only to civil recovery for damage which I may have done his busiquestion ness. Very well. If the Attorneythink General wishes to give the kind of right, which now exists, to the new individual or to the Crown, let him say so in this Bill , and he will not find a word jection urged from this side of the chamber. I understood that that was and what the honourable member for Flinders suggested should be done, and also the honourable member for Angas. . Let us take the other view. Let us suppose that the phrases now in the Bill are incorafore- porated in an A ct of Parliament. What will happen? Honourable members opposite will be parties to new monopolies which have not existed in British comuses, exercises, or vends the invention forming the sub- munities for over 300 years, under patent ject-matter of the patent or copyright law. Do they wish to go to bed with that kind of thing on their consciences ?",33
302,Mr WEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The honourable member need not worry. We will take care of ourselves.,33
303,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am not going to take care of the honourable member. That task might be intrusted to God Almighty with more or less success. I was dealing rather with those honourable members who have been thoughtfully participating in this discussion. Is it a fair thing that any political party-revolutionar y or rethe actionary, to use our popular platform phrases-should , under the guise of war, do a thing the intention of which may not be in that direction, but the effect of against which inevitably will be?",33
304,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Neithe r the intention nor the effect will be what the honourable member suggests. No greater monopoly will be given to the licensee than was of the vested in the patentee.,33
305,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Let me traverse that argument for the tenth and last time. I agree that that is all that should be done.; but I am content to accept my own eyeand the opinions of legal gentlemen a around me, who affirm that under this Bill the title wiU be altered and a higher right wil l be given to the transferee than that previously enjoyed by the transferror. At the present time, civil recovery is all that is possible for damage alleged to have That position a will be maintained under the new condiI tion of things, plus a prosecution and If that does not a amount to practical immunity, I do not know what does. The majority of honour the able members who will vote upon"" this are laymen, and they must either it out for themselves or accept the opinions of the legal members of this Chamber. I take leave to cut my own way through the forest and f o vote acof obcordingly. If I am present when the motion for the second reading of the Bill is put, I shall vote against it.",33
306,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Is the interpretation of the law to he settled by numbers?,34
307,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"As Carlyle said, "" We count heads to avoid breaking them,"" in this generation; and the Attorney-General is the most eloquent advocate of that principle in this country.",34
308,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"If that be so, the honourable member has more lawyers upon his side than I have upon mine.",34
309,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I do not say that the number of lawyers in this Chamber should determine the matter. There are laymen here, and they must not be afraid to enter the lists, especially when the lawyers themselves disagree. I submit that this clause would confer upon any Government enormous and dangerous powers of patronage, which they do not need, and with which they should not be intrusted. Let me put a case to illustrate my meaning. Let us assume that two men apply for the suspension of a patent, and that the suspension is granted in favour of one of them. It might be granted under the principle of preference to unionists. I do not say this with a view to throwing the apple of discord on the table. One of these men might be a unionist, and the other might not. Let us suppose that both apply to the Attorney-General for the suspension of a particular patent, and that such suspension is granted to one of them in accordance with the language of this clause. If he be true to the principles of which he is so able an exponent, he should give it in favour of the unionist.",34
310,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Why ?,34
311,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Because the honourable gentleman would believe that' the unionists would be better intrusted with the work because he was a unionist.,34
312,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Then the honourable gentleman would give>it to the non-unionist.,34
313,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,No ; because I do not believe in preference of any kind.,34
314,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,No ; the honourable gentleman onry practises it .,34
315,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I do not practise it , either. I have this preference, that where lurid adjectives are to be handed out, I prefer to apply them to my honourable friends opposite rather than to my friends on this side, but I should have no preference in the exercise of judicial [105] discretion or administrative selection, because I do not believe in it at all.",34
316,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Then why assume that I do?,34
317,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Because the honourable gentleman has said that he does.,34
318,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That is not true.,34
319,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"And because the Government, of which the honourable gentleman is a member, have said that they do.",34
320,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That is not true.,34
321,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,It is true; but the honourable gentleman's interjection is not parliamentary.,34
322,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I ask the Attorney-General to withdraw his statement.,34
323,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I withdraw it , but I now ask you, sir, to ask the honourable member for Balaclava to withdraw his statement that this Government, or any member of it, pollutes the fountain of justice and makes appointments to the Judiciary for party reasons.",34
324,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I did not say that.,34
325,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The honourable gentleman did say so. If he did not say that, he said nothing. That is a reflection which ought not to be allowed to pass.",34
326,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I followed the honourable member for Balaclava very closely, and I did not understand him to say what the Attorney General has attributed to him.",34
327,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"If I used the words or conveyed the impression attributed to me by the Attorney-General, I should not have the slightest hesitation in immediately and unqualifiedly withdrawing it , but I did not, and would not, make any such suggestion.",34
328,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The honourable gentleman spoke of the exercise by me of judicial discretion in a party manner.,34
329,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I do not know why the Attorney-General should claim to be a mentor in the matter of parliamentary manners when he is himself guilty of this unseemly behaviour. I wish to pursue the subject without any party venom. I have been led into an argument which has assumed the character of a dialogue with the honourable gentleman. I do not wish to continue that.,34
330,Mr ARCHIBALD,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,What has preference to unionists to do with this Bill?,34
331,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I am showing how it could be exercised under the Bill.,34
332,Mr ARCHIBALD,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The honourable gentleman could not lose the opportunity of making a party attack.,35
333,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I have had many opportunities to make party attacks this session which I have refrained from taking advantage of.,35
334,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member for Balaclava said, in the plainest and most unmistakable way, that I , in the exercise of my judicial discretion in regard to this matter, would exercise it so that I should give preference, not to the man who was most fit, but, for party reasons, to some other person. I resent that.",35
335,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I must repeat that, although I followed the honourable member for Balaclava very closely indeed, I did not gather from his words the meaning attributed to them by the Attorney-General. There has evidently been a misunderstanding.",35
336,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I rise this time to give the Attorney-General the assurance that I did not say that which he has attributed to me, and did not mean it. If I had used the words I should at once withdraw them. I acquit the honourable gentleman, and always have done so, of any attempt to improperly use the judicial functions intrusted to him. I was endeavouring to show that this power could be used by the honourable gentleman in the way I have described, ancl I said that, as he was an advocate of preference to unionists, it seemed to me that it should be so used by him if he were true to the principles he professes. I do not wish to continue the argument indefinitely. If the present Government were turned out of power, and the other party came in",35
337,Mr WATKINS,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,No hope!,35
338,Mr WATT,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Surely the honourable member will allow an "" if , "" which implies, not an expectation, but a hope? If that happened, I say this would then be an equally dangerous power to entrust to any body of men, if it is not absolutely necessary for the national safety. close with the observation that I trust that the Attorney-General will take counsel with the legal members on this side, who have expressed very strong views as to the legal effect of the clause which has been referred to, and that, if possible, before the Bill emerges from the Committee stage, the honourable gentleman will assure honourable members that only those rights which now exist wHJ, under the Bill, be transferred to the new holder of the patent.",35
339,Unknown,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 7.J/.5 p.m.,35
340,Mr WEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"East Sydney) [7.45] I was rather surprised at the heat displayed in the debate by certain legal gentlemen, whose training ought to have shown them that it is a great advantage in argument to keep cool; nor could I quite understand the heated manner in which the honourable member for Balaclava endeavoured to discuss the question. It struck some of us that there must be some underlying reason for this display of temper and enthusiasm over a Bill of this character. I take it to be a Bill necessitated by the present disturbed state of the patent rights law, owing to the war. Certain patentees, being enemy subjects, have been deprived of their rights under their patents, and, as there is no legal authority to carry the patents on, the Government have brought in the measure to enable licences to be issued to persons willing to do so. The Attorney-General has repeatedly stated that the licensee will have no more privileges than the original patentee. A patent is a monopoly, but honourable members on the other side have been endeavouring to impress on us the enormity of the offence of monopoly. We on this side know quite as much, and a little more, about monopolies than they do, and have taken a little more interest than they have in the various monopolies from which the people suffer. In Great Britain a number of patentees, especially German patentees, have had a great monopoly over certain scents, dyes, and patent medicines. This caused the British Government some trouble, but they overcame the difficulty by enacting that, unless the patentee manufactured the article in Great Britain within two years, he forfeited his patent rights. Some of I these German patents are absolutely essential in trade. The honourable member for Flinders referred to one connected with the laying of rails for tramways and trains. Some provision would have to be made to meet cases of that kind. Under the Patents Act, the patentee has the protection of the civil law, but if I understand this Bill aright, the protection afforded to the licensee is a maximum fine of £500 for any infringement of his licence. In view of the enormous expenditure involved in creating industries, it is essential that licences should be protected; that is what this Bill does.",35
341,Mr BOYD,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That does not apply to the particular patent referred to. No enormous capital is required for that.,36
342,Mr WEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Whether that is so or not, I have always endeavoured to encourage people to put their money into investments. The honourable member for Elinders, ably supported by the honourable member for Balaclava, seemed to display exceptional eagerness, determination, and perseverance to impress on the House that it) would, by this Bill , be creating monopolies, detrimental to the interests of those represented by us on this side. The facts, however, are plain. The honourable member for Flinders was in quite a new role in taking up the cudgels on behalf of the oppressed. The whole of the honourable member's argument is met by pointing to the circumstances of the times, which demand a Bill of this character. But for the war the measure would not be before us. The complaint of some honourable members that it is oppressive and tyrannical might be justified in ordinary times, but it has no weight now. We have had a number of ornaments of the legal profession disagreeing this afternoon, but the Attorney General has maintained his ground, and, applying to the subject that business capacity which I think I possess, I have come to the conclusion that the Bill will not have the h a r m f u l effects predicted by the Opposition. It will do what is urgently wanted towards keeping the wheels of industry going, and I shall support it .",36
343,Mr EODGERS,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,It will do something to create monopolies.,36
344,Mr WEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Many silly things are said by way of interjection. I have just explained that no monopolies will be created by the Bill . A licensee w i undertake certain obligations, and ought to have some protection.",36
345,Mr GROOM,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Darling Downs) [7.57]. - I would ask the Attorney-General to reconsider the Bill . H is desire to give adequate protection to licensees or persons in whose favour there is a suspension of a patent under the original Act appears reasonable. The original enemy patentee is blocked from operating [105]- 2 his patent, although the patent is one which it is desirable to work in the interests of the people. Our problem is to devise some protection which will encourage the person in whose favour a patent has been suspended to undertake the work. A patentee has the righ t to bring an action for damages for an in fringement of his patent. If another person is to be put into the position of a patentee, we ought to see that he has all the rights and privileges as regards the protection of his in terests that the patentee had, but this Bill makes different provision from the right of action for infringement. It gives entirely new rights. The best way to test this is to ask what are the defences that can be raised upon an action for infringement. Terrill , in his book on patent law, sets out nine different defences that may be raised by the defendant for an infringement of patent. For instance, he may(1) Deny the plaintiff's title to the letters patent sued upon. (2) He may plead the leave and licence of the patentee specifying the circumstances. (3) He may deny ""that he has committed the acts complained of in the particulars of breaches. (4) He may deny that the acts complained of are infringements of the letters patent. There are various other defences which may be raised by a person who, it is alleged, has committed a breach of a patentee's right.",36
346,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Yes , I quite agree with you there.",36
347,Mr GROOM,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"We will assume that a man has received a particular patent, ancl he has taken action, against the person for having infringed the patent. The validity of the patent can be questioned by the defence. Another defence that can be raised in an ordinary civil action is the want of novelty. As one of the Judges puts it If the public once possessed of an invention by any means whatever, no subsequent patent l l can be granted for it either to the true or first inventor himself or to any other person, for the public cannot be deprived of the right to use the invention, and a patentee of the invention could not give any consideration to the public for the grant, the public already possessing everything that he could give. That is the law as laid down by Lord Blackburn in the case Patterson versus Gas Light and Coke Co.",36
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Is it to be assumed that the Government would give to this patent a licence subject to particular risks ? "" Mr GROOM - The patent is on the register, and the man has to take his patent for what it is worth. If any one infringed it , he could bring an action against the person for an infringement. Under proposed new section 4 of this Bill , there is no provision by which a man can raise the defence and attack the original patent on the ground of want of novelty of the patent.",36
349,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I say this: He ought to be able to raise that defence; and if there is any ambiguity in the clause-and apparently there is, according to the honourable member's interpretation of it- T will be willin g to make it right, so that such a defence may be raised.",37
350,Mr GROOM,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"If the Attorney-General will look into the matter, he will see that the ground of want of novelty is one of the defences that may be set up in an ordinary action by a patentee. In any prosecution under this Bill , the person prosecuted should have the right to raise the same defence for his action as he could have raised had the action been for a breach on behalf of the original patentee. The licensee ought not to be in any better position than the patentee originally was. I would suggest a proviso enabling the defendant to raise the same defences as could be raised in an action for an infringement.  who infringed the patent in a better position.",37
351,Mr GROOM,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"No , the honourable member is mistaken. A person infringing the patent ought to have only the same right to raise the defence as he could have raised it against the original patentee; nothing more, and nothing less.",37
352,Mr MASSYGREENE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That is what the honourable member for Plinders was contending for.,37
353,Mr GROOM,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"In addition, the remarks of the honourable member for F l in ders had reference to the criminal law. The second point that was raised by the honourable member for Flinders was that the Bill was introducing a protection for the licensee which was not afforded in the original Act to the patentee. That is to say, if a man commits an infringement and a summons is issued against him, he may be fined £500 under this Bill , and this is new Protection. The honourable member for Flinders pontended that the original grantee did not have the same protection as the licensee would now have.",37
354,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I do not admit that the cases are similar.,37
355,Mr GROOM,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The person in whose favour the suspension may have been made ought only to get what the original patentee had. The right of the patentee under the original Act had something in it in the nature of a monopoly. He had the right to manufacture and sell a particular article, and could bring an action for damages and recover compensation against any person who infringed his rights. There is merit in being an original inventor; but so far as the licensee is concerned, the position is different. He obtains the right to sell any particular article by virtue of the fact that he is the first man in .",37
356,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,No ; he need not be the first man at all. The Government might grant three or four licences.,37
357,Mr GROOM,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I admit that ; but, generally speaking, the position is as I have stated. The point is that, inherently, the licensee is not entitled to any merit in connection with any discovery. Such a right is given to the original inventor to stimulate and encourage the exercise of the inventive capacity in man. But the licensee has not done anything of that sort. He takes advantage of another man's invention; but it seems now that the Attorney-General is justified in giving him something in the nature of a monopoly if a licensee says, "" I am prepared to put my capital into this venture and manufacture the article for the good of the public.""",37
358,Mr SAMPSON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"If there is competition, what would be the position?",37
359,Mr GROOM,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Assumin g that three or four men want a licence, and will manufacture, in time of war like this, it might be given to each. I know from experience that at one time certain medical requisites were required, and it was essential that they should be manufactured. Now, if a man were willing to manufacture, and said, "" In ordinary times it would uot pay me, but I amprepared to do so in the public interest if I get a monopoly,"" and if it could be shown that competition after the war would close up his factory, it would be right and proper to give him something in the nature of a monopoly, because it would be encouraging him to carry on operations for the benefit of the community as a whole. The point that we look at is this: When we do give a man a licence, what is the nature of it? How is it to be safeguarded and protected ? Then, if he has that privilege, the person who commits an infringement ought to be able to prove that the man was not entitled to it on the ground of want of novelty, or the other ground of invalidity. It is also doubtful whether we ought to enforce it by the penal provisions. I u this matter we are only trying to assist the Minister. In time of war, we ought to relax patent measures so as to be able to carry on all those in dustries that are essential to Australia.",37
360,Mr SAMPSON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Wimmera) [8.11] I have listened with a great deal of in terest to the clear exposition of the legal position by the honourable member for Flinders and the legal members who have followed him. The question of granting licences is one which no responsible Minister will consent to except after the most exhaustive investigation into the particular character of the patent, and to the nature of the application. The principle of the Bill should be to embody or carry over into the licences just exactly that measure of protection which is afforded the original patentee.",38
361,Mr BRENNAN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Can you give an illustration of one instance to the contrary ?,38
362,Mr SAMPSON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I believe that the Government laid down conditions under which the freezing factory should be erected in the Northern Territory. know that it is not quite on all-fours as an illustration, because a patent is a monopoly, and the granting of a licence by the Crown, generally speaking, is not on all-fours with the monopoly rights that exist under our patent laws. At a time like this, it is advisable that there should be some elasticity in the Act , and discretion allowed the Attorney-General in the administration of any law of this nature. For instance, in Australia we might have 500 patent rights held by Germans, and in the public interest it might be advisable for the Attorney General to cancel or avoid 480 or 490 of them to allow of the manufacture locally of articles that were formerly protected.",38
363,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Are you pared to give the Minister power to prohibit people in the Commonwealth from manufacturing thermit, or something of the kind ? A r e you prepared to give the Minister the right to stop people who are manufacturing as against a bad patent?",38
364,Mr SAMPSON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I am not prepared to discuss that just now.,38
365,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That is the whole question.,38
366,Mr SAMPSON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"No , it is not. I say it might be advisable to do so under existing circumstances. I cannot understand the intention of the Government with regard to the penal clause in the case of a breach of the licences. I cannot understand why that clause was put in. I know that that is the policy of the Government, and I take it to be acceptable to the Opposition generally; but, in my opinion, although in a majority of cases it might be desirable in the public interest that the patents held by enemy subjects should be suspended or avoided, it might also be advisable, in particular instances, for the establishment of industries useful to the Commonwealth, for the Administration to go beyond the patent rights to give security to capitalists.",38
367,Mr MASSYGREENE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That can be done by licence now.,38
368,Mr SAMPSON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I take it that no greater rights are transferred to a licensee than were possessed by the original patentee. As a matter of general principle, that is as it should be; but in certain cases it may be advisable to give to licensees more protection than was possessed by the patentees. Generally, I am in agreement with the views expressed by the honourable member for Flinders, and I accepted by the Attorney-General; but I think that there might be a reserve power which would enable a licensee to be given greater security than was possessed by the patentee, in order that important industries may be established in the Commonwealth. I do not know how far the treatment of the baser metals is dependent on patent rights, but what I suggest might be found very useful in regard to that matter.",38
369,Mr CARR,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Macquarie) [ 8 . 2 0 ] - I think that the Opposition is inclined to exaggerate the danger attendant upon the vesting of power in the At torney-General. The Leader of the Opposition said, by interjection, that pre- rights in respect of suspended patents would be granted according as the Government favoured applicants for them. No doubt that is so. But the implication that the Government, in favoring certain applicants, would act unjustly to the people as a whole is not a fair one. The Opposition must trust the Government in this matter, as those who are now supporting the Government would have to trust its successor. It is clear that there w i ll not be a rush to secure suspended patent rights. Patent questions are delicate matters to handle, and great expense would have to be incurred before any new industry of importance could be established. To successfully jump any claim would need very clever men. It is necessary to hedge with more than the ordinary security those licensed by the Goveniment to use patent rights. They run the risk of having the rights taken from them at the conclusion of the war, because the patents are only suspended, and in a re-adjustment following upon the war they might lose what had been granted to them. This alone entitles them to special protection while engaged in a manufacture which is distinctly to the advantage of Australia. I am inclined to agree with the opinion that their position should be made more secure than would be that of an ordinary patentee. . Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond) [8.23] The further the discussion proceeds, the less need there appears to be for the Bill . Under the A ct which it is proposed to amend two alternatives were open to the Attorney-General. He could continue the old patents, and grant licences to any one who applied to him for permission to carry on any particular process or manufacture which was protected.",38
370,Mr AKCHIBALD,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,How many licences would have been applied for?,39
371,Mr MASSYGREENE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The presumption would be that if a great many licences were applied for in regard to any particular industry it would pay a great many persons to manufacture the patented article.,39
372,Mr ARCHIBALD,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,There would be applications at all.,39
373,Mr MASSYGREENE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The Minister will see, if he turns up the list of patents"" granted to enemy subjects, that by far the greater number of them apply to articles already manufactured in Australia. For instance, improvements in connection with harrows for attaching to seed-drills have been patented. There are in Australia many persons engaged in the manufacture of seed-drills. ""Why should not they be permitted to apply to. the Attorney-General for a licence to use this patent during the currency of the war? Why should not the right to use the patent be given to every individual who wished to use it?",39
374,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Why have licences not been applied for in these cases?,39
375,Mr MASSYGREENE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Presumably , because it would not pay manufacturers to use the patent rights. The other alternative open to the Attorney-General was, on application, to suspend a patent altogether, in which case any person in Australia could manufacture the patented article. In regard to the thermit process, the Attorney-General has suspended the patent in favour of a particular individual. If , instead of doing that, he had granted a licence to every individual who desired to use the process, he would have done all that was needed. If a number of persons in Australia wished to take up that process, I cannot see why they should not be allowed to do so, or why a monopoly in regard to it should be given to one individual.",39
376,Mr CARR,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,In some manufactures a monopoly must be assured to offer an in ducement to a manufacturer to take up the business.,39
377,Mr MASSYGREENE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"If that be so, when the Attorney-General granted a licence, and a firm commenced, to manufacture the patented article, no one else would attempt to enter the business, because it would not pay. I protest against the granting of a monopoly to any individual.",39
378,Mr CARR,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The honourable member knows something of the risks of business.,39
379,Mr MASSYGREENE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"If half-a-dozen persons are prepared to take those risks, why should they not be permitted to do so? If half-a-dozen persons are willing to in vest capital in the manufacture of an article protected by Germau patents, why should not they have a free hand to do no so?",39
380,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"They can do so, except in cases where a patent has been suspended by operation of the Statute, and a licence granted. For nine months the public has had the right to do what the honourable member says should be permitted.",39
381,Mr MASSYGREENE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Onl y upon applying to the Attorney-General for the suspension of a patent.,39

I quite understand that tliere may be many businesses governed by the possession of patent rights which have been suspended, whose establishment would be very advantageous to the Commonwealth, in which, if a man could not get the whole trade into his hands as a monopoly, it would not be worthwhile to invest capital. I have risen to ask the Attorney-General whether he will be prepared to accept an amendment providing that where a patent is suspended, and a licence granted in respect of it , the licensee will not be put in a stronger position than was occupied by the original patentee.",40

393,Dr MALONEY,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Victoria ) [8.32] This Bill is of far more importance than it would at first sight appear to be. I take it that in this time of dire trouble, arising from the terrible war, if the Government confiscate any patent rights at all, they should hold them for the benefit of the whole community. In a case to which reference has been made during this debate, Mr Chinn, who was dismissed from his employment in connection with t.he construction of the K a l goorlie to Port Augusta railway, because he Avas a Labour man, applied to have a certain patent right suspended. Mr. Chinn, I believe, is a much-wronged man. When he made this application and sought to secure a licence to use the patent, he was opposed by another man who has been greatly benefited in connection with the railway to which I have referred; but the evidence in support of the application was so clear that Mr . Teesdale Smith retired, I believe, from the case. The patent related to the welding of rails, and certainly is an important one. As a member of the party of whom the Government are the mouthpiece, I wish to urge that if any man or body of men be deprived of patent rights in the stress of this terrible war, then all patent rights so suspended should be held by the Government for the benefit of the whole community.",40
394,Mr SAMPSON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That might be advisable in regard to a certain class of patents.,40
395,Dr MALONEY,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The inventor of a patent rarely reaps any reward. The harvest is usually gathered by capitalists. That great mechanical genius, Mergenthaler, the inventor of the linotype, was allowed to die in misery in Chicago. The wretched men who held his patent even desired to remove his name from the machine which he invented, but that was prevented by the patent laws of the United States of America. Mergenthaler, however, never derived the full benefit from his invention. I hope that the Government will certainly reserve for the benefit of the whole community any patent rights in regard to means of locomotion-paten t rights relating to trains and tramways-that may he suspended or annulled. The honourable member for Wimmera, who interjected a few moments ago, probably thinks that it would not be worthwhile for the Government to take over the patents in respect of the manufacture of certain goods. Where that is not done, a licence granted to an individual to exercise the patent should not operate for any considerable length of time. The Government should always control the monopoly of patents. I would welcome the establishment of a Government workshop, where a man could experiment with his invention and submit it to tests. If that were done, then the Government, having assisted the man to develop his invention, should be entitled to a moiety of the benefits arising from it, or it could take over the whole patent, and allow the patentee a bonus in respect of every machine or article manufactured.  tract for the Government.",40
396,Dr MALONEY,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The Government often have to face big contracts. We heard much the same kind of yelp when it was first proposed that the Government should take over the Post Office, the education of the young, ancl a thousand and one other public instrumentalities.  over a thousand and one things.",41
397,Dr MALONEY,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The Government of Japan, in connection with the tobacco monopoly alone, have taken over the manufacture of a thousand different things. I do not wish to delay the passing of this Bill. I have full confidence in the Attorney-General, who is to be given these practically unlimited powers. The eyes of Australia will be upon him, and I am sure he will not do anything to injure his party or to lower the glorious flag of Labour.",41
398,Mr RODGERS,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Wannon) [8.37] The more we discuss this measure the greater are the difficulties with which we are confronted, and the more we have to look not so much at its legal aspects as at the objects sought to be achieved by it. I take it that the Blouse is anxious to commercialize the period of the war. We are anxious that some use shall be made of certain patents that are placed at the disposal of the community, and which deal very often with absolute essentials. They may relate to war material, to the construction of rails and other Government requirements. There are two points of view that we must not disregard. The legal aspect has been put very clearly by lawyers in the House, who have reminded us that Australia has fallen into line with all other civilized countries, in so far that it has declared by law its intention to grant monopolies for a period of fourteen years to the patentees of all inventions. By the Commonwealth Act of 1914 patents held by enemy subjects have been suspended, aud the debate to-night has centred round the question whether the Government should grant licences to manufacture or vend the goods to which these patents relate in competition with those who are prepared to take on what, I think, is a most insecure position. When the honourable member for Kooyong put the industrial side of the question before the Chamber, I did not follow him clearly. I now see that those who are going to carry on industries in this country under rights that are, to some extent, emasculated, must have a greater security than has been suggested inferentially by those who have said that no greater rights can be given to a licensee than are possessed by the holder of the patent to which it relates. I recognise that there is a good deal, from a legal, and also a moral, point of view, in the contention regarding the granting of greater privileges to licensees than we would give to ordinary patentees. This community, by no act of its own, has been deprived of the advantages which accrued to it under certain original patent rights, and we have to decide how it can make use of those patents, relating, it may be, to commodities essential to the life and well-being of the community. It can do so only by some form of concession or privilege. We cannot dogmatize as to what the exact nature of that privilege should be; but it seems to me that the Government would do well if, instead of granting licences on a wholesale scale, it would confine its attention to patents relating to commodities that are essential to the needs of the country, in the hope that the war will not be of long duration. There is something to be said for the contention that the declaration of war deprived certain people of patent rights. The Mother Country, however, has seen fit not to wholly confiscate those rights, and has passed legislation such as that now before us. I hope that the Attorney General, in replying to the arguments that have been advanced, will traverse the practical, as well as the legal, side of the tion, and show how it is possible to get men of business knowledge and commercial enterprise to enter upon these undertakings unless they are given some form of security that, during the period of the war and for a considerable time thereafter, their right to use the patents concerned will be continued in such a way as to place them in the position of the original holder of the monopoly. The term "" monopoly "" at first causes one some alarm, but our own patent laws create an absolute monopoly for a period of fourteen years in respect of every patent granted. Any man who is prepared to take up an established industry, and to carry it on for the unexpired term of the' patent relating to it, seems to me to require substantial protection.",41
399,Mr FENTO N,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Maribyrnong) [8.42]. - I hope that the Attorney-General will not be disposed to pay too much attention to the arguments of the Opposition, and to so alter this Bill that those who engage in certain industries here may be insufficiently protected. As the result of the war, we are living in exceptional times, and the Government of Britain have recognised this fact in regard to the patent law. I read only a few days ago that they were ready to stand behind those who were prepared to enter upon the manufacture of dyes and other materials that are so essential to the community-anc l to stand behind them to the extent of millions of pounds. Mr. JOSEPH Coos - B y lending money straight out to them. Mr Fenton"" - I am not particular as to what form the encouragement shall take.",42
400,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"But the encouragement offered by the British Government does not take the form of prohibiting citizens from continuing to carry on manufactories which they are honestly working. The Government, by this Bill, will create a monopoly, with all the worse mischiefs of monopoly, if they validate a - bad patent.",42
401,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I believe that the honourable member's fears will'be dispelled by the Attorney-General's reply.,42
402,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Yes , if he will accept an amendment.",42
403,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"In other words, the honourable member says that if the Attorney-General will accept his view all will ques- be well. I do not agree with him. T hardly approve of the sort of tacit consent that the Attorney-General has already given to the suggestion that those who are licensed to carry on certain works to which patent rights relate sliould have no more rights than were enjoyed by the original patentees.",42
404,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Why should they?,42
405,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The ""honourable member for Kooyong has replied to the honourable member's contention. I am not going to be a stickler for the legal features of this question. I shall vote with the object of trying, as far as possible, to establish in Australia industries that have previously been carried on in Germany. I wish to see Australian workmen manufacturing goods previously supplied to us by Germany.",42
406,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,We all do.,42
407,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I do not know why the honourable member for Flinders is so disturbed about this matter. I cannot see in clause 4 the awful danger that he sees. He has had a nightmare over the provision. Evidently he has studied the measure and come to the House prepared to debate it . Honourable members paid him every attention while he was dealing with what I admit is a very intricate subject from the legal and technical point of view. My endeavour is to bring a practical mind to bear upon the question, because I believe that it has a practical, as well as a legal and technical, the side, and my hope is that under the provisions of the Act now in existence and the Bill now before us, the Government will be able to take in hand some of the patents which it is absolutely essential should be under their control. I think that every honourable member will agree to the action taken by the Attorney General in granting the power to operate a certain patent to the Engineer-in-Chief of Commonwealth Railways instead of suspending the patent rights in order that a few of the cutest men in Australiamight get a licence to operate them. In other words, he has made that particular patent a Commonwealth monopoly, and the honourable member for Kooyong and others will agree with ine that the At torney-General has enabled the Commonwealth to take over something which will be of immense financial benefit to Australia, and will be very helpful indeed. In the event of a licence being granted to persons who wish to be secured for a number of years before they lay down plant costing a certain sum of money, I should like to know from the Attorney General whether the Commonwealth will draw royalty during the time those persons are manufacturing under the terms of their licence. If that is the case, not only shall we get employment for our own people, but also we shall have continual revenue from this source.",42
408,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"No licence has been issued without the condition of the payment of royalty except, of course, in regard to a licence to the Crown.",43
409,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Grea t Britain , which has nob the Protectionist policy that I hope we shall have in a few months' time, has adopted another method of protecting British workmen and employers. I understand that if a German or Frenchman who has patent rights in Great Britain , is selling in Great Britain manufactured outside, he is given two years in which to establish his works in the United Kingdom for the manufacture of the goods he sells there under his patent. If he does not establish, his factory in Great Britain the patent is voided.",43
410,Sir ROBERT BEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I remember having son."" introduced a similar provision in the amending Patents Bill in 1909.",43
411,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am pleased to hear that, but I ask whether any person selling goods manufactured in another country an industry? under patent rights obtained in Australia must, after two years, manufacture them here? If that is the case the law is certhat tainly not being obeyed, or our importaof tions would not be so large. It is i possible for a man to spend a large sum of money in the establishment of an i dustry unless he has some security of tenure. The Attorney-General gave us of aliens. an illustration. He said: "" If £50,000 is needed for the manufacture of certain articles which hitherto have been made in and the question will Germany or Austria, can we expect any their disposition after the war. person or persons to erect the necessary buildings and lay down the plant at that initial expenditure without some securperson to another. it y ? "" We cannot expect it , and consequently, unless the Government take up the manufacture of any of the thingscovered by patent rights held in Germany, or unless we give encouragementto private enterprise, it will not be done. I do not wish to see this legislation continue for the period of the war only. I trust that we shall be able to continue it under certain patent rights, or licences even after the war, so thar,. Australia may enjoy the privileges hitherto enjoyed by Germany, which we have patronized very well indeed. I trust that, the Attorney-General will not give way to the persuasiveness of honourable members opposite, and I hope that in Committee we shall be able to frame a Bill that will have, as its first object, the protection of Australian interests. I am out to protect Australian interests in this as. in any other measure we have before us; and I hope that when the Bill finally leaves this House and the Senate it wiil' be framed so as to benefit Australiansand Australian industries.",43

420,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Th © royalties are fixed by the Minister, who may alter them as circumstances suggest.",44
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"To all intents and purposes it is practical appropriation. If these licences are not to confer a free and full advantage of the monopoly the patent gives to the patentee, there will be little inducement to our industrialists in Australia to take advantage of patents and embark large sums of money in them in the belief that they are securing a monopoly.",44
422,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,What the right honourable gentleman is saying is a complete answer to what the honourable member for Plinders has said.,44
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I have heard the honourable member for Kooyong and some others claiming that the man in whose favour the suspension is made should have no more rights than were possessed by the original patentee. W hy give any person any further rights of an exclusive and monopolistic character?,44
424,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,He will not get further rights.,44
425,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Yes ; the essence of the clause is the word "" favour."" We have "" in whose favour "" also "" suspension in favour "" of a person to the exclusion of some other persons. If that be not discrimination-if it not the very essence of monopoly, should like to know what it is.",44
426,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,It is the transfer of a ciency today. monopoly from one person to another.,44
427,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Exactly , and there is not much relief to the community in the process.",44
428,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,The royalties are the relief to the community.,44
429,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"But I underof stand that after the war they become the property of the patentee. We grant a complete monopoly over the article such as was possessed by the original patentee. I do not think there is very much ground for argument as to the effect of this legislation on new Australian industries. I cannot se© how any man who has a huge sum of capital ready to be sunk for the purpose of creating a new industry will take it on with all th© disabilities which the Attorney-General imposes upon him, or which ar© potential in the proposition. That leads me to the position I wish to put as a layman, looking at the matter from the outside, without any reference to fiscal theories or that sort of thing. Why should we hamper the community in its industrial operations by conferring any favour upon any particular individual to the exclusion of other individuals in the community ? Many of the things in daily use are subject to patent rights. In our Post Office we use, or we did until very recently, material of an absolutely in ferior character because of the existence of patent rights. Here is a chance to relieve the community fro m a disability imposed upon it by the exercise of patent rights by German or other enemy patentees. I refer particularly to the jacks that we used to use in the telephones. Years ago, we had to use a particular type of jack, and, though th© experts of the Department said that there was a very much superior article to be obtained, we were prevented from using it because of these patent rights. I understand that that condition of affairs in some respects still continues. Here is an opportunity in this Bill to relieve the community of many of these any patents held by the enemy, and to make it most effective in its assistance to many very of our industrial enterprises.",44
430,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"This Bill , and the Act it amends, only apply to enemy patents.",44
431,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"But the Attorbe ney-General knows to what extent these I enemy patents enter into many of the things which make up our industrial effiI n fact, it is only during this war time that wa have realized to what an extent Germany has been allowed to monopolize many of these things, and I want to be shown why, when these patent rights have been suspended, and suspended almost, if not quite, to a point confiscation, they should be tied up any more from the community, and in that manner made to interfere, as I suggest this will interfere, with the general particular industrial efficiency?",44
432,Sir ROBERT BEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,There is not much chance of their being applied to a similar invention. The Bill will only affect the bigger industries. Mr JO d EPHCOOK - I do not know. All I know is that we are legislating to put discriminating power into the hands of the Government.,45
433,Sir ROBERT BEST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"But who wil l apply for the patents? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I feel sure tliere will be a great rush of applications for many of these patents, particularly in these days when prices are ruling high and the temptation to industrial enterprise is very great. I only want to see the best done for our industrialists in Australia, and for the life of me I cannot understand how it can benefit our industries as a whole if any one individual is given a right as against the rest of the in dustries of Australia. During the currency of these patents our industrial efficiency is lessened. Now, owing to this cataclysmic upheaval we are relieved of that kind of thing, yet this Bill , it seems to me, is going to take what advantage we have, as the outcome of the war, and place it at the disposal of the Government, with the idea of its being given again into the control of some individual as against the community as a whole. An y Government will have to use a power like this with great discrimination, for, if two or three people apply for the same patent, only one can get it . Therefore, there is to be favour. That is the word used in clause 3. Favour wil l have to be shown by the Government to one man as against another. A protecting ring is to be drawn round one man to the exclusion of all others. They may be equal in their ability to the man who gets into the inner circle by the rights conveyed by this clause, and I should like to hear some further argument on that aspect of the Bill-wh y there should be any discrimination at all in favour of individuals, seeing that the war has given us possession of rights that were formerly held by enemy patentees. That is the position which appeals to me under this Bill . I certainly think that tude taken by the honourable members for Flinders and Darling Downs is correct, and that we should confer no further powers upon a licensee than were possessed by the original patentee. cannot conceive that any harm would come to our industrial enterprises as a whole if such a limitation were placed in this Bill . My own impression is that, by spreading the operation of the Bill over the whole of our industries, we should be giving infinitely more relief to the community generally than we shall give by granting a monopoly to any one individual.",45
434,Mr BRENNAN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Batman) [ 9 . 8 ] - I think the House may congratulate itself that the Bill has brought from members of the Opposition expressions of opinion of a much more f r a n k and hearty character than they were disposed to favour us with in connection with a former war measure. W it h my friend the honourable member for Maribyrnong, I realise that if even a junior member of the legal profession rises to speak, his action immediately leads to the impression that he will naturally take that peculiarly technical and unstable view-ofte n unpracticalknown as the legal view, as against the view of those persons whose business it is to express practical opinions in matters of this kind. I have always felt, and I still feel, that there is not, in a matter of this kind, as wide a gulf between the technical and legal and the practical position as some honourable members suppose; and I should like to put forward one view in connection with clause 3 which, perhaps, should be more properly debated in Committee, but which has been full y discussed on the second reading. Mr JosEi'ir Coon - That clause really is the Bill .",45
435,Mr BRENNAN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"It contains the main principles of the Bill , and it is a curious thing that the Protectionist argument should have been so used to buttress that clause as it at present stands. Does it occur to honourable members that if the Protectionist argument is to apply at all the effect of this clause will be to protect German patents, because these German patents are to be suspended, we assume, for a period which will end either with the termination of the war at the earliest, or some time before the expiration of the period for which the patents exist ? the atti- Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The latter, according to the Attorney-General.",45
436,Mr BRENNAN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"If it is merely for a brief period, then as soon as the war is over we may suppose that the original I patentees will seek to become possessed of their patents again, together with all their patent rights. Many hope not, and I express no opinion ahout it , but I suggest that, as one phase of the question, these patent rights will be re-established, and in the result we shall have the extraordinary anomaly that we shall have been preserving from attack under a special form of Protection a patent which belongs to an alien enemy.",45
437,Mr FENTON,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,We commandeer it .,46
438,Mr BEENNAN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"If we do, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong says, commandeer it , we may be prescribing for the unexpired period of the patent. A monopoly which is open to attack could not stand the test.",46
439,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"That is the suggestion, anyway.",46
440,Mr BRENNAN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"S u r e l y we ought to have some explanation from the Attorney General regarding this proposal. What is the object? I cannot conceive why these particular patents in the hands of a licensee are to be treated in a different way from other patents. Why should they be protected from, attack? Why should we say, as we are saying in this Bill , that we will protect patents owned by Germans-by alien enemies? We are going to take them over, and clause 3 establishes special laws for their protection. It may be that the patent to which the law will apply will be a perfectly rotten thing. There are hundreds, I suppose thousands, of patents issued already, and to be issued, in Australia, which would not stand a moment's attack if they were to be attacked. Y e t , if they are taken over as patents issued to enemy aliens, they will have the advantage of this clause, which protects them from oil attack, because the Bill imposes a very severe penalty, as has already been pointed out, upon any person seeking to manufacture the article in question. At the present time anybody may start manufacturing, and his righ t to manufacture is a matter to be tested under civil law. If that is Protection, it is the kind of Protection to which I do not, as a practical person, or as a legal person, propose to lend any support. Protection, as I understand it , is the price, or, as I prefer to call it , the subsidy, paid to manufacturers in the for m of duty to enable them to set up local industries in this country. In that case, there is some competition at the worse, unless we have absolute prohibition. In the case of these patents we have absolute prohibition. A patent may be the rottenest in the world ; it may be incapable of standing any investigation or opposition if such were applied to it ; but because it has been taken over by the Government, and a licence issued to some persons to manufacture the article, it is to be exempted from the ordinary laws relating to patent rights.",46
441,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I have already stated half-a-dozen times that that is not so, or, if it be so, it is not intended.",46
442,Mr BRENNAN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am very glad to have that assurance; but the words of the Bill certainly appear to convey what I have stated, and I venture to suggest that they may convey that meaning to the Courts when they are called upon to answer any question relating to such patents.",46
443,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [9.17] - I think the House is to be congratulated upon its freedom, during this discussion, from all the traditional ties that usually hamper its eloquence and powers, and on the manner in which it has approached this measure. Certainly, if one had time, it would be easy to show that the arguments of various members are effective in one thing, at any rate;, that is to say, they are mutually destructive. The view taken by the honourable member for Flinders, for instance, applied to that taken by the right honourable member for Parramatta, shows a conflict, not only as to the purposes of the Bill , but also as to the whole scope of the Act which the Bill is to amend. However, I shall not serve any useful purpose by continuing along these lines, and I desire only to say to the House that I thoroughly appreciate the manner in which the measure has been approached. It is perfectly true that t h a Bill has been criticised, but, on the whole, I think not unfairly . Very likely its purposes have been misapprehended; possibly, the verbiage of the Bill is responsible for that. There has been in some quarters evidence of a misapprehension of the scope and purpose, not only of this measure, but of the principal Act of 1914. I think I cannot do better than quote what I said in introducing that Act , because I then dealt with a number of points raised by the Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members as to the scope and intention of the measure, and because these directly deal with many points raised in the debate on this Bill . On page 604 of the Hansard debates for November, 1914, I am .reported as having saidWe are at war with Germany and with Austria, but we do not propose to violate any principle of international law, or to sanction the expropriation of private property. A fund will be created from the royalties received which may be used to compensate at the conclusion of the war, and to the extent demanded by the circumstances in each particular case, the original patentee for the use of his patent. I do not put this provision forward on the low ground that we should do unto others what we hope they may do unto us; I put it on the liigher ground that a civilized community has no right to take away private property, whioh inheres as much in a patent as in any other form of property. Civilized warfare does not interfere with the property of individual enemies; this is now one of the settled principles of international law.",46
444,Sir JOHN FORREST,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,What about the .evidence in this morning's newspaper?,47
445,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I was about to say that circumstances have occurred since delivered that speech which make it fectly clear that this is not a settled principle of international law, for i certainly being daily violated by our enemies. Sir WILLIAM . IRVINE - It is, i speak of civilized nations.",47
446,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I agree with the orable member. We may say, then, that expropriation of private property is forby bidden by international law and is opwe posed to the practice of civilized nations. If I may adopt the emendation of the honourable member for Flinders, and apply my remarks to "" civilized nations,"" I stand by my original statement. I conthe tinuedWhat we propose is in proper cases to offer facilities for the use of patents now possessed by alien enemies, so that persons may manufacture or produce or use locally articles protected by these patents, which the community would otherwise not be able to obtain. The period and conditions of the licences must be sucb as will induce persons to set about the manufacture of these articles in this country, and the circumstances of each case must be considered separately. Those are the principles which underlie the original measure. I venture to say that they are principles with which every honourable member in the House is in accord. They recognise, first of all, the fundamental principle-and it is a fundamental principle, although it has been of late foully violated-that private property is not subject to expropriation in civilized warfare. It recognises that a patent right is granted primarily to encourage the in ventor, and, secondly, to protect the in terests of the community. It limits a monopoly to a period, at the expiration of which the patent is free to all. And usually a patent ""is available to the community during the term of the patent on payment of a price which sometimes takes the for m of a royalty. The 1914 Act, recognising these principles, was drafted to deal with very special circumstances. In that measure the Minister is given power to suspend or avoid a patent. In all that has been said to-night, the exercise of the power to avoid a patent has not been affected or called into question, because if a patent right be avoided, then ipso facto it becomes the common property of the whole nation; if it be suspended wholly or in part, and a licence be granted to an individual, then the matter is in a I different position. The Leader of the perOpposition asked why a licence should be granted to a particular person, and why t is we did not leave it open. In some cases it is left open. And in every case where a patent is avoided it becomes common f you property, and any one may use it , but in deciding whether a patent ought to be honsuspended or avoided we must look at the circumstances. If the patent is such that avoiding it the people may get it , then avoid it ; but if it is such that by avoiding it we simply cut off our nose to spite our face, then we suspend it , and give a licence to some person or persons can who are able and willin g to engage in manufacture or sale of that article so that the community may get it .",47
447,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"You do not grant licences where you suspend the patent, do you?",47
448,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"We grant a licence where we suspend the patent. We suspend the patent in favour of some person, with certain reservations. In the avoidance and in the suspension it is the welfare of the community that is looked at.",47
449,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"As a matter of fact, they do not avoid patents in England.",47
450,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am speaking of what _ we do in Australia. I was saying that in all cases the welfare of the community is the first consideration. Where a patent is of such, a character that avoidance will make it available to the community, we avoid it ; where the effect of avoidance will be to place the patent out of reach of the community, we suspend it and make arrangements for its manufacture by a licensee. Mention has been mad© to-night of th© Thermit process. I may briefly refer to the matter. Applications were made by Mr Henry Chinn and Mr Teesdale Smith for a suspension of a number of the patent rights involved in that process, but I was unable to see my way clear to grant the application. The application had to be considered from the stand-point of the community. It was very desirable that the public should have an opportunity of using the Thermit process, and it was highly undesirable that the benefit of that use should vest in the German patentee. That being so, a licence was issued practically to the Crown itself, in the name of one of the departmental officers.",47
451,Mr RODGERS,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"""Would the royalties preserve the original interests?",48
452,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I will come to effect of royalties generally in a minute. public. I have mentioned what happened in regard to the Thermit process. In giving effect to the principles I have mentioned, we must have regard to three thingsth© welfare of th© community, the rights of the patentee, and the rights of the licensee. The rights of the community are clear and paramount; and the rights of the licensee and those of the patentee royalty. must not be regarded if they are inconwith sistent with the rights of the community. One of the rights of the community to have access to the patented article; and to do that in a great number of cases it is necessary to offer an induceare ment to some person to go on manufacshall turing it . To that end we must security of tenure, so that, when is over and the measure lapses, the the licence may continue for a period terminous with that of the patent right. At present, a licensee has a right to manufacturing and vending a patented article for, let us say, ten years; the war ceases, or even now, he has'no protection from infringement. B u position is incompatible with the purpose of the Statute, which is the general good of the community. The community is given an opportunity to have the benefit of the patent. But, unless the licensee be protected, this is not possible. I come now to another phase of the matter. In every case in which a licence has been issued a maximum price has been set forth in that licence, in order to protect the community against exploitation. The rights of a patentee are safeguarded by a royalty, and the rights of th© Crown are safeguarded by the same means; the royalty does not necessarily flow wholly to the patentee or wholly to the Crown. This measure has been assailed from so many different points that it is difficult to deal with them all, but I am endeavouring to do so. As I say, the royalty f u n d is not necessarily wholly at the disposal of the patentee. First of all, it has to await the terms of peace, and, secondly, its disposition has to await the decision of this or some future Parliament and the Government which exercises the Executive power. The Crown is surely entitled to some consideration for having carried on the business of the patentee; and the fees enable the Crown to recoup itself in part for the time and effort expended in carrying out these meathe sures on behalf of patentees and the I come now to the proposal in the Bill . We find the licensee is in a fix. While we have given a licence for which a licensee pays a royalty, he is exposed to the competition of any person in Australia-an y man may com© along and us© for nothing that for which he is paying a Clearly that is incompatible the fair rights of the licensee ancl th© fair rights of the community. The is community is not concerned so much about an opportunity to manufacture the article as that some person or persons, who able and willin g to manufacture it , be put in a position to do so; give and clearly no man will manufacthe war ture unless he sees some margin of rights of profit and some security of tenure. conI t , therefore, is necessary to give the licensee an assurance that the rights he go on has cannot be enjoyed by any one excepting a person to whom a similar licence but when has been granted by th© Crown. I may here state the principles actuating the t this Ministry in this regard. Licences are granted to one or to several persons, aecording to the nature of th© patent rights. Where it is such a patent that one person can easily manufacture sufficient foil the whole of Australia, the licence is granted to one person; where there is ample opportunity for several, licences are extended to several. Otherwise, no man would put enough capital into a business to insure that ample supply for the community that we desire. I now come to the manner in which we propose to give a licensee those rights that are necessary to induce him to invest his capital and to insure him against competition, generally, by unauthorized persons. Under the Bill we give the licensee rights that a patentee does not possess. The patentee, at the present time, has a right to sue in a Civil Court for damages for infringement. That is his only remedy; and, according to the honourable member for Balaclava, he has had no other remedy for 350 years. It has been urged tonight by the honourable member for Balaclava and others that this Bill is a new departure, which creates a new criminal offence, and that we have no right to give a licensee remedies other than those given to a patentee. That view, in my opinion, is quite wrong. It is assumed, in the first place, that the licensee is exactly the same position as the patentee, but, as a matter of fact, he is not. A licensee during the war, no doubt, might be given the right to sue for infringement, just as a patentee may sue; but both during the war and after the war a licensee will be in a position quite different from that of a patentee. ""When a patentee comes into Court, he is the only person who can sue for infringement. His monopoly is complete, and excludes the whole world; he alone has the right, against all the world, to make or sell article. If he can prove that anybody has infringed his right, the damages are measured by the circumstances. But a licensee, when he comes into Court, cannot, like the patentee, say that he has a monopoly against the world-that nobody else can sue for infringement, for he has not an absolute monopoly. He shares it with the patentee and with other licensees, for the patentee never loses his right to sue for infringement. It is perfectly obvious that the damages given to the licensee for infringement of his right cannot be those ordinarily given to a patentee.",48
453,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,Where does licensee get any right to bring an action - for infringement? Mr Hughes.,49
454,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I do not say that he has any riglit, but supposing we give him that right, the question then is, is he in as good a position as a patentee is ordinarily? Obviously not. I now come to another point. I think that a licensee, under this Bill, should be put in a better position than a patentee is ordinarily, because a licensee is a trustee for the community, for the purpose of establishing a new industry and creating a new opportunity for the - people of Australia. He is acting as the licensed agent of the Crown for a public purpose, and we ought to protect him by some special means, in order that he may not be put to the expense and difficulty involved in seeking redress by civil process. I know that this measure is a blow at my honoured profession, and I realise that there will be some ""weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth."" I know that, under the patent law, there are opportunities for advising clients in regard to infringements-of egging them on, holding them back, or leading them this or that way-opportunitie s glorious in themselves, though perhaps disastrous into the unfortunate clients. I venture to say that, nevertheless, the method proposed by the Bill is absolutely fair and proper in the circumstances. We create, as it were, a new kind of patentee, who has to carry on a business for the benefit of the community. And are we not going to safeguard hinj? Are we going to throw around his neck a millstone of litigation at the end of the war? What will happen at the end of the war ? Germany will make every effort to regain her trade. She will not hesitate, in the the Courts of this and every other country, to endeavour, with financial and other assistance, to once again get hold of that ever-increasing volume of trade that was hers before the war. We desire to provide beyond all possible doubt that these licensees shall be safeguarded, and that any man who puts his money into a business under licence shall be assured during the currency of the licence that he is safe against any attempt to chouse him out of his rights. I now come to a point raised by the honourable members for Plinders, Angas, and Darling Downs, that we are giving a licensee more than a patentee had. In an action for infringement of patent rights the defendant is at liberty to prove a that the patent is bad, and ought to be revoked on the ground that it is not new, and to set up a number of other defences. Very well. I quite agree with those who say that these defences ought to be given to defendants under this Bill . I think it is fair and proper. When the honourable member for Flinders contended that this B i ll would give to the licensee more than the patentee himself enjoyed, I did not accept his statement. I said that it would not. But having since looked into the matter, I say that it is very questionable whether that view might not be fairly argued. When the honourable member for Darling Downs was speaking, I said that if ambiguity existed in the Bill I would remove it by stating in plain words exactly what is intended. What I wish to convey is that under this measure we propose to give every licensee the rights, whatever they were, of the patentee. If the patent contains a defect we do not intend to cure it in this way. We intend only to relieve the licensee of any necessity for maintaining his righ t in a civil Court; but, if the patent itself is bad, then the welfare of the community must be regarded, and in such circumstances the monopoly will cease, and the patent rights be evenly distributed over the whole body of the people. There is one more point that I desire to make. This provision-as I have said previously-is intended to defect in the Act of 1914, which took away from the patentee the right to sue for infringement, and gave that right to nobody else, nor, even to the Crown. The powers given under clause 4, and the penalties which may be imposed upon any person who makes, uses, exercises, or vends a patent, ought not in my opinion to be exercised save by the Attorney General or some person authorized on his behalf. It is not a right which should be used by any man v/ho chooses to draw a bow at a venture. It is a remedy which should be used only in a proper case. Consequently I intend, in Committee, to move such amendments as will make that position perfectly clear. The Act of 1914 has been used for the benefit of the community, and, although we have not been able to exercise its provisions as freely as we would have liked, that has not been clue to any f a u l t of the Government, but to the fact that very few applications have been made for suspension or avoidance of patents. The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Richmond mentioned a number of cases in which patent rights were retarding the manufacture of better or useful articles. To them. I say: "" There is the Act ; let the public take 'advantage of it . "" If there is any German patent which can be manufactured in Australia, is the enterprise of the people of this country so hamstrung as not to take advantage of it? I invite them to do so, and they may rest assured that this measure will be utilized to protect the community, and to encourage the manufacture in Australia of articles which are covered by German and Austrian patents. Question resolved in the affirmative. B i ll read a second time. In Committee: Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3After section three of the principal Act the following section is inserted :*' 4 -(1. ) Where a patent, or the registration, and all or any of the rights conferred by the registration, of a trade mark or design, has been suspended in favour of any person, any person other than the person in whose favour the patent, or the registration, as aforesaid, has been so suspended, who during such suspension(a) in the case of a patent, makes uses exercises or vends the invention formcure a ing the subject-matter of the patent; or (b) in the case of a trade mark, uses in respect of the goods in respect of which it is registered, the trade mark or a mark substantially identical with the trade mark or so nearty resembling it as to be likely to deceive; or (c) in the case of a design, applies the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation of it to any article in respect of which the design is registered, or, without the authority of the person in whose favour the registration has been suspended, sells or offers or keeps for sale any article to which the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation of it has been applied, shall be guilty of an offence. Penalty: Five hundred pounds. "" (2.) Upon the conviction of any person for an offence against sub-section (1.) of this section, the High Court may, if it thinks fit, upon the application of the Attorney-General, issue an injunction to restrain the person from committing any further offence against that subsection. "" (3.) The costs of the determination of any such application shall be in the discretion of the Court.""",49
455,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [9.53] - I move That after the word "" pounds,"" line 34, the following new sub-clause be inserted :"" (IA) It shall be a defence to a tion under this section if the defendant satisfies the Court that a petition for the revocation of the patent, or for the removal of the trade mark or design from the ter, as the . ease may be, would be successful."" The effect of my proposal, if adopted, will be to enable the defendant to raise all the defences which could be raised in an action for infringement under the Patents Act. Under bhat Act, in an action for infringement, or a petition for revocation, certain grounds of defence may be raised. In Frost's Patent Law and Practice, V o l . 1, 3rd edition, page 297, the practice is made clear. Amongst grounds for which a patent may be revoked are that the patentee was not the true and first inventor, that the alleged invention is not the proper subject-matter, or that it lacks the essential element of utility or novelty, or that the specifications are defective, or on any one of these grounds singly - It may also be revoked on the ground that it was obtained in fraud of the rights of the petitioner. Also, where the specification directs a certain thing to be done, which turns out to be not only unnecessary, but also disadvantageous and useless, the patent may be revoked on the ground of false suggestion. I have clearly shown that under the general defence, which can be raised under the proposed new subclause, all the points can be urged which could be raised in an action for infringement.",51
456,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Flinders) [9.55] - I am very glad that the Attorney-General has introduced this amendment, which entirely removes the most substantial objection which had to the language of the Bill . honourable gentleman has given us his assurance that the objections which could be raised on a petition for the revocation of a patent are as wide as those which may be made a defence to the action. Without having looked into the matter, I am inclined to agree with him. At all events, I accept his assurance. That removes what was to my mind the substantial trouble which I experienced in accepting this Bill . I do not raise any objection to the penalty that is proposed in lieu of damages, though it seems to mean extraordinarily awkward method of enforcing patent rights. But it is possible-as the Attorney-General has exprosecuplained-that it may be necessary for the Crown to have some power to protect these patents, seeing that it is thecustodian of this private property during regis- the period covered by the war. Bub J would ask the honourable gentleman whether it is intended that a licensee or a person in whose favour a patent is suspended should be entitled to recover damages for infringement. Under this Bill it is proposed that the Crown shall take to itself the right to protect this property. I quite appreciate that proposal. It is further intended to give the licensee blie right to secure an injunction against in fringement. That also is proper. But I the do not know whether the penalty of £ 5 0 0 is intended to be exclusive of any claim for damages in a civil suit which the licensee might otherwise have. I throw this out for the consideration of the At torney-General. He may thinlc it desirable to consultths Parliamentary Draftsman or his own colleagues as to whether-if we are going to give these substantial rights to a licensee, and to make him pay a substantial sum of money for this monopoly-w e ought to invest him, not merely with the right to secure an injunction, but with the ordinary civil right of damages for wrong-doing by an infringer. The Crown protects the patent by criminal proceedings, and I understand that it is further proposed that the Attorney-General shall alone have the right to say whether or not a prosecution shall be instituted. Bub this power is also to be used for the purpose of inducing persons to put capital into industry. If that be so, we shall be giving a very great and valuable monopoly to individuals for which I presume we shall make them pay. II f they will give a big price for this valuThe able monopoly, probably they will also wish to protect it , not merely by injunction against past infringements, but by damages for future infringements. I am rather inclined to think that that is not provided for in this Bill . At any rate, I throw oub the suggestion for the consideration of the Attorney-Genfiral.",51
457,Mr BRENDAN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Batman) [10.0] Following on what the honourable member for Flinders has said, I suggest that the effect of the amendment will be that an alleged infringer of a patent operated under a licence will have a greater measure of protection than such a person has in ordinary circumstances. It will now be necessary to prove under the criminal law an offence against the person alleged to have infringed the patent. Sir ""WILLIAM IK VINE - Unles s there is provision for an action for damages.",51
458,Mr BRENNAN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Yes , unless _ there is such a provision. It is more difficult to prove an offence under the criminal law against a person than to merely weigh the respective rights of two individuals under the civil law and turn the balance against the same person. If , then, we do not insert some clause making provision for damages, we shall be giving a more extended protection than possibly the Attorney-General intends to a person who, following the words of the clause, ""makes, uses, exercises, or vends the invention forming the subject-matter of the patent."" I suggest that the Attorney-General should bear that in mind.",52
459,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Angas) [10.3] - There nre one or two matters to which I should like to direct the attention of the Attorney-General. There is power under the regulations and under the Act to grant a licence, not only where a patent is suspended, but where it is avoided. So far as I can find out, they do not avoid patents in the United Kingdom, and for two reasons. One is that it is contrary to what is generally done between nations, because patents are not cancelled. As a matter of fact, I believe that, Germany has not touched the patent law at all so far, ancl France has only modified it to some extent. There is another reason, and that is that you cannot grant a licence for a patent that has been avoided, because if it is voided it is declared absolutely non-existent. For that reason regulations which provided, as ours do, for granting licences for avoided patents have been described as ultra vires, and to an extent absurd. I wish to know from the Attorney-General whether he intends to act upon the powers given by the regulations to avoid patents upon application being made, because if he does he cannot grant licences for those patents. To do so would be contrary to the policy of these Acts, because it is not the intention to destroy patents unless they could be destroyed for some reason which would have been applicable and of force before this legislation was passed. The regulations provide that a licence may be granted whether a patent is avoided or merely suspended; but this Bill provides for a penalty where there is a licence granted upon the suspension of a patent. The Bill does not touch the avoidance of patents at all. The draft of the Bill seems to me to recognise what I say is the proper policy. The Attorney-General has recognised that, or he would not submit a Bill dealing with suspension only, but in his reply to the debate on the second reading the honourable gentleman talked about avoidiug patents as well as suspending them. I understand that he stated that it was not intended to grant a licence where there has been an avoidance of a patent.",52
460,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,That is so.,52
461,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,It could not be done.,52
462,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"What I did say was that it seemed the proper thing to avoid a patent where the community gets the whole benefit of the patent, but where the community could not get the whole benefit it was necessary to suspend the patent and grant a licence.",52
463,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"We cannot affect the administration, and we are only trying to help in this matter. I hope that very grave consideration will be given before any attempt is made to avoid a patent, because it is not the policy of this legislation to do that. Under proposed new section 4 "" wliere a patent . . has been suspended in favour of any person "" certain things shall follow, and apparently the intention is to grant the licence to the person in whose favour a patent has been suspended. But I point out that other persons may want licences. My own impression is that a patent is not suspended "" in favour of any person,"" but upon the application of any person. That is what the regulations provide for.",52
464,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I do not think so.,52
465,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I think that is so. Clause 3 of the regulations provides thatThe Minister may, on the application of any person, and subject to sueh terms and conditions, if any, as he thinks fit, order the avoidance or suspension in whole or in part of any patent or licence the person entitled to the benefit of which is a subject of any State at war with the King. That would seem to imply that the person to whom the licence is given is the person in whose favour the patent was suspended. Clause 5 of the regulations provides thatNotwithstanding anything in these regulations contained, the Minister may at any time, if in his absolute discretion he deems it expedient in the public interest so to do, order the avoidance or suspension in whole or in part of any such patent or licence upon such terms and conditions, if auy, as he thinks fit. That does not touch it . That is an independent power.",52
466,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I think it does touch it. Under that regulation I am not to wait for an application. I may act of my own volition.,53
467,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"There is no doubt .that the honourable gentleman may act on his own initiative. That is not what I am speaking of. Where there is an application, proposed new section 4 seems to imply that the licence shall be given only to the person who applies for the suspension of a patent.",53
468,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"That may be implied, but the clause does not say so.",53
469,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Propose d new section 4 provides thatWhere a patent, or the registration, and all or any of the rights conferred by the registration, or the trade mark or design, has been suspended in favour of any person, any person other than the person in whose favour the patent, or the registration, as aforesaid, has been so suspended. That refers to the person who made the application for the suspension; but there is nothing in the regulations, or the existing Act , to say that there is a suspension "" in favour of "" a particular person. There is a suspension "" on the application "" of a person. Clause 6 of the regulations saysIn any case in which the Minister makes an order in pursuance of the Patents, Trade Marks, and Designs Act 1914, avoiding or suspending a patent in whole or in. part, the Minister may, in his discretion, grant in favour of persons, other than the subject of any State at war with the King, licences to make, use, exercise or vend the patented invention. Under that, upon an application for suspension being successful, the applicant may be the person to get the licence, or any one afterwards; but then the suspension would not be in favour of the applicant, but in favour of the general public. Under proposed new section 4, it might be only the person who first applies for the suspension of a patent who would have the right to a licence.",53
470,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The honourable member suggests the omission of the words "" in favour of any person "" ?",53
471,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I think that would better convey what is meant.,53
472,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I shall look into that.,53
473,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"There is another point to be considered. When the war is over, what will be the effect upon the patentee's rights? He will have a patent then subject to the burden of a licence which will not be an exclusive licence, but one protected against infringement by others who have not a licence, but not as against the patentee himself. What will his position be? Can he grant other licences? Can he sue for infringement by other people; or what can he do? The Bill does not deal with that. It is a difficult subject, and I ask the Attorney-General to consider that point also.",53
474,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"My impression is that, under the principal Act and this Bill , the Minister may take away from the patentee all his rights except possibly his right to sue for infringement when the war is at an end. I do not think that the patentee will have the right to grant a licence to any one else.",53
475,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I doubt it , because it is not proposed by the Bill to give an exclusive licence. It gives the effect of an exclusive licence by putting other people under a severe penalty if they manufacture the patented article while the licence is in existence. But that does not deal with the patentee.",53
476,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,I shall look into that point also.,53
477,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"The honourable member for Flinders has referred to the penalty. I have spoken of the international policy, and have said that it is not to interfere with the rights of the patentee at all, but to cover the effect of the suspension of his rights, to protect him, and to enable the public to have the use of the patent in the meantime. This penalty will go to the Crown. Why should there not be some provision made, by regulation or under the Act , to pay the penalty to the person whose rights are affected, and who might be the licensee or the patentee? There might have to be an apportionment of the penalty between the two. The Patents Act does not providethat penalties shall go to the Crown, except in the case of some fraud or breach of the official regulation. This is an anomalous provision.",53
478,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,We shall not hesitate to bring down amending legislation if this is found to be deficient.,54
479,Mr GLYNN,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"I am satisfied with that statement. The matter is a very difficult one, and the legislation may affect very substantial rights.",54
480,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [10.13] - In reply to what the honourable member for Angas has just said, I admit the difficulties surrounding this question. They cannot be easily brushed aside; they are very real, and are not figments of the imagination. What is more to the point, they cannot all be stated, nor can they all be anticipated. But, as they arise, and when it can be shown that the law is defective, we shall not hestitate to ask Parliament to agree to such amending legislation as appears to be necessary. If upon looking into the questions which have been raised we find that some amendment of this Bill should be made before it goes through another place, we shall not hesitate to propose it , and ask honourable members here to agree to it later. The honourable member for Batman, speaking in support of ine suggestion made by the honourable member for Flinders, considers that we mighb give the licensee civil rights to sue for damages.",54
481,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,There patents for the use of which a man might be willing to pay a penalty of £500.,54
482,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"It appears to me that, although we are dealing with patent rights, we are creating an anomaly, and we should deal with the person in the anomalous position in a way different from the way in which we would deal with the ordinary patentee. His rights are given to him by the Crown for a specific purpose. We shall safeguard those rights, but he has none of the rights to sue *for damages that properly belong to the patentee. The honourable member for Batman said that this measure was one which would better safeguard German patents. I think that is quite true: it does safeguard German patents, but it will not safeguard German patentees but Australian licensees. I think that it is a quite sufficient answer to the honourable member. Mr. JOSEPH COOK: (Parramatta) [10.15] - When the Bill is through, will the Government proceed to put it into operation, and confer exclusive rights on individuals on their own responsibility, or will they come to the House and let the House approve of the grant of any exclusive power and privilege of the kind?",54
483,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [10.16] - Thes e powers have been already exercised several times. If honourable members so desire, there is no reason why the exercise by the Minister of the powers under the Act should not be tabled at intervals for their information. If honourable members think the information is interesting and necessary, I shall make it my business to furnish, say, monthly returns, if anything happens during the month. Without occasion, of course, there need be no report.",54
484,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Parramatta) [10.17] - That is not quite what I want. This proposal is clearly protective. The protection is to be exercised by the Executive away from Parliament, but I hold that whatever protection is granted to individuals under this proposal should be the grant of this Parliament in the last resort. I am only asking that when the Attorney-General makes an exclusive grant of the kind, which is in its very essence protective, and intended to be protective, he should let the House know are what he is doing before it actually takes place. We do not protect an industry by the T a r i ff without consulting Parliament. The same principle should apply here.",54
485,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [10.18] - The honourable member does not seem to have a clear conception of the object of the measure. Every day the Commissioner of Patents grants patent rights to persons, giving them a monopoly for fourteen years. He does not ask Parliament to exercise the power. If Parliament thinks I am not fit to exercise the same powers as a relatively subordinate oflicial of the Department, it had better say so. Under these measures the application has first to be made to me. The Commissioner hears the evidence and puts it before me, but makes no recommendation. I act on the evidence, and if it appears to me proper to suspend, I suspend; if it is proper to refuse the application, I refuse it ; if it is right to grant a licence, I grant it . Surely the honourable member does not suggest that I should consult the Blouse about each particular case. Take the case of Thermit. There are at least a dozen patents affecting it ; one has been avoided in Great B r it a in , the others have not. Some are affected by the decision I gave, but not all. We should be turning this place, which is a deliberative assembly, into a sort of quasi-judicial tribunal by bringing such cases before it . Parliament has ample authority over the Executive Government, which every day exercises powers that, compared with this power, are as a mountain to a molehill. honourable member hardly realizes that such rights as these are granted nearly every day by the Commissioner of Patents in the ordinary exercise of his powers. One case out of about 2,000 comes back to me, and I have to decide whether it should stand or not, and if it should not stand, in whose favour it should be given. Amendment agreed to.",54

The effect of this will be to prevent the proposed new section being used without sufficient cause, or other than in a proper case. It is the usual proviso with regard to extraordinary powers; and as this is a clear departure, I think the House and the country w i have a better guarantee when the sole were withdrawn. authority for the exercise of the power is a member of the Government, which is, and must be, subordinate to Parliament.",55

The power to initiate for enforcement of the penalty is limited if confined to the At torney-General, and the licensee will have no right to protect his patents on his own initiative. Surely that will vitally lessen the competition for these patents ? The licensee will be a much better judge than the Attorney-General of what is an in fringement.",55
491,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"Plinders) The [10.25] - The point raised by the honourable member for Wannon deserves a good deal of consideration; but I understand the Attorney-General intends to consider, before the Bill goes to another place, whether it is not desirable to frame a clause giving the licensee a claim for damages. Under the unamended clause, there was a general power in the patentee, or licensee, to enforce his patent, or licence, by claiming a penalty. If we are going to take away that weapon from - him, we must give him an alternative. The licensee should have another mode ) of enforcing his right, and I understand be the Attorney-General will consider the or a matter. Unless that is given, we shall Atnot be able to reap anything like the same f r u it s from the measure.",55

I am asking the Attorney-General, before granting these special trade privileges to individuals, and so preventing others from taking advantage of them, to allow this House to have a say whether those special powers should be granted or not. The Minister should not have the right to confer those privileges upon an individual for the purpose of giving him a trade monopoly.

Mr. JOSEPH COOE: - That , however, has nothing to do with my point, which is that no Minister ought, by Executive action, to have the power to grant to any individual in the community such tremendous trade advantages as are contained in this proposed new section. That responsibility ought to rest with Parliament, just as the special privileges in the shape of bonuses and other encouragements to people to build up an industry are vested in the Legislature. I am sorry that I have been so abused for making a simple suggestion of this kind.",57
525,Mr HUGHES,DAIRYI NG IN NORTHERN,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [10.41] - I only want to say once more that no power is conferred upon the Attorney-General by this Bill to suspend a patent in favour of anybody, or to grant licences in favour of anybody. That power was granted by Act 15 of 1914, which has been the law since the 19th November last. The present measure does nothing of the sort. I refer the honourable member now to the Manual of Emergency Legislation, 191k, in Great B r it a in , and I direct his attention to order No. 1328, on page 236, dealing with Patents and Designs (Temporary) Rules, dated 7th September, 1914, which statesIn any case in which the Board of Trade make an order by virtue of the powers vested in them under the provisions of the Patents, I know Designs, and Trade Marks (Temporary) Rules Acts 1914, (a) and under any rides made under these Acts or either of them avoiding or suspending in whole or in part a patent or avoiding or suspending registration and all or any rights conferred by the registration of any design, the Board may, in their discretion, grant in favour of persons other than the subject of any State at war with His Majesty, licences to make, nse, exercise, or vend the patented invention or registered design so avoided or suspended upon such terms and conditions, and either for the whole term of the patent or registration of the design, or for sueh less period as the Board of Trade may think fit. Those are the words that we have incorporated in our Act, and those are the powers that were conferred upon the Minister of the Commonwealth for exactly the same reason as that which actuated the British Parliament in granting those powers to the Board of Trade.
