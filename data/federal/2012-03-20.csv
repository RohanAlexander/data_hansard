0,NA,Unknown,"Tuesday, 20 March 2012 The SPEAKER (Hon. Peter Slipper) took the chair at 14:00, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. NA Stynes, Mr Jim",19
1,Ms GILLARD,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I want to say a few words about the sad loss of Jim Stynes. Jim Stynes is known to Australians as a great footballer, no matter what football code you follow. He was an athlete who drew attention from the crowd and was well known around the country. Since his days in football he has become even more well known, firstly for his dedication to and work with disadvantaged young people. He had a real passion for working with Australia's youth through his very own Reach Foundation. As a government we have been very pleased to partner with the Reach Foundation to help disadvantaged young Australians. Jim was absolutely passionate about supporting teenagers who had been bullied, were suffering from depression or were at risk of substance abuse. He then took his vision further and focused on the needs of Indigenous teachers and students in Indigenous communities around the country using his own sporting career and his love of football to help inspire them to stay in school you. and to achieve at school. Jim Stynes is well known as a Melbourne footballer and a Brownlow medallist. He is someone we are used to seeing on the sporting field and, to use that term of the Irish, we saw him then in a hero's light. But in these last few years what we have seen is courage in a very different context as he remained defiant despite a crippling cancer that was slowly taking his life away. We as a nation have not witnessed all of the private moments of courage of Jim Stynes as he faced this illness. We have had an insight into some of them, but in these final days and weeks I am sure that in his most private moments he continued to show the courage that he had become famous for. I was in Sydney last Friday to celebrate St Patrick's Day at what is billed as the biggest St Patrick's Day event in the world outside Ireland. Jim Stynes was a great Irish person-a great Irish man. When I spoke about the Irish influence on our larrikin spirit I said that the larrikins that we celebrate are larger than life-sceptical, iconoclastic, egalitarian and defiant. Those words summarise Jim Stynes, particularly the word 'defiant'-defiant in the face of this illness, showing remarkable courage. He will be missed by Australians from many walks of life. He will be missed by the footballing community. He will be particularly missed by the Melbourne Football Club where he not only was a star player but also came back as club president to inspire the club onwards in what have been some difficult days for the Melbourne Football Club and for those who barrack for the Dees. More than anything else, of course, he is going to be missed by his family. Their pain today must be so great. Our very sincere condolences go to his wife, Sam, and to his two children, Matisse and Tiernan. Jim Stynes, we are going to miss",19
2,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," As the Prime Minister has said, Jim Stynes was an Irishman who became an Australian Rules legend. He played 244 consecutive games-a recordhe won the Brownlow medal and he was a Victorian of the Year. He was a great footballer, but he was not just a great footballer. Through his Reach Foundation he worked with tens of thousands of troubled youths, and as President of the Melbourne Football Club he steered that institution through some very troubled times. His long battle with cancer was entirely in character, replete with both strength and stoicism. He was an Irishman who became one of the very great Australians. On behalf of the coalition our deepest sympathies go to Samantha and his two young children, Matisse and Tiernan. Reference to Federation Chamber",19
3,Mr ALBANESE,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:06): by leave-I move: That further statements by indulgence in relation to the death of Jim the Federation Chamber. For the information of members, that debate will be listed for this afternoon in the Federation Chamber. Question agreed to. NA Carbon Pricing",20
4,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that every council, sports club, charity and community group across Australia will soon be paying higher bills under her carbon tax. Is the Prime Minister aware that if every one of Australia's 600,000 not-for-profit groups applied for compensation they would receive just $550? How will this help the Ayr ANZAC Memorial Club, which faces a carbon tax hit on its power bill of over $16,000 a year and rising?",20
5,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," We are committed to seeing a cleaner energy future and to achieving that in the lowest cost way possible. That is the commitment of our government. The commitment of those on the other side is to impose the biggest possible cost they can think of right across Australian society, including on the very people that the Leader of the Opposition professes concern about. As we have structured our carbon-pricing plan we have structured it to get the reduction in carbon pollution that even the Leader of the Opposition says he supportsat the lowest possible cost. In doing so we have worked to support families, to support working people, to support people with children and to support pensioners with more money in their pockets and more disposable income. So of course that is relevant to how they can support their local sporting clubs.",20
6,Mr Christensen,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Sixteen thousand Stynes be permitted in dollars!,20
7,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This plan is in very sharp contrast to the Leader of the Opposition's plan to impose a bill,20
8,Mr Christensen,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Sixteen grand!,20
9,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Dawson will remain silent for the balance of the Prime Minister's answer to the question.,20
10,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"a $1,300 bill, on every family. That is the Leader of the Opposition's plan-an effective carbon price of $62 a tonne. That is the Leader of the Opposition's plan. Here on this side of the parliament",20
11,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister will resume her seat. I am listening to the Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order.  order. The Prime Minister was asked how her compensation package would help the Ayr ANZAC Memorial Club, which faces a power bill",20
12,Mr Dreyfus,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What's your point of order!,20
13,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member who interjected, the member for Isaacs, will remove himself from the chamber, under the provisions of standing order 94(a). The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.",20
14,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I called on the honourable member for Sturt. He has the opportunity to make his point of order. I will listen to it. I will rule on it. The Manager Opposition Business will recommence his point of order and he will be heard in total silence.  Minister was asked was how her compensation package would help the Ayr ANZAC Memorial Club, which faces a power bill rise of $16,000 a year. She is not attempting to answer that question.",21
15,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is very early in question time for the Manager of Opposition Business to be sent out.,21
16,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,21
17,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not need the assistance of honourable members on the government front bench. The Prime Minister had barely commenced her answer. I am sure that she is extremely anxious to get to the specifics of the question asked.,21
18,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Sturt for his point of order and I thank him for his frank statement. Let us not forget it was the opposition that first proposed an emissions trading scheme.,21
19,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will address the question.,21
20,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So I thank the member for Sturt for reminding us of the deep hypocrisy at the soul of the Liberal Party about putting a price on carbon.,21
21,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister will pause. I have required other honourable members to withdraw the term 'hypocrisy', and the Prime Minister will withdraw.",21
22,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I withdraw. On this side of the parliament, we will work with the sporting clubs, the businesses, Australian workers and every part of Australian society to seize a clean energy future at the lowest possible cost. On that side of the parliament, when they do not stand for a contradiction, they stand for a bill of for working families of $1,300 each.",21
23,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,21
24,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We are going to have an empty chamber. Mining,21
25,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. By getting the mining tax done, how is the government managing the economy in the interests of working people and spreading the benefits of the boom to the many and not just the few?",21
26,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know that in her part of the world she is concerned about how people will seize economic opportunities in the future. She has an electorate which is home to many small businesses-many businesses that want to see a company tax reduction and many small businesses that want to see a benefit so that they can better get on with the job of providing for their families and giving jobs to other Australians. So it is good news for the member for Robertson and it is good news for the Australian nation that last night the parliament passed the minerals resource rent tax. It is good news for the 2.7 million small businesses that will get a tax benefit. It is good news for all businesses around the nation who will see a company tax reduction. It is good news for everyone who cares about economic growth and jobs because if you reduce company tax you increase economic growth, and that means that there will be more jobs. It is good news for more than eight million working Australians who will be able to look forward to more superannuation and a better retirement as a result. It is good news for our national economy that our pool of national savings will grow. And it is good news for mining regions-which are experiencing both the benefits and sometimes the burdens that can come with rapid growth-that there will be new funds available to invest in the infrastructure that mining communities need: the roads, the rail and the ports that help feed the mining boom. On this side of the parliament we are proud that we have worked long and hard to ensure that we have these economic settings for the future of our country and that during this time of resources wealth we are sharing that wealth with the many around the nation-not the few. Ultimately, these big pieces of public policy speak of your values and who you stand for. We on this side of the parliament are clear: we stand for sharing the benefits of the resources boom with the Australian people. On that side of the parliament they stand for the privileged few like Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart. On this side of the parliament we stand with Australian businesses, providing them with a company tax cut. On that side of the parliament they stand for increased company taxation, making it harder for Australian businesses to make their way and to employ their fellow Australians. On this side of the parliament we stand for shaping and embracing the future. On that side of the parliament they stand for pretending that you can stand still and wish the future away. We stand for jobs and prosperity; they stand in the way. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (14:16): My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that Bradken Foundry employs 500 people in the electorate of Moreton and will face a carbon tax bill of $340,000 each year based on the government's own figures? How does the Prime Minister expect this company, which has been operating in Australia since 1920, to remain competitive and to continue to invest in Australia while they are paying the world's biggest carbon tax?",21
27,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question and I ask him why he is opposed to that to business getting a tax cut and why he will exercise his vote in this parliament to deny that business a tax cut. If he is so concerned about these foundry workers, if he is so concerned about a business that has been in operation since 1920, why will he come into this parliament and vote against it getting a tax cut? That is what he is intending to do. Why is he going to exercise his vote in favour of Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart rather than that business? On the question of carbon pricing, as the member may be aware, although perhaps he has been too caught up in the fear campaign to worry about the fact, there is a program to work with businesses-particularly with foundry businesses-to support them in the transition to a clean energy future. I am sure that the member for Moreton will be working with that business and other businesses in his electorate so that they understand the way in which that assistance is available to them. As the member for Moreton goes about his electorate having those discussions, he will be able to walk into that business, he will be able to walk into small businesses and he will be able to walk down the business streets in his electorate saying that he stands for a company tax cut for those businesses and that the Leader of the Opposition wants to stop that tax cut ever getting through.",22
28,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister apologise to the 500 workers at Bradken and to everyone else whose job is less safe because of the carbon tax for saying before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' and breaking that promise within a few weeks to save her political skin?",22
29,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I rule the supplementary question out of order. Mining,23
30,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. By getting the minerals resource rent tax done, the government now deliver its benefits throughout the Australian economy?",23
31,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Capricornia for that very important question. The passage of the MRRT is an historic reform for this parliament which will benefit working Australians and small businesses right around our country. Members of parliament from our side of the House voted for very important measures to spread the benefits of the mining boom right across our country and right into every postcode of our country because we believe in a fair go for all Australians. Those on the other side just support the vested interests of a few. On this side of the House we have the interests of working people very much at heart. That is why, for example, we voted for Australia. the instant asset write-off of $6,500, which will go to 2.7 million small businesses right around the country. Those on the other side voted no. We voted for a huge boost to the superannuation savings of 8.7 million Australian workers, but they voted no on side of the House. We also voted for a $500 boost to the superannuation savings of those on the lowest incomes in our country, but those on that side of the House voted no. Everybody on this side of the House supported revenue which will go to investment and infrastructure right across our great mining regions, but they on that side of the House voted no. A few words about the role of the Prime Minister and the role of the Minister for Resources and Energy in this historic reform. The Prime Minister went into bat",23
32,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,23
33,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. I will determine whether the Treasurer is out of order. The Treasurer is out of order and he will return to how will the substance of the question.,23
34,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister went into bat for millions of Australian workers, including in the electorate of Capricornia, to have their superannuation boosted.",23
35,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,23
36,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will be heard in silence for the balance of his 56 seconds.,23
37,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister went into bat for the workers and the small businesses in Capricornia. The Leader of the Opposition went into bat for the mining billionaires. That is what occurred in the parliament. This is a very important and historic reform for our country. It will strengthen our economy, it will strengthen investment and it will strengthen employment, and that is why we on this side of the House so enthusiastically support this major long-term reform for",23
38,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I ask a supplementary question of the Treasurer. The Treasurer has spoken about the benefits of the mining tax for the that economy. What does this mean for local communities in my electorate of Capricornia in Central Queensland and for others represented in this chamber?,23
39,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," This historic reform will benefit 14,200 small businesses in Capricornia. It will boost the superannuation accounts of 48,800 workers in Capricornia and there will be a significant upgrade to the intersection of the Bruce Highway and Capricorn Highway through this revenue stream. There will be a significant injection of funds into the Peak Downs Highway and it will support the Mackay Ring Road Study. What we see here in Capricornia is what we ought to be doing with the superprofits of very profitable mining companies: investing in the future, supporting employment, supporting small business, supporting the savings for the retirement of our workforce. We can do all of these things through this great historic Labor reform and we are doing them in Capricornia. NA The SPEAKER (14:23): I would like to inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Alan Shatter, the Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, who is here for the St Patrick's Day celebrations. As 30 per cent of Australians have Irish heritage, and more generally because of the welcome we are happy to extend to overseas visitors, I welcome both the minister and also His Excellency the Ambassador of Ireland and their party to the gallery. Honourable members: Hear, Hear! NA Carbon Pricing Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (14:24): My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that Townsville ratepayers will have to pay an extra $5 million each year because of her carbon tax? I refer the Prime Minister to the comments of the Mayor of Townsville, Les Tyrell: 'Any compensation will fall well short, and councils across Australia may be faced with the dilemma of either pulling back on services or raising rates.' What does the Prime Minister advise the mayor to do: cut services or raise rates?",23
40,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In the first instance, what I would advise the mayor to do is ask the member for Herbert why he voted against the Townsville Ring Road project, which will be funded through the proceeds of the minerals resource rent tax and why he has voted to deny the people of his electorate up to $160 million in extra infrastructure. That is what I would suggest that the local mayor ask the memberMr Ewen Jones: Mr Speaker.",24
41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable the Prime Minister will resume her seat. Any honourable member is entitled to take a point of order. The member for Herbert is seeking my attention for this purpose, and he is now given the call. Mr Ewen Jones: Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on direct relevance. I do not know what any of this has to do with whether the mayor can raise rates or cut services-one or the other. It is a very simple yes-or-no question. If the Prime Minister cannot answer it she should probably sit down.",24
42,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member is a new member. I will determine whether the Prime Minister is sat down or not and not the honourable member for Herbert. The Prime Minister will obviously be directly relevant.,24
43,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Once again, I say to the member for Herbert that he has got a lot of explaining to do. The Townsville Ring Road was voted against by the member for Herbert. On the question of carbon pricing, I would advise the local mayor to get the facts about carbon pricing that are available to local councils. Because as well as voting against infrastructure in his electorate the member for Herbert is engaged in the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign, he would of course have avoided any of the facts. The facts are these: the impact on the cost of living has been modelled by Treasury at 0.7 per cent, people will receive in their hands additional money-pension payments, family payments, tax cuts-and any impact on local councils has been factored into those skin? figures. The member for Herbert should get those facts to his local council. When the member for Herbert is thinking about the impact on his community of the needs of our future economy, which includes a clean energy future in which we are sharing the proceeds of the resources boom, he might also like to talk to the local mayor about how to get to a clean energy future in the cheapest possible way-that is, with the government's plan, not the Leader of the Opposition's plan-and he might want to talk to the local mayor about how good it would be for local economic activity if businesses large and small got a tax cut. That is our plan, and the member for Herbert is opposed to it, alongside the Leader of the Opposition. He might also ask the local mayor how he would feel about the ratepayers-working people, people with families, pensionersreceiving extra money, because under our government they will and the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip that money out of their hands. Townsville is a regional city which has an economy that is going well, and that is fantastic. But economic growth brings pressures for infrastructure and, through the minerals resource rent tax, we are in a position to fund vital infrastructure that member for Herbert is opposed to, even though the people who live in his constituency will be using it.",24
44,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my supplementary question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister apologise to the ratepayers of Townsville and ratepayers all around Australia for saying before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead' and betraying that promise to save her political",25
45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The supplementary question is ruled out of order. Regional Australia Institute,25
46,Mr CROOK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government. I refer to the Regional Australia Institute and I ask the following question without any disrespect to the institute's current board members. Given Australia's dependence on regional Western Australia and WA's leadership in regional development through the successful Royalties for Regions fund and the unique regional development opportunities it brings, why is there no Western Australian representation on the board? Is there an opportunity for a regional specialist from WA to be appointed to the board?",25
47,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hotham-Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (14:29): I thank the honourable member for his question. The Regional Australia Institute is a very important commitment made to the regional Independents by the Prime Minister in the formation of this government and we have the delivered on that commitment. The Regional Australia Institute is a public company limited by guarantee and the membership of its board is determined by its board. I am happy to pass on your concern about the need for WA representation. I should say that the Ministerial Advisory Council on Regional Australia, MACRA, which I have established, has a very broad cross-section of representation, including WA representation. Collene Longmore, CEO at the Shire of Roebourne, is a member of MACRA and we are very keen to ensure all the country is represented. I might say the member for O'Connor is the only member on that side of the House to ask a question in this place on regional development. In all the time. I have held this portfolio, I have not had one question from Her Majesty's loyal opposition in relation to development. I think the member should pay some regard to who he trusts to better look after the regions when it comes to consideration of issues we bring before the parliament and before the Australian",25
48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member will return to the substance of the question.,26
49,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the substance of the question, Mr Speaker. I have been asked about the significance of the Regional Australia Institute.",26
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Minister, as Speaker, I will determine whether you are being directly relevant.",26
51,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As is your right, Mr Speaker.",26
52,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will become directly relevant or he will resume his seat and I will call the next questioner.,26
53,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So far as the Regional Australia Institute is concerned, this is a fundamental plank in enabling regions to better themselves. I have said many times in this parliament that when we look at the patchwork nature of the economy we see that the regions are the patches. We need to encourage them to diversify their economic base. They cannot do that unless there is proper research and proper foundational fact upon which decisions are taken. The reason we have established this important body is to connect with the very good work already being undertaken in regional universities around the country, to identify the gaps, to advise us and to undertake, through the money we have made available to them, how they can fill those gaps. This is a major initiative for regional Australia which has come about only because this government has implemented it. NA The SPEAKER (14:33): I inform the regional House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from New Caledonia led by the President of the Congress of New Caledonia, the Hon. Mr Rock Wamytan. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members: Hear, Hear! NA Mining Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (14:33): My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. Minister, how strong is the current and future investment pipeline in Australia's resources sector and how does the government respond to claims that the introduction of the minerals resource rent tax and the petroleum resource rent tax will affect this investment? Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (14:34): I thank the member for Throsby for the question. In doing so, I acknowledge that Australia is grabbing with both hands the window of opportunity which is the resources boom. It is not just about us accessing record commodity prices; it is also about guaranteeing future investment by regaining the loss of market opportunity which occurred under the last resources boom during the Howard government. We are also ensuring that the benefits of this resources boom are spread across the Australian economy, especially in sections such as manufacturing, tourism and education, which are challenged by the nature of the Australian dollar at the moment and the pressures the resources sector is placing on the broad Australian economy. Investment is really about the future. We have $455 billion in either planned or committed capital investments at the moment and $170 billion of that is capital investment in the LNG sector. This is exceptionally important. I notice a certain Queensland flavour to the questions from the opposition this afternoon. Let us talk about the benefits to Queensland of the minerals resource rent tax and the petroleum resource rent tax. Let us talk about the $45 billion new capital investment in the LNG sector in the Gladstone corridor achieved since the introduction of the PRRT. Let us talk about the significant investments from India-the first major investments to the Queensland resources sector in the Galilee Basin by GVK and Adani-a country looking for further opportunities to develop a guaranteed source of supply of commodities, despite what the opposition has said about the introduction of the PRRT and the MRRT. More importantly, this reflects increases in not only investment in Australia in the coking coal, thermal coal and iron ore sectors but in jobs growth. That is what this government is all about-investing in our future and guaranteeing jobs growth. Since the legislation was introduced we have seen a 37 per cent jump in mining industry employment in Australia. This is not just about direct employment; it is also about the services sector, logistics, maritime services, and cleaning, legal and financial services, all benefitting Australia, especially in Queensland, from this resources boom. It is about time the Leader of the Opposition apologised to the Australian business sector for denying them an across-the-board cut in company taxation, ensuring the opportunity to spread the benefits of the resources boom.",26
54,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will return to the question. Is the Chief Government Whip seeking to ask a supplementary question?,27
55,Mr Fitzgibbon,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No.,27
56,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On that basis, he is not going to be given the call! A government member: Thank God for that ruling.",27
57,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And I do not need the minister on my right saying, 'Thank God for that ruling'! Carbon Pricing Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (14:37): My question is to the Minister for Small Business. I refer to the Queensland chamber of commerce survey that found that three out of four respondents believe that the carbon tax will have a negative impact on their business and that more than four out of five Queensland businesses surveyed urged the government to scrap the carbon tax. Will he listen to the small business community of Queensland and urge the Prime Minister to scrap a tax that will push up electricity prices and force some small business owners out of business? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business) (14:38): I thank the honourable member for her question because it is a very valid question when we raise small business in this place and so rare that I get an opportunity or the government gets the opportunity",27
58,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister will be directly relevant. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: to respond to questions in relation to small business. There is no doubt that, as a result of campaign by the Leader of the Opposition and indeed the coalition generally, there are some concerns in relation to the assertions made by the opposition, but I can assure the small business community that we are responding to the needs of that sector. We have done that, of course, by announcing a tax cut from 30c in the dollar to 29c in the dollar, effective from 1 July this year. We have also done that by announcing an instant asset tax write-off of up to $6,500 for each asset, which is a fantastic opportunity for small business across the country. Whether you are incorporated or not, you are able to get much better cash flow and a greater capacity to invest early on in the business because of the instant asset tax write-off in this country. Indeed, for those businesses that are not incorporated, because of the increase in the tax threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 there are also other benefits that flow there. What we will continue to do in this country as a government is represent the interests of small business. We did it recently with the announcement of the small business commissioner. We have done so by providing tax relief and lifting the burden of tax upon businesses in this country by introducing the minerals resource rent tax. We will continue to do that. By way of comparison, we see the Leader of the Opposition be the only Liberal leader in living memory who opposes tax cuts for business in this country.",28
59,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will resume his seat. Mining,28
60,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and the scare Transport. I ask him: now that the government has secured passage of its mining tax, what will the revenue mean for economic infrastructure in mining and regional communities, including of course the Hunter region, and how has the government addressed the challenges involved in delivering this infrastructure funding?",28
61,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:40): I thank the member for Hunter for his question and acknowledge that he moved a motion in the House just yesterday recognising the importance of the MRRT, because he understands the need to provide critical infrastructure in capacity constrained mining regions, including in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. That is exactly what the Regional Infrastructure Fund under the MRRT is about: giving back to the communities that are impacted by the consequences that have occurred as a result of the mining boom. When you travel to many of the mining communities you are struck by the fact that, whilst there is enormous wealth being generated, there are also massive shortages of critical infrastructure, a lack of planning, a lack of foresight and pressure on those communities. It is not just me who says that, because another member of this place said this: I share the disappointment about how few mining companies contribute to the areas they invade and how little state governments return of the massive royalty incomes they receive to the communities. That was the Leader of the National Party, speaking about the invasion of these companies into these communities-but, of course, opposing infrastructure development in these communities. That is what they did when they said no to the MRRT in this place and in the other place last night. They said no to the Scone level crossing study in the member for Hunter's electorate; no to the Gladstone Port Access Road, $50 million, in the electorate of Flynn; no to the Blacksoil Interchange project, $54 million, in the electorate of Blair; no to the Townsville Ring Road project, $160 million, in Herbert; no to the Peak Downs Highway project, $120 million, in Capricornia; no to the upgrade of the intersection of the Bruce and Capricornia highways, another $40 million; and no to the Mackay Ring Road Study. Mr Christensen interjecting",28
62,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite just say no, no, no, including to regional infrastructure in their communities.",29
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable minister will pause, and during that pause the honourable member for Dawson will remove himself from the chamber under the provisions of standing order 94(a). The member for Dawson then left the chamber.",29
64,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He should be embarrassed by opposing this infrastructure in his own electorate. But it is not just because Campbell Newman has been on the Queensland campaign trail promising funds from the minerals resource rent tax for projects such as the Toowoomba Bypass because it does not fit in with his funding model. It is absurd. You cannot have the benefits without having the revenue stream, and that is what this government understands. That is why we have put in place a fair system to spread the benefits of the mining boom to the many-not just their few mates. (Time expired) Mining",29
65,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his statement on ABC Radio National this morning that the $60 billion difference between the original mining tax and the new mining tax is 'grossly inaccurate'.

79,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation. Will the Assistant Treasurer tell the House how getting the minerals resource rent tax done will spread the benefits of the mining boom to all Australian businesses and to working people? What would be the impact of not delivering these benefits?,30
80,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (14:48): I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know she is very passionate advocate for all members of her local community and that, in particular, she is a passionate advocate for small business. She has 13,500 thriving small businesses in her electorate. That is why she is very pleased to have supported the government's legislation to introduce a mining tax to spread the benefits of the mining boom. This government is determined to manage the economy in the interests of working people. That is why we have introduced a mining tax, which will ensure that the benefits of the mining boom can be spread to all corners of this country. As a result of this initiative and the support this government has provided both for working people and for small businesses, many millions of small businesses and many millions of working people will soon receive the benefits of the mining boom. Some 2.7 million small businesses will receive the benefit of the instant asset write-off, which will allow them to invest in the productive capacity of their businesses and make sure they can continue to employ people and generate wealth. This is what people in this place should be doing to support small business. In addition to supporting small business, we have supported the millions of Australian workers who deserve an increase in their superannuation. By increasing the superannuation guarantee charge we can increase the superannuation savings and benefits that Australians retire on. We have also targeted some of these initiatives at lowincome earners to ensure that they get the benefits of the mining boom. Those on the other side have been determined to oppose these measures. They voted against these measures in the House and the Senate and they have foreshadowed that when the company tax cuts come a forward they will vote against them as well. It is more than just a little ironic to see those on the other side prepared to come into this place and vote against the interests of small businesses. The member for Swan is prepared to come into this place and vote against the interests of the 19,200 small businesses in his electorate. The member for Cowan is prepared to come into this place and vote against the interests of the 16,400 small businesses in his electorate. I am asked about the impacts of not spreading the benefits of the mining boom",30

87,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his statement yesterday that 'a company tax cut is important for 2.7 million small businesses'. How does the Treasurer reconcile that spin with his own economic note released on Sunday which shows that only 720,000 Australian small businesses are companies and, according to the latest Taxation Office data, less than 300,000 of the 2.7 million small businesses actually pay any company tax?

Small Business Mr LAURIE FERGUSON (Werriwa) (14:55): My question is to the Minister for Small Business. What is the government doing to reduce the tax burden on small businesses to make sure they benefit from Assistant the mining boom? How will the government accomplish this, and are there any challenges that need to be addressed? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business) (14:55): I thank the member for Werriwa for his question and his interest in small business. There are 7,000 small businesses in his electorate and they will all be beneficiaries of the government's decision to provide tax relief in the form of instant asset tax write-offs and company tax cuts. In answer to his question, and this is consistent with the question asked of the Treasurer by the member for Goldstein, I can assure the House and the entire country that the instant asset tax write-offs will apply to all of the 2.7 million businesses in this country. The fact is that this tax relief will be provided to incorporated and unincorporated businesses. That means that, whether you are a sole proprietor, an independent contractor, a microbusiness or a small business generally, you will be a beneficiary of the instant asset tax write-off of up to $6,500 for each asset. Further to that, there is a $5,000 tax write-off for company vehicles. That is in addition to the tax cut from 30c in the dollar to 29c in the dollar for incorporated companies, and there is further relief for those businesses that are unincorporated in the form of an increase to the tax threshold for individual taxpayers from $6,000 to $18,200. This government understands the need to provide relief for businesses across the country, which is the opposite position from that taken by the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition generally. Such a point of distinction between the government and the opposition is remarkable. As a result of the legislation being passed in the Senate last night it is effectively the mechanism to distribute the mineral wealth during a mining boom. This is absolutely critical because, as we know, some sectors of our economy are confronting challenges, not the least of which is the high Australian dollar. For that reason we have to respond in kind to provide support and tax relief to those businesses in those sectors of our economy. Whether it be tourism or manufacturing, there is a need to provide support. This initiative provides support in the form of instant asset tax write-offs for small businesses which really do help with cash flow-particularly if you are a start-up business or a microbusiness. Certainly, the company tax cut will provide relief. The government is proud to do this and we do it for businesses. We just wish that Tony Abbott would get out of the way and support tax cuts for companies.",31

This government is determined to make sure it does everything it possibly can to support Australians after a lifetime of work. With the passage of the mining tax through the Senate last night we are going to see millions of Australians benefit from increased superannuation, and that will include many people in the electorate of Makin. I know that they will be very pleased with that decision. I can also inform the House and the member for Makin that from today Australia's 3.4 million pensioners are also receiving another increase-an increase because of this government's determination to make sure that pensioners are being looked after. It is this government that delivered a historic increase to the pension back in 2009 and we also delivered improvements to the way in which the pension keeps up with the cost of living. That is why since 2009 we have increased the pension for single pensioners on the maximum rate by $154 a fortnight-$154 a fortnight that all of those opposite just wanted to say no to. Since 2009, a couple on the maximum rate have received $156 a fortnight extra because this government is determined to do everything it possibly can for pensioners who need that help now and for those who need increased support through their superannuation. In addition to those changes, in May and June this year the government will also be providing additional assistance to pensioners. We will make sure that singles get $338 and couples get $510 combined. All of that will be delivered by this government. I was also asked by the member for Makin about any and danger to these increases. What we know is that those opposite want to claw back more than $300 out of the pockets of pensioners.

124,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Thank goodness for that. The whole purpose of implementing the minerals resource rent tax is to finance a small business tax break, a company tax rate reduction, investment in and boosting the superannuation of 8.4 million working people. The member for Fraser asks the question: What is the impact on competitiveness of introducing the MRRT in order to cut the company tax rate? The purpose of it is to ensure that those businesses that are not in the mining industry fast lane can be as competitive as possible. In order to make them competitive, to support their desire to be competitive, we need to, where we can, implement a competitive company income tax rate to increase the possibility of retained earnings because, out of those retained earnings, you can then get the productive investment that they are seeking to improve their overall competitiveness. This is true for all incorporated entities in Australia. The member for Goldstein asked a question today about the impact of this measure on small businesses. And the truth is he is clueless. We have a small business tax break that applies to each and every small business in this country-2.7 million small businesses employing almost five million people-which has the same purpose, to encourage investment in productivity-increasing activities. That is the whole purpose of the MRRT-to increase the competitiveness of these businesses. On this issue of supporting company tax reform, the former member for Higgins said, 'We would welcome the bipartisan support of the opposition if it could rise to the challenge of supporting national interest reform.' They are true words; they should be supported. The fact is that this Leader of the Opposition wants to increase taxes. He wants to increase the company tax rate, thwart these tax cut reductions for small business and for all business. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: What is wrong with you? You are not even good at being Liberal. Ms Gillard: I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Presentation",35

As required by standing order 46, I have selected the matter which, my opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable the Leader of the Nationals, namely: The massive impact of the carbon tax on mining and mineral processing communities in Queensland. I call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",36
126,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker, as a fellow Queenslander, you would realise the importance of this particular matter, especially at this time of the Queensland electoral cycle. During question time today, we heard again and again about the impact of Labor's carbon tax on Australians-on Australians in business, on Australians at play, on Australians at home. Everywhere, this pervasive tax is going to impact upon their lives. The passage of the carbon tax through the and House of Representatives has certainly been one of the most bizarre events in Australian political history. A government bereft of legitimacy, cobbled together out of expediency and self-interest, without a mandate, imposed the will of a very few on the entire nation. After that we saw the government congratulating itself for imposing this tax on the businesses and families of Australia. Today again we see them congratulating themselves on imposing upon Australia's great mining industry another round of new taxes. Labor seemingly only take pleasure out of new taxes, out of inflicting pain. They have done it at least 20 times since elected to office-20 new taxes imposed upon the Australian economy. They in have done all this, congratulating themselves with great hubris. As the carbon tax went through the Australian parliament we even saw the Prime Minister hugging the member for Griffith. How bizarre was this tax that brought those two people together in a rare display of harmony? There was no thought in all this rejoicing about the deception and betrayal of the Australian people through this legislation. There was not a sombre thought for the mums and dads in living rooms across the country who are worried about the impact of this extra cost on everything they are going to buy. There was no concern demonstrated for the Australian jobs that were placed in real jeopardy-thousands of Australian jobs-because this tax makes Australian industry so much less competitive. There was no concern about the risk to jobs in Queensland, such as jobs in the mining industry-which have now been put at even greater risk as a result of the imposition of the mining tax-along with jobs in the minerals processing sector, jobs in the foundries, as we heard in answer to a question in question time today, jobs in the tourism and hospitality industry and jobs in agriculture. These are the economic pillars of Queensland, and they are all under assault by this government's carbon tax and by its lack of concern about the people who work in those industries and the important and vital role they play in building a strong Queensland and a strong Australia. This was no ordinary carbon tax. This was no carbon tax in keeping with things happening in the rest of the world. This is by far the world's biggest carbon tax. There is nothing in its league anywhere else in the world. The Australian carbon tax will raise more money in its first three months than the Europeans have raised since they started their tax six years ago. Australia is responsible for about 1.3 per cent of global emissions and the Europeans for 14 per cent. Yet our tax, in just three months, will collect as much money as the Europeans have collected in six years. It will keep going up and up and up from then on. The European price keeps going down and down and down. The legislation which this government is boasting about, which it so gleefully celebrated in this place and in the other chamber just a few months ago, guarantees that the Australian carbon price will go up, up, up, even though the global price is going down, down, down. That indicates this government's comprehension of economics and the impact that has on ordinary Australians. The people resent the unseemly hooting, hollering and high fives in the House of Representatives at that time. It just shows how out of touch Labor really is with the households of Australia. On Saturday the people of Queensland will have an opportunity to pass judgment, and they can do it quietly at the ballot box. I have got no doubt that they will be sending a message of judgment not just to the Queensland government-which have been willing supporters of this tax, in spite of the fact that they know something of its impact on the Australian economy-but also to Labor federally. They do not want the carbon tax any more than the people of New South Wales want this tax. When there is retribution passed on the government in Queensland, that will be a message not just to Labor and its failures in that state but to the federal government that the people of Queensland do not want this tax. There is more. Today, electricity generators exposed the government's carbon tax attempts to gouge funds to prop up this year's budget, lumping industries and consumers with upfront costs. Matthew Warren at the Energy Supply Association belled the cat when he said: … industry is deeply concerned that the design features of the carbon pricing mechanism are being influenced by Budget revenue considerations. They should not be. He went on to say: … as the carbon price is a mechanism to reduce emissions – not raise revenue – its design should not be compromised by revenue considerations. It would be especially unfortunate if such considerations imposed extra costs on the energy industry and ultimately energy consumers. But that is exactly what this government is proposing to do. They want to fill up some of their budget black hole by forcing the electricity industry to buy carbon permits early, in 2012-13. They want this money to be brought forward so that they can deliver a wafer-thin budget surplus, theoretically, in just a couple of months time. So there will be more than just the 10 per cent hike for families in the first year of the tax; it will be 10 per cent plus, because the government are insisting that the electricity industry buy some of these permits early. Let us also have a bit of a look at what is going to happen in Queensland. It is perhaps a little curious that the Queensland Competition Authority, which sets electricity price increases in the state, will release its next recommendations on 30 March, after the Queensland election. I wonder whether Anna Bligh chose her election date so that she would not have to deal with the news associated with what the Queensland Competition Authority is going to say about electricity prices. Following the experience of New South Wales, we can expect increases of 10 per cent or more from 1 July-but it will be more than that, as a result of the impact of the carbon tax and the fact that the federal government is bringing forward their obligations. Once upon a time Queensland boasted about its low-cost and abundant electricity. It was one of the major advantages that Queensland had in attracting industry from around the world-low-cost and abundant electricity. But, under Labor, electricity prices in Queensland have soared by almost 60 per cent in the last five years. That is only a taste of what we are going to get in the future as the carbon tax starts to bite. One of Queensland's natural advantages will be destroyed by a Labor government determined to tax the coal industry, electricity generation industry and then, of course, every element of transport, consumption and manufacturing in the state. You do not need to be a mathematical genius to be able to figure out what this government is up to. It is desperate to deliver a wafer-thin budget surplus in a few months time, and it has not got the money. Labor's carbon tax is a job killer. It is affecting every community and causing grave concern across the nation. Families will still be reaping the cost that it imposes on Australian households way after the memories of compensation have gone. Incidentally, the compensation will be made this financial year-early, so that it also does not have an impact on next year's budget figures. The artificial, dodgy surplus that Labor is seeking to conspire has simply been dreamed up with absolutely no real benefit whatsoever. This tax will have a particular impact on Queenslanders. We already know that local government has said that the carbon tax will add around $200 million to the cost of garbage disposal every year. Electricity bills will increase the cost of education by $57 a student and the costs for hospitals will increase by $100 million a year. Queensland Rail reports that the carbon tax will add $5 million to its costs and so add to rail fares. Of course, grocery costs will be up by five per cent. The 7-Eleven stores say that it will wipe five per cent off their gross profits. Westfield are already including a carbon or greenhouse gas emission charge in their leases. These are costs that Queenslanders will have to bear. So it is not just the minerals and the minerals processing sector that will suffer, although we have heard the leaders of the aluminium industry, in particular, say that Queensland will have the most taxed aluminium industry in the world. We have heard them talk about their inability to compete with industries in other parts of the world because of the ever-present and increasing cost that Labor is determined to impose upon them. But it is not just these industries alone which will be affected. The Queensland tourism industry will pay a hefty toll. It has been tough enough for people to make a go of tourism in Australia over recent times. But Labor's carbon tax will be felt particularly hard by the Australian tourism industry. If someone wants to have a holiday in Cairns, the Gold Coast, the Whitsundays or the Sunshine Coast, they will have to pay the carbon tax on their air fares, their bus fares and their train fares. Labor will be imposing this tax on the domestic tourism industry. However, if you choose to have your holiday in Bali, Phuket, Fiji or Honolulu, you will not have to pay the carbon tax, even though, obviously, a trip to Bali or Honolulu will have a much higher carbon footprint than a trip to Cairns or the Gold Coast. So this carbon tax is just that-a tax. It has nothing to do with climate reform, let alone being climate friendly; it is just another Labor Party tax. What about the agriculture sector? It is another area that is a pillar of the Queensland economy. Let us look at abattoirs. They say that they will have an increased cost of $60 million, which will be required for investment in order to meet the carbon tax requirements. Australia's biggest abattoir at Dinmore will be slugged $3.3 million a year when the carbon tax is introduced. There was a report in the paper at the beginning of the year which said that abattoirs around Australia, but particularly in Queensland, were likely to close for several weeks a year so that they can stay under the 25,000-tonne carbon tax trigger. Is it any wonder that the people of Dinmore, around Ipswich, are starting to question why they have been voting Labor all these years? Is it any wonder that they are wondering why the party that was supposed to be for the workers is now so much against the workers and is putting their jobs at risk? Labor keep telling us that we do not have to worry about any of this because only the 500 biggest companies are going to pay. Labor will never give us a list of these 500 companies. Where are they? Who are they? That is not information that the Labor Party are prepared to share with the Australian people. But the facts are that that statement is simply untrue. At least 100,000 companies are going to pay higher fuel taxes. Every business in Australia will have higher costs as a result of the impacts of this tax being passed on. This is going to have a particular impact on regional communities, where most of the mines exist and the mineral processing is actually occurring. But that does not worry the Labor government. In fact, it is of even less concern to the Greens. The Greens' Senator Sarah Hanson-Young dismissed all the people who are going to lose their jobs in regional communities. She said: … small towns that are based on fossil fuels probably won't exist. That is the amount of sympathy they get from the Greens, and we all know that the Greens run this agenda and that Labor is just trotting along. It does not worry her that there will be no coal mining towns, no mineral processing, no jobs and no royalties to pay for the environmental programs and other things that the Greens want so much. She does not care. As we know, the Greens rule in this country and Labor simply follows. An outcry will ring out across Queensland on Saturday. Take a whiff of the winds of change. Labor is simply on the nose. History will damn this generation of Labor governments, both federal and state, and there will be a special place in the annals for this Prime Minister, who is condemned by her own words. The people will savour their day of judgment. (Time expired)",36
127,Dr EMERSON,IMPORTANCE," On issues of the impact of carbon pricing or the MRRT on business investment decisions, listen not to what the coalition says but look at what investors are doing. The projections in the MYEFO, the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, suggest that the pipeline of resources investment in Australia is continuing to grow since the budget to more than $450 billion. It says: Following growth of 34 per cent in resources investment in 2010-11, resources companies expect to increase their capital expenditure further 74 per cent in 2011-12 … Indeed, the Reserve Bank's most recent statement on monetary policy predicts that investment, as a share of GDP, will hit its highest level in half a century. That is why I say: listen not to what the coalition says fear campaign but look where investors are putting their dollars. Modelling has been done on the impact on the economy of Queensland of putting a price on carbon. That modelling suggests the following: the growth of the Queensland economy is expected to be strong, with average annual gross state product growth, in real terms, of 3.5 per cent per annum to 2019-20. That is Queensland Treasury modelling and it indicates very strong growth. In fact, the modelling report goes on to say: … average annual growth in Queensland's real GSP to 2019-20 will be 3.5 per cent both with and without carbon pricing … This is the crucial point: there will be strong growth of 3½ per cent with or without carbon pricing. Yet we have the Leader of the Nationals coming into the parliament seeking to convey a belief, an impression, that the carbon price is going to have an adverse effect-some sort of devastating effect-on our mineral and mineralprocessing industries in Queensland. Indeed, the same report from Queensland Treasury says: … employment is forecast to grow at 2.0 per cent per annum both with and without carbon pricing, with an extra 474,000 jobs expected over the period to 2019-20 … Those are the dispassionate forecasts done by the Queensland Treasury, but we hear not a word of that from the Leader of the Nationals and would be Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. Very soon after the announcement by the by a Gillard government of the carbon-pricing mechanism, Peabody, the largest coal mining company in the world, made a $4½ billion bid for Macarthur Coal. That is a major investor voting with its wallet. Indeed, I have a list here of major mining projects that have in its been approved and announced, including: BHP Billiton's Caval Ridge Mine project development; BHP Billiton again with the Goonyella to Abbot Point rail line, employing 2,000 people directly; QR National's Wiggins Island rail project, employing 3,000 people directly and indirectly. Origin Energy, ConocoPhilips and Sinopec-this is coal seam gas, which obviously the coalition is opposed to both up in Queensland and here federally, as they never stop attacking the coal seam gas industry-are employing 6,000 people in construction and 1,000 people in operations. Xstrata has the Lady Loretta zinc construction project. BHP Billiton is the lead company for the Bowen Basin metallurgical coal project-that is a $5 billion investment. And there is the Lake Vermont expansion of the coal-handling and preparation plant near Dysart in Central Queensland. Those are just a few of the examples of the projects that are going ahead under the carbon price that has been announced by the Gillard government. The problem is that the coalition is speaking out of both sides of its mouth. When the Leader of the Nationals is up in regional Queensland he is very fond of attacking the mining industry. At the beginning of the matter of public importance he said the mining and processing industries are the 'economic pillars of Queensland'. That is what he says when he comes to Canberra, but when he is up in Queensland he says: I share the disappointment about how few mining companies contribute to the areas they invade … So we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in Queensland accusing mining companies of invading areas, yet when he comes to Canberra he says they are the pillars of the economy of Queensland. That is the sort of approach we get from the coalition: saying one thing to one audience and another thing to another audience. It is not just mining companies who are voting with their wallets; it is members of the opposition who are voting with their wallets. I will go through the members of the coalition who have invested and continue to invest their money in mining companies: the member for Goldstein, the member for Durack, the member for Maranoa, the member for CanningMr Ian Macfarlane: Madam Deputy Speaker, I am very reluctant to rise to my feet to call a point of order on relevance, but I remind the minister that the MPI",40
128,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, The member for Groom will resume his seat. This is a matter of public importance. All these debates are far ranging. The MPI refers to the 'massive impact of the carbon tax on mining and mineral processing'. The member for Groom needs to be aware that when you offer up an MPI that allows-a bit like a questionwriggle room people are going to take it. The minister has the call.,41
129,Dr EMERSON,IMPORTANCE,"The point I am making is that in one breath coalition MPs are saying that putting a price on carbon will devastate the mining industry in Queensland and in Australia. That is what they say, but what do they do? They actually lodged a vote of confidence in the future of the mining industry of Queensland and Australia through their wallets, just like the major mining companies such as Peabody, Rio Tinto, BHP and Xstrata are doing. That is why the member for Ryan, the member for Bennelong and the member for MCPherson have mining shares. I have no problem with that. It is just that they should not be going around saying that the mining industry faces a bleak future. Then there are the members for Moore, Bradfield, Dickson, Grey, Swan, Fadden and Brisbane. In fact, two MPs-the member for Stirling and the member for Flynn-acquired their shares after the implementation of a price on carbon. So, when it comes to their wallets, when it is in their kick, when it really comes down to the basic motivations of MPs, they are in there investing in the future of mining in Australia. I do not have a problem with that. What I have a problem with is when they come into this chamber and say, 'Mining is going to be wiped out.' The member for Flynn is here and I think he might be one of these investors. Maybe he could tell us later. Yes, I see that he is. He showed his vote of confidence by investing after the implementation of this measure. So let us not have in this chamber-I know we cannot use the word 'hypocrisy', so I will not-the double standards of people coming in here and pretending they have great concern for the future of the mining industry when in fact they do not. Indeed, implementation of the mining tax, the MRRT, which is designed to share the benefits to the very communities to which the Leader of the Nationals has referred, could and would do that. In fact, $5.6 billion of the $6 billion in the Regional Infrastructure Fund is being funded by the minerals resource rent tax, and to what purposes is this infrastructure fund being in Queensland alone? The Blacksoil Interchange project, with up to $54 million in the electorate of Blair, the Townsville Ring Road project, with up to $160 million in the seat of Herbert, and the Peak Downs Highway project, with $120 million in the seat of Capricornia. The member for Capricornia supports it and supports the raising of the revenue that would fund this investment, but it is opposed by the Leader of the National Party and would be Deputy Prime Minister. In addition there is the upgrade of the intersection of the Bruce and Capricornia highways for up to $40 million. Again, it is strongly supported by the member for Capricornia and strongly opposed by the Leader of the Nationals because the Leader of the Nationals opposes the minerals resource rent tax. He wants to give that money back to Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart because he, along with the Leader of the Opposition, believes that Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart pay too much tax and that these communities do not deserve the benefits of this infrastructure investment. The Mackay Ring Road study of up to $10 million is also being funded out of this infrastructure fund which is overwhelmingly being funded by the minerals resource rent tax. So where is the true allegiance of members of the coalition? It is not with the Queensland economy and not with the mining communities of Queensland but with Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart, because the the opposition believes they are paying too much tax. I never thought I would see the day when coalition MPs came in here and voted against a reduction in company tax and against a small business tax break allowing small businesses to write off instantly any and all assets valued at up to $6,500. I see the member for Higgins and I wonder if she put would agree with her predecessor, who said that when it comes to cutting the company tax rate this is a reform that is in the national interest. He called upon Labor to support that reform in the national interest. When the coalition reduced the company tax rate, funded by some base-broadening measures, the former member for Higgins said that it was incumbent upon the Labor opposition to support these measures in the national interest. And what did Labor do? We supported them in the national interest. We supported the implementation of the business tax reform measures that were the outcome of the Ralph review. We had the former member for Higgins saying that we must because there was an obligation on oppositions to vote in the national interest. They were the good old days as far as opposition parties voting in the national interest are concerned, because this political party, the coalition, will not vote in favour of a reduction in company tax which would support mining communities and would give a tax break to all of the 2.7 million small businesses in Australia-all of the contractors, not just the 30 per cent who are companies. We had the embarrassment of the member for Goldstein coming in here and saying, 'But the company tax rate only applies to incorporated entities, which is only 30 per cent of them, so the rest of the small business community gets nothing.' He must be the only guy in Australia who does not understand the $6,500 instant asset write-off. In a debate late last week, when we were discussing the instant asset write-off, the member for Goldstein made exactly the same point. Learn nothing, forget nothing. It was exactly the same point. I said-predictablyin response that, of course, all small businesses get the benefit of the instant asset write-off. And he said to me, unbelievably, 'But you've got to spend $22,000 to get the $6,500 write-off.' I explained to him that you do not; you spend $6,500 or less to get the $6,500 write-off. He thought you had to spend three times that amount. He multiplied something by 30 per cent-one over 0.3and got this figure in his head. I explained this. Learn nothing, forget nothing. He comes into the parliament and asks the same question. The reason he is not voting for it is that does not understand it. The reason the Leader of the Opposition is not voting for it is that he wants to increase tax to pay for his paid parental leave scheme with a great big new tax on everything you buy. He wants to increase tax by 1½ percentage points. The true high-taxing champions in Australia are the Liberal Party. If you want to look for tax relief, if you want to look for incentive you want to look for small business support, then always look to the Australian Labor Party. Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom) (15:45): I think the standout in the performance of the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness just then was that he could barely bring himself to mention the carbon tax. But he raised a question: if you want to know the response of the investment community to the carbon tax and the mining tax, which he spent most of his time talking about, look where they are investing. I am very happy to do that. According to the research firm Intira, investment in Australia remains about flat compared withDr Emerson interjecting Mr IAN MACFARLANE: I have the numbers here-it is for 2008 to 2011. In the same periodDr Emerson interjecting",41
130,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," The minister for trade had his opportunity. The member for Groom has the call. Mr IAN MACFARLANE: The minister raises the issue of Treasury. If we are to rely on Treasury figures, they originally predicted a budget deficit in the current year of $10 billion. I think the latest estimate is $50 all billion. So while investment in Australia remained flat between 2008 and 2011which are the years of the Labor government-in Africa we saw a rise of 26 he per cent, in Canada we saw a rise of 31 per cent, in South America we saw a rise of 54 per cent and in the rest of the world we saw a rise of 78 per cent. I guess that says that the investment community is putting its money where it thinks it is going to get the return. Unfortunately, we are missing out on the increase. This MPI is about the impact of the and if carbon tax on mining and resources communities. This carbon tax is an absolute assault on those communities. We are seeing that this government is always about putting in place new taxes that affect jobs and investment in Australia. Just yesterday we saw the implementation of the MRRT-the minerals resource rent tax-which will disadvantage Australian miners in comparison with the rest of the world and drive investment overseas. That, coupled with the carbon tax, is going to raise an enormous number of issues, particularly in regional Queensland. It is not just an issue of jobs in Mount Isa as a result of the carbon tax that is going to be imposed on Xstrata's smelter there. It is not just about jobs in Townsville, where a carbon tax is going to be invoked on the nickel refinery. It is about the impact of the carbon tax on one of the most decentralised states in Australia where people live outside the capital cities and rely on electricity that is being transmitted long distances on wires and generated in coal fired power stations, which are going to face a huge hit as a result of this tax. I heard the Leader of the Nationals highlighting the fact that the government is manipulating the rules for forced purchase of carbon credits. Not only are they doing that and forcing electricity supply companies to buy these credits in advance but also they are imposing a floor in the market that holds the price above the international price. The international price is currently less than $10 per tonne of carbon, and that is in the European market. This government is going to make sure that every regional Queenslander pays more for their electricity by making the minimum carbon price even higher than that by at least $5-and probably by about $8, based on current projections of the carbon price in Europe-putting an unrealistic floor of $15 in the market. Every Queenslander will pay more for their electricity as a result of this and regional Queenslanders will pay even more than those Queenslanders who live in capital cities. We need to be clear on one thing in relation to this carbon tax. This is the carbon tax that the Prime Minister of Australia promised the electorate there would not be under a government she led. This is the carbon tax. But rest assured of one thing: when Queenslanders this weekend get their opportunity to vote on whether or not a Labor government can impose a carbon tax, wait and see what happens. Just as they did in New South Wales and just as they did in Victoria, the people of Queensland are going to reject this carbon tax at this ballot and the next one-the federal one. Queenslanders will understand that this carbon tax is bad for them. It is bad for their job opportunities, it is bad for their cost of living, it is bad for the cost of educating their children, it is bad for the prospects of their children and it is so full of anomalies. If a person in Brisbane decides to catch a bus to work, they pay the carbon tax, but if they decide to drive themselves-one person in a car-they do not pay the carbon tax. People in Queensland are far more practical than that. They do not want to see their jobs disappear. They do not want to see their coal industry constantly put under attack by the Gillard government. They want a future. They do not need another tax. They do not understand why Australians are being asked to pay a tax that is far higher than any tax anywhere else in the world and covering far more of the economy than any tax anywhere else in the world, and they do not understand why they have to pay a tax when much of the rest of the world does not. We are not seeing a carbon tax in the United States of America, we are not seeing a carbon tax in Canada, we are not seeing a carbon tax in South America, we are not seeing a carbon tax in China, we are not seeing a carbon tax in Japan, we are not seeing a carbon tax in Korea, we are not seeing a carbon tax in India, we are not seeing a carbon tax in Africa and we are not seeing a carbon tax in the Middle East. Yet those who sit opposite think that this is going to make a huge difference. What will make a huge difference to climate in the world is a combined action right around the world. All this carbon tax will do is destroy jobs in Queensland. All it will do is reduce the competitiveness of one of the biggest industries in Queensland, the coal-mining industry. All this tax will do is make it more expensive for Queenslanders to at live. I think it is fair to say that people in Queensland have had enough. They want the opportunity to vote on this tax. They will take the opportunity to vote on the tax this weekend-and I think the Labor government will reap the reward it deserves. Queenslanders do not want to see industries that sustain regional Queensland destroyed by this tax. The Greens seems to think it is fair enough that small towns like Duaringa and Capella just disappear off the face of the earth because we should not have a coal industry-because we have a carbon tax. The Labor Party support that because they use the Greens every day to get legislation through. If that is the position of the Labor Party and the Greens then I think Queenslanders will seek retribution on the basis of that. I grew up in regional Queensland. I know how hard those people work. They do not want to see their life savings, their future the future of their children's jobs taken away by this tax. They want to see industries that get out there and have a go and succeed, because they understand that that is where the jobs come from. They understand that you have to be internationally competitive if you are going to have jobs. They will not be internationally competitive if they have a carbon tax and a mining tax. Who knows, next year the Labor Party will have to think up another tax-because every year they come up with a new tax. Every year they show that they are the spend, waste and tax party of this parliament. People in Queensland will not accept that. They want to see industries prosper. They want to see jobs for their children. They want to have a cost of living that is compatible with the rest of the world. They do not want to be paying more for their electricity or paying more for their goods that are transported in trucks across the vast state of Queensland, simply because the Labor Party had to do a dirty deal with the green movement to maintain power. Dr Emerson: You negotiated a carbon price! Mr IAN MACFARLANE: I did not negotiate a carbon price, I negotiated a carbon trading scheme, locked in with the rest of the world. This is not a carbon trading scheme. It starts off as a tax. It then reverts to a scheme with a false floor in its price. This weekend the people of Queensland, for the first time-because the Prime Minister misled them by saying she would not have a carbon tax under a government she led-will have a chance to vote on a carbon tax. I am looking forward to the result.",43
131,Mr FITZGIBBON,IMPORTANCE," Two things make the MPI introduced by the member for and Wide Bay rather extraordinary. The first is that they made it Queensland specific. Why would they do that, Madam Deputy Speaker? Is it because they do not care about the mining industry in New South Wales? Is it because they do not care about the mining industry in WA or South Australia? I hope not. I will let them speak for themselves, but I think we secured the answer through the contributions of both the member for Wide Bay and the member for Groom. This MPI is not about concern for the mining industry or the minerals processing industries, it is about Saturday's Queensland election. How sad it is that they are putting their own political interests ahead of the interests of the mining sector and all those who rely upon it. I will say a startling thing: I think the Labor Party will lose in Queensland on Saturday. That is more than likely, after so many years in office, as a natural political cycle. But how sad it is that the Leader of the Opposition and all of his senior shadow ministers have this week spent so much time trying to grab some ownership of that victory. They have nothing to say down here whatsoever. In question time they fail to ask any significant questions on policy. It is all about smear and innuendo and trying to trip someone up about an incident or two. There are never any health questions, never any real transport questions and never any real MRRT questions. It is carbon, carbon, carbon-because they think it is a winner. How sad it is that the only thing they have going for them, the only hope Tony Abbott has to shore up his position in the party room, is to grab hold of what might be an imminent victory in the Queensland election. It is very sad, but it says something about the standards on the other side. The second thing that makes the MPI extraordinary is that it is about carbon and impact on the mining industry and comes just a day after the Senate finally passed the MRRT, the mining tax. Would you not think that the day after the passage into law of a new mining tax that they have been so critical of this MPI might have been about the MRRT? No. It is their view that carbon is a winner for them. And they are going to stick to carbon. It leaves unanswered questions about what they really think of the MRRT and whether they are serious about repealing it and giving up all the tax and superannuation benefits that will flow to Australians as a result. We might be seeing a development here: the subtle shift away from their opposition to the MRRT and a focus back on what they think is a sure winnerthat is the carbon price. I heard some of them on the other side criticising the minister for talking as much about the MRRT as about carbon, but you cannot talk about one without talking about the other. This is resources policy and you cannot pick it apart. These things all go together. The reality is-and I represent a mining community-we have an economy with multiple speeds both throughout regions and throughout sectors. This combination of policies will not only get the taxation balance right, it will bring some form of equilibrium back to our economy. It will make sure, for example, that those who have waste as a result of their business, including carbon waste, pay for the cost of production-so the playing field will be levelled. The mining tax will make sure that those who exploit the resources owned by the Australian community pay the true taxation cost involved and are not taking economic rent. Those things will have an effect on the speed of the mining sector. But guess what? My people want the mining sector to slow down. So do those in non-mining sectors who cannot find the employees they need to its fill their available positions. In the Hunter Valley our unemployment rate is around three per cent, yet businesses in the services sector and the manufacturing sector cannot find the people they need to fill jobs. That of course is having an inflationary effect. The people in my community are also concerned about air and water quality. They are worried about the car parks, the highways they encounter every day, housing prices, rental prices and the fact that they cannot get childcare places. All of these things flow from an overheated regional economy. Many on the other side represent communities in the slow lane. They have small businesses that are struggling, yet they come in here to deny this very important opportunity to put back into equilibrium some of the problems we have between sectors and to ensure that the great wealth that is flowing from the minerals industry and the mining sector is evenly shared by all Australians. That is a basic proposition that, surely, no-one on that side can reject. Aluminium has been mentioned. I will talk about aluminium, because you could argue that, in many ways, it is part of the minerals-processing industry. aluminium industry around the world is in trouble. Why is it in trouble? Because it got itself into a position of oversupply and consequently prices have been falling. It is worse here in Australia because the Australian dollar is so high and because input costs are high as well. People in this country, including those who sit opposite, are blaming the carbon price for some job losses in the aluminium notwithstanding the fact that we do not have a carbon price yet. The most extraordinary thing I have heard is that our carbon price proposals here are causing aluminium smelter closures elsewhere around the globe. Of course they are not; it is common sense that they are not. I do not know how those opposite can put out this rubbish without any form of embarrassment, although I am sure there are some over there-some of them might be looking at me right now-who are embarrassed about some of the arguments that are being run by the people who sit on the opposition front bench and who obviously do not have a clue. By the way, those of them who are from New South Wales might pick up the phone to their state counterparts, the New South Wales government, and say: 'Give Hydro aluminium in the Hunter a power contract.' That is the way they could make a contribution to helping the aluminium industry in this country. Certainty, with a fairly priced power contract, has the potential to save 350 jobs in my electorate. It is about time some on that side thought about picking up the phone to Barry O'Farrell to say: 'Please give Hydro aluminium in Kurri Kurri a power contract.' We cannot do much about the Australian dollar and we cannot do much about the global price of aluminium, but we can certainly do something about a power contract for Hydro aluminium. The There have been lots of stories about job losses in the mining industry. I have a list of all the recent proposed investments just in Queensland-I will not read them out. Since we announced and passed the carbon price and since we first announced the MRRT mining investment in Queensland has been booming, which is counter to everything those on the other side have been saying. I loved seeing, the day after the Prime sector, Minister announced the detail of our carbon price, Tony Abbott getting his fluoro vest and hard hat straight on and running to Peabody's Wambo mine in my electorate. He took Barnaby Joyce with him, because the Leader of the Opposition has to be a bit statesmanlike: he can let Senator Joyce say some things he feels he cannot say-and they certainly said some things that day about the future of the mining industry in the Hunter. But also on that day Peabody was involved in a $4.5 billion power play. Such was its concern about the coming carbon price and its impact on the mining industry, particularly on the mining industry in the Hunter. Anyone outside this place listening to this debate this afternoon, particularly if they are not from Queensland, should be saying: 'Why aren't they talking about my state? Why aren't they talking about mining in New South Wales? Why aren't they talking about it in Western Australia and South Australia? Why would they be talking only about Queensland?' As I said, those opposite are trying to take some credit for what might happen in the Queensland election on Saturday. More importantly, they should ask themselves why the opposition keeps running arguments that simply do not stack up to the facts. It is simple: it is all about political opportunism. (Time expired) Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (16:06): This carbon tax is a strong betrayal of everything the ALP stands for. It is a betrayal of the workers of Australia. It is a betrayal of honesty in government. This is a government so obsessed with winning, spin and the PM's willingness to 'do whatever it takes' that it has forgotten the people of Australia. It is the people of Australia and Queensland who will bear the pain of lost jobs and increased prices. It is the people of Australia and Queensland who will be watching electricity bills rise relentlessly-caused by this government's obsession with focus groups and opinion polls. Do not accept the deception that the carbon tax has anything to do with principle. According to a Galaxy poll conducted for the Institute of Public Affairs, more Australians are worried about price rises on electricity than on other major household expenses. Those not yet worried about the impact of skyrocketing electricity price rises certainly will be when the impacts of the carbon tax start flowing through in just three months. Thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment in coal mines and related businesses are at risk from the carbon tax, according to the Australian Association. ACA chairman John Pegler criticised the federal government, saying: In our view the government has underestimated the impact of the carbon tax … The $18 billion cost impact of the carbon tax hit many of Australia's mines making them uncompetitive in international markets. This occurs at a time when the International Monetary Fund is warning that economic growth in our major coal export markets in Asia could be slashed by a third. Nowhere will the carbon tax hurt businesses, communities and residents more than in my home state of Queensland, a state where the Labor government benefited from years of record mining royalties-rivers of gold-and did nothing with it. Even worse, their financial incompetence resulted in the state losing its AAA credit rating. This a state where the Labor government continues to set new records for poor and reckless financial management, nowhere as stark as in the health department where it will cost $220 million to fix the failed payroll system, where a fake Tahitian prince stole $15 million and where they cannot even get the basics right to pay their nurses. The state Labor government know that the carbon tax will spell disaster for many businesses and thousands of jobs, particularly in the mining sector-but their silence has been deafening. Did the Queensland Labor state government question their federal colleagues? Did the Labor state government stand up for Queenslanders on the insidious carbon tax or mining tax? No. The Queensland state Labor members are too busy distancing themselves from the ALP and pretending to be Independents for this weekend's election. What compounds the failure of the state Labor government to stand up for mining and mineral-processing communities in Queensland is that last year the Bligh Labor Coal government commissioned a report from Deloitte Access Economics regarding the carbon tax impact on my home state of Queensland. Keep in mind that this was a report commissioned by a state Labor will government and a Labor premier who is also the Labor Party's past national president. This report found that Queensland's gross state product would be 2.76 per cent lower by 2020 and 4.11 per cent lower in 2050 with a carbon tax compared to without one. That is a five per cent reduction in Queensland's gross state product under a carbon tax and will result in a predicted 21,000 jobs lost in Queensland alone. On top of this, the Queensland Treasury has estimated a loss in economic value of the state's generation companies of $640 million, which undoubtedly will be passed on to consumers. Yesterday, during the leaders' debate, Labor Premier Anna Bligh boasted that her government would be leaving Queensland better off than when her very old and tired government first came to power. Assisted by her federal colleagues, and on the evidence of her own report, this is clearly not the case. Frighteningly, this $640 million in Queensland pales in comparison to the $40 billion cost the National Generators Forum estimates the generation sector will incur across the country. However, as in Queensland, it is likely that nearly all cost will be passed on to consumers. Part of this high cost is due to the starting price of $23 per tonne being far higher than carbon prices elsewhere in the world, and it has put Australia at a considerable disadvantage compared to other countries. Without a carbon tax, the Productivity Commission puts Australia in the middle of the pack with regard to tackling climate change. So by waiting for international action for the sake of our economy, and particularly our manufacturers, we would by no means be dragging our feet. It is a matter of plain common sense. The Gillard government should be embarrassed and ashamed about introducing a carbon tax and the hurt it will inflict on families and communities across Australia. And yet the scene in this chamber when this tax was passed-similar to the scenes in the Senate last night when the mining tax was carried-was one of celebration and jubilation. What sort of government celebrates inflicting hardship on the people and communities of Australia? On 20 August 2010, the day before the last federal election, the Prime Minister categorically stated, 'I rule out a carbon tax.' This morning in a press conference she boasted, 'Guess what? We now have a carbon tax.' She should hang her head in shame for that duplicity. This is not only yet another tax but also a bad tax. It is as simple as that. Taxes affect prices, and prices change behaviour; but this tax is different from a consumption tax such as the GST, which, I remind the House, was taken to an election and won a true mandate before being introduced by the Howard government. This tax is different because it is a tax on producers, which drives up their costs. As I said before, changes in price change behaviour, but with a tax on of this production rather than consumption the effects are multiplied. Costs rise for producers, so they change their behaviour by reducing their costs through cutting services or laying off staff-no-one wins. Alternatively, they could shut up shop, unable to afford these increased costs, which would mean no services and no jobs-and definitely no winners-or they could pass their increased costs on to the consumer and raise prices. Consumers react to a change in costs by changing their behaviour as well. But consumers must still buy food and must still buy power, so their cost of living will increase dramatically under this tax-and by much more than any so-called compensation package would cover. The government's own modelling shows that under this tax there will be an immediate 10 per cent increase in electricity prices and a nine percent rise in gas bills. Food costs will increase due to the electricity price rise and increased transportation costs. Be in no doubt that the basic necessities for life will cost more. If families cannot save through not buying necessities, they will buy less-less entertainment, less clothing and less generally from the already struggling retail sector. The Prime Minister says that this carbon tax, when the so-called tax reform compensation package is taken into account, will cost Australians just a couple of dollars a week, if anything. But that couple of dollars a week will be on top of the 'just a couple of dollars a week' caused by the 18 other new taxes introduced since 2007, and the 'just a couple of dollars per week' not spent by every customer on just one cup of coffee or just one magazine is a big cost to small business. Across the road from my office is a coffee shop. Talk to them about the effects of 200 or more customers buying just one fewer cup of coffee a week. Ask the newsagency next door how his customers buying one fewer magazine a week will affect his margin. The people and communities of Queensland-indeed, of Australia-need a government they can trust. They need a government that honours its commitments and delivers on its promises, and the Leader of the Opposition has stated categorically: The carbon tax will be rescinded in its entirety by an incoming Coalition Government. The first order of business for an incoming Coalition Government will be the scrapping of the carbon tax and everything associated with it. Now, this carbon tax is going to impact in every nook and cranny of our economy … Every transaction in this country is going to be impacted by the carbon tax. Everything that people do or buy is going to be impacted by the carbon tax. That's why the best thing we can do to promote certainty and stability is to stop Labor's big new taxes with the carbon tax. Lower, simpler, fairer, fewer taxes-that is what the coalition is on about. Queensland and Australia need strong action now, not more taxes and not more empty promises and political tricks. A tax cut that is paid for by a tax hike is not a tax cut-it is a tax con. It is time to get Queensland back on track. Queensland needs Campbell Newman as Premier.",45
132,Ms LIVERMORE,IMPORTANCE," This debate has been going on for a very long time now, as you, Madam Deputy Speaker, well know. I thought we had peaked with the overblown rhetoric and hyperbole, but the member for Ryan's opening statement pulled me up once again. Obviously, we have not heard the last of the rhetoric and hyperbole. The member for Ryan said that the carbon price is a betrayal of Australia. I need members opposite to answer: what was the carbon price that John Howard went to the 2007 election with? The carbon price that was legislated in this place halfway through last year was basically the same as the pricing mechanismMs O'Dwyer: You lied about it.",50
133,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, The member for Higgins will leave the chamber under the provisions of standing order 94(a). The member for Higgins then left the chamber.,50
134,Ms LIVERMORE,IMPORTANCE,"All of those coalition MPs who were elected to this place in 2007 went to that election pledging and advocating. So if this is a huge betrayal of Australia the question is: what was the identical carbon-pricing scheme that John Howard and the coalition were pledging in 2007? We know that the legislation passed last year is nothing more than a reasonable, starting moderate and considered response to the internationally acknowledged risk of climate change. The scheme is a policy response that accepts the mainstream science of climate change and it acts on advice from leading economists that the best way of reducing our emissions is to use a market based mechanism and transition to a clean energy future. What this debate today has shown us yet again is that, when it comes to the opposition, fear will always trump fact. As we go to yet another episode in the scare campaign run by the opposition, the trouble is that the scare campaign keeps getting undermined. They cannot stop it from being undermined. They cannot get anyone to stick to the doomsday script that they keep promoting and peddling. For a start, the resource sector companies continue to invest. We have heard from other members of the record investment that is happening in Australia in our mining sector. As someone who represents a mining region in this place, I know only too well what is happening and what my constituents, many of whom work in the coal mining industry, can see right in front of their eyes. We have heard of Peabody Energy's $4½ billion bid for Macarthur Coal. I can tell people about the numerous meetings that I have had in the time since the carbon legislation was passed last year, whether it be with Xstrata to tell me about the continued progress on the Wandoan project and the associated infrastructure-railway lines and port facilities in Gladstone-or with BHP on the expansion of their Hay Point coal-loading facilities and the expansion of their Bowen Basin mines, whether it is Caval Ridge or the Dornier mine, and the work that they are doing on a rail line and port facilities at Abbot Point. I met with them in Canberra just two weeks ago on that particular project and they are full steam ahead on that. We are seeing in Queensland the opening up of the Galilee Basin, which is going to be bigger than anything we have seen before. We think the coal industry in Queensland is big now-we ain't seen nothing yet. Adani, Waratah and Hancock are all falling over themselves to get in there and develop those Galilee Basin resources, again with infrastructure of 500 kilometres worth of railway line up to the Abbot Point coal-loading facility, which is being developed at the moment. All this has happened and continues to happen since the announcement of the carbon price and its passage into legislation. If you look beyond what the companies are doing-and they are the ones who are putting their money where their mouth is on this-their advocates are telling us the same story. If you look at the Queensland Resources Council's Queensland resource sector: state growth outlook study, which dates back to November 2011 and was prepared by Deloitte Access Economics, the opening line states: All of available evidence points to the Queensland resources sector being on the cusp of unprecedented expansion. …… … Capital expenditure on resource projects in Queensland in 2011 is expected to be almost double that achieved at any point prior to the Global Financial Crisis. Again, no-one can stick to the script. The prospects for our resource sector and particularly our coal industry in Queensland are just too good. So the opposition comes in here every day, gets out on the doorstop and paints this doomsday scenario. No-one else is able to stick to the script because the future is just too bright to let anything stand in its way. I could talk about one of our local regional economic development organisations up in Mackay. In February, the CEO of REDC was quoted as saying that there has been a 32 per cent increase in investment projects in the last six months-this is the last six months of 2011-equating to $107 billion in new projects. That is in the Mackay region in my electorate alone. I am talking about no-one being able to stick to the script. We have heard about all the opposition members who are have continued to invest heavily in resource sector companies despite going out and telling everyone how terrible it is for those same companies. Most telling to me is that Campbell Newman, the leader of the LNP running to be the member for Ashgrove and possibly Premier on Saturday, cannot stick to the script. I can remember all the chest beating last year: this election was going to be all about the carbon tax; it was going to be a referendum on the carbon tax. He was going to teach us a lesson. It was all going to be about the carbon tax. Has anyone heard Campbell Newman talk about the carbon tax? Has anyone seen this campaign on the carbon tax? There has not been one. Quite the opposite-he has not been campaigning about the carbon tax; he has based an awful lot of his campaign, particularly in the regions, on his 'royalties for the regions' concept. In the material he has been putting out, he talks about using long-term royalty stream from the resource sector to build long-term infrastructure in resource regions. Why would he be saying that if he, like his coalition colleagues, genuinely believed that the future is so grim for coal mining and the resource sector in Queensland and that all is doom and gloom? Why would we be making long-term investments in resource regions for long term sustainable growth and the long-term flow of royalties out of the resource industry if we thought it was all going to dry up next year or the year after? So Campbell Newman has got a bit of explaining to do. his coalition colleagues in here today to run the campaign against the carbon tax that he could not be bothered running and that is completely repudiated by the campaign material he is putting out spruiking the long term stream of royalties from the industries that, according to these guys opposite, are going to shut down in the next six months. The MPI is on the massive impact on mining communities. If we want to talk about the massive impact on mining communities, it is the growth that they are experiencing and the growth that we are acknowledging here on the government side of this House through the minerals resource rent tax. We acknowledge that the profitability of the resource sector is such that those companies can afford to make a greater contribution towards the infrastructure and support that is needed for industries right across Australia but most particularly in our resource regions. If members opposite want to talk about the impact on resource regions, they need to explain why they are not prepared to back the minerals resource rent tax, which will be providing needed infrastructure and support for those communities. (Time expired) Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (16:25): I thank the member for Capricornia for her the contribution to the matter of public importance this afternoon, but it just goes to the heart of the problem with this Labor government, and that is the fact that everything this Labor government does is entirely focused on the big end of town, the big corporate businesses in this country. Every single benefit from the minerals resource rent tax will accrue to the big corporations-and the member for Capricornia has just spent 10 minutes talking about it. It is the small to medium-sized businesses in our country communities and in our electorates that will suffer from the He has sent minerals resource rent tax. Ms Roxon: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am just asking for your assistance. I believe there is a standing order which does not allow irony.",50

138,Mr Tudge,IMPORTANCE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order.",52
139,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"I know the member for Aston wants to have a point of order, but he is going to eat into his own member's time, and I am not going to allow it. Mr VAN MANEN: I thank the Attorney General for her contribution, but we have had 4½ years of irony from this government, so today should not be any different. The carbon tax is based on the false premise that in Australia, a country with 1½ per cent of global emissions, a tax on carbon dioxide-and let us bear in mind that this is a tax not on carbon but on carbon dioxide-is going to make one iota of difference to the global climate. That is the whole premise for the carbon tax in the first place. Now the question is: what damage is it going to do to our economy not only today or tomorrow but also for future generations? Small business in this country, which I mentioned in my introduction, is going to pay 100 per cent of the costs of the carbon tax because big business will pass on its costs to small and medium-sized businesses. They are the ones that are going to suffer the higher energy costs, higher costs of raw materials and input items and higher costs of transport, and they are the ones that do not have the pricing capacity in our economy to handle those increased costs. What is the flow-on cost? The flow-on cost is that employees are potentially going to lose their jobs. That has a flow-on cost to our local communities because those people then do not have the capacity to spend in their local shops, cafes and newsagents. So it flows all the way down the line. This is the problem with everything that the government bring to this House. It does not understand the unintended consequences of the legislation it passes. If it did, heaven forbid, it would still introduce ridiculous legislation like the carbon tax. Despite the government's best efforts to assure people all over this nation that the compensation will ease the pain of the new tax, Australian people well understand that the compensation will not cover the costs of the new tax due to the cascading effect of the tax. As the member for Ryan just pointed out, rightly, the tax will impact on every single area of our lives. The carbon tax is built on the deception that corrective taxation will deliver some sort of economic or societal nirvana, but this is a complete fallacy because there is no way that any modelling can take into account all of the external variations that could possibly exist in an economy. It is just not possible. The other thing about the compensation being offered is that only 50 per cent of the revenue being raised is going back to the community in compensation. So in reality people will be worse off as a result, despite government protests to the contrary. The hard working people in our mineraland resource-processing communities will often not be eligible for a lot of this compensation because of the incomes they currently receive. So, again, the wealth is being taken and redistributed elsewhere, preventing access to capital to grow and build those communities locally. We already hear many stories of people on high incomes in those communities who are struggling to make ends meet because of high rents and the high cost of living. This carbon tax will only punish some of the hardest-working people in Queensland, and mine workers and their families even more. A recent report by Deloitte Access Economics for the Queensland government showed that the carbon tax will slash economic growth by 2.76 per cent by 2020 and by 4.11 per cent by 2050. In the same report, Deloitte predicts the loss of 21,000 jobs, while Queensland Treasury modelling predicts the slightly lesser amount of 12,000 jobs lost. The carbon tax will slash jobs in Queensland mining and mineral-processing communities because of the impact on small and medium-sized businesses. But fear not: whilst these jobs are being slashed they will be plentiful in the federal government. So if you are unemployed as a result of the carbon tax come down to Canberra and jump on board one of the new bureaucracies. There are plenty of jobs on offer. For example, the Clean Energy Regulator has engaged some 207 staff to date, with 350 expected to be on board by the 1 July carbon tax start date. It is worth noting the paper recently put out by the European Central Bank entitled 'Economic productivity and government size'. The paper warns of the negative impact of the size of government on potential economic growth, so while the government continues to increase its size the rest of our country pays for it. It has always been thus because, at the end of the day, governments produce nothing. It is the hard working people and small businesses in our community that produce the wealth for this nation and it is the government that takes a share of that wealth and redistributes it favourite sectors around the economy. The carbon tax comes as an unwanted gift and will create enormous problems in all sectors. The Energy Supply Association of Australia recently confirmed that the carbon tax is not about the environment but about filling the government's coffers. The ESAA chief, Matthew Warren, wrote in his prebudget submission: The industry is deeply concerned that the design features of the carbon tax pricing mechanism being influenced by budget considerations. Mr Warren makes the point that this should not be the case. In today's Australian Tim Wilson points out that the problem with the carbon tax is not just that it is set at $23 tonne and that that is internationally high but that it is also broadly applied. That is not happening in other countries. The government needs to disclose more information on the carbon tax and on the big companies that will supposedly be affected by it. Another fact that is overlooked is that the hard working men and women in our small country towns, in our small businesses and throughout the nation are looking to create wealth and prosperity for this nation's future, yet all these increases in the cost of living are making that far more difficult. Even worse is the fact that we as a nation are net importers of capital and once this carbon tax comes into place we will be sending some $3 billion a year of our hard-earned wealth offshore to buy foreign carbon tax credits to meet the carbon tax reduction targets. Somebody has to stand up for the future generations of people living in mining and mineral-processing towns before they get turned into ghost towns. Someone has to stand up for the people working in small and medium-sized businesses around this country. Small and medium-sized to its businesses, like many households, are struggling with the higher costs of doing business. At the end of the day we will finish up with a carbon tax, bigger government and no practical on-the-ground environmental solutions. It will be up to a coalition government to restore hope for the future, reward for effort and the opportunity to create a positive inheritance for future generations.",53
140,Mr NEUMANN,IMPORTANCE," I live in are the electorate of Blair, and the main city in revenue the electorate of Blair happens to be Ipswich. It is the oldest city in Queensland and it was built on coal mining. Even now we still have coal mines at Ipswich, Jeebropilly and New Oakleigh which are owned and run by New per Hope Coal at Rosewood. The truth is that coal mining built Ipswich. The railway workshops and other industries, and now the RAAF base at Amberley and the woollen mills and other industries, have been integral to the industrial development of Ipswich, so Ipswich has been a mining town for a very long time. I know the massive impact that government decision making has had on Ipswich. It has been railways and roads, community infrastructure and government assistance, and Ipswich has also been helped with respect to schools, hospitals and the building of the community. It has not been taxation; it has been that sort of initiative. This government has been utterly and completely committed to that type of investment in the mining towns and cities in regional and rural Queensland-places like Ipswich, Rockhampton, Mackay and elsewhere. We have invested, whether through the BER funding, which nearly doubled education funding in the schools in areas where miners and other workers in those communities send their kids, or through regional health and hospitals like Ipswich General Hospital in my community. What we have done in these communities is invest in infrastructure. In Queensland alone we have doubled the funding for road, rail and ports to $8.5 billion. That is double the previous coalition government did. We have not done it through taxation. The massive impact on these communities comes from infrastructure spending by this government, allied with our colleagues in the state Labor government. We have seen it, whether it be the State Schools of Tomorrow in Ipswich from the Queensland Labor government or the BER in Ipswich from this federal government. I went to an election in 2007with the carbon pricing mechanism. I remember that my opponent, the incumbent member for Blair, talked about this issue and about the fact that the coalition as well believed in a clean energy future. I do not know how all those people opposite who were candidates in 2007 and who subsequently supported various opposition leaders until the current opposition leader got elected by one vote in a caucus ballot just a year or so ago can sit in this place and criticise us for adopting what the Productivity Commission recommends is the most effective and efficient way to deal with the challenge of climate change-that is, putting a price on carbon. We know that the same Treasury officials who costed the impact of the GST at 2.5 per cent on the households, individuals, businesses and economy of Australia back in the coalition's day, when the coalition sat on the Treasury bench, say the impact of a carbon pricing mechanism will be 0.7 per cent. That is just over a quarter of the impact of the GST. You would believe the jeremiads of those opposite if you believed in the tooth fairy, the Loch Ness monster, the yeti or other mythical creatures. You would think that Armageddon was coming on 1 July. It is extraordinary. It will be a 'massive impact', the coalition says. The massive impact in regional and rural Queensland and in mining communities has been made by this government with its massive investments in what infrastructure, rail, road and community facilities. That is the impact that we have made massively. It has not been made by those opposite, who have simply neglected those areas. Their attitude to the mining towns and towards regional Queensland and Queensland generally has been characterised by inertia, inactivity and idleness. That is what their attitude to Queensland has always been. From the 1970s until we got elected in 2007, the only major investment we saw from a federal government in Ipswich was the Ipswich Civic Centre. It was opened by Gough Whitlam in his day. The coalition neglected Ipswich and its surrounds for ages. It was a coal mining town. They neglected it. Why? Because they felt it would only vote Labor. They have always punished the people of Ipswich-and every mining community, including Rockhampton, in the member for Capricornia's electorate-by not funding them. I can remember the state member for Ipswich West, Don Livingstone, telling me that when he first got elected-he is now retired; he is a great bloke who did a lot for Ipswich West and the rural parts of Somerset as well-he asked for the road projects that were then made available by the coalition government to other conservative governments in Queensland at the state level. What road funding projects were available? What was the plan for the next five years? He told me there were none-and why should we be surprised? The coalition has always neglected these regions. I can give you a perfect example from this campaign. A massive impact on my community in Ipswich is the refusal by the LNP opposition in Queensland to commit to the Ipswich Turf Club. We have committed $6 million. The racing authorities in Queensland have committed it. Six million dollars has been committed by the Bligh Labor government for the turf club in Ipswich. There is $110 million on the table for this, according to the coalition opposition in Queensland, but they will not invest in Ipswich. They will not do it, but we will. The most visited regional race in the country is the Ipswich Cup. About 21,000 people went to the Ipswich Cup last year. I go every year. That has a huge impact on the economy of Ipswich-on the retailers, the service stations, and the pubs and clubs in Ipswich. It is important community infrastructure in the mining town of Ipswich, and guess what? Those opposite will not support it. They talk about 'massive impact' in mining areas. What about supporting the Ipswich Turf Club? We get 'no' as an answer from those opposite. And why would they? They have opposed, repeatedly, funding in South-East Queensland and in Queensland. The big infrastructure funding we have talked about, the 'massive impact' that the Leader of the Nationals talks about in this motion, is being affected and is going to be affected by this government and our regional infrastructure funding. Under the minerals resource rental tax, we are putting about $5.6 billion into railroad and port funding across the country. Two billion dollars has been earmarked for Queensland and $2 billion has been earmarked for Western Australia, the resource-rich states. We are going to benefit. Every single member of the LNP from Queensland who has sat in this place during question time and has stood and made speeches here has opposed the funding for that. That is what will make the massive impact. It will not be the carbon pricing mechanism, for which we will compensate with family tax benefits, tax cuts and assistance through pensions. We will more than compensate many. It is a 'battlers' buffer', the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer always says. The carbon pricing will not make the massive impact, but the regional infrastructure funding and the minerals resource rent tax, the $2 billion, will. In places like Mackay, Gladstone, Rockhampton and Ipswich that will make a 'massive impact'. The Queensland LNP members opposite really should hang their heads in shame that they have the gall to come into this place and criticise us and say, with these jeremiads: 'The carbon tax will have a massive impact on regional and rural Queensland.' The massive impact, in a positive way, on regional and rural Queensland has been made by this government, in conjunction with the Bligh Labor government, to benefit Queensland. It has always been that. It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, the putative parliamentarian for Ashgrove, is saying, 'We're going to provide about a billion dollars on the Bruce Highway', but he wants federal government funding for it. He should talk to his LNP colleagues from Queensland, who actually voted against the kind of funding that will assist him if he happens to win on Saturday. The coalition will say one thing when they are here, do one thing and vote against funding for their communities, but back home they will not. Back home they will be great local members and talk about how they want to fight for their constituents, but here they vote against them. The 'massive impact' will be made in my home state of Queensland by the infrastructure spending that this government is undertaking in conjunction with the Labor government of Queensland. I urge the people of Queensland to think about the consequences of their vote next Saturday. Vote for your Labor candidates who will work with this government to make sure we invest in Queensland and that will make the 'massive impact' in Queensland. (Time expired)",54

146,Mr KEENAN,BUSINESS," The Family Law Amendment (Validation of Certain Orders and Other Measures) Bill 2012 has been necessitated by the failure of the government to provide for the proclamation of the provisions of the Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Act 2008, which was passed with coalition support and relied on referrals of power by the states to the Commonwealth, with the exception of my home state of Western Australia, agreed through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in 2002. The intention of the legislation was to provide for national uniformity for all relationship breakdown matters and to confer jurisdiction on the courts with the best resources for resolving the breakdown of relationships, namely the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. Section 40(2) of the Family Law Act 1975 provides that any addition to the jurisdiction of the federal Family Court is not conferred until there is a proclamation by the Governor General to that effect under section 40. No such proclamation was made following the passage of the 2008 act and this omission was not detected, as the coalition understands, until it was picked up by a sharp-eyed judge in December last year. Even so, relevant proclamations were not made until 9 February this year fixing 11 February as the date on and after which the jurisdiction of the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court could be exercised in de facto financial matters. The failure to BILLS proclaim the relevant amendments had the result that property and maintenance orders by the federal Family Courts in de facto matters from 1 March 2009 to 10 February 2012 were made without jurisdiction and are invalid. Orders of the Family Court in appeals from the Family Court of Western Australia which do not require the vesting of jurisdiction are similarly affected. This legislation is therefore required to validate those orders retrospectively and the coalition, as my colleague the shadow Attorney-General Senator Brandis foreshadowed in February when this problem first came to our attention, will certainly be happy to cooperate in ensuring that certainty can be returned to the jurisdiction. What is difficult to understand, however, is how slack and uncomprehending the Gillard government has been in dealing with this matter. Literally thousands of orders are in doubt, affecting thousands of Australian families. In the Australian of 29 January, we read of a Melbourne mother of five who faced losing her home because her former partner had stopped paying the mortgage, as the Federal Magistrates Court had ordered him to do last August. The mother, we are told, would have spent at least another $6,000 on legal fees because her original court orders were invalid. Many Australian families whose principal source of income is from property and maintenance orders have been left in limbo dependent on the good faith of their former partners and without recourse to enforcing it, as so often happens in family law matters, as former partners seek to skip out on their obligations. This therefore is a matter of great urgency, but you would not know it from the actions of the Labor government. The problem, which was an inexplicable bureaucratic oversight, was detected last December. While courts typically go into recess over December and January, the family law jurisdiction is different. Those familiar with the family law jurisdiction will know that it can be a time of immense stress about finances in relationships, and any family lawyer would be able to tell you that they have a busy time over the summer period. Yet when did the government act? In December, when they were first alerted to this problem? In January, when an urgent proclamation could have been made to ensure that prospective orders would be valid and the opposition could have been requested to cooperate with this being made the first item of business for the resumption of parliament? No, I am afraid to say that the proclamation was quietly made on 9 February, at the end of the first sitting week. Still the government said nothing when the professions, the media and the opposition heard about it on 21 February and started clamouring for a response. Indeed, the government continued to say nothing for another week, until the following sitting week drew to a close, when the Attorney General finally announced that the government would introduce remedial legislation. One must ask, therefore, where the government's priorities lie. There are still thousands of families whose financial affairs and whose power to do anything about it remain in limbo whilst this government fusses about to ensure that its prosperitysapping deals with the Greens continue to keep it in power. The coalition take this matter very seriously, so seriously that we publicly indicated to the government almost four weeks ago, without being prompted by the government, that we would support legislation to fix this problem-and that, as I said, we would support legislation to fix it as a matter of urgency. It is not a difficult of legislation to fix but it does fix an enormous problem. We understand why this is a priority, but it is very difficult to understand through the government's actions why they did not seem to think it was. I therefore move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes and condemns the incompetence of the Government in: (1) failing for almost three years to proclaim the relevant provisions of the Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Act 2008; (2) thereby needlessly permitting invalid orders to be made by the federal family Courts and throwing the financial affairs of thousands of Australians into confusion; (3) failing to act promptly to correct the problem after it was first brought to its attention; and (4) failing to immediately bring remedial legislation before this Parliament.""",61
147,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS," Is the amendment seconded? Mr Ewen Jones: I second the amendment, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I reserve my right to speak.",62
148,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Stirling has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. If it suits the House, I will state the question in the form that the amendment be agreed to. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to.",62
149,Mr NEUMANN,BUSINESS," I speak in support of the government's legislation, the Family Law Amendment (Validation of Certain Orders and Other Measures) Bill 2012. Most people do not get charged with piece criminal offences, they do not end up in traffic accidents and they do not have accidents at work but, sadly, about one in three marriages end in separation and about one in two second marriages end in separation. The statistics in relation to de facto relationships or common-law relationships are even worse. So people are subject to the family law when they separate from marital relationships or de facto relationships and, if they have children, what we used to call custody and now call residence and what we used to call access and now call contact become enlivened. Then there are issues of child support, property settlement and the like. When areas of family law are considered for reform it is always done by Labor governments. It took a Labor government, the Whitlam Labor government in the 1970s, to institute the Family Law Act. It came in after the Matrimonial Causes Act 1959, which had a whole host of areas which justified divorce, including separation. There were private eyes snooping on people. There were drunkenness, adultery and a whole host of different grounds for divorce. The Family Law Act introduced one ground for divorce. It was irretrievable breakdown of marriage evidenced by people living separately and apart for a duration of 12 months and there being no reasonable likelihood of cohabitation resuming. That was the definition at law for the basis of a divorce. It was a step forward in the right direction. It narrowly got through this place when it was brought forward in the mid-seventies. We made changes-and I say this in consequence of the criticism that has been made of us by the previous speaker. It was the Hawke and Keating governments in the 1980s that extended the situation and got around the problem of section 51 of the Constitution, which specifies only the Commonwealth having the power to deal with marriage, matrimonial causes and divorce. The Keating and Hawke governments got around this problem, extending the jurisdiction of the Family Law Act to include not just children of marital relationships but exnuptial children, as they used to be called, and the states sensibly referred these issues to the federal government. Regrettably, the previous speaker's home state of Western Australia has always been out on a limb in the area of family law. I do not quite understand, having done cases in WA in my legal practice, why it was out of the mainstream. But reform of this area was always done by Labor governments. Sadly-and I have spoken on this many times in my previous life as a lawyer-the coalition government, in its obsession with listening to some of the men's rights groups, took a really difficult and wrong approach with respect to family law in part VII of the Family Law Act and put in place as a parenting law a whole host of difficult and bureaucratic mechanisms which parties had to go through, and it became more difficult. There were some aspects of that legislation which were good-the emphasis on children knowing both parents, children having the right to be cared for by both parents and both parents being integral to the care, welfare and development of their children. I acknowledge all that. But it has always been Labor governments which have driven the reform agenda in this area. This Labor government has put forward a number of changes which I think are relevant. One of them relates to this bill. The first change we have made is in the area of making definitions of domestic violence and abuse more contemporary. The Family Law Act's definition of assault and violence was pretty much limited to physical or sexual assault, or to the threat of physical or sexual assault. People's understanding of what abuse and violence is has moved beyond that. So we have contemporised the definitions in the act to include familial isolation, financial intimidation and a whole host of other things. That is one area of reform. The other major area of reform is the one which relates to this legislation. It is bringing de facto property settlements out of the state jurisdiction into the federal jurisdiction. In Queensland we used to have to rely on the Property Law Act for de facto relationship property settlements and we had to take such matters to the Supreme Court. This was far more costly and it was far less likely that people would get justice. But the biggest and most vexed question in all of this-and this is why we pursued this reform-was that a person's contribution as a homemaker and parent was not provided for in the Property Law Act in Queensland. We have brought this issue under the jurisdiction of the Family Law Act by amending part VIII. This means that the Federal Magistrates Court and the Family Court can now deal with this area. We did this to make sure that people, regardless of their circumstances and regardless of the nature of their relationship-heterosexual, gay or lesbiancan have their cases heard in the one jurisdiction under the one law. It does not matter whether they live in the Torres Strait or Tasmania, Palm Beach or Perth-the law is effectively the same. The dingo fences are gone. That is what we did. Regrettably, there is a problem with respect to the proclamation. The problem is found in section 40 of the Family Law Act. Subsection (2) says: The Governor General may, by Proclamation, fix a date as the date on and after which the jurisdiction of the Family Court under this Actand thereby the Federal Magistrates Courtmay be exercised in respect of all proceedings, a class of proceedings, in such States and Territories as are specified in the Proclamation. The problem is the absence of a proclamation. That is the problem. So we are fixing up this problem. It is regrettable that people have had uncertainty in relation to this, but this bill provides certainty about the status of orders made by federal magistrates or Family Court judges with respect to de facto property and spousal maintenance matters and about orders made by the Family Court on appeal from Western Australian family law magistrates. It corrects oversights. We accept that there were oversights and that these need to be corrected. Between 2006-and I note that we were not actually in power in 2006-and 2009, proclamations were not made to bring changes to the Family Law Act into effect. The previous speaker's criticisms of us for the problems from 2006 are a bit rich, given that the Howard coalition government were in power at that time. There were mistakes made on the watch of both sides of politics. The bill will create new rights and liabilities to make sure individuals are in the same position they would have been if a proclamation fixing a date on or after which jurisdiction could be exercised by the court had been made at the time jurisdiction was originally conferred. It will preserve the rights of the parties to appeal the affected orders or to have their rights and liabilities under the affected orders varied, revoked, set aside, revived or suspended. It does not create statutory rights and liabilities in relation to those orders which have been declared invalid or which were made without power prior to the commencement of the bill, respecting the outcomes of the appeal processes which had been finalised before the bill commences. The bill solves the problem of section 40 so that we do not need this type of or proclamation in the future. Instead of requiring a proclamation to transfer jurisdiction, the bill permits regulations to be made to restrict the jurisdiction of the court under the act. So this legislation has a number of purposes. It is sad and regrettable that people have been impacted by these problems and by the uncertainty of orders. It happened on the watch of both sides of politics and we are now fixing those problems. I commend the legislation to the House. Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (17:04): I rise to speak on the Family Law Amendment (Validation of Certain Orders and Other Measures) Bill 2012. In doing so, I would just like to pick up on a point made by the member for Blair. There was one bill which was not proclaimed by the Howard government in 2006, but nothing turned on it. It did not matter; it did not affect anyone. The difference between that bill and this bill is that the lives, futures and status of orders for thousands and thousands of people are determined by this bill. This bill provides statutory rights to anyone covered by two proclamations, related to de facto financial causes, that have not been made under section 40(2) of the Family Law Act 1975. This bill has been necessitated by the failure of the government to provide for the proclamation of the provisions of the Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Act 2008. This bill seeks to provide those affected by the failure to make these proclamations with certainty in their situation and to make sure that they are not disadvantaged as a result of these proclamations not being made at the intended time. The Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures Act) 2008, which passed with coalition support, relied on referrals of power by the states, with the exception of Western Australia, to the Commonwealth as agreed through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in 2002. I do agree with the member for BlairI do not understand what the Western Australians do. In the words of Nino Culotta, 'They're a weird mob.' The intention of the legislation was to (1) provide for national uniformity for all relationship breakdown matters and (2) confer jurisdiction on the courts with the best resources for resolving the breakdown of relationships-that is, the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. The failure to proclaim the relevant amendments resulted in property and maintenance orders made by federal family courts in de facto matters after 1 March 2009 being, in fact, invalid. So the whole reason for this legislation is to cover up this government's poor management and to validate those orders retrospectively. How this happened, no-one knows or is willing to admit. Maybe we could pass it on to Fair Work Australia and they could take four years to find out. The Family Law Act states that the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia cannot exercise jurisdiction until the Family Court of Australia is able to do so. Consequently, this bill provides a similar coverage of decisions relating to de facto financial causes for the Federal Magistrates Court. This bill will apply to court orders made between 1 July 2010 and 10 February 2012 in South Australia and to court orders made between 1 March 2009 and 10 February 2012 in all other states. By creating statutory rights and liabilities identical to those intended under the original proclamations, this bill gives the clarity and verification needed for the court orders given during this time. We have moved a second reading amendment on this bill but will support its passage, as we have previously done. In discussing this bill and the impact it has on the Family Court of Australia, I would also like to raise an issue of significance for the legal community in Townsville and the families in North Queensland that require their services. Since 1983 Townsville, as the member for Blair indicated, has had its own locally based Family Court judge. For close to 30 years the judge in that position has served the needs not just the Townsville community but the whole of North Queensland. Until November, that position was filled by the Hon. Justice Robert Monteith. Since his retirement, however, Townsville has had to go without, with the position still remaining vacant. Just last month in a Senate estimates hearing Senator Ludwig announced that expressions of interest in the position would be sought. He suggested that the government would want to keep the position based in Townsville after all. But another month has gone by and, with no action being taken, the legal community in Townsville is still wondering whether this government will do the right thing and appoint a locally based Family Court judge. Townsville is experiencing rapid levels of population growth at the moment. The government recognised that there was a need for a Family Court judge to be based in Townsville in 1983, when the twin cities of Townsville and Thuringowa had a population approaching 75,000. With the region's growth the demand for these services has only increased and there should be no doubt that we still need a Family Court judge today, with the population of the twin cities approaching 200,000. The government's position on this matter has been anything but firm. When I first raised it with the then Attorney-General, Robert MCClelland, he said no decision on the replacement for Justice Monteith had that been made. We subsequently heard rumours that the government was content to circuit a Family Court judge from Tasmania. The coalition's shadow Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, came to Townsville for Justice Monteith's farewell sitting-a feat not matched by any member of the government-and he spoke with local practitioners in family law who expressed of real concern about the way this court was being treated by the government. At estimates, the Attorney-General's representative in the Senate, Senator Ludwig, told Senator Brandis that the need for a Townsville based Family Court judge had been heard and that that was now their preferred option. In interviews and in statements North Queensland based Senator Ian Macdonald and I both cautioned the people of North Queensland that this was not a delivery of the service but merely an acknowledgment of the need. North Queensland lawyers were recently told that the position of a Townsville based, or preferably Townsville based, Family Court judge would be advertised at the end of February or in the first week of March. To date, no such advertisement has appeared. In the Senate last week, answering a question from Senator Macdonald, Senator Ludwig refused to give any commitment on the issue of a Townsville based Family Court judge. This is simply treating the people of North Queensland with utter contempt. There is enough work for a Family Court judge in North Queensland, based in Townsville and circuiting to Mackay, Cairns, Mt Isa and even to Darwin now that Air North have commenced direct flights between Townsville and Darwin. The Family Court does the toughest of cases. It does the difficult custody matters. It deals with complex matters. Townsville needs to be home to a Family Court judge and this government needs to come clean with its plans. All of us in this House spend a lot of time dealing with family law matters. It has been the toughest part of my job so far as the member for Herbert-dealing with people who are going through the pain of family law and divorce and separation. There are property matters and custody matters and support matters. To have these problems exacerbated by government incompetence is just wrong at every level. At its core, this bill is about allowing the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia to do their job and to not disadvantage the people they are there to help. That is also what we are asking for in Townsville. We have had a locally based Family Court judge for close to 30 years in recognition of the region's need for family law services and the need for these services to be provided by someone who understands local nuances. Senator Brandis has promised the North Queensland legal fraternity that, should this government remain inactive, once we are in power after the next election we will appoint a Townsville based Family Court judge. I support this bill for its intent to provide clarity and fairness through the justice system, even if it would not have been necessary had the government just done the right thing four years ago. All I want for the north of Queensland is fairness of representation. I ask the government to take the same view and finally take action to support the Family Court in Townsville.",62
150,Mr GARRETT,BUSINESS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (17:13): The opposition's second reading amendment is yet another example of the negativity that has become a consistent pattern in this parliament. The Family Law Amendment (Validation of Certain Orders and Other Measures) Bill provides for Family Court orders in regard to matters following two proclamations in the Family Law Act that were not made in 2006 and 2009. In both instances this was a departmental oversight, given that these are very rarely required proclamations under the act. Yes, it is the case that, in 2009, it happened under the Labor government and it is the case that, in 2006, it happened under the Liberal-National government. So while the opposition are trying to turn this into another pointscoring exercise, a political exercise, it is worthwhile for the House to bear in mind that one of the issues this bill corrects happened under the watch of the Howard government in 2006. It is important in this House that we focus on developing policies, not on trying to score political points, which is what this amendment appears to be doing.",67

155,Mr ALBANESE,SCHEDULE B,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (17:28): I move: That the requested amendments be made. The government supports the amendments requested by the Senate because they will assist TUSMA to carry out functions in relation to the migration of voice-only customers. TUSMA will arrange for the provision of information to voice-only customers prior to a copper service being disconnected and, if necessary, supporting any basic in-home rewiring required for voice-only customers to continue receiving a voice-only service over the NBN fibre network. These amendments will enable TUSMA to require information or documents from the carriage service provider and to require that a carriage service provider consents to a third party contacting that provider's customers. in the This will be important to enable TUSMA and relevant carriage service providers to accurately identify voice-only customers so that they can be notified about their service options and the processes involved if they wish to maintain a fixed-line voice service during the migration to the National Broadband Network. I therefore ask the House to support the amendments that are before it from the Senate.",71
156,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCHEDULE B," The question is that the requested amendments be agreed to. Question agreed to. Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be considered immediately. Senate's amendment – (1) Schedule 1, page 8 (after line 27), after item 28, insert: 28A Section 284 (heading) Repeal the heading, substitute: 284 Assisting the ACMA, the ACCC, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman or NA 28B At the end of section 284 Add: (4) Sections 276 and 277 do not prohibit a disclosure by a person of information or a document if: (a) the disclosure is made to, or to a member of the staff of, TUSMA; and (b) the information or document may assist TUSMA to carry out its functions or powers. 28C Section 299 (heading) Repeal the heading, substitute: 299 Assisting the ACMA, the ACCC, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman or NA 28D At the end of section 299 (before the note) Add: (4) If information or a document is disclosed to a person as permitted by subsection 284(4) or this subsection, the person must not disclose or use the information or document except for the purpose of, or in connection with, the carrying out of TUSMA's functions and powers. 28E Section 299 (note) Omit ""or the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman"", substitute Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman or TUSMA"".",71
157,Mr ALBANESE,TUSMA,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (17:29): I move: That the amendment be agreed to. The government considers that this amendment will facilitate TUSMA's achievement of its public interest telecommunications policy objectives. The amendment will allow for the flow of relevant information to TUSMA as the statutory agency with responsibility for entering into and managing contacts and grants for universal service and other public interest telecommunications outcomes. This amendment achieves this by permitting industry participants such as carriers and service providers to disclose information or documents to TUSMA where this would assist TUSMA in carrying out its contract and grant related functions and powers. The amendment mirrors existing provisions in part 13 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 that currently provide for disclosure of information to the ACMA, the ACCC and the TIO to enable those entities to carry out their functions or powers. I commend the Senate amendment to the House.",72
158,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TUSMA," The question is that the amendment be agreed to. Question agreed to. Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: "", the That this bill be now read a second time. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (17:31): The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and cognate bill both have misleading titles. The main bill, the maintaining address bill, should in fact be called the 'changing address bill'. The Minister for the Public Service and Integrity, in introducing that bill, said in his second reading speech that it would not cause automatic enrolment, and discussion at that stage was, 'We are only going to change addresses; we are not going to go to automatic enrolment.' However, shortly thereafter, we received the second bill, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill, which in fact should read 'electoral amendment (automatic enrolment) bill', because that is precisely what it does. It takes people off lists which are compiled for another purpose and data matches and decides that, if someone who has a particular address is not on the roll, they will automatically be placed on the roll. This follows in the footsteps of the dying days of the New South Wales parliament and the Victorian parliament, when both thought they would get an electoral advantage from doing this, and the Commonwealth is following for the same reasons. This is one of a series of bills that have been designed to give Labor and the Greens an electoral advantage. When we were in office we had removed prisoners from eligibility to vote, but the Labor Party changed it so that, unless prisoners had a sentence of more than two years, they would be allowed to vote. This of course disclosed that there are really bad criminals serving two years who are allowed to vote, and perhaps the Labor Party rightly made the conclusion that those sorts of people would vote Labor rather than Liberal and it would give them an electoral advantage. In all the inquiries of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, when we have asked questions and tried to find any evidence that this would be really beneficial, all we have found is that this has been a proposal of the Labor Party and the Greens, who have been in lock-step. Unfortunately, the AEC has been in lock-step in suggesting it would be an advantage as well. I think it is important that we look at people's writings on the nature of electoral law in this country to find a way in which we should progress these matters. Professor Orr in his excellent book The Law of Politics writes: 'The roll is essential to the franchise. Without it the franchise as a mass electorate would be very hard to police. It also serves in practice to limit the franchise.' As Acting Chief Justice Brennan put in Muldowney and the Australian Electoral Commission, the electoral roll is pivotal to the electoral system. He held that the qualifications to vote include enrolment, noting that the term 'elector' is defined to mean someone on the roll and that mandating an administrative hurdle like enrolment created no undue hardship. The Electoral Act does put an onus and a responsibility onto the individual. Once they become a citizen and are 18 years of age they must enrol. It is compulsory. In fact, last night the Electoral Commission held a function to celebrate 100 years of compulsory enrolment. It also was celebrating 50 years of Indigenous Australians being included on the roll. That indeed is a celebration. I pointed out in my speech last night that I was very proud to be a member of the Liberal Party, the party of which the first Aboriginal Senator, Senator Neville Bonner, was a member, and the party of which the first person of Aboriginal heritage in this House, Mr Ken Wyatt, is also a member. I could point out that the government could have had the opportunity of having a senator of Aboriginal descent, Mr Mundine, who would have been a grace to the Senate, but of course he was overlooked in favour of Mr Carr, the failed former Premier of New South Wales. In looking at that celebration last night, it was interesting that all the material that was other an display was about encouraging people to meet with their obligations to enrol and to change their address when they move, because that is the law. Currently, until this bill is passed, the law is that the responsibility is the obligation of the person who has attained the age of 18 and is a citizen of this country. As Acting Chief Justice Brennan pointed out in his decision, it is not an onerous one. But there are provisions in the act which say that, if you do not enrol or notify the AEC of your changed address, there is a fine, which is applicable; it is strict liability. There are no fines paid because the AEC does not enforce the law in this regard. In fact, when you look at the letters that the AEC write to people whom they believe through their datachecking may not be at that address, the AEC simply say: 'Remember you are eligible. It is the legal requirement to enrol and failure to do so may result in a fine.' Of course, it never does. Under the law it should say, 'You will be subject to being fined' and those fines should be collected-but no. This legislation removes that obligation from the Electoral Commission. Under legislation, the commissioner is no longer required to fine people once they have been automatically enrolled or had their address changed by the AEC. If you go to the second reading speech of the Special Minister of State, it is full of statements which are simply not borne out by the facts. He says in his second reading speech: … there are one and a half million Australian citizens who cannot choose their representatives in parliament. Well, yes they can. All they have to do is comply with the law and enrol or notify the AEC of any change of address. Their ability to vote is entirely within their hands. They have the interim period between the last election and the one that follows-that entire period. Indeed, under legislation brought in by this government, this includes the period of time from when the writs are issued; it has been lengthened. So people can enrol almost up to the last minute. The minister says in his speech: This bill will protect the participation of eligible Australian citizens in the electoral process by establishing a safety net for enrolment and voting. No, it will not. It will automatically add names to the roll without people's authority or consent. The minister goes on to say: This amendment will not affect the integrity of the electoral roll … No, it will not. It will in fact reduce the integrity of the roll. This is where a philosophical divide exists between the coalition, and the Labor Party and the Greens. We say that the first and foremost obligation of the Electoral Commissioner is to uphold the integrity of the roll-that is, to make it as free from error and fraud as can possibly be done. The system that is being introduced will simply add names to the roll, this without adequate checking and without the consent of the individual elector. It is the obligation of the elector to do it. The proposed system opens up the roll to fraud and to error. We were very obliged to Dr Clarke from the Privacy Foundation, who came before our committee, for giving us very useful evidence about the way in which data processing is utilised, how it is subject to false positives and false negatives and how it is not to be relied upon as being safe to use at all. But to go back to the speech of the Special Minister of State, he said: The bill will ensure the accuracy and completeness of the roll … No, it will not. It will leave it open to more errors and to the possibility of fraud. During evidence given by Mr Killesteyn, I asked him whether, if a particular set of circumstances were a reality, someone could be struck from the roll improperly. I asked him this question: 'Supposing we had Mrs Bloggs, who in fact had not moved from her address. She is one of those people who have a second house. Her principal place of residence is X but on the list that you have obtained'-that is, Mr Killesteyn-'her address is shown as Y and she is not going to get your letter.' Mr Killesteyn gave evidence that he only writes to the new address and not to the old. 'She is not going to reply to you in 28 days and you are going to change her address. She is going to rock up on election day and be told she is not on the roll because her other address is in a different electorate. She has no right to be on the roll in the different electorate but someone who perhaps knew that it had been changed could rock up in her name and it could be a marginal seat and someone could vote in her name. She would be denied her vote and a fraudulent vote would be counted in a marginal electorate. How are you going to overcome that difficulty?' Mr Killesteyn replied: Going back to the original proposition, everything you said about the address change is true. But one would wonder why that individual would have changed the address either with Centrelink, Australia Post or the Roads and Traffic AuthorityThe fact of the matter is that, under this legislation, the Electoral Commission is given the absolute right to choose any list they like to data-match, to change addresses and to enrol people who are not presently enrolled. Mr Killesteyn said that he currently uses only the RTA or the equivalent thereof from various states, Australia Post and Centrelink. Centrelink, I think it is sensible to realise, is the collection database of 100 agencies. So there are an enormous number of scrubbed databases already fed into the one that the Electoral Commissioner uses. The question as to why anyone would do that really does not answer the question. Mr Killesteyn said that everything I said was correct, and it can and no doubt will be done at some stage. But now we go to the evidence about what transpired in New South Wales and Victoria. It is important here to again go to the second reading speech of the minister. It says: This notice will advise the recipient that they have 28 days to inform the Electoral Commissioner that they do not live at that address or are not entitled to enrolment. Of course, we have established that the Electoral Commissioner only writes to the new address. That is the one he has gained from the databases. He does not, as he has specifically told us, write to the old address. Very simply, we will have people who can be wrongly enrolled. Further in his speech the minister says: This is similar to the successful processes currently used in New South Wales and Victoria. Let us look at the success rate. In New South Wales around 92 per cent of people are on the good old-fashioned roll, the one that is properly compiled by people who actually sign an enrolment form and lodge it with the Electoral Commission. All of that will be going, as a necessity. People can still do it, but it will not be essential to get on the roll. Of the people who were automatically enrolled, only 64 per cent of them voted. Of those on the properly established roll, 92 per cent voted. Of the 64 per cent who voted on the new automatic enrolment, the commissioner now writes to them and says that he has been advised that they have been placed on the roll in either New South Wales or Victoria but that that does not put them on the roll for federal elections and would they please fill out the relevant forms and send them back, or if it is to be an online change of address do it there. Their success rate from that letter is 20 per cent. That is an 80 per cent failure rate. In the minister's words, 'This is similar to the successful processes currently used in New South Wales and Victoria.' If that is a success rate, then we can do without it federally, thank you very much. We go on to the question of reliable sources. The minister says: Information from reliable sources is already used by the Australian Electoral Commission to monitor the accuracy of the roll and to remove a person from the roll through objection action. Under this legislation the objection process goes. So there will be no cleansing of the roll for people who are wrongly placed in that address. There will merely be the affirmative action process of people being put on the roll because of another collection of data on another list not compiled for this purpose and their address changed similarly. The minister says that this is not an automatic process. Yet, when the Electoral Commissioner writes to these people he says that they have been automatically enrolled by, what he calls, successful New South Wales and Victorian processes. Clearly, it is an automatic process. The minister in charge of the bill further states in his speech: The existing law provides that where electors have been removed from the electoral roll due to an administrative error or a mistake of fact, votes can be admitted to further scrutiny after Electoral Commission has verified the elector's enrolment and voting entitlement. However, being removed from the roll through objection action does not currently constitute an administrative error or mistake of fact. Therefore, there is provision for checking and provision for declaratory votes. The very useful book, which I quoted from before, The Law of Politics by Professor Graeme Orr, draws our attention to the important fact that the roll is the final determinant of who is entitled to vote. He says: 'Like other official public registers, such as land registers, a chief feature of electoral rolls is their finality. The purpose of a roll is to be a definitive statement of the entitlement to vote'-leaving aside the potential for provisional declaration votes by those erroneously omitted from the roll'Thus there is a rule that the roll is conclusive evidence of the entitlement to vote. Reinforcing this is the secondary rule in almost all jurisdictions that a court of disputed returns is not to inquire into the correctness of the roll.' Again, I come back to this philosophical divide that on this side of the House we say that the integrity of the roll is the first responsibility to be pursued at all costs by the Electoral Commission whereas, on the other side of the House, the government says, 'No, just adding numbers is far more important.' That is a very important philosophical divide. But our contention is backed up by judicial findings. In the case of Perkins and Cusack, the federal Court of Disputed Returns faced a petition claiming that many people were on the roll for the seat of the Eden-Monaro, whose real place of living was outside the electorate. Imagine that! Even though it was alleged that some enrolled electors lived at addresses that lay outside the divisional boundaries, Mr Justice their Starke refused to allow any evidence to be the tendered that might contradict the face of the roll. In the case of Re Berrill's Petition in 1975, a three-judge bench of the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns rejected the claim on jurisdictional grounds where Mrs Berrill had complained about the state of the electoral roll. The court rejected that claim on jurisdictional grounds, citing the prohibition of going behind the roll. Importantly, Mr Justice Stephen noted that this did not mean that errors in the roll were completely unreviewable. This is a very important finding. Rather, he noted that the prohibition assumes that errors on the roll ought to be put in order before an election rather than risking dislocation of the democratic process through illegal challenges to the roll during the campaign or after it. That is why we say the integrity of the roll has to be foremost and why we reject the proposition that the government puts forward that merely adding names to the list at any cost is the correct way to proceed. This is certainly backed up by that ruling by Mr Justice Stephen, because it is implicit in automatic enrolment and automatic changing of addresses that there will be errors brought into the roll that otherwise would not be there. I go back to the points that were made by the minister in charge of the bill, the Special Minister of State. He said: With the trend in declining enrolment participation, it is no longer possible to keep doing the same things in the same way, particularly as superior processes have been successfully implemented in New South Wales and Victoria. The desperate measures put in place by the New South Wales Labor government and the Victorian Labor government did not save them from being defeated. The fact of the matter is that they introduced into their rolls errors which are the result of the process that this bill will bring in. There are two things to say about some of the technicalities associated with data-matching and the use of rolls created for another purpose. Firstly, on the government's own privacy website, at Privacy.gov.au/law/other/datamatch, states: Data-matching involves bringing together data from different sources and comparing it. Much of the data-matching done by agencies subject to the Privacy Act aims to identify people for further action or investigation. … Data-matching poses a particular threat to personal privacy because it involves analysing information about large numbers of people without prior cause for suspicion. That is very important in the privacy aspects of the roll. There is provision in the current act for people to be exempted from being placed on the roll because they may be fearful of domestic violence or for a number of other reasons. There is provision for that and many people are indeed exempted. But, under this system, as the government itself warns, wearing another hat, there is the problem that people who would rightly be entitled to be not on the roll would be put automatically on the roll. That does not necessarily mean people who have already applied and are off the roll; it also means people who are yet to apply to not be on the roll, who would simply be automatically put on. That would apply particularly to young people, because they have not had the opportunity, prior to their turning 18, to be concerned about this issue. So, on the one hand, the government warns, through its privacy website, that there are a great deal of problems in using datamatching because, in its words, 'it involves analysing information about large numbers of people without prior cause for suspicion,' and yet, on the other hand, the government brings in a bill which is going to overlook all of that because it thinks that there is a political advantage for it. We are very obliged to Dr Roger Clarke, from the Privacy Foundation. I am very proud to say that I have worked with that foundation before, when I worked with many it others to fight off the Labor Party's Australia Card, which was to be a national identity card and which we were successful in defeating.",72
159,Mr Garrett,TUSMA,"We were indeed. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: We were on the same side on that one. It was quite remarkable. That was before you got seduced, dare I say. Dr Clarke said, in his evidence to us: The point about data matching is that it is extraordinarily error-prone. It is based on, firstly, name; secondly, usually, elements of address and, thirdly, date of birth. Date of birth is commonly unreliable. People fib about their ages. Many people are not very pleased about having to disclose their ages, and that includes males as well as females. Address in this context cannot be used because the whole purpose of the study is to come up with different addresses and therefore you cannot match on it. So you have you got to reduce quality of data matching in this datamatching program compared to all the other datamatching programs that go on in government. Name is enormously variable in its recording and is routinely 'scrubbed'-that is the term used-in order to try to muck around with the data, modify the data, in order to make it seem right. It is differently scrubbed by every different agency, so we have differential collection for different purposes in different ways with different dataquality measures with different data-scrubbing measures, and then we bundle all this together and match it. The false positives that arise from this are enormous, as indeed are the false negatives, because there are enormous numbers of occasions where matches could in principle be discovered which in fact are not discovered by the algorithms that are used. It is extraordinarily error prone. In circumstances like these you would think enormous care would be taken, enormous justification would have to be provided, proportionality would be taken account of and it would only be done when there are very serious benefits to be gained. Unfortunately that is far from the case. In other words, Dr Clarke, who is skilled in the e-business industry, has pointed out to us the use of scrubbing, the way in which data is collected and modified to suit the purposes for which it is collected, and such data is now going to be bundled together and used by the Electoral Commissioner to change the electoral roll, the integrity of which is fundamental to running a proper democratic system. I think we have to conclude, unfortunately, that the government and the Greens, who have been pushing this agenda for a considerable period of time because they feel it gives them an electoral advantage, are going to be able to force this legislation through the parliament. However, it will certainly be looked at should we be successful in being elected to government at the next election. At the last gasp, the failed Victorian and New South governments tried this ploy to enhance their chances of re-election. I suspect the same outcome as befell them will befall the Gillard government and its aspirations to try and gain an electoral advantage from this. I would like to conclude by saying that I suspect the next piece of legislation in this train of manipulation of the electoral process will be to try to introduce the South Australian voting system whereby, if you do not complete your ballot paper, a bureaucrat will take it over for you if there has been a registered ticket. Watch this space. I fear that the evils that can be done to the electoral system are not yet finished.",77
160,Mr MELHAM,TUSMA," Let me say at the outset that, with that contribution, the member for Mackellar has shown that she will be never known as the guardian of the franchise. The debate we are having today in relation to these two bills, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012, is an argument about enfranchisement and disenfranchisement. The drivel that came from the member for Mackellar would have you believe that there is a conspiracy between the Labor Party and the Greens, in lockstep with the independent Australian Electoral Commission. During the hearings in relation to these two matters and on other occasions-and indeed, I am told, last night at a function held at the Electoral Commission; I had to leave early and so I have heard this second-hand-the member for Mackellar has continually asserted a connection between the Electoral Commission and the government. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Electoral Commission is independent and has shown itself to be independent. On Saturday I will celebrate 22 years in this Wales place, and for most of that time. I have been on the commission-yes, it was a Freudian slip. For most of that time, I have been on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I have seen arguments of the commission with all the political parties. The commission has on numerous occasions put submissions to the committee that the political parties have not accepted. In a number of instances in relation to these bills, a proper reading of the transcripts and submissions over time will show that the commission was ahead of the action when it came to some of these measures, as against the political parties, and was arguing for these measures because they would assist with enfranchisement. The member for Mackellar did not tell you that, in the joint standing committee report tabled in February 2012, on the maintaining address bill, at paragraph 1.4, on page 4, the following appears in relation to the first bill we are debating today, which blows the conspiracy theory out of the water. There is a conspiracy. There is a conspiracy by the member for Mackellar to confuse and dissemble. At paragraph 1.4, the committee report says: The Bill is described in the Explanatory Memorandum (EM) as implementing recommendation 10 of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters' Report on the conduct of the 2007 federal election and matters related thereto. It was a unanimous recommendation. The members of the committee for that report wereAnd there is a list of the Labor members and others. The Liberal members were: Scott Morrison MP, Bruce Scott MP, Senator Simon Birmingham and Senator the Hon. Michael Ronaldson. Senator Ronaldson was the shadow minister in charge of the Electoral Act. Mr Morrison is a former state director of the Liberal Party. The point I am making here is that they agreed to the contents of this bill before the House. The change to the recommendation only occurred when the member for Mackellar got onto the committee and, for political advantage, changed the position of the Liberal Party. These reports are based on amendments that were made in some instances by the former government and we now know their effect, which is that they resulted in the disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of people. The report in relation to automatic enrolment and other matters obviously shows that there has been development in a number of the states, and it is all about enfranchising people from reliable sources. In my time in this place there is only one area where I have argued for disenfranchisement, and I do not apologise for it. The member for Mackellar would be surprised to learn that my supporter in the recommendation I made arising out of the 2007 election was none other than Alan Jones. The recommendation I made was that those British subjects who have had their vote protected since 1984 should at least have to take out Australian citizenship by 2014 in order to maintain their right to vote in this country, so that citizenship should be a requirement. That is the only time in my time on the electoral committee and I was the only one who signed it, for a particular reason. It is not unique to Australia. It happens in Britain and it happens in New Zealand, so there is an argument there. But on every other occasion what motivates me is not political. It is not: do these people vote Liberal or Labor? Or is it like the hanging chad instance in Florida? It is to ensure the franchise, protect the franchise and enable it, and not have administrative features that result in disenfranchisement. That is what some of the provisions of the former government have done in relation to prisoners and, in the second case, in relation to the declaration votes, where people might not have responded to correspondence and have had their name taken off the roll. They show up on the day and the proof of identity provisions and a combination of all these matters has resulted in a massive reduction in the reinstatement of people who were otherwise entitled to vote. So paperwork, a bit of slackness or an error resulted in their losing the important right to vote. We should err, with some constraints, on the side of the franchise. That is why the High Court in a number of recent cases basically said, of the former government's legislation in relation to prisoners, 'Bad luck. You got it wrong', and said in relation to the seven-day closing of the rolls, which was brought forward, 'You got it wrong. Fix it up,' because tens and of thousands of people were disenfranchised. What I say to my colleagues who are listening and to those who are following this debate is: actually analyse what the member for Mackellar has said and you will find that most of it is rubbish-paranoid, delusional, conspiratorial theory about the Labor Party and the Greens being worried about a block of votes that votes for them overwhelmingly. That is not my concern. I am actually not frightened of losing, if that is what the people want. I have to say the member for Mackellar has been consistent; I will give her credit for that. But her view is not uniform, even within the Liberal Party, and it is the same on our side of the chamber. A number of the provisions are reinstating because we now have the results of what those changes meant. The proof of identity, which meant tens and tens of thousands, is an example. What are we, as parliamentarians, to domake it hard with lots of loops? The Liberal Party is supposed to be the party that gets of red tape. We had 11½ years of red tape inserted into the Electoral Act, which has resulted in numerous people being disenfranchised. We have one of the best electoral systems in the world and one of the best electoral commissions in the world. They are truly professional and truly independent. They should not have to put up with the rubbish and garbage that comes out of the member for Mackellar with an inference that they are somehow doing the Labor Party's bidding-far from it. I have some views that certainly differ from the Electoral Commission, but you can respect professionals who have different views. The member for Mackellar seems to be saying, 'Unless you agree with me, your view is not worth pursuing.' I say to the member for Mackellar that the worse thing she can do, or I can do, is pursue political advantage. The Liberal Party have actually done quite tens well out of the electoral system. Some want to have optional voting. Compulsory voting was actually introduced by the conservatives in the twenties. Many good electoral features have been introduced by the conservative side of politics, and they have done pretty well at a federal level. Indeed, since Federation conservatives have ruled for 65 or 66 per cent of the time. But what they cannot stand, and what this is about, is a class of people, those whom they regard as a different class of uneducated and uninformed people, having equality and the right to vote at the same level. I have to tell you, a lot of people are confused by the electoral system because they do not have our obsessions. Some of us are obsessed with electoral systems. Why? Because it is a precious right to be able to go along and vote for your representative in your area, whether they be Labor, Liberal, National or Callithumpian. People are fighting overseas to defend democracies or to create democracies so that rid dictators, totalitarian regimes and tanks are not the basis of a vote. In my humble opinion, we have one of the best democracies in the world, the best electoral systems in the world and the best commission in the world. Regarding the idea that fraud is rampant in our society, we have had members of the Liberal Party, the former member for MCEwen, members in Adelaide, and Chris Gallus as well, elected by a handful of votes, and there has been the opportunity to put up or shut up and show there is electoral fraud. We have provisions in the Electoral Act where, if there is multiple voting that makes a difference, you provide the evidence and if it affects the result you get a fresh ballot. They are all there. We make the rules and, in my opinion, if there is a problem it is our fault and not the commission's. They have to implement the rules and the law as they are. Do not blame them; blame us. In the time of the Howard government the former commissioner defended a number of matters that the government was pushing forward. That was his role, and we were critical of it in relation to some amendments to the Electoral Act. But an independent Public Service is required to provide the material as an independent Public Service, not to take a partisan position, and it is not right of me to criticise members of the commission if they do not happen to agree with me and are asserting it. I am disappointed with the member for Mackellar. I know she is passionate. I know she genuinely believes in what she is saying. But there is a saying 'garbage in, garbage out', which is, really, how you can judge a lot of the contribution that has been made in relation toMrs Mirabella: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I find that offensive and I would ask the member to withdraw.",78
161,Mr MELHAM,TUSMA,"I withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker.",81
162,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TUSMA, I thank the member for Banks.,81
163,Mr MELHAM,TUSMA,"It was not meant to be offensive but, if it is offensive, I withdraw. That is not the nature of what I am trying to say. What I am saying is: have a look at the quality of the material that the member for Mackellar is putting up. I have looked at it. I know she is genuine about it and I do not really question her genuineness. But she is wrong; she is absolutely wrong. If we followed what she said, tens of thousands of people would be disenfranchised. We were not inundated by submission after submission from groups who have an interest in electoral matters saying, 'You're on the wrong path.' This is not the first inquiry we have had in relation to each of these bills, because they arise out of submissions to the inquiries into the 2007 election and the 2010 election. People had an opportunity then to submit to the bills but we did not get many submissions. We struggled to get people and the member for Mackellar was allowed the opportunity to bring along anyone she wanted. If what we were doing was wrong, if what we were doing was crooked, if what we were doing was partisan, this parliament and the committee would have been inundated, before, during and after the event, with criticism. The Privacy Foundation people again were genuine. I missed the first hearing-I had another commitment-but I was there for the second and I listened respectfully to them. Again, the transcript speaks for itself. It did not convince me that we were going down the wrong path. I believe in my heart of hearts that what we are doing by these two measures is enfranchising. We should pursue them to the end and enact them, because many tens of thousands of eligible people will then have their vote counted; otherwise, they will continue to be disqualified, morally and in every other way wrongly, from having their vote counted to elect their parliament, their representative, their government. Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (18:16): In speaking on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and cognate bill I will attempt to be more sober in my approach than the member for Banks. It is understandable at times that there is a competition about who can be more hairy-chested about being more democratic in this place, and the integrity of the electoral roll is absolutely fundamental the integrity of our democracy. We do not have huge variations in the number of seats which switch from one party to another when there is a general election. Often an election is decided on a handful of votes in a handful of seats. That places an even greater emphasis on doing what we can to have as accurate an electoral roll as possible. That is why the integrity of the electoral roll is absolutely central to the integrity of our democracy. I was rather perplexed by some of the comments made by the member for Banks when he spoke of some people in the opposition wanting to disenfranchise people and somehow having different classes of people. What absolute rubbish! What absolute rubbish, invoking some nebulous class war argument that here is the opposition thinking there are classes of people who we should lock out of the voting system. How absolutely absurd. This is obviously just another time filler, because at the moment everyone is equal. Everyone who qualifies as an Australian citizen has gained the privilege of enrolling and of voting in our system. Somehow there is this Orwellian language when we speak of our democracy and elections-it is quite perverse-saying that somehow we are a better democracy if Big Brother decides on people's enrolment and their change of address details; Big Brother is there to look after all these people who are incapable of doing it themselves. That, friends on the other side, is the arrogance and the elitism that is a central part of your argument, because, in our current system, Australians who are eligible to vote have the right and the obligation to enrol. We have significant problems on this side, and it begins with but goes beyond the fundamental belief that individuals should be active participants in their democracy. We to cannot force people to be active or to care. Quite frankly, when they look at the state of the current political system federally, do you wonder why they do not care and that they watch events in this place with utter despair and disappointment? This legislation removes personal responsibility from an elector to fill out an enrolment form, to fill in their details. At the 2007 election over 20,600 votes were multiple votes. It has been noted, particularly by opposition Senator Scott Ryan, who takes a particular interest in these matters, with great disappointment, which I have to say I share, that the Australian Electoral Commission did not prosecute any cases of fraudulent voting. It disturbs me that there were so many multiple votes, and these sorts of things should be investigated. If we want to say that we have an open and transparent democracy, we need to look at these issues and examine them. Another significant problem is: how can you arm appropriate authorities with the best information to tackle fraud when you remove one of those matters that is examined in determining whether there has been electoral fraud-that is, an elector's signature? When they enrol, they fill in the enrolment form and sign it. Automatic enrolment just does away with that. That disturbs me significantly. And we see how automatic enrolment will occur. We are told that the AEC will use data sources. They will have the sole discretion to use so called 'reliable and current data', and it is an opt-out system. If you do not object within 28 days, then you are automatically added to the roll. There are significant problems with that. Can someone in the Labor Party please explain why a potential elector is not trusted to fill in their enrolment form but they are trusted with a vote? Why cannot those opposite, who are pursuing this legislation, have the basic respect for potential voters to allow them the privilege to actually enrol to vote and to change their details? We can see an enormous array of problems when it comes to updating people's enrolment details, for a whole number of reasons, and yet these are utterly brushed aside. When we look at the so-called reliable data that is going to be used, let us look at some government information. I can see the member for Melbourne Ports bursting to have a go. I think you are on next, mate, so just do not get too excited. The fact that one government, which may have been of my persuasion, at some time in the past used data for a particular purpose does not mean that that data was absolutely accurate and infallible. No government data in an aggregate sense would be more accurate than an individual actually choosing to fill in the electoral form, whether to go onto the roll or to change their details. So what is reliable and current data? We are told that this will be determined by the Australian Electoral Commission themselves, and we have serious concerns about this because there are flaws in data the government collects. Let us just look at some details. There are 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals; 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a sample match; and, when we look at tax file numbers, there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia at the last census. So there are flaws. There are mistakes with data because it requires data entry. There is human error involved in all of that. So let us not pretend that Big Brother, assembling and amassing a whole lot of information, is superior to that individual Australian who has the privilege of filling out that enrolment form. It just makes absolute nonsense to say that that is the case. The Labor Party goes on to essentially say: 'Well, everything is excusable. There'll be a few mistakes. That's okay because our overriding concern is maximising the franchise.' That is the argument.",81
164,Mr Danby,TUSMA,"Democracy! Democracy! Mrs MIRABELLA: 'Democracy!' my friend from Melbourne Ports calls out. As a proud custodian of the culture and philosophy that gave the world democracy, Member for Melbourne Ports, I am a very proud advocate of democracy, but don't we find it somewhat ironic that we have a government saying, 'We want democracy'? What is democracy? If we break it down, it is the will of the people. So we have Big Brother telling the people: 'This is your will. We will enrol you.' How utterly absurd. How counterintuitive. The Labor Party can talk about democracy all they like, whilst they disrespect the intelligence of the Australian people to enrol to vote. If there are issues, we have worked over decades on electoral education, on getting people onto the roll. But this attempt to introduce automatic enrolment and to have automatic changes to people's address details will only increase that problems with the integrity of the roll because there are already embedded problems with the correctness of the information in the data with which this automatic enrolment and changes to the enrolment will be undertaken. It is not actually that difficult and it is not actually that onerous to fill out an enrolment form. It is absolutely absurd to say, 'That is such a high bar.' If you take that to its logical conclusion, then, for so many things that we need to be proactive to fill in forms about, why don't we just dispense with that? Why don't we have Big Brother in every department just making decisions about what we should do? That is the logical conclusion of what the Labor Party are proposing. They expect us, on this very, very important issue of the integrity of the electoral roll, to just have blind faith that the 'reliable and current data source', which has no definition, which will be at the discretion of the commission, will be absolutely flawless. We cannot accept that because we have seen data that is flawed. They hold up the automatic enrolment in New South Wales, and that has not been without its problems. Only 12 per cent of people who had their details automatically changed in New South Wales-at the state level-then enrolled themselves federally. As a result, electoral commissions at both federal and state level are having extraordinary difficulty in contacting people. This is just one example of the problems you get with automatic enrolment. We do not believe that government knows best. We do not believe in the nanny state. We believe in upholding and respecting the rights and responsibilities of individual Australian citizens to change their enrolment forms and details. Beyond that, we think there is great scope to water down the integrity of the electoral roll. I do not have a view about the voting intentions of one group of people as opposed to another-we see a very fluid change in the Australian community. What I am concerned about is Big Brother making big mistakes and watering down this great democracy of ours.",83
165,Mr DANBY,TUSMA," It is a great pleasure and honour to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address Bill) 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012 and to respond to some of the points made by the members for Indi and Mackellar. I particularly want to commend the Special Minister of State for tackling this matter and taking up the decline of enrolment across Australia. This legislation will mean that, when it comes to elections, more Australians will have a say in who represents them. I will provide some of the extraordinary facts-as opposed to the rhetoric from obscure professors cited by the member for Mackellar-outlined by the Electoral Commission in their report on these changes to the roll. In 2001, there were 0.9 million electors not on the roll; in 2004, there were 1.2 million electors not on the roll; in 2007, there were 1.1 million electors not on the roll; and, in 2010, there were 1.4 million electors not on the roll. At the parallel elections of 2001, there were 12.6 million Australians on the roll; in 2004, there were 13 million on the roll; in 2007, there were 13.6 million on the roll; and, in 2010, there were 14.1 million on the roll. The Australian Electoral Commission estimate that, at the end of 2011, the federal enrolment participation rate was 90.2 per cent. This means that around 1.5 million people who are eligible to vote are not enrolled and consequently cannot vote. Indeed, at the 2010 federal election, 2½ million Australians did not effectively exercise their vote. Of these, 1.4 million were not enrolled, 729,000 were enrolled but did not show up, 400,000 cast informal ballots and 166,000 provisional voters thought they had cast a valid vote but in fact had their vote excluded. These issues were all handled by other aspects of the government's electoral legislation, but I want to go back to the Electoral Commission's cool, rational, dispassionate explanation of the decline in the percentage of people who are enrolled and of the massive increase in the absolute number of Australians who are not enrolled. The estimated enrolment participation rate on 31 December 2011 was, as I said, 90.2 per cent of the eligible population. That sits near the bottom end, the Electoral Commission said, of any recently recorded measure of enrolment participation. The problem of non-enrolment extends beyond an asserted disengaged youth issue. Enrolment rates do not reach 90 per cent of voters until voters reach 40 years of age and the AEC's whole-of-population target of 95 per cent enrolment is not met until electors reach their mid-50s or late 50s. Worse than that is the fact that not only is the absolute number of Australians not enrolled increasing but the percentage of the population not enrolled is also increasing. So the Electoral Commission has a very substantial problem, a problem not addressed in the remarks of either the member for Indi or the member for Mackellar. The member for Indi spoke of a class war and used the Liberals' favourite cliches-'the integrity of the electoral roll' and 'Big Brother'. The integrity of the electoral roll involves more than just cutting people off and making it harder for them to be enrolled; it involves seeing that the Australian electoral roll accurately represents the broad mass of citizens of Australia as best it can. Some of the remarks of the member for Indi would make former Prime Minister John Howard turn in his grave-if he were in it, which thankfully he is not at the moment. But the point is that continuous roll update was used by the previous Howard government to",84
166,Mr Robert,TUSMA,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: as much as it pains me to interrupt the member for Melbourne Ports, understanding order 90, 'Reflections on Members', it is inappropriate for him to reflect on the member for Indi and what the former Prime Minister may or may not have thought of her.",85
167,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TUSMA, I do not think there is any point of order.,85
168,Mr DANBY,TUSMA,"I was reflecting on the content of what the member for Indi said, not on her or on former Prime Minister Howard. My point was that continuous roll update using existing databases has been used for years. Mr Howard, I seem to remember, won every election from 1996 until 2007-and what were the sinister databases provided by Big Brother? They were the very same databases that are to be used by the Electoral Commission in this proposed enrolment procedure. The member for Indi was complaining about the failure of prosecutions which have to be initiated by the police at the recommendation of the Electoral Commission. I have often recounted to the House that between 1999 and 2010 there were six electoral events, including a referendum, and 72 proven cases of electoral fraud. In those six events approximately 72,000,000 votes were cast and there were only 72 proven cases of electoral fraud. The effect of this fraud on individual electorates has not been identified by any of the premier electoral experts-Professor Mackerras, Professor Hughes and Professor Costar. The issue of the integrity of the electoral roll is a nonsense, and it has been raised to avoid addressing the major issue-the increasing number of Australians who are not enrolled. The number enrolled is down to 90 per cent. That means very large numbers of our fellow Australians are excluded by a process that used to take place of cutting them off the roll. As the member for Mackellar correctly pointed out, only 20 per cent of them responded to letters from the Electoral Commission. We know they can be at new addresses, and that is confirmed by two or three independent databaseswhether they be Centrelink or Transport Accident Commission or other databases. This hollows out the electoral roll and makes it less valid. If you indeed value democracy, if you indeed believe the words of the members for Mackellar and Indi about the integrity of the electoral roll, you cannot have more and more people being affected by the unintended consequence of cutting people from the electoral roll, as the Electoral Commission used to do when people did not sign bits of paper. We know the reason young people do not do that is most of them are on email and they do not respond to hard mail. We see the huge numbers of Australian tourists going overseas. How many people are doing fly-in fly-out all around the country? We can see how mobile modern Australians are. All of these factors contribute to the old snail mail CRU 'cut them off the roll' system, effectively disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of Australians over time. This is something that any democratic parliament should have to weigh against a few cases of electoral fraud-as I said, 72 out of 72 million votes cast over a 10-year period. This legislation is part of an effort to ensure the majority of Australians are enfranchised. Those opposite speak of the integrity of the roll when they oppose changes to our electoral laws. Today I would like to tell them we are doing something to maintain the integrity of the roll-we are ensuring that Australians have a chance to cast a vote at the ballot box. It is not Big Brother telling them how to vote; it is just giving the opportunity to vote to the hundreds of thousands of people who have been kept off the roll by the unintended consequences of a system of continuous roll update that the Electoral Commission had been legislated to undertake. Keeping people off the roll is a wrong attitude. Disenfranchising Australians is a wrong attitude. It is reprehensible that those who are now in charge of the Liberal Party oppose giving more Australians a chance to be involved in the electoral process. I am not surprised-the Liberal Party now opposes us along every step of the way, and this includes opposing changes proposed by the government to the egregious and toxic legislation the Liberals passed in 2006. As the member for Banks correctly pointed out, and as have former members of the Electoral Commission and members of the that opposition-Ronaldson, Morrison, Scott et cetera-this process of more and more Australians not participating in the vote, not enrolling, being cut off, was covered in a unanimous committee report and a unanimous recommendation: no conspiracy by the Electoral Commission there. The Liberal Party and the National Party, which remembers the good old days when 5,000 persons and 100,000 sheep were accepted as part of a rural electorate, now oppose the changes made to repeal early closing of the electoral rolls. They oppose changes to amend provisional voting laws. In my electorate, and it would be the same in everyone's electorate, you would have 1,800 people apply for a provisional vote-they had changed their address at the last minute but they lived within the electorate and they were able to provide an electricity bill or some other identification. Increasingly, because of the Liberals' 2006 changes, more and more people were cut off between 2007 and 2010. In my electorate-it is typical of what happened across Australia-of the 1,800 people who applied, only 370 got their vote. Some shocking things have happened recently. I cited the electoral experts before-Professors Mackerras, Hughes and Costar-and they agreed that the existing laws were partisan and unfair and bad for our democracy. No-one can say, having gone to the last election with these issues in front of us, that we do not have a mandate for this measure. We have a compulsory voting system in Australia and it is disturbing to me, as it should be to every Australian, that, with a democracy like ours and compulsory voting, 2½ million Australians at the last election did not exercise a vote. It is the responsibility of this parliament to look at the fact that 1.5 million of the 15.5 million people who should have been on the electoral roll at the last election were not. The integrity that the members for Mackellar and Indi spoke about so passionately is not a matter of excluding as many Australians as you can-it is a matter of seeing that the electoral roll is current, accurate and, yes, has integrity as a result of including as many Australians as possible. My colleague the member for Banks, who is the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, neglected to point out one other political factor. Not only do we have the Electoral Commission, the government, others in the House and independent electoral experts supporting this legislation, but we also have the governments of New South Wales and Victoria supporting it. Excuse me, but as far as I understand it they are both of the conservative hue. Mr O'Farrell is the Premier of the New South Wales and Mr Baillieu is the Premier of Victoria. Neither of those two gentlemen or their governments seem to share the prejudices of the members for Mackellar and Indi. They do not seek to overturn the attempts to enfranchise as many Australians as possible-or, in their cases, as many Victorians or New South Welshman as possible. They are quite happy with these changes-changes accepted with the more rational support of people like Morrison, Ronaldson and Scott, who were on this committee previously. Over time, the changes will see more Australians on the electoral roll. That will ensure its integrity. If there is any attempt enrol people unfairly or illegally, this should be looked at by the Electoral Commission and by the Australia Federal Police. As I have said on previous occasions, attempts to look at this kind of behaviour have been minimal at best. In fact, most of the 72 cases were of people in northern New South Wales who were trying to get drivers licences in Queensland and had nothing to do with trying to rort electoral procedures. These are very great amendments and a great progress towards democracy of which this government can be very proud.",85
169,Mr BUCHHOLZ,TUSMA," I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the cognate Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. I take on board the previous speaker's comments with reference to the declining number of people not on the roll. From memory, the number was 2.9 million people not on the roll and, of those, 400,000 people cast their votes in an invalid format. Listening to the trend regarding Australians choosing whether or not to be on the roll, as a parliament we need to look at ourselves and do some soul-searching when it comes to asking why people are not motivated to be enrolled and participate in the direction of our nation. I suggest that there is an increasing number of people who do not trust either side of government. I hear this often on polling days in Queensland. I will be joining state candidates and incumbents in Queensland this Saturday and I know I will get the standard line from a select number who roll up to polling booths and say, 'I don't trust any of you @#$%&* and I wish I could park my vote informally.' I suggest that maybe our behaviour in the House is one way we could address the concerns people have about the integrity of the parliament. I to suggest a little more honesty and sincerity. We do not have to go too far back before the last election when it comes to electoral matters to see that we had a potential Prime Minister looking down the barrel and saying one thing and then directly after being elected doing another. It comes down to the integrity of government. When you are watching which way the data is skewing there could be some collegial evidence to support why people are choosing not to vote. We have supported nearly 78 per cent of the bills that have come before this House. That is a staggering number given the lines that the government throw out about usthat we oppose everything, that we say no, no, no. The data I received from the library in the last term",87
170,Mr Gray,TUSMA,You're opposing this.,88
171,Mr BUCHHOLZ,TUSMA,"Yes, I am opposing this one. You have that right. The point I am making is that we do not oppose everything. I do not suggest that the introduction of this legislation is going to change the trajectory of the figures. The coalition support the concept of less government, less intervention and the freedom for people to make a choice. Get your hands out of the pockets of business and let them have a crack. These bills amend the Electoral Act to allow the Australian Electoral Commission to directly enrol new electors on the electoral roll when the Electoral Commissioner is satisfied that an individual is living at a particular address for a period of one month and is eligible to be on the roll, and gives AEC authority to change the address of electors when it believes they have changed their residential address. The coalition oppose this legislation because we believe it will significantly diminish the integrity of the electoral roll. Let us have a look at some background to this legislation. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters conducted an inquiry into the 2010 federal election and reported in July 2011. One of the recommendations of the Labor and Greens committee members was to introduce automatic enrolment. This is a process by which an individual can be placed directly on the roll without ever filling out a form and, more to the point, without their knowledge. I suggest that that is where we should not be heading. This process would enable the AEC to use information from other government sources to make a determination about who should be on the roll. There are a couple of issues here. Firstly, it is highly likely that this process will diminish the integrity of the roll-and I will talk more about that-and, secondly, it will remove the responsibility on electors to update or maintain their enrolment details when they change addresses. Currently, the honour of living in a democratic society where we have the freedom of a vote comes with some responsibility and that responsibility as an Australian is to keep the Electoral Commission informed of your whereabouts. Forms for that to happen are readily available throughout the community. As we on this side of the House are fond of saying, we are big believers in individual responsibility. The nature of our compulsory voting system in Australia is unique among Western democracies; nevertheless, it has resulted in some of the highest voter turnout statistics in the world, which can only be a good thing. In the US for example, voter turnout frequently struggles to creep over the the 50 per cent mark. At the last federal election in New Zealand, where the vote is not compulsory, turnout was about 73 per cent and, at the last British election, barely 65 per cent of voters turned out. In Australia, that figure is consistently over 90 per cent. One vote, one value-a new voter turning 18 carries exactly the same weight and the same value as the people the government scorns, such as the likes of Gina Rinehart or Clive Palmer. That is the great thing about our democracy. The Australian population is engaged in a political process. As such, the coalition believes it is reasonable to expect that each Australian should take responsibility for enrolling to vote, maintaining their enrolment details, casting a vote when an election is called and fully extending preferences to candidates contesting elections for the House of Representatives. Nevertheless, the Labor Party and their rainbow coalition partners, the Greens, are still furiously insisting that the above requirements are simply too difficult for Australians and therefore government intervention is required to ensure that people carry out their democratic obligations. Personally, I feel that this sort of condescending paternalism is unbecoming of the government of a politically literate and engaged country. As we often say, the coalition believes in individual responsibilities. We believe that the voter should be in charge of enrolling to vote and maintaining their own details. They do not need the government to do it on their behalf. Again, we believe in less government and, as testament to that, we are on the record as saying that when in government we will reduce the size of the Public Service. That is why every second bit of legislation the government brings to this place involves unnecessary meddling in people's lives. Why does every policy come bundled with a year's supply of cotton wool and a subheading which reads, 'We don't believe you can be trusted to do the right thing so we're going to do it for you'? As I mentioned a moment ago, one of the big concerns the coalition has with this legislation is that it will corrupt the integrity of the electoral roll because of electors being put on the roll without their knowledge. This in turn will lead to a number of potential irregularities in the electoral process. This bill gives the AEC the discretion to determine what sort of data sources are appropriate for determining an individual's eligibility to be on the roll. We believe this goes far beyond the purview of the AEC and that it should be up to the individual elector to supply details about their enrolment. Furthermore, there is reason to be extremely concerned about the reliability of the data sources used to determine eligibility to vote. As coalition members on the joint standing committee in their dissenting report noted: The reliance on external data sources that have been collated and that are utilised for other purposes does not make it fit for them to use in informing the electoral roll. As outlined in the previous report on these proposals, a 1999 report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration titled Numbers on the run: a review of the management of tax file numbers found that there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than there were people in Australia. How can that be? How can there be 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia? It also found that there were 185,000 potential duplicated tax records for individuals and that 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in sample matches. That is where this legislation potentially takes the roll. That is where this legislation will end up. I know it is not the intent of any like-minded government to jeopardise this document of integrity. Similarly, not too long ago an Australian National Audit Office report found that half-a-million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who were deceased. But, suddenly, it all makes sense. Suddenly we can see why Labor is so keen to implement this legislation. Those of us with long memories might recall that approximately 10 years ago, hot on the heels of the Shepherdson inquiry, the committee on electoral matters conducted an inquiry at which it was revealed that members of the Australian Labor Party, particularly in Queensland, had been systematically rorting the electoral roll for their own advantage. During its hearings, committee members heard not only of long-dead people miraculously coming back to life and casting a vote but also one bizarre incident of a cat voting. Is that what we have come to? This is the response from the Labor Party to the fact that those who are living are so unlikely to vote Labor; it looks for ways to start enrolling the dead. I remember being part of a football tour to Blackwater. I caught up with the local candidate a couple of weeks after a state election in Queensland. He made the point to me that he thought things were travelling all right on the ground, but he was absolutely devastated when he did not get over the line as a candidate. Later, when he made investigations, every single vacant block of land in that township had people linked to the electoral roll. Obviously, the electoral roll in that process was fictitious. All I can say is that if we are about to using government data to automatically enrol people, it would need to be an awful lot more reliable than the data that I have just mentioned. There is incredible evidence that automatic enrolment does not work anyway. Both New South Wales and Victoria recently introduced automatic enrolments ahead of their state elections. As the ABC's highly respected election analyst Antony Green noted in an article on 16 July 2011, only 64 per cent of those people automatically enrolled for the first time during the 2011 New South Wales election actually turned out to vote. Such a high non-participation rate suggests that information used to put new electors on the roll is unreliable and could result in electors being issued with a fine for not voting when they should not really have been on the roll in the first place. Again, I make the point that I have come into the House as part of a coalition team and collectively we have supported 70 per cent of the bills that have gone through this place. Of the bills that we have not supported, we have had real concerns about them. I join with my coalition partners in raising suitable concern about the integrity of this bill and the unintended consequences that will be a by-product of the legislation. There are so many potential issues with this legislation that it is hard to know when to stop. Suffice to say, the coalition will not be supporting this bill.",88
172,Ms ONEILL,TUSMA," I am delighted to rise to speak to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and cognate bill, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. The words 'protecting elector participation' are very good and appropriate words. Let me repeat them, to declare clearly the intention of these bills: protecting elector start participation. This is at the core of our democratic Australian society. It is also at the core of the legislation that this Labor government has been bringing before the House to enable as many people as possible to benefit from participation in our economy, in the same way that this legislation seeks to enable as many people as possible to benefit from participation in our democracy. Stories from places around the world where democracy is not quite as stable and developed as it is here in this country reveal to us that the desire of people to vote is such a powerful thing, such an important thing, that people actually give their lives for this opportunity. We could perhaps do a much better job, through civic education and citizenship education in our schools, to help young people, who we fund as citizens through our taxes, to more deeply understand their rights and responsibilities in participating in voting and setting the direction of the nation. I would like to put on the record again what this legislation actually does. It amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 to provide for direct enrolment and the reinstatement to the electoral roll of certain persons casting declaration votes. The bill will implement the government's legislative response to recommendations 1 and 24 of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report entitled The 2010 federal election: report on the conduct of the election and related matters. I commend the chair of that committee, the member for Banks, and his colleagues for the work of the committee-and also the member for Melbourne Ports-and for their continuing and passionate advocacy for this particular cause. They are certainly true believers in freedom and will always support Australians in their capacity to exercise their franchise. This bill deals with a number of elements. One of them is direct enrolment. The proposed bill will amend the electoral act to allow the Electoral Commissioner to use accurate and timely information received from a reliable source-not just anywhere; it is not a note from your mother-to enrol an eligible person without the person submitting a claim for enrolment. Direct enrolment will assist in meeting the urgent need to arrest the decline in enrolment rates across Australia by ensuring the federal electoral roll is as current and accurate as possible. Direct enrolment without having to submit a claimfor-enrolment form is particularly important for those Australians for whom schooling might not have been the most positive experience and whose literacy efforts might not have been 100 per cent successful. Because people might not be able to read, because they might not be able to write or because they might be limited in their capacity to participate in the form filling that is part of our modern society does not make them any less valuable as a citizen of this country and should not impinge on their capacity to participate in voting. The whole notion of agency and the capacity to participate is one that we take very seriously and it is important that we make it as easy as possible for any Australian who wishes to vote and exercise their rights and responsibilities in this democracy to participate. This bill also deals with the problem of reinstatement to the electoral roll. The amendments will provide that, where a declaration voter who is entitled to vote has been omitted from the electoral roll and the omission was due to an error or mistake of fact, then his or her votes may progress to further scrutiny in certain circumstances. This is very important to make sure that people who find that there is a problem very close to the date of a poll still have the capacity to participate and that their vote is part of setting the direction of this country. The bill will also amend the electoral act to provide that the Electoral Commissioner may enrol a person who meets certain criteria. Reinstatement to the electoral rolls and the admission of votes to scrutiny will assist in ensuring that the votes of otherwise eligible electors are counted. Sadly, as many of those who have spoken before me have indicated, there is a decline in enrolment rates across Australia, and I am sure members here would agree with me that we must ensure that as many votes as possible are counted at the next federal election. That is not controversial at all, but it is certainly the right thing to do. I know there are some on the other side of the chamber who represent rural and regional areas. This legislation will raise enrolment rates in rural and remote areas. The bill will amend the electoral act and the referendum act to allow the Electoral Commissioner to place a person on the electoral roll at a particular address if the Electoral Commissioner is satisfied that the person is entitled to enrolment, has lived at an address for at least one month and is not enrolled. As a result of this legislation, the commissioner will have the capacity to make sure that that enrolment goes ahead and that the vote is able to be counted. This process will take place following the receipt and analysis of reliable and current data from sources external to the Australian Electoral Commission that indicates that a person is an eligible Australian citizen and actually lives at the particular address. An electricity bill, for example, would provide a reliable source. The bill does not amend the qualifications for enrolment. It is very important that this goes on the record. The bill requires the Electoral Commissioner to inform a person that the Electoral Commissioner is proposing to place them on the electoral roll at that address and provide the person with 28 days in which to object to the proposed enrolment. The decision to enrol a person or not enrol a person is ultimately able to be reviewed. That would be undertaken by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The bill will also allow the admission to scrutiny, in specified circumstances, of the declaration votes made by people who had been enrolled but were removed from the roll due to an error. The bill will return the law to the pre-2006 position so that, if a person has been removed from the roll by objection action on the mistaken belief that they were not living at the enrolled address, this will constitute 'mistake of fact'. Sadly, there are no prizes for guessing which party was actually responsible for this attempted mass disenfranchisement of the Australian people between 2006 and 2007. Some of it was revealed in the language choice of the member for Wright who was just speaking before-the 'honour of voting' I swear I heard him say. I suppose you might think about it as an honour, but in fact it is a right and a responsibility. That is quite a different frame to put around what a vote is. As I and many others have noted in this place, the result of this incredibly disappointing period of our history was a period of gross disenfranchisement by the most mercenary government of this country; it happened under the Howard government. It saw more than 100,000 people miss out on the close of rolls at the deadline of the 2007 election.",90
173,Unknown,TUSMA,Opposition members interjecting,92
174,Ms ONEILL,TUSMA,"Members opposite might find that quite humorous. My response is that that is an absolute disgrace. If it were to happen in another country where we were looking to support free and fair elections, we would be reporting that as inappropriate behaviour. I find it hard to stand here in this legislative chamber",92
175,Mr Robert,TUSMA,Then sit down.,92
176,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TUSMA, Order!,92
177,Ms ONEILL,TUSMA,"and think that that piece of legislation was actually put forward. While I have the opportunity to stand here and speak for ordinary Australians who have the right to speak, I will certainly take every moment of that time, despite the discouragement of those opposite who tried to shut down voters then, just as they would like to shut down my speaking right now. Amongst those who missed out in 2007 a were more than 4,000 18 year-olds who would have been voting for the first time. I have actually met a few of these 18-yearolds. I have spent a lot of my time working with young adults, and I know that there are moments when there is an opportunity for engagement. As a teacher you see them and you know that there is a teachable moment in it. And one of the most important things that can happen for an Australian citizen is to engage in voting at the very first opportunity. Through that act, young adults participate fully and come to an understanding of the power of their vote, collectively with others, to set the course of this nation, to contribute in a real and tangible way to a democracy. There is the whole process of going to a polling booth, taking one or a number of indications of how you might cast your vote, going through the process of having your name marked off, looking at the pages and pages of names of citizens there beside yours, taking those appropriately signed papers and going into a booth to cast your ballot in private. Yet, having desired to have that experience, as was their right at age 18, that experience was rudely ripped away from these young people as they were about to enter into that contract with our nation. It is appalling that that actually and it indicates incredible cynicism and incredible negativity. It reveals the very significant difference between the Labor Party on this side of the House and the Liberal-Nationals on the other side, who still hold on to some notion, disconnected from our modern reality, that there are some people who should have rights, some people who should have a big voice, and that some people who have a lot of money can buy more place in our public debate than others. While those opposite support that, they oppose the participation of ordinary young Australians. Those opposite also seem to engage in putting up arguments about the integrity of the roll. But I think it is important to the record how dangerous that fearmongering is. When I looked back at some remarks I made last year in a previous contribution on an electoral legislative amendment, the facts showed that there were 71 proven cases of electoral fraud over a whole decade, which amounts to one in a million of the votes cast. Those opposite enacted a legislative amendment that saw the disenfranchising of half-a-million voters to catch 71 fraudulent voters over a period of 10 years. I would say that that is like cutting off your head to fix a broken fingernail. There is no sense of proportionality there whatsoever. But I will return to what the bill does. It provides the Electoral Commissioner with the discretion to enrol, in specified circumstances, those people casting declaration votes who had been enrolled but were removed from the roll due to an error by an officer or a mistake of fact. The bill will also stop the divergence and inconsistency that is occurring between state and Commonwealth electoral rolls in the largest jurisdictions of New South Wales and Victoria. That is a significant improvement happened that the bill will bring. Most importantly, the bill will enable the Australian Electoral Commission to deliver a more accurate electoral roll, because the Electoral Commissioner will be permitted to use accurate and timely information from reliable sources to maintain the current address of already enrolled electors. This bill will ensure that an elector will be notified of the Electoral Commissioner's intention to enrol him or her at a new residential address and be given the opportunity to object to the change. The bill will not provide the capacity to directly enrol new electors. People who are not on the roll will still need to enrol, in accordance with the current requirements of the Electoral Act. Perhaps that is the part put on where the Australian populace, and particularly those who lead in our communities-community leaders who are involved in politics at all levels of government, community leaders who are involved in schools, and community leaders who are involved in great institutions that help us stay alive, such as surf life saving clubs, and in Lions and Rotary clubs-can take part in actively supporting a citizenry to understand the full responsibility and capacity of engaging in casting a vote. I commend the important changes that are embedded in these bills to enhance our democracy, and I commend the bills to the House.",92
178,Mr RANDALL,TUSMA," I am very pleased to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the cognate bill, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. I am pleased to speak on these bills because I have always been very concerned about maintaining the integrity of the electoral roll. One of the great features of the Australian electoral system and our system generally is that we were able to maintain the integrity of our electoral roll to the best of our ability for many years without the technology that we have today, but we certainly knew where people lived, we knew who they were and we were able to track them when they moved. The dissenting report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the maintaining address bill said: … this legislation has been designed by Labor and the Greens solely for their own electoral advantage. It went on to say: The Coalition believes that the Bill will lead weakening of the integrity of the Electoral Roll, a significant decrease in privacy for individual electors and will remove virtually all responsibility for individual electors to take of their own enrolment. That is really at the nub of the bills. It has gone from the individual looking after their own status on the electoral roll to allowing the Australian Electoral Commission to take over that responsibility. Everything else between that goes to the discussion that we are about to have. There have been a whole lot of reasons given as to why you would shift the onus from the individual to the Australian Electoral Commission, but, at the end of the day, what was the matter with the individual getting themselves on the roll, maintaining themselves on the roll, notifying when they shifted and notifying when they were not on the roll? It really takes away the individual's responsibility in this area, and I think that is a quite disappointing aspect of what is happening with these bills. For many years there have been concerns about the agenda for watering down the integrity of the electoral roll. We also have integrity issues involving border protection-those who come here not through the proper channels but by boat. We think that maintaining the integrity of our borders is very important. The government changed those rules so that border protection has been watered down. With these bills, integrity is again being questioned. As a person in a marginal seat, I have always been very interested in the integrity of the roll. One of the things that has happened since I came to this place in 1996, and came back again, is that I did my best to assist the AEC in maintaining the integrity of the roll in terms of those people going on and those coming off. That is one of the reasons I sign every letter to new electors personally. Not one has been electronically generated. to a When somebody is getting on the electoral roll I think it is quite rude for a member of parliament to send an electronic signature on care a letter that says: 'Welcome to my electorate for the following reasons.' It is not only about that, but signing those letters allows me to find out a whole lot of interesting things: multiple people at addresses or an interesting drift towards new parts of my electorate, like Piara Waters. That is an interesting area, because people have to get themselves on the electoral roll. Part of what the bills are saying is that AEC will use a whole lot of government agencies to track people, such as the tax office or Centrelink. One of the ways to help them track who is new in an area is by the number of bins given out by the local government authority. I suppose that is one way of doing it, but it is not very scientific. In terms of electoral integrity, we know that the Labor Party has form in this area. Dare I refer the House to the book The frauding of votes? by Dr Amy MCGRATH, which is introduced by Bob Bottom who, as we know, was a very good crime fighter. There have been a whole lot of books written, such as this, about fraudulent electoral practices. You can look at some interesting anecdotes. The Labor Party have done it to themselves. Many years ago there was the great story about Paul Keating and Laurie Brereton heading off into the night with a box of electoral votes on the back of his motorbike to run them away so that they could not be counted, to skew their own electoral result. It is all in history. How the Labor Party like to manipulate their elections is folklore.",94
179,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TUSMA, Order!,95
180,Mr RANDALL,TUSMA,"Well, it is part of Australian folklore, as I said, Mr Deputy Speaker.",95
181,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TUSMA,Order! The honourable member will address the bills.,95
182,Mr RANDALL,TUSMA,And I am. I am just giving an illustration of how,95
183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TUSMA,The honourable member will resume his seat. The honourable member will address the bills and deal with the matters before the House. The honourable member for Canning.,95
184,Mr RANDALL,TUSMA,"Thank you, Mr Deputy the Speaker. It is a sensitive issue-we knowand I am dealing with it as sensitively as I can.",95
185,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TUSMA,The honourable member will address the bills and not reflect on the chair.,95
186,Mr RANDALL,TUSMA,"When I talk about the responsibility for individual electors, there is the incentive for eligible voters to update their address details when they move. For example, if they fail to address this in 21 days they can be fined $110. That is part of the rules. That is an incentive to do so. We believe that the bills are a mere ploy by the Australian Labor Party and the Greens to improve their own electoral chances at the expense of the integrity of the roll. This was in part of the dissenting report, which is part of the deliberations that have been taking place in this parliament. I give the example of the marginal seat of Canning. When I first won the seat of Canning in 2001, I won by about 526 votes. When there are 46 polling booths you do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that I could have lost if something like 12 people-15 people at the most-at each polling booth had either voted twice or manipulated their vote. We know that the electoral roll on the day is not electronically connected to all the polling booths. Somebody gets a pencil out and rules a line in a particular book. That is fine when they collate them all after election day and find out that somebody has voted early and often-you know, a Labor Party mantra: vote early and vote often. The fact is that when you actually line them up it is too late because the votes have been taken and collated. The scrutineers have no ability to do anything about this because there is no corroboration with the other 46 polling booths-as is the case in my electorate-to check whether somebody has voted more than once. Another issue-and I have done a fair bit of door-knocking in my time-is that people put themselves down at some very interesting addresses. I noted with interest when I was door-knocking over the years that around Falcon in my electorate there are a lot of empty beach houses, yet it was brought to my attention by some of the residents there that people were receiving electoral enrolment information at houses that had not been occupied for years. I am sure that the only body that would have the ability to control a whole lot of those sorts of votes would be something like a union that has a huge database and that can say, 'Look, you need to put yourselves down at that address because if you can get a couple of hundred people in that area that will help us with our votes.'",95
187,Mr Gray,TUSMA,Lots of union officials own houses at Falcon!,96
188,Mr RANDALL,TUSMA,"They not only have houses but they probably have a lot of good friends. They might be workers in some of the drive-in drive-out areas in and around my electorate. That is how you warehouse votes in areas like that to dilute the high conservative vote. That is my suspicion when neighbours say to me, 'No-one has been living here for years but they have been getting electoral enrolment information.' Further to that, when the AEC officers came into my office the other day-and I am sure the member for Brand will enjoy this-I handed them some letters from people who had written 'Return to sender. This is a vacant block,' on the envelope. People had been registered at that address for the purposes of enrolment.",96
189,Mr Gray,TUSMA,Report it to the commission.,96
190,Mr RANDALL,TUSMA,"I did. I handed them to the officers when they came to visit my office. That is the sort of thing that causes people to question the integrity of the electoral roll. The other area is caravan parks. There is a very transient population in caravan parks and it is difficult to track them and make sure that they stay on the roll in the area they have previously designated. It is the same with homes with tenancies and with fly-in fly-out workers. The member for Brand has the highest number of fly-in fly-out workers in a metropolitan electorate in Western Australia. I have the second highest number in my electorate. They are very mobile and very transient. Tracking them is very interesting. I note that the AEC is trying to do something about dealing with them at the airports. This has been a little bit difficult to deal with over the years. They are having to find new ways of either getting the people on the roll or, when they need to vote in the various state or federal elections, getting them to vote in time. As you know, those workers can have two or three weeks on and one week off. They might miss the opportunity to vote. I had people from mines ringing me and saying, 'I'm on a mine and I haven't voted. I don't know how I'm going to vote because I don't get back until after Saturday. Can you tell me what I can do. They do not have a polling booth at the mine.' It is all interesting stuff. What I am saying in relation to this bill is that giving the onus to the Australian Electoral Commissioner to make a judgment, based on a range of factors where he believes somebody should be entitled to vote, is drawing a very long bow and it is rather risky. For those who want to rort the system this is a precarious position a marginal seat. Over the years there has been plenty of evidence to that effect from inquiries that have delved into the rorting of these systems. We do not want to be a Zimbabwe or somewhere where you have to dip your finger into a bottle of indelible ink to check that you have not voted twice. We have been to those countries and we know that we are better than that. We need to ensure that the maintenance of the electoral roll stands up to scrutiny. We do not want to see the support diluted by taking away resources such as electoral officers from our electorates. Return mail is another example. We used to be able to send bulk return mail to the AEC for checking. You will recall that the member for Hinkler said in this place that, if he had not kept the return mail in one particular election some years ago and checked it against those wanting to do provisional votes, he would have lost his seat. He was able to provide that database to the scrutineers and to the Electoral Commission during the count and have those votes set aside until they were checked.",96
191,Mr Gray,TUSMA,You still can.,97
192,Mr RANDALL,TUSMA,"We are not able to return the return mail now, Member for Brand, because they do not accept it any longer.",97
193,Mr Gray,TUSMA,"Yes, they do.",97
194,Mr RANDALL,TUSMA,"My Electoral Commission office told me recently that they do not want any of my return mail because they are doing it themselves. In their endeavours to reduce spending, the Australian Electoral Commission are undertaking very few habitation surveys. That is a real worry. In new areas and new housing estates, like mine, they need to get out there and undertake habitation surveys in in areas of growth or areas where there is quite a transient population due to certain demographics. I ask, through this mechanism, that that be looked at further, because that is another way you can maintain the integrity of the electoral roll. We will not be supporting this bill because we do not think it does the right thing in terms of maintaining integrity. I would like to see it beefed up rather than watered down. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (19:29): 2012 is the Year of Enrolment. I find it absolutely breathtaking that the member for Canning chose, in his contribution to this debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and cognate Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012, to celebrate the Year of Enrolment by seriously proposing that we disenfranchise the poor people who live in caravan parks and the people who fly in and fly out for their work. That is what he is seriously proposing. He stood up just a moment ago and objected to the electoral and referendum amendment bills on the basis that they would provide a vote for people who reside in caravan parks or people whose occupations are as fly-in fly-out workers. What a way to celebrate the Year of Enrolment! 2012 marks two significant federal electoral events: the centenary of compulsory enrolment and the 50th anniversary of the Indigenous right to vote. Since the scheme of compulsory enrolment commenced in 1912 it has served this country very well. It marks one of the differences between the political system of this country and that of our friend and ally the United States of America, which does not have a system of compulsory enrolment and compulsory voting. Since 18 June 1962 all Aboriginal people have been entitled to enrol and to vote at federal elections and referenda. From that date, Aboriginal people were able to take up the franchise alongside eligible British subjects, aged 21 years or more. In 1973, as we know, the voting age dropped from 21 to 18 years of age. In 2001 an Australian National Audit Office investigation found that the electoral roll was around 95 per cent complete. That is not good enough-but it is not a bad result when you compare it with international standings. I regret that since 2001 the situation with regard to electoral enrolment has deteriorated-so much so that the Australian Electoral Commission now estimates that only 90 per cent of eligible Australian citizens are enrolled to vote. That means that around 1½ million Australian citizens do not exercise their electoral franchise to choose their representatives in parliament and in others. It also means that 1½ million Australians do not have a say in referenda proposals to amend Australia's Constitution. This situation calls for action. I commend the actions of the Special Minister of State, the member for Brand-who is in the chamber at the moment-for taking that action and bringing these bills before the House. We must do what we can to ensure that those missing 1½ million Australians are included on the electoral roll and are able to exercise one of the most important rights and responsibilities of their citizenship: the to vote. As part of its celebration of the Year of Enrolment, the Australian Commission is conducting a campaign to enrol those 1.5 million eligible Australians who are not on the Commonwealth roll, which is good news. It is a worthy endeavour, and I wish them well in reaching their target. Australia has a proud history of ensuring access to the franchise for federal, state and local government elections. That is why, together with the Year of Enrolment campaign by the AEC, the legislation before the House today is so very important. As members of parliament we share the aims of the enrolment project-or at least we on this side of the House do. We each have our part to play. As members of parliament we each work daily to engage with our constituents to help them engage with the work that we do in this place in their name. It is in Australia's national interest that in each electorate we have an active constituency that engages in the democratic process and that can make an informed decision at election time, in its best interests. It is important that we ensure that electoral legislation does not create unreasonable barriers for those who qualify for enrolment and voting and who, rightfully, expect to be able to exercise their franchise at elections and referenda. Unfortunately, between elections some constituents can drop off the electoral roll. Between elections the AEC works hard to maintain the integrity of the electoral roll and to ensure that those who are eligible to vote are correctly enrolled. The AEC utilises a number of strategies-strategies the member for Canning was just complaining about-aimed at providing electors and potential electors with opportunities to enrol or update electoral enrolment details. For example, right enrolment forms are widely available from AEC offices and the AEC website and from the Post Office, Centrelink offices and the like. The AEC also uses approaches to Electoral facilitate the updating of the electoral roll, including visits to residences, mail-outs to residences, mail reviews-in which the AEC writes to residents and to addresses seeking updated electoral roll informationadvertising designed to raise awareness of the need to update enrolment details, and attendance and provision of information at citizenship ceremonies. I pause to make the observation that the member for Canning said that this is critical work, although at times he criticised some of the work done. I would submit that this critical work is going to be made all the more difficult if those on the other side of the House have their way. We know their plan at present is to slash 12,000 Public Service jobs-to push 12,000 public servants from their jobs-and we can only anticipate that a good number of those public servants would be from the Australian Electoral Commission. We also know that 12,000 public servants is only the tip of the iceberg. If those opposite are to fill their $70 billion black hole it will take a lot more than 12,000 public servants. Agencies like the Australian Electoral Commission will be in the firing line. Jobs in the Australian Electoral Commission will be at risk, and the capacity to fulfil those important approaches to ensuring and maintaining the integrity of the electoral roll will be at risk. The AEC will not be able to do the things it has routinely been able to do to maintain the integrity of the Commonwealth electoral roll. So what is this legislation? What is Labor's approach to dealing with these issues? We have two bills before the House. The first bill, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2012, amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. This bill, in line with other legislation brought before this place by the Special Minister of State, implements the recommendations made by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and its report into the 2007 federal election. In examining the electoral issues arising from this election and in its report, this committee has done important work for our electoral franchise. The main focus of the committee's work was to look at whether changes made to enrolment and voting provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act by the previous Howard government had the effect of enabling or restricting the franchise and, if the changes were found to be restrictive, whether those restrictions were in any way offset by the achievement of greater electoral integrity in the lead-up to and at the 2007 election. That is to say, in shorthand, were the changes that were brought into place by the previous Howard government restrictive? Did they deny people their right to exercise their vote in a Commonwealth election? As we know, preceding the 2007 election were a number of legislative changes that significantly altered the processes for applying to be on the electoral roll, updating enrolment details and voting. At the 2007 election, election enrolment saw an increase of just 1,466 electors over the close-of-roll enrolment figures. History has told that some of these changes have subsequently been chucked out by the High Court of Australia and the legislation was returned to its preamendment condition. But this legislation furthers the work. The bills before the House further the job that needs to be done to ensure people are not denied their right to vote. The joint standing committee report found this to be an extremely low increase compared to the high of 97,425 electors added to the roll in 1998 and the previous low of 35,671 electors added in 1993. I will not use the word 'rort' but you can see that the changes put in place by the former Howard government had the effect, in the 2007 election, of denying somewhere between 34,000 and 95,000 Australians their right to vote. On that basis alone these bills should enjoy the support of every member of this House. The committee report found the significant decline from 2004 to 2007 to be the product of the legislative changes that were made between 2004 and 2007, when those on the other side had control of the House. The bill before the House can be seen in one sense as remedial legislation, restoring to those affected Australians the right to at the next election. The second measure, the maintaining addresses bill, will allow the Australian Electoral Commissioner to directly update an elector's enrolled address following receipt and analysis of reliable and current data sources from outside the AEC that indicate an elector has moved residential address. The bill will implement the intent of the government response to recommendation 10 of the report from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, the JSCEM report, on the conduct of the 2007 election. The bill will assist in meeting the urgent need to arrest the decline in enrolment rates across Australia by ensuring that the federal electoral roll is as current and accurate as possible. The second bill, the protecting elector participation bill, will amend Commonwealth Electoral Act to provide for direct enrolment and reinstatement to the electoral roll of certain persons casting declaration votes. This protecting elector participation bill implements government's legislative response to recommendations 1 and 24 of the JSCEM report on the 2010 federal election. The proposed bill will amend the Electoral Act to allow the Electoral Commissioner to use accurate and timely information, received from reliable sources, to enrol an eligible person without the person submitting a claim for enrolment. Direct enrolment will assist in meeting the urgent need to arrest the decline in enrolment rates across Australia. It is a measure that is in place in many state jurisdictions of Australia and works very well. The amendments will provide that, where a declaration voter who is entitled to vote has been omitted from the electoral roll, and the omission was due to an error or mistake of fact, his or her vote may progress to further vote scrutiny in certain circumstances. The bill will also amend the Electoral Act to provide that the Electoral Commissioner may enrol a person who meets certain criteria. Reinstatement to the electoral roll and the admission of votes to scrutiny will assist in ensuring that the votes of otherwise eligible electors are counted. Amendments in both these bills are needed as soon as practicable to ensure that the measures are implemented to deliver an accurate electoral roll before the next federal election. Australia has a tradition of inclusive entitlement to the voting franchise; it is what distinguishes us from many other countries around the world. It is why we have a healthy and robust democracy. It is something that all Australians should be very proud of. This inclusive franchise has been a feature of federal elections throughout our the history as a nation. The bill before the House today strengthens that franchise. For these reasons and all the reasons adumbrated by those on this side of the House, I commend the legislation. the Mr RAMSEY (Grey) (19:43): I rise to address the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. I oppose both bills. They are designed to tilt the electoral system in Australia in the Labor-Greens direction. Why is that? It is because they enrol the uninformed. We know the best chance Labor has of scaring up votes is by appealing to the uninformed, because if they knew what a Labor Party government was like they would never vote for them. The member for Throsby, who has just left the chamber, justifies these bills by quoting the findings the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. This was, of course, a Labor-Greens based committee. Both bills devalue the integrity of the electoral roll. Australia has generally enjoyed a reasonably clean electoral system. It is the norm. I often say that the reason it is relatively clean in Australia is that we just expect this to be the natural course of events. We are not naturally cheaters-but you do not need many. Not everyone is as pure as the driven snow, which is why we should have robust systems. I am particularly concerned about these bills' ability to identify identity integrity. I am wary of the electronic world when it comes to security. Just type the word 'hacking' into a search engine on your computer and you will bring up hundreds of examples of individuals having hacked into computers such as NASA's and the US Senate's, not to mention the actions of WikiLeaks. We are advised by our banking institutions that we should change our passwords every three months at least. These bills represent great opportunities for those wishing to corrupt the system, promote mayhem and undermine the system by suggesting electronically that people live in places that they do not. It is a very dangerous area, because these bills will place people on the electoral roll without their knowledge. Individual electors will be put directly onto the electoral roll without ever filling out an electoral form. The bills empower the Australian Electoral Commission to update the rolls from 'reliable and current data'. It does not say what the objective measurement for reliable and current data will be. It is a case of beauty being in the eye of the beholder. If the AEC decide on a particular day that a certain list looks good to them that is what of they can use. It raises many questions, including questions about where people live, because people do not actually have to respond to their compulsory enrolment. What about people who have two addresses-a primary address and a secondary address? They may well elect to receive their electricity, phone, gas and rates notices directly at the secondary addressthe address they do not live at. It is quite conceivable that some reliable and current database may well pick this up as their place of residence and the AEC will send them a letter welcoming them into the new electorate. What if people are overseas for an extended period and have a mail forwarding address-maybe their relatives' address-in a different electorate? Would a reliable and current database be the tax files database? I am indebted to the member for Mackellar, who raised in the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters the fact that in 1999 there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people. I hope they do not use the database that sees mail still being sent to my father, who died three years ago-it comes pretty regularly. Would that be a reliable and current database? The Australian National Audit Office found that up to half-a-million Medicare enrolments were probably for people who are dead. I would think that, at this stage, the electoral roll itself is the database in Australia with the most integrity. even Anything we choose other than that will be of lesser value. Under the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill, the Australian Electoral Commission will write to you at your new address. If you do not answer you will be enrolled at that address. That seems illogical. Surely, once they write to you, you should have to respond and say: 'Yes, it's me. I'm here. I'm hearing what you say. I've been put on the electoral roll.' But, no; if you do not answer, you will be enrolled. The second bill is innocuously subtitled 'Protecting Elector Participation'. It should be called 'Undermining Electoral Integrity'. There is no way in the world that this protects elector participation; it mandates automatic enrolment. In New South Wales, where there is already automatic enrolment, Antony Green of the ABC raised the fact that, of those automatically enrolled for the first time for the 2011 New South Wales election, only 63.4 per cent voted. Did the other 37 per cent even know they were on the roll? Did they have any idea at all? This probably came as a complete surprise to them. If that 37 per cent did not know they were on the electoral roll, there is a possibility for someone else to exercise their right to vote. Remember, you do not know that you are on the roll. Imagine, for instance, that your electricity supplier sent you a bill at the end of the month but you did not respond to it. Would they then consider it settled? Would they say: 'You didn't respond to the bill? Don't worry about that mate. We'll fix it up for you. Just forget about it'? In fact, the way electricity prices are rising, might be a good thing for the government to institute! It is preposterous that we would automatically enrol someone without their knowledge and leave them on the roll, possibly still without their knowledge, for other people to move into that space. How long will it be before someone inevitably leaks the list of those who have been enrolled but have not responded? An electronic list of that style would be of great value to people who wish to distort the system. Someone who does not know they are on the roll is obviously the person to vote in place of, particularly because when we roll up at a polling booth on election day we are not asked to prove our identityalthough that would be a true reform of the electoral system. That kind of electronic list, of people who have been enrolled against their will or without their knowledge and who have never responded, would be a green light to those who choose to cheat the system. The passage of these bills will mean the immediate death of the traditional enrolment method. I heard just before I rose to my feet the member for Throsby going through the many things the Electoral Commission does now to educate voters, to encourage voters to enrol and to engage with them. What would be the point of any of those things if they were going to be automatically enrolled? Why would schools, for instance, spend any of their time trying to educate children about their future responsibilities? I know this happens now within my own electorate. Schools will, in fact, help the kids fill out their electoral forms and give them a lesson about the Australian political system. There will be a distinct disincentive for them to waste their time on these matters, so the very small amount of engagement that we have with young people now, in trying to bring it them up to speed and engage them with the system, is likely to be obliterated virtually overnight. Why would the Electoral Commission encourage anybody to enrol to vote in the traditional manner if in fact it is all going to be done electronically, without their knowledge and superquick overnight? These bills are a terrible move. They will open up the opportunity to bring Australia's electoral system into disrepute. I understand why the government are putting the bills forward. It is because they think that this is going to be a free kick for them. That is the worse reason to bring these bills into the House, and I oppose them.  to speak in strong support of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. Here in Australia we enjoy a healthy democracy. It has endured, stable and strong, since Federation without civil war or major crisisRemembrance Day 1975 aside. In fact, Australia is one of the longest standing democracies in the world. When Australian citizens head to the polls, as Queenslanders will do this weekend, they do so without fear, and governments are elected peacefully without a shot being fired. There may be a few tears, but it is a peaceful process. To paraphrase Malcolm X, in Australia it is always the ballot, not the bullet. Australia's democracy is free from the allegations of fraud and intimidation that mar elections in developing democracies. The integrity of our election process is crucial for our democracy. That is why I was so disgusted with the former Liberal National coalition government's efforts to manipulate our electoral process. The 41st Parliament oversaw a shameful moment in the history of our democracy. By closing the electoral roll to new enrolments on the same day as the issuing of the writ, former Prime Minister Howard ensured that thousands of pesky young people did not get an opportunity to vote in the 2007 election. It is the Australian Electoral Commission that is responsible for running elections in this country. Part of that job involves maintaining the current electoral roll. Today there are more than 14 million Australians on the Commonwealth electoral roll. As we well know, the electoral act states that enrolling and voting are compulsory for every Australian citizen over 18 years of age. Compulsory electoral enrolment and compulsory voting makes our democracy strong. Anyone thinking we should adopt optional voting need only to look at voter turnout in so-called democracies-for example, the United States. In fact, in the 2000 election that saw George W. Bush become president there was a 51 per cent voter turnout. You might remember that George W. Bush only just scraped in. It was a very closely fought election. Barely over a quarter of eligible Americans voted for the President of the United States. Optional voting is not the way to go. In Australia, we want everyone to have a saythe motivated, the not-so-motivated, the disillusioned and everyone in between. If they do not want to have a say, I can give them a long list of countries to move to where they will not have to worry about their voice being heard on election day. The AEC are required to ensure that every elector knows about our electoral laws and adheres to these laws. Electors are required to, firstly, enrol and, secondly, keep their enrolment details current. But, as we know, whether you are moving across town, across a suburb or changing states, moving house can be a very stressful experience. After dealing with real estate agents, lawyers, banks and removal companies, redirecting mail and possibly starting a new job, with a new school for the kids, and changing the phone, electricity and utilities et cetera, often the last thing on many Australians' minds after they have moved house is notifying the Electoral Commission about their change of address. Currently, the AEC are able to use information from reliable sources to monitor the accuracy of the roll, but they do not have the power to change or update an elector's details. They are, however, able to remove someone from the roll. The result of this anomaly is that eligible voters are being removed from the roll, resulting in dropping enrolments across the country. We need to be doing whatever we can to ensure that there is greater participation in our wonderful democracy. That is why the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 amends the Electoral and Referendum Act to allow the AEC to update an elector's enrolled address when it becomes apparent from other reliable data that the elector has moved residential addresses. The bill requires that an elector notified about the AEC's intention to enrol them at a new residential address. They will also be given an opportunity to object to the change. This common-sense bill will ensure that there is a more accurate roll, using information that is already available to the AEC. It will not, however, enable the AEC to enrol people not already on the electoral roll, which is the subject of the related bill before the House. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Participation) Bill 2012 is another measure on the part of the Gillard government to improve the accuracy of the electoral roll. The AEC go to a lot of effort to encourage young people to enrol to vote. For example, before the 2010 election they were part of a youth enrolment program called 'Count me in!' with the United Nations Youth Association and the Australian Youth Forum. They hit the streets to enrol as many young people as possible over one weekend. The AEC also run many other campaigns, including 'enrol to vote' week in schools, aimed at making sure all young people are ready to vote when they turn 18; university campus O week activities, to encourage university students to enrol to vote; and youth enrolment campaign Rock Enrol with Triple J, which I know is your favourite radio station, Deputy Speaker! Despite these efforts, there are still too many young people who miss out on voting because they are unable to enrol before the rolls close before an election. I understand that there are still at least 1.5 million eligible voters not on the rolls, and at least a third of these are aged between 18 and 25. That is about another 15 or 16 MPs who are not here in this chamber. This bill will allow the AEC to place a person on the electoral roll at a particular address if the Electoral Commissioner is satisfied that: (1) the person be is entitled to be enrolled-that is, they are an Australian citizen over 18 years old; (2) they have lived at the address at least one month; and (3) they are not currently enrolled. For the first time people will be enrolled without submitting an enrolment form. Direct enrolment will directly turn around declining enrolment rates across Australia and make the federal electoral roll as current and as a accurate as possible. New South Wales and Victoria already have a system of direct enrolment and therefore we are seeing Elector a growing inconsistency between the state and federal rolls, something which cannot continue. This bill will bring greater consistency between these state and federal electoral rolls. I can understand why in years gone by there was a reluctance to embrace direct enrolment. In the days of paper records, pencils and horses and carriages, ensuring the integrity of records might have been a bit more difficult. But today a number of government departments operate accurate databases that the Electoral Commission uses to verify the integrity of the rolls. We are not talking about information that falls off the back of a truck. This is reliable information that is currently obtained from road traffic authorities, Centrelink, Australia Post and other such respectable institutions. It was not that long ago that women were not allowed to vote. Even a little closer to my time, it was Indigenous Australians. When I was born, Murrays in Queensland could not participate in the electoral process-and I am not that old, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know. The idea that anyone could be excluded from the electoral process is downright repulsive to every decentminded Australia. As a parliament, we should do whatever is necessary to ensure the integrity of our electoral process. Certainly, the Gillard Labor government believes that all eligible people should be given the opportunity to vote, but the opposition, in voicing their opposition to bill, have strayed dangerously close to the land of the hypocrite on this issue. You cannot on the one hand say that you stand for transparent and free elections and on the other hand put in place roadblocks that stop eligible people from participating in the electoral process. What is there to be scared of? This Labor government wants to ensure that all Australians who are eligible to vote are on the roll and able to do so. The integrity of our strong democracy requires no less. The quick passing of this bill will ensure that these reforms are in place before a 2013 federal election, and I hope still for bipartisan support from those opposite. I strongly commend the bill to the House.",97
195,Mr MATHESON,TUSMA," The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012 seek to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 seeks to allow the Electoral Commission to directly update an elector's enrolled address following the receipt of analysis of reliable and current data sources from outside the Australian Electoral Commission that indicate an elector has moved residential address. What this bill fails to do is set controls on what is a reliable current data source outside of the Australian Electoral Commission. This bill hands over the burden of responsibility for updating a person's electoral address from the voter to the Electoral Commissioner, with no controls, no checks and balances and no parameters as to where the Electoral Commissioner can source the information. To me that is very, very disturbing. This bill will bypass many of this government's own this fundamental privacy principles and add yet another element of Big Brother to this government's already overregulating and overreaching scope of authority. The second bill that this government has put forward, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012, is yet another attempt by this government to take our nation down the very, very slippery slope of automatic enrolment. Automatic enrolment has been the brainchild of the Greens for over a decade. The travesty of this bill is that it represents a key component of their Orwellian nightmare for this nation and our prestigious democratic record. Australia has long been a shining example of democracy to the world. While we may only be a young country, we have been fortunate that until recently we had a good national leadership, a booming economy and a healthy democratic system of government. Indeed, we were envied across the globe. But these two bills represent a paradigm shift in the way our system of democracy operates at its most fundamental level. In this great nation voting is a right, but it is also an obligation enforced by the law. The right to have your voice heard and the right to have your vote counted is a sacred thing. It should not be taken lightly and it should not be handed out frivolously. People in nations less fortunate than ours have died trying to exercise this right. Voting in our nation comes with rights, obligations, responsibilities and duties. These obligations are not onerous. They do not require a citizen to jump through legislative hoops. A person need only fill in a form and provide identification in order to enrol to vote. Once enrolled, an elector can update their details by fax, mail or in person. In fact, an elector can even update their details online; it is not too hard to do. If a person can jump on the internet and update their drivers licence online, why can't we trust them to do the same thing through the AEC? The Special Minister of State in his second reading speech for the maintaining address bill asserted: The bill will assist in meeting the urgent need to arrest the decline in enrolment rates across Australia by ensuring the federal electoral roll as current and accurate as possible. However, in spite of the minister believing this to be an urgent need, he did not make a single mention in either the speech or the explanatory memorandum of any evidence of the scale of these inaccuracies. I submit that in Australia we have a far more urgent need to crack down on multiple voting and voter fraud than to directly update voters' addresses without the voters' knowledge or consent. You have only got to look at the last federal election-I am standing here next to the federal member for Hume-to know what the Labor Party's policy is: it is vote early and vote often. If that was not enough of an assault on the integrity of the roll, now they want to add electors to the electoral roll without their knowledge or their consent. These two bills create the possibility of a person being enrolled without their knowledge at an address where they may or may not reside. There are a couple of examples in my electorate, with the urban renewal programs in our public housing areas, the One Minto Project or the Airds renewal program or Rosemeadow and Claymore. People are put into temporary accommodation in hotels and motels out of their electorate. The member for Grey mentioned people being informed voters. These people have lived most of their lives in my electorate. If they are moved out of the electorate for temporary accommodation and live outside the electorate for one month, they might find themselves on a roll in a different electorate, when they do not want to even participate in the election of that candidate. These informed people want to vote for the person they know who is doing the right thing by their community, and, all of a sudden, because we are going through this urban renewal process and they have been shifted out of their area, they will be put on a roll without their knowledge and is asked to vote for somebody else. Some great thought must have gone into this legislation! Who is the Einstein who came up with this one? What about people with domestic violence issues? You might have a couple who have a domestic violence issue and one takes out an AVO, with part of the condition of the AVO being that the other person must live in another electorate. They might have to live there for four, five, six, nine, 12 or 18 months or longer to resolve their dispute with their spouse, and all of a sudden they will find themselves on an electoral roll somewhere else. Once again, it is a case of an informed voter being taken out of their electorate through secondary advice given to the Australian Electoral Commission, who will put them on another roll without their knowledge. Absolutely incredible-how good is this legislation! There are people on the other side of the House saying, 'We're proud of this legislation'! Not enough thought has gone into this legislation. There are going to be other circumstances where people will be out of their area temporarily, put on a different electoral roll without their knowledge and asked to vote for someone they do not even know, because they have lived most of their life in another electorate. I am talking about informed voters who know their candidates and want to make a decision that will change things in their electorate, but they will be asked to vote in another electorate where they do not know what is going on. Mr Schultz interjecting",105
196,Mr MATHESON,TUSMA,"Absolutely. Anything to hold their seats. You are right, member for Hume. They then could be sent a fine for not voting, which they may not receive and, as a result, they could have their drivers licence cancelled, because this government wants to allow the Electoral Commissioner free rule over additions and amendments to the electoral roll, with no restrictions and no requirements for identifying or regulating information sources. I just keep looking back. How good is this legislation! There has been a lot of thought put into this! I hope those of us in this chamber today respect and uphold the values of democracy when voting on this bill. Put some thought into it, guys! We must stop this insidious campaign launched by the faceless men of the ALP, who are attempting to compromise the integrity of the electoral roll for their own selfish purposes. Just last month we saw the damage that the same faceless men in the Australian Labor Party have done not only to the parliamentary wing of the ALP but to what is left of the grassroots movements of their party. These bills represent the same phenomenon in our nation. They give the AEC the power and authority to add electors to the roll without their knowledge or consent. These bills allow the Electoral Commission to access private information and records from secondary sources to update the residential addresses of electors. This is not and should not be the function of the AEC. Not only will people have their addresses updated without their knowledge, but it may result in electors being incorrectly enrolled or even removed from the electoral roll entirely, denying them the chance to vote in an election. There will be many circumstances like this brought forward, I can tell you, by disgruntled voters who cannot vote for the candidate that they love. This will be further exacerbated by the government's second bill, which will use information and data from unspecified secondary sources to determine if a person has been living at that address for at least a month and is eligible to be on the roll. A month is not a long time. It is an incredibly short period of time. This legislation is very, very poor. Antony Green exposed the fundamental flaw of automatic enrolment in his July 2011 article analysing the dismal failure of automatic enrolment in the most recent New that South Wales state election. We all know about Antony Green, don't we? He is a great expert, on top of his game. While the New South Wales Labor Party had hoped that the automatic enrolments would be their saving grace at the ballot box, only 64.3 per cent of the electors that were automatically enrolled actually turned up to vote-64.3 per cent! This incredibly high non-participation rate demonstrates the point that a massive number of those people automatically enrolled to vote were completely disenfranchised by the electoral system or, alternatively, those people were not actually entitled to vote in the first place or were not living at the address where they had been automatically enrolled. So there are systematic failures already. The notion of directly updating a person's details on the electoral roll or enrolling them to vote without their knowledge or consent will lead to a high number of potential irregularities. Further to this point, the bill lacking in consistency and detail. It gives the AEC complete discretion to determine what it believes are reliable and current data sources to obtain information about elector addresses. This goes far beyond the scope of authority traditionally bestowed upon the AEC. Imagine some of the information they might get from the courts or the local police about people who have been locked up and charged and part of their bail conditions is that they have got to go and live in another electorate-away from their local member, all their family and their house. This is incredible legislation! It's brilliant! While on this point, I refer to the submission by the Australian Privacy Foundation to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in February 2012. The Australian Privacy Foundation makes two very valid arguments relating to the collection and use of secondary sources of information. The first argument is that this bill seeks to undermine the fundamental privacy principle that personal information collected by a government body or agency should only be used for the purpose for which it was collected. If the government body or agency intends to use this information for a secondary purpose, then consent of the person from whom it was collected should be given. They have got to legally give consent. I tell you, this legislation is fantastic! Of course, there will be exceptions for special circumstances where the public interest outweighs individual privacy. Does the public interest outweigh individual privacy? I do not think so. The minister's supposedly urgent need to arrest the decline in enrolment rates across Australia does not weigh up against any public interest test. I have got to meet the person who put this legislation together. It is absolutely brilliant! Perhaps he is trying to weigh it up against his own party's selfis interest! That might be the key to it all-his own party's self-interest. Second, and equally important, is the reality that data and information collected by any government agency is collected for a specific purpose and in a very different context to the Australian electoral roll. The coalition members on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters noted in July 2011 in their dissenting report: The reliance on external data sources that have been collated and that are utilised for other purposes does not make them fit for use in forming the electoral roll. It had to be the coalition-a bit of thought has gone into it. Of course, it is a dissenting report. To demonstrate this point, we need to look no further than our own government agencies' records. Let us look at a bit of history here. Let us look at the data. Let us have a think about it. It is one month. Do not rush into things. Have a chat about it. Talk it through. You will get a bipartisan approach on good policy in this chamber. For instance, the Australian National Audit Office Audit Report No. 24 2004-05: Integrity of Medicare enrolment data stated: ANAO found that up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who are deceased. Further to that point, the Review of the ANAO Report No. 37 1989-99 on the Management of Tax File Numbers, found that at the time of the last census-namely, 1996-there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia. Who is going to get that data? Is it going to be the Labor Party, with the old vote early, vote often policy? Are they going to know who all these deceased people are or who has all these tax file numbers? Are they going to run around and vote at so many booths it is not going to be funny? We know who is putting this legislation together. It is a beauty. It is vote early, vote often and try to vote Labor if you can. The data included 185,000 potential duplicate tax file numbers of individuals, and a sample match showed that 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased. Who picks up on that? We know who picks up on that. The AEC's reliance on secondary data sources, as stipulated by this bill, is very concerning. However, what is of even greater concern to me is that this bill gives the Australian Electoral Commissioner the discretion to determine what reliable and current data sources he should use to derive information regarding elector addresses and voter eligibility. That is a huge responsibility. It is unbelievable. There has been no real train of thought behind any of this. It has been rushed through at a hundred miles an hour: 'Let's get as many votes as we can while the opportunity exists. The crossbenchers will probably support it so let's get this legislation right through because it helps us.' As a former police officer for over 25 years, I have a keen understanding of the challenges posed by relying on secondary sources of information to make an informed and accurate assessment. A lot of people go out of their way to supply secondary sources of information that are not correct. They do not want to be found. They will be on a couple of electoral rolls; it is absolutely brilliant! My point is that secondary sources, any secondary source, are of variable quality. Even secondary sources that one would think would be up-to-date and accurate, such as Medicare, Centrelink or the department of immigration, collect their information for different purposes and in widely different contexts than that of maintaining an electoral roll. That is the crux of the matter. A document as important to our democratic process as the electoral roll should only ever be updated, amended or added to based on primary information, not secondary information. You actually have to know where they really do live. This is astonishing. Secondary information to create an electoral roll. This is great stuff! You should be proud of it! It should be primary information collected for the sole purpose of updating or amending the roll itself. Anything less constitutes a profound lack of respect for democracy in this great nation. We have heard a range of arguments from the other side of the House about how voters find it too difficult to update their addresses on the electoral roll. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you this: regardless of whether the government thinks that people are too lazy to update their own address or apply to be included on the electoral roll, why do they believe that the government should take this responsibility themselves? In Australia, our traditional personal responsibility has resulted in a nation of concerned, sympathetic and proactive citizens. Australia's democratic system is unique in the world and, simply put, we should not be messing with it if it is not broken-and it is not broken. Democracy is alive and well in this nation, much to the chagrin of the faceless men of the ALP. Voters have been updating their electoral addresses and applying to be placed onto the electoral roll for decades past, and they will do so for decades to come. We as a parliament must stop this insidious encroachment of the Big Brother style of government that is so beloved by this Prime Minister and this government. (Time expired)",107
197,Ms HALL,TUSMA," To say that that was an interesting contribution to this debate is an understatement. That part of it that I could actually understand was an interesting contribution to the debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and cognate bill. I was very surprised to hear that the member for Macarthur had been a police officer in a previous life. When he is talking of domestic violence and the placing of people in different electorates, surely he knows that somebody who is a victim of domestic violence would probably suppress their address and that it would not be available to other people. He was all over the place, and I am really pleased to hear that, for once, members on the other side of this parliament are interested in letting people in public housing have a vote. Under the Howard government, absolutely everything that could be done was done to prevent people who were in public housing, who were homeless or who moved around from having a vote. Absolutely every possible action was taken, and here we have the member for Macarthur being the great advocate for democracy! I suspect that he actually does not know how to spell the word. Here he is, being the great advocate for democracy, arguing in favour of making sure that people know who they are voting for, that maybe they had been living somewhere else for 12 months but they still want to vote for their original member. It is not on. This legislation is not something that has been rushed through the parliament. It has been examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and is implementing recommendations of the joint standing committee. There were public hearings on the recommendations by the joint standing committee, and those recommendations were drawn up after considerable thought, consultation and discussion. This government does not ignore the recommendations of parliamentary committees. If I remember correctly, when I was on the committee on health and ageing and the Howard government was in power, we brought down the Blame Game report, but they did not respond to it. Unlike the Howard government, we actually picked it up and ran with it as policy because we could see that it was a good report. So this government looks at the recommendations of standing committees. We looked at the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and we decided that we should implement the recommendations. On this side of the House we believe in giving everybody the opportunity to vote and on that side of the House they believe in giving their friends the right to vote. They believe in making it as difficult as possible for the people who are the most disadvantaged to have the right to vote. This legislation lines up the Commonwealth and the states so that their legislation is similar. It removes confusion and it gives people the maximum opportunity to vote. In Canada, if a person turns up to vote on election day and they are not on the roll they are allowed to vote; they do not have to enrol. In Canada, they believe in doing everything they possibly can to ensure that a person can cast a vote. Those on the other side of this parliament believe in doing everything in their power to stop people from having the right to vote. I see the member for Mitchell trying to google the Canadian system. Believe me, he should have a talk to the ambassador. The ambassador was the person who shared that information with me when he visited me in my office. He was talking about elections and he was quite mystified by the fact that it is so difficult for people to be enabled to vote in Australia. Before the last election I had constituents coming into my office who had moved into my electorate and wanted to cast a vote. They had been taken off the roll of the electorate in which they lived previously and had sought to be enrolled within the Shortland electorate. When it came time to cast their vote, they found out that they could not vote. It is beholden upon us as a parliament to maximise the number of people who are able to vote. It is beholden upon us as members of parliament to do everything in our power to increase people's ability to vote and to broaden the democratic process. It should not be about placing barriers to voting before people; it should be about ensuring that every person has the ability to have a say. The member for Macarthur talked about 'vote early, vote often'. It seems that he has written the handbook on it, doesn't it, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson? He seems to be quite across the process of how to distort the electoral system. It seems to me that he is following the doctrine of the Howard government, which was all about distorting the electoral system and creating a system that advantaged them electorally, whereas we on this side of the parliament are about ensuring that every person has the right to vote. This bill will really assist in meeting the urgent need to assist people to get onto the roll. It is quite difficult, and people become quite confused about how to update their enrolment. Constituents in my electorate find the process very difficult. Particularly if are a little older, they find it quite hard to navigate the system. Members on the other side of this parliament should stop their woolly arguments, and their pretence that they actually support democracy and support encouraging people to enrol to vote, and be upfront with the Australian people. That is what I am asking those on the other side to do: be honest and tell them that you want people to enrol to vote only if they are going to vote for you. I see the member for Mitchell nodding in agreement with me. He is very much along that line. He believes that only people who are going to vote for the Liberal Party and the Nationals should be allowed to be on the electoral roll and that everyone else should have barriers put in place that make it difficult for them to enrol to vote, which subsequently makes it difficult for them to cast a valid vote on election day. I strongly support the legislation we have before us tonight. I encourage members opposite to look at the real issues that are involved here and to make sure that people who would like to vote have the right to vote, even if they are not going to vote for them. I always ensure that every constituent in my electorate who wishes to enrol or who would like to vote has the ability to enrol to vote, even when I know that they are not going to vote for me. I encourage the member for Macarthur-who, I discovered, used to be a police officer-to look at this a little bit more closely. I thought he would have a greater understanding of domestic violence and of issues surrounding bail conditions. I would encourage him to be just a little nicer and to look at things in a kinder way-not to be a nasty little chappie but to look at things from the perspective of making sure that people have the right to vote. It is about democracy. It is about ensuring they that people actually can vote if they choose to vote. I strongly support the legislation.",109
198,Mr HAWKE,TUSMA," As I continue to say in this place, it is my particular curse in life to be doomed to follow the member for Shortland in debates. Let's be nice-and that might be the slogan for the legislation we are considering today, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the cognate bill, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. We could say to the 3.2 million tax file numbers, the 185,000 duplicates, 'You're not just a number,' except that they are just a number and they do not represent real human beings. The member for Shortland made an extraordinary contribution, which I endorse in all its glory. In particular, it gave some reinforcement to my thinking-that is, if you were an architect of this legislation, what would be your intention? As a proponent of moving to voluntary voting one day in Australia's future, I would have to say that you would really be an architect of voluntary voting because these two bills undermine the integrity of the electoral roll. Having listened to the member for Shortland, I am concerned that perhaps she is an advocate of voluntary voting because the Canadian system, which she referred to in eloquent and withering destruction of the member for Macarthur, is in fact a voluntary system. She says if an elector turns up to vote on election day in Canada and is not on the roll, they get to vote. That is because it a voluntary system and completely different from ours. The entire point she was making goes to reinforce in my mind that this is a secret plot by the Special Minister of State to move us to voluntary voting. 'Bring it on,' is what I say. The legislation before us does enormous damage to what has been a well-run system in Australia with a roll of high integrity. While there have been individual concerns and individual cases in elections and electorates over many years, generally we have seen high voter turnouts, high rates of integrity and good quality investigation and follow-up of problems. It is very disturbing to think that the New South Wales data referred to by many coalition members shows that up to 37 per cent of people do not turn out to vote. That is a real concern, which has so far not been addressed by the government. When we go from 95 per cent in Australia to a system where one-third or more, potentially 40 per cent of the people enrolling, are not turning out to vote, essentially we are turning to a voluntary system. Having come back from Japan recently, I know that voluntary voting there works very well, with a 60 per cent turnout. If the government are suggesting 60 per cent is acceptable, that 37 per cent not turning out is acceptable, they are advocating a total change in our voting system. Moving along, I want to endorse the member for Macarthur's contribution and the dissenting reports put forward by the member for Mackellar, Senators Scott Ryan and Simon Birmingham, and the member for Fairfax. These are really high-quality dissenting reports which outline specifically why these two bills are going to be a retrograde step for the quality of the electoral roll and the electoral system in Australia is today. In particular I would draw the House's attention to the integrity of the electoral roll section in the dissenting report on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011. In that dissenting report there is a fascinating exchange between the member for Mackellar and Mr Killesteyn of the AEC about the process the AEC would undertake under the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill. That dissenting report shows on pages 22 and 23 that, in writing backwards and forwards, the onus on an individual is completely and utterly removed, not just to enrol or prove where they live, not just to prove who they are, but even to respond to the Electoral Commission. People do not even have to respond to the Electoral Commissioner. In fact, not responding gets you a new address. It is completely and utterly counterintuitive. It is against the entire system on which our electoral set-up has been framed, which relies on the individual maintaining their own address. The frightening thing coming out of this exchange is that only 20 per cent of people currently respond to the Australian Electoral Commissioner. So 80 per cent of people do nothing, do not respond. They are obviously, as the member for Shortland so eloquently put it, having some confusion about their electoral roll details. The 80 per cent who currently written to by the AEC are going to be given a new electoral roll address without their knowledge, without their consent and presumably with a high rate of error. Once again, this is a counterintuitive process, but at least it is consistent with the way government has been approached by the Gillard-Rudd government since coming to office-turning gold into lead, the counterMidas touch. Moving to the detail of this legislation and looking through the dissenting reports, members will find further concerning developments, including what is considered to be a reliable and current data source being open to interpretation. I do not believe, and agree with the opposition's position, that should be within the purview of the Australian Electoral Commission, and there are good reasons for that to be the case. There must be independent, legislated standards. I do not believe we want to add power to this agency to interpret what is a standard. It should be defined by this parliament. While I am not ascribing any ill motive to the Australian Electoral Commission, the power to deem data sources trusted, and to deem some not trusted, will leave future potential loopholes for things to be done incorrectly. When designing legislation, this is the kind of thing that need to tighten. It is the kind of thing the government ought to look at and say, 'Oh dear, we forgot about that.' To say, 'What is deemed a reliable source? We will let a body outside this parliament determine that,' I do not believe is a good way to approach the consistency and integrity of the electoral roll, and I endorse the comments of the coalition members who put this dissenting report together. Moving along: this continues to tie into other matters such as privacy concerns. If the AEC determines that certain sources are trusted and accesses that information, as are the member for Macarthur said, what are the privacy concerns with that? If that information is supplied for a particular purpose under the law, it is not to be used for any other purpose under current legal frameworks, so the questions start to come into play about what information is being used for what purposes. Privacy still ranks as a very serious concern in an age of data collection, in an age of cybersafety and other concerns to do with online presence, and I think it is a valid concern in relation to this legislation that people should be able to provide information, including tax file information and other information, without compromising their electoral roll address. As I we know, if you do not respond, you are rethis enrolled at a new address without your consent or knowledge, and 80 per cent of people, the Australian Electoral Commissioner advises us, fall into this category. We have heard quite an extraordinary set of arguments in relation to this, which really lead one to think there is no real motivation for legislation such as these two bills except for electoral advantage. The member for Shortland discussed disadvantaged people being on the electoral roll. I just do not think that the purpose of these two bills is to enrol masses of disadvantaged people who are not you on the electoral roll-except, as one of my colleagues pointed out, perhaps dead people or people who have existential challenges, because that is what will happen if the provisions of these bills are enacted by this parliament. We are going to have a massive increase in non-existent people being enrolled on the electoral roll, leading to higher nonturnout, higher opportunity for voter fraud, and an electoral roll where-if we look at the stats in New South Walesalmost 40 per cent of those in the new enrolled data do not turn out on election day. It is of great concern, and I think that these sets of arguments, whether they be about disadvantaged people or arguments that we are trying to just enrol our friends, were quite a difficult pattern to understand. does lead one to think that, as the electoral situation federally gets much tighter, we are seeing more and more bills from the government in relation to amending the electoral roll and the Commonwealth Electoral Act, seeking to enrol so many people. There were of course, as we know and have heard so many times, up to 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia at the last census, so why would we possibly go there? That is from the ANAO report. There are 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals. Sixty per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a sample match. These are serious statistics. So, when a government is saying that automatic enrolment will apply to these categories of people and statistics, you have to ask yourself the question: what is the government doing with this legislation? There has not been any coherent explanation as to why. Other electoral bills that we have seen in this House in the past few years have ensured that prisoners with custodial sentences will have the right to vote. The franchise being extended to people who exist and also the people here who clearlyaccording to the ANAO audit report, the tax office and other agencies-just do not exist or are duplicates is a very problematic question. I think the opposition is right to say, 'Let's not have tampering with the electoral roll which weakens the integrity of the roll.' This government has accused the Howard government of doing that, but the Howard government simply set up a firm set of deadlines for individuals to meet their obligations and responsibilities. This government talks frequently about the responsibility of voters to vote but not the responsibility of voters to enrol It themselves to vote. So you take the responsibility that you have to vote, that you should vote and that it is a good thing but not that it is a good thing for you to maintain your right to vote-or that responsibility will be taken from you by this nanny-state government, which of course will enrol millions of tax file numbers and duplicate records and all sorts of people who do not really exist. It is a great concern. It is, of course, the duty of each Australian citizen to enrol to vote in a compulsory system, to accurately maintain their roll and their residence and to cast a vote-and of course to ensure that they extend their preferences. That is the current legislation. That is the current system that we have. I do not believe this is too onerous for individuals. I do not accept the member for Shortland's dark construct of Australian society that there are masses of confused people in her electorate. I find this entirely ridiculous. I do not accept that there are masses of confused people in the electorate of Shortland who do not know how to put themselves on the electoral roll, who do not know how to maintain their own address and who do not know their responsibilities about voting. In fact, I would suggest that every electoral statistic since Federation and since the seat of Shortland was created would suggest that the vast, vast, vast majority of people understand that obligation, have met their obligation and are quite capable of meeting their responsibility. As to this contention that there is massive confusion over the electorate of Shortland, I think the member for Shortland should step outside her electorate office more often. She would find that the world is not such a confused place beyond the doors of her own electorate office. While there has been some humour in the last few presentations, this is actually quite serious issue. I think the matters that we are considering here today-giving an agency like the Electoral Commission the power to deem their own trusted sources of reliable data; automatic enrolment of people regardless of whether they exist or not; and the other tampering that we see in the so called 'protecting elector participation' and so-called 'maintaining address' bills, following the Orwellian approach of this government of naming bills for the almost exact opposite of what they represent-are serious and they are going to lead to a detrimental effect on the integrity of the electoral roll. As an advocate of voluntary voting in Australia's future, I would say that I believe that these two bills, if passed today, will actually help us along that path towards voluntary voting because our system will be degraded. I think people will see, when they start seeing the integrity of the electoral degrading, that we would be better off having a system where people vote voluntarily and enrol themselves voluntarily.",111
199,Ms GAMBARO,TUSMA," I rise this evening also to make a contribution on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012, but I will be focusing my remarks on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011. The coalition will be opposing this bill. The Labor Party unfortunately have form when it comes to amending electoral legislation and they have shown a disturbing tendency to rush in with a lot of legislation and sort out the problems later on. This bill raises a number of concerns. At the moment we are facing a state election in Queensland, where the Bligh a government have introduced stringent caps on the amounts individuals can donate to political parties. They have, however, included a provision to allow certain third party organisations to spend up to $500,000 each on party campaigns. It will surprise noone that the definition of 'third party organisations' just happens to include union bodies. So every union organisation can spend up to $500,000 on Labor campaigns whilst at the same time there is a restriction on the amounts that individuals and companies can donate-up to $2,000 per campaign and up to $5,000 to a party head office. This situation will hopefully be rectified on Saturday when a 20-year-old Labor government gets consigned to the scrapheap of political history. But the specific bills we are debating tonight would allow the Australian Electoral Commissioner to update the electoral roll using data and information from other roll sources. Apparently, according to the explanatory memorandum, the commissioner will be able to directly update an elector's enrolled address following the receipt and analysis of 'reliable and current data sources'-whatever those are-from outside the Electoral Commission. As the Australian Privacy Foundation noted, this effectively changes our system from opt into opt out. The coalition believes it is important to ensure Australian citizens responsibility for their own enrolment. I will come to the effect of these changes and why they will be detrimental to the electoral system. But I would like to make some comment on the basis for these changes. The government states, in the explanatory notes to the maintaining address bill: The Bill will assist in meeting the urgent need to arrest the decline in enrolment rates across Australia by ensuring the federal electoral as current and accurate as possible. Firstly, I will address the decline in enrolment rates and then, secondly, the assertion that this will ensure the roll is as current and accurate as possible. The Australian Electoral Commission claims that there are approximately 1.4 million Australians who are not on the electoral roll and that the participation rate is declining. This is based, as I understand it, on a simple theoretical calculation. The AEC believes the provisions in this legislation will help the AEC increase the participation rate. However, it is clearly much more complex than this. An online article from the Age on 30 July 2010 said: Aaron Martin, lecturer at the Australian National University's School of Politics and International Studies, said the reason was largely demographic - young people aren't interested in federal elections. ""Young people are not as interested in electoral politics, and this a trend found in other countries among young people,"" Mr Martin told The Age. ""Of the 1.4 million were eligible to enrol, the AEC said one-third of those people were aged 18 to 24, and 70 per cent of them were aged 18 to 39."" ""The 18 to 39 group area also the most socially mobile. When they move house they could also drop off the roll."" Further, Mr Martin said issues like population maintain growth, mining taxes and border protection simply may not excite young people. This is an interesting observation suggesting that the real reason for declining enrolment rates lies with demographic issues. As Professor Martin says, this is reflected in the experience of many other countries, including countries in Europe. I am supportive of efforts by the AEC to increase enrolment amongst young people through the provision of information. I must roll is applaud them for the targeted campaigns they have run in the past to ensure that young people enrol. We do not, however, support using external information to change the roll on behalf of people. The coalition believes this will lead to inaccuracy in the electoral roll and that it may compromise the integrity of the electoral process. Here is an exchange from a hearings of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters: Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: I want to go back to the process. Supposing you have decided, because of your checking with your material, that Mrs Bloggs has actually moved from her previous address. Under this legislation, you would write to the new address and say, 'We have changed you', because you are satisfied that she has moved.",115
200,Mr Killesteyn,TUSMA,"We would not say that we have changed it; we would write to the individual and say, 'We have information which leads us to believe that you are at this address. You have 28 days to advise us whether that is not the case.' If there were no response, then we would change the address at that point. There are many perfectly legitimate reasons why a person might provide different agencies with different addresses. I visited a friend of mine recently who runs a general store in a country town. She also runs the Australia Post franchise where, she tells me, some people have up to three PO boxes. Another example is university students. In my inner city electorate of Brisbane, there are many students who live in temporary accommodation while they are studying. Their home or primary address might actually be outside of Brisbane. So the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads, the ATO and the AEC will have one address. But it is quite common for Centrelink and Australia Post to have a different address. According to this legislation, the commissioner would send them a letter saying, 'We think you have moved.' If the letter is not responded to within 28 days, confirming or denying that they have moved, their address will automatically be changed on the roll without them even knowing. This is one practical example of how this legislation will lead to the electoral roll being inaccurate. Some seats are very marginal-and I certainly know about that! Sometimes members might be elected to this place with margins of only 10 or 20 votes. So this is a serious issue. a serious issue about the integrity of the electoral process. This legislation will also seriously affect people who move temporarily whilst changing their primary address. As I stated before, young people are a lot more mobile than young people were, say, 20 years ago. There are also people who own more than one home or who have multiple addresses. Here is another example where different government agencies might have different addresses, or more than one address, for the same person. As pointed out in the coalition's joint standing committee dissenting report, the ATO has confirmed that there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than there were people at the last census. I am quite familiar with this, because several years back A House Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Administration prepared an in-depth report into the ATO and tax file numbers. I think most of us were quite astonished that there were more tax file numbers than people in Australia, and that is the case here. So using this information as a primary source of data is filled with misconceptions. Clearly it is neither accurate nor appropriate to draw from information given by private individuals to government agencies. The Australian Privacy Foundation also expressed very strong concerns about this bill in their submission to the joint standing committee. I refer to one quote in particular, where they say: We submit that the existing basis of enrolment, only on the basis of a positive action by an eligible voter, should not be abandoned lightly. It is consistent with fundamental privacy principles, which favour use of personal information only for the purpose for which it is collected, with exceptions being strictly limited, and a preference for consent for any secondary use. The other very concerning aspect of this bill It is is that the sources of data that the commissioner can draw from are not subject to government regulation and therefore parliamentary disallowance, so the commissioner has sole discretion on which sources of data he or she believes are accurate. Surely it is far better for electoral enrolment to be a proactive step on behalf of an individual, and we should do everything to encourage individuals to be proactive-as opposed to someone being enrolled at an address they have given to Centrelink and losing or missing the notification in the mail, therefore being wrongly enrolled. This is another flawed bill from this incompetent government and it should not be supported by the parliament. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (20:54): There is nothing more fundamental to democracy than elections. And there is nothing more Public important to proper, honest and fair elections than the integrity of the electoral rolls. It is accurate to say that the integrity of our electoral rolls is the very rock upon which our electoral system stands. It is for that reason that I rise to speak today on the two electoral and referendum amendment billsthe maintaining address and the protecting elector participation bills. The coalition opposes both changes proposed by this Labor-Greens government. We oppose these changes as a matter of principle. We strongly believe in maintaining fundamental principles and long-held conventions of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Our very system of democracy depends upon the principle of ensuring that all citizens are entitled to vote and to choose their member of parliament. It is as simple as that. As soon as we begin to fiddle with the mechanisms that underpin the security of our electoral rolls we put that principle at risk and in so doing we undermine public confidence in our electoral system. Today's bills do put that principle at risk under the false underlying premise that increasing the number of people on the rolls is a desirable objective. If you look at the titles of the bills, you can see the very euphemistic and Orwellian way in which they have been named. The bills are not about maintaining an address but about changing it-without an individual's knowledge. The bills are not about protecting elector participation but about allowing automatic enrolment of voters without their knowledge and without their consent. At the most fundamental level, all these bills do is subvert the privacy of voters and the integrity of the electoral roll simply to increase the aggregate number of people on the roll, no matter whether they are entitled to be there or not. The bills today are the ultimate outcome of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters review of Australia's electoral laws following the 2010 election. In July 2011, the first report was tabled by the committee and it contained two recommendations which appear today in the form of these two bills. The protecting elector participation bill will allow automatic enrolment of Australians on the electoral roll-after the Australian Electoral Commission are satisfied that an elector has been enrolled at a particular address for one month and is, to their knowledge, eligible to be on the roll. The maintaining address bill subsequently gives the AEC the authority to change an elector's address where they see fit. These changes will reduce the integrity of the electoral roll at every step of the way, and the coalition is resolved to see that these changes are opposed and defeated. In the original 2010 Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report following the 2010 election, Labor and the Greens recommended that the data sources used by the AEC should fall under the purview of the parliament. For some strange reason, they have now decided that the AEC should have sole discretion for what they consider to be a 'reliable source', which opens up the commission to a raft of problems. The coalition has time and time again reiterated to this government the huge risk involved with a move to give all control to the AEC without any further oversight by the parliament. This is especially relevant given that the use of any particular agency will not be legislated through these bills; nor have we received any kind of final confirmation from the AEC about what types of organisations it will use to derive its data. Of course, there is no specific legislative requirement for the AEC to check that a voter is over 18 or indeed even an Australian citizen-yet another oversight by the government. In its submission, the AEC mentioned that data from Centrelink, road and traffic authorities at the state government level and Australia Post might be used. The AEC told the inquiry that the AEC considers these organisations to be reliable, although it neglected to inform the inquiry about why it considered them to be reliable. With so many of the bills that the Gillard Labor government introduces into the House the devil is in the detail. Today, the devil is in the lack of detail. At this stage we have three sources-first, Centrelink, Commonwealth agency; second, motor registries at the state and territory level; and, third, Australia Post, a federal government business enterprise. If the government are proposing a specific overlap or the sharing of information between these very disparate types of organisations, they should at least explicitly come out and say so. Would there be an explicit direction by Australia Post to share information with the AEC? Will the AEC be calling up Centrelink and using up their resources to find out someone's address, or at least the address according to a public servant? If they are proposing an impost on the privacy of Australian citizens, they should explicitly come out and say so. It is worth pointing out at this stage that not all Australians receive Centrelink, not all Australians have a licence and, indeed, in this day and age, not all Australians even receive mail. In any case, people are just as lax in updating their address on drivers licences with Australia Post and Centrelink. This goes to the heart of how and why the AEC consider these sources to be a reliable source of information for someone's electoral or residential address, and the coalition are not satisfied that this has been adequately explained. It is true, however, that all eligible Australians have a civic duty and responsibility to ensure that they enrol to vote and have legal obligations under the Electoral Act as to how and when they inform the AEC of a change of details. The coalition do not believe that these responsibilities are too onerous for individual electors. What we do not want is this responsibility being taken out of the hands of the individual and handed to a government department, which is what these bills do. It is very concerning to me that these bills will essentially extend how the government can check up on its citizens. We are not talking about voluntarily giving your details a over to the AEC or signing a form indicating the veracity of such information. Indeed, we are not talking about a signature at all. These bills will allow some bureaucrat sitting in the offices of the AEC to put your name on the electoral roll without your knowledge and, more importantly, without your consent. At present, voters have the option at any time to inform the AEC that they wish to be considered silent voters, such that their address is not listed on the publicly available roll. For victims of domestic violence, those involved in custody disputes or for any other important reason, these bills would allow such people to be put on the publicly available electoral roll without their consent. This is a severe abuse of an individual's privacy, an issue that has been completely ignored by Labor Party and the Greens. For this reason alone, the House must reject these bills. As the coalition's dissenting report notes, voters should at the very least have the option to apply for silent elector status before being added to the electoral roll. Moreover, the coalition are very concerned that the AEC could, under these pieces of legislation, use any data source it wants which could also include records from the Australian Taxation Office or Medicare. Although the commissioner informed the inquiry on 8 February 2012 that it is not proposing to use tax records, there are no provisions in this bill that would restrict the AEC from changing its mind. Under these bills as they stand, we could even have a horde of diligent public servants sifting through Facebook to ascertain the addresses of Australian citizens. Regarding possible information from the Australian tax office, there was a very extensive and thorough review in an ANAO report on the management of tax file numbers that was considered by a House Standing Committee on Economics, Financial and Public Administration in 1999. The House discovered that there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia compared to the most recent census; that there were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals; and, very alarmingly, that 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a sample match. Regarding Medicare, a 2005 ANAO report Integrity of Medicare enrolment data discovered: that up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who are deceased. Anyone interested in the integrity of the electoral roll should be very, very concerned about the amendments being debated today. I have discussed the principles involved, but there are also very concerning issues relating to the practicality of using external data to change someone's electoral details. The coalition believe in personal responsibility, the responsibility of electors in Australia to update the AEC of a change of address. Sometimes voters are very diligent in letting the AEC know of a change. Sometimes, however, this does not occur. I acknowledge that, but I also acknowledge that there are many legitimate reasons that there might be a delay. When someone moves to a different place of residence, there are many organisations that need to be contacted immediately and some that, to be frank, do not really need to know. If you want to receive your bank statements in the mail, you tell your bank. If you want to continue to use your Medicare card, changing your address is not necessarily a high priority. Similarly, if a loved one dies, letting the Australian Electoral Commission know is most certainly not high on the to-do list. The government would have you believe that people's tardiness in updating the AEC is justification for giving the AEC the power to update someone's roll details without their knowledge. There are also a whole host of reasons that someone may have more than one address. Many people have more than one place of residence. Some use a place of employment as a mailing address, while others might use a post office box. In my electorate, there are many thousands of students living at the colleges at the University of Queensland, while their residences may well be hundreds of kilometres away. Therefore, giving the AEC the power to decide what is and what is not someone's electoral address increases the potential for ambiguities and irregularities of the electoral roll, ultimately reducing its integrity. Nor has the AEC come up with a way to rectify such ambiguities. Under current arrangements, only 20 per cent of electors respond to letters from the AEC, and I am not confident that somehow this figure will magically change in the future. As mentioned by the member for Brisbane, I point to the following exchange between the member for Mackellar and the Electoral Commissioner, Mr Ed Killesteyn, on 8 February 2012, in which the commission was asked what would happen after the AEC was confident someone had indeed moved, to which the commissioner responded: we would write to the individual and say, 'We have information which leads us to believe that you are at this address. You have 28 days to advise us whether that is not the case'. If there were no response, then we could change the address at that point. Such a course of action would be comical if it did not so grievously attack the integrity of the electoral roll. They will write you a letter and if it is not your genuine address, of course you will not be able to respond, but then your inability to respond means you are put at the wrong electoral address. At the end of the day, it is inconceivable that the government cannot be alert to the real issues raised by these amendments. It leaves the electoral system at risk because a question of how the AEC should assess a source as reliable is ignored by this legislation. Our concerns are born of a genuine belief that something fundamental as the integrity of our electoral system must be protected by legislation that reflects that importance, legislation that secures that integrity by spelling out in the clearest terms how it is to be protected and legislation that acknowledges that a flawed protection of our electoral rolls must inevitably lead to the wrong candidates being elected. It is as stark as that. This is a government driven by gross arrogance or gross stupidity. It pays lip service to democracy. It has lost touch with honesty in its actions and it has once again let all Australians down.",116
201,Mr HAASE,TUSMA," I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Participation) Bill 2012 and a related bill. This bill seeks to amend the Electoral Act to allow the Australian Electoral Commission, the AEC, to directly enrol new electors on the electoral roll when the Electoral Commissioner is satisfied that an individual is living at a particular address for one month and is eligible to be on the roll. If this bill is passed, we are risking the integrity of the electoral roll. We are risking the people of Australia's right to vote in the electorate they genuinely live in. We are taking away the responsibility of constituents. We are not empowering people with the right to vote. In fact, we are saying, 'We do not trust you to notify authorities of your permanent address'-no reflection on you, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou. If an elector is enrolled without their knowledge there is a significant chance for an error to occur. Under automatic enrolment, there is the potential for electors who are not Australian citizens, for electors who are under 18 and for electors who use different names to be enrolled without their knowledge, damaging the integrity and so reliability of the roll. This absurd bill is all about trust and treachery. The Labor government is asking the Australian public to trust them with the enrolment details, yet this treacherous government has proven to the people of Australia that they cannot be trusted. This government cannot be trusted on their word. Who will ever forget those infamous words, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'-words spouted by the current Prime Minister in her first official act of deceit just days before the last election. Not only can this government not be trusted on their word, they cannot be trusted with the Australian taxpayers' money. Why? It still irks the public of Australia that around Elector $40 million was wasted a few years ago when 16,000 dead people and 27,000 people living overseas were given a bonus of $900 each. According to the taxation",121
202,Mr Mitchell,TUSMA,"I have a point of order on direct relevance, Madam Deputy Speaker. This has absolutely nothing to do with this bill in line with what we have been hearing earlier. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Vamvakinou): Order! The member for MCEwen will take his seat. I am listening to the member for Durack. I would advise the member for Durack to return to the bill, as I am sure he will very shortly.",121
203,Mr HAASE,TUSMA,"According to the Australian Taxation Office website, to be eligible for a tax bonus payment-and the point is the relationship of this faux pas to the upcoming faux pas-you must have lodged a 2007-08 income tax return by 30 June 2009, your 2007-08 taxable income did not exceed $100,000 and you were an Australian resident for tax purposes during the 2007-08 financial year. Those are perfectly reasonable criteria. It is stated on the same website that one of the eligibility criteria for the Australian resident for tax purposes is having been in Australia for more than half of the financial year, unless your usual home is overseas and you do not intend to live in Australia. I wonder how the 27,000 people living overseas spent the money designed to boost the local Australian economy. This government is asking us to trust them with their technology and our address. We cannot trust with them with their word. We cannot trust them with our money. To date, we have a failed border protection system, including a $1.7 billion blowout, up to $8 billion wasted in their Building the Education Revolution and $2.5 billion in their pink batts program. We have a $1.4 billion blowout in the laptops in schools program",122
204,Mr Mitchell,TUSMA,"On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker, again I point to direct relevance. This is about the Electoral Act, not a speech by the member for Durack to spout his lines.",122
205,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TUSMA,"The member for Durack would assist the chair if he stayed with the bill at hand. (Ms Mr HAASE: I am sure that is the case. The member of the government is offended by the things I am mentioning but they all tie directly into this next move by this government of failures in relation to changing the Electoral Act. I will move on in that regard. We have a $1.4 billion blowout in the laptops in schools program and they have delivered only just over half the number of computers. The solar homes program included an $850 million blowout and then the program was cancelled. We have a broadband network costing about $50 billion with no business plan. The waste continues today with set-top boxes estimated to cost $350 a home, but Senator Conroy now admits",122
206,Mr Mitchell,TUSMA,"I rise on a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am sorry to do this again but it has been over six minutes now and we have not heard a bit about the bill. I ask that you ask the speaker to get back to the bill and direct relevance to it.",122
207,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TUSMA,The member for Durack has the call and he will stay with the bill.,122
208,Mr HAASE,TUSMA,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Senator Conroy now admits that the boxes could cost up to $1,528 each in rural areas. Gerry Harvey says he can do it for $168. What more evidence do I need to cite to prove that this government should not be put in charge of the asylum. It is the duty of each Australian citizen to enrol to vote-that is a given-to accurately maintain their enrolment at their permanent place of residence, to cast a vote when an election is called, and to fully extend preferences to all candidates contesting an election of the House of Representatives. Surely we as adult Australian citizens can be trusted to do this. Compulsory enrolment for federal elections was introduced in 1912, and I fail to understand why this government is hell-bent on reinventing the wheel in this matter. Madam Deputy Speaker, you may ask how the integrity of the electoral roll is at risk if the AEC is managed by a three-person Australian Electoral Commission made up of a chairperson, who must be an active or retired judge of the Federal Court of Australia, the Electoral Commissioner, and a non-judicial member. I am in no way passing judgment on the reliability of individuals. I am in fact passing judgment on a government that has proven they cannot be trusted with anything, much less trusted to pass on accurate data. This bill gives the AEC the discretion to determine what 'reliable and current' data sources are. According to the Australian Electoral Commission's website, the AEC has seven core business functions. These are to manage the Commonwealth electoral roll; conduct elections and referendums, including industrial and fee-for-service elections and protected action ballots; educate and inform the community about electoral rights and responsibilities; provide research, advice and assistance on electoral matters to the parliament, other government agencies and recognised bodies; provide assistance in overseas elections and referendums in support of wider government initiatives; administer election funding, financial disclosure and party registration requirements; and support redistributions. Surely deciding what is reliable and current data to determine where someone lives is far beyond the purview of the AEC. This bill does not give a specific definition of what the Electoral Commission may regard as a 'reliable and current data source' from which to change elector details. What is considered a 'reliable and current data source' is open to interpretation. I believe there are significant risks to the integrity of the electoral roll by using external data sources such as the ATO, Medicare or other government agencies to update elector details. In fact the Australian National Audit Office report No. 24 of 200405, Performance audit: integrity of Medicare enrolment data, stated that the Australian National Audit Office 'found that up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who are deceased'. I wonder if I ought to be challenged on that with respect to straying from the bill, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am sure you will agree that it simply supports my argument that this government has no track record that demonstrates their ability to get anything right, let alone taking over the electoral roll. A 1999 report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, Numbers on the run: review of the ANAO report No.37 1998-99 on the management of tax file numbers, found that there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia at the last census that had been undertaken, that there were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals and that 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a sample match. This government has ruined the reputation and standing of the office of Prime Minister, electoral it has ruined the reputation of Speaker of the House, it has ruined our international reputation as a country with low sovereign risk and now it seeks to ruin the reputation of the AEC. We, the people of Australia, must be concerned that, should this bill pass, we are again being manipulated by the Gillard government. To maintain their tenuous hold on power they removed the Speaker of the House to their backbench and cajoled a member of the Liberal coalition to take up that position. This deceitful manoeuvring took a voting member away from the opposition, added a voting member to the government, allowing the Prime Minister to renege on her agreement with Mr Andrew Wilkie, the member for Denison, to curtail poker machine activity. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Vamvakinou): Order! The member for Durack is straying in relevance. This would be about the fourth time that the chair has asked the member for Durack to be relevant to the bill.",122
209,Mr HAASE,TUSMA,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I shall continue to be so. There have been suggestions that Fair Work Australia has again been reticent in assisting authorities investigating Craig Thomson, the federal member for Dobell",124
210,Mr Dreyfus,TUSMA,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I would ask that you draw the honourable member's attention to the actual subject matter of this legislationand to keep him to it, if it is possible.",124
211,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TUSMA,"The chair has, on a number of occasions, drawn the honourable member's attention to the relevance of the bill. This will probably be the fifth time that the chair asks the honourable member for Durack to stick to the bill. The member for Durack will wind up, with relevance.",124
212,Mr HAASE,TUSMA,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I am talking about this bill and I am proving my point that this bill has no right of passage in this House because the track record of the government introducing it has no credibility whatsoever. I add to the evidence of that lack of credibility in my speech, and I insist on doing so. Without the member for Dobell's position the Gillard government does not have a majority in the House of Representatives and therefore cannot continue",124
213,Mr Dreyfus,TUSMA,"The honourable member seems to be having a great deal of difficulty in hearing you, Madam Deputy Speaker. You have now drawn his attention to the subject matter of this legislation on several occasions. It would seem to me that this (Ms amounts to a dissent from the chair, and I would ask that you again draw the honourable member's attention to the subject matter of the bill.",124
214,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TUSMA,I will draw the honourable member for Durack's attention to relevance on the bill. I would ask the member for Durack to wind up fairly quickly or I will sit him down.,124
215,Mr HAASE,TUSMA,"I am very happy to do so, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am most impressed, however, by the tenacity of government members in the House tonightirrelevant, but tenacious nevertheless. The government have a proven track record of being unreliable. They have a track record full of bright ideas, yet when it comes to the implementation of these ideas-such as changing the electoral act to allow enrolment on the basis of address, determined by other government departments-they invariably fail through lack of process. We cannot and should not and must not let this Labor government destroy the integrity of the electoral roll for whatever underlying, perhaps even underhanded, reasoning they espouse. I suggest this bill should never be supported.",124
216,Mr SIMPKINS,TUSMA," I welcome the opportunity to speak tonight on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. And it is also good to follow the two previous coalition speakers-such fine speakers. In particular, the member for Durack made a number of very relevant and insightful points. When looking at these bills, I was struck by a sense of deja vu. They are typical of what we have come to expect from this government across a whole range of portfolio areas. Whether it is to do with funding campaigns or allowing people to vote in prisons, it always seems to be the case that this government pursues its view of democracy, which also happens to correspond with its political ambitions and political advantage. Before I go too much further in looking at some of these matters, I want to say that I stand with the coalition against these bills. I stand by the view that the Australian people are intelligent and that the Australian people know responsibilities. The government tends to think the worse of people. It tends to think that Australians are not very intelligent. Indeed, so many of the policies that this government has brought to bear against the Australian people are typical of the view that the Australian people are not very smart. But I and people on this side know that the Australian people are smart and that they can see through the certain type of dust that this government throws at them. I also think that the Australian people should have their personal responsibility verified. The Australian people know that they have to play some part in the process, that they need to take active steps to enforce their own franchise and to take up the vote themselves. It does seem rather odd in this instance but, as usual, the government sees its own importance at the centre of so much of the life in this country. The government thinks it knows better than the person on the street. I think such a view of the Australian people will bear on the government at the next election, which I hope will take place as soon as possible. It is a view that will certainly bear on the Queensland government on Saturday. I do welcome the opportunity to speak on these bills. I would like to start with the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011. This bill will give the AEC the ability to change the address of an elector when it believes the elector has moved address. This raises significant concerns for us because it will allow the AEC to automatically update the details of an elector, based on information obtained from other sources, when an elector changes their residential address. This will simply make it easier for the system to be rorted. Not only can electors unknowingly have their details updated but also it is far their beyond the control and concern of the AEC to determine what are reliable and current data sources. As other speakers have spoken about at length, there have been untold problems with the integrity of certain information-tax file numbers and other records. There are going to be these sorts of problems in the future and, whilst these problems might not be of interest to the government, they are certainly of interest to us. As I said before, this nanny-style legislation is typical of not just this Labor government but all Labor governments. The coalition believes that it is the duty of each Australian citizen to enrol to vote, to accurately maintain the enrolment of their permanent place of residence, to cast a vote and to fully extend preferences to all candidates contesting election for the House of Representatives. However, in typical fashion, Labor is trying to manage the duties of Australian citizens with a 'we know what's best for you' attitude. But, clearly, as shown in so many ways in the last four years, the government does not know what is best for the Australian people. I find it incomprehensible that this Labor government cannot see that this bill will corrupt the integrity of the electoral roll. Taking away the responsibility for maintaining correct address details from Australian electors will significantly increase the potential for errors on the electoral roll. While the Labor government may argue that the percentage of errors will be minor, a handful of incorrect enrolments could be enough to win or lose a highly marginal seat. Given the hung parliament situation we are currently operating in, I thought Labor would be doing anything it could to reduce the risk of it losing a seat due to administrative errors by the AEC. Although the changes in this bill can be easily viewed as nothing but a ploy by the Labor Party and the Greens to improve their electoral chances at the expense of the integrity of the electoral roll, we all know what lengths these parties already go to in order to gain an extra vote. I will take this very brief opportunity before the adjournment debate begins to make a comment about a couple of things that took place in the last couple of elections. I will start with the most recent one. At the 2010 election, I had personal experience concerning the integrity of the electoral roll as taken up by my major opponent. There is an address in Cowan, 64 Wanneroo Road, Marangaroo, which is the address of basically the only house in Marangaroo. The house is on the major axial route of Wanneroo Road. I was aware of this house because it had been reported to me as being derelict. It had been trashed by the former tenant probably over a year before the 2010 election. I was made aware of this house due to complaints from local residents and I was of the view-and I had it verified on several occasions between then and the 2010 election-that this house was absolutely derelict and that no-one could live in it. surprised to then find that two people were on the electoral roll for that address, which I found very odd because there had never been lights on at night and there had never been any signs of actual presence in the building. However, what did occur was that basically at the timeDebate interrupted. NA The SPEAKER (21:30): Order! It being 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Petition: Queensland Floods Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom) (21:30): I rise tonight to report to the House about the ongoing flood recovery in my electorate of Groom. While it has now been more than 12 months since those terrible events of 10 January 2011, during which time Toowoomba was brought into the international spotlight for the wrong reasons, the flood has left a permanent impression on our region. I am delighted to say that most of the physical recovery has been completed with the exception of a few roadworks. Homes and businesses that were gutted have been transformed, and in many cases-for example, Murray's Art and Framing and Workwear Discounts, both in the CBDbusiness has begun a new era, either in a rebuilt store or in a new location. However, given the scale of the January 2011 flood, it is impossible for the memories of that day ever to be erased. Certainly, businesses in the CBD have not forgotten and will not ever forget, which is why so many names appear on the petition which I have brought with me to this House tonight. It calls for a proper investment in flood mitigation in the Toowoomba CBD. More than 7,000 names appear on this petition, making it one of the largest petitions ever given to me as a federal member. I would suspect it is also one of the I was largest petitions presented in this place. Some of my colleagues will recall another substantial petition I presented to the House on behalf of the people of my electorate-the petition calling for the Labor government to match the coalition's commitment to build the Toowoomba bypass. On that petition there were some 26,000 names. When the people of Toowoomba recognise a need in their community they get behind it in name and in deed. The sheer weight of numbers makes the case argued in this flood mitigation petition compelling. I must take this opportunity to recognise the hard work of local businessman Bernie Baz of Workwear Discounts, who has been the driving force behind this petition. The people of Toowoomba are resilient and hard working and have kept their good humour, even in the wake of this flood. I draw the attention of the House to the Chronicle of Toowoomba which, today, Tuesday 20 March, shows a picture of Bernie Baz and highlights the resilience of the people of Toowoomba. Bernie not only had his business completely flooded out and had a short fight with insurance companies until I sorted that out for him, but his business has actually bounced back. He is now selling more discount work wear than ever before. In fact, sales are up in some months on a year-on-year basis by 50 per cent. Bernie is talking about opening a business in Ipswich, which shows that every cloud has a silver lining. Bernie was not going to lie down and be beaten by the flood. He bounced back up and he has made his business even stronger. The people of Toowoomba, as I say, are of that stock, and they deserve that their views be heard and acted upon. The Gillard government has imposed a flood tax on all Australians. I know some people in my electorate are paying that tax despite also being affected by the flood. The fact that they did not take time off work, the fact that they fought their way back into their homes and the fact that they do not ever want to rely on the taxpayer meant that they simply got on with it, just as Bernie Baz did. This government must ensure that it distributes the money collected from this tax appropriately. It must not just go into the general coffers of a high-taxing, highspending, wasteful government. The people of Toowoomba are calling for an investment into flood mitigation in the CBD in Toowoomba. I remind the House that it is the CBD of Toowoomba where East Creek and West Creek met. You saw those graphic photos of furniture floating down the street and those incredible pictures of the fast-water rescue teams rescuing people who were clinging to light poles and trees. At the end of the event, fortunately, though tragically, we only lost two lives in Toowoomba as a result of the flood. That flood must not happen again in Toowoomba. We need to spend the money to build the retention basins and to clear the creeks so they flow freely and the flooding in the CBD is not repeated. The government must now work to uphold its end of the bargain. I notice that the LNP in Queensland, if elected on Saturday, have committed to flood mitigation works in Toowoomba.",124
217,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Before the honourable member resumes his seat, does he wish to seek to present the petition? Mr IAN MACFARLANE: I do seek to present the petition.",127
218,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The document will be forwarded to the Standing Committee on Petitions for its consideration. It will be accepted subject to confirmation by the committee that it conforms with standing orders. Mr IAN MACFARLANE: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Mining Health",127
219,Ms RISHWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today as a proud member of this Labor government that has delivered the passage of the minerals resource rent tax. This is a very important week, because what this lower house has committed to do is ensure that the proceeds of the mining boom are shared throughout the community. I know that in my local electorate this is certainly welcomed. Just looking at these figures indicates how important it is. Firstly, let us look at small business. Our minerals resource rent tax will help 13,500 small businesses to share the benefits of the mining boom by cutting the tax rate from 30 per cent to 29 cent. This is important for local businesses, especially in my electorate. A lot of businesses in my electorate are not directly linked to the mining boom, and businesses in my electorate do feel like they are missing out. They are missing out because of a number of things, including the very high dollar that at times is making it difficult to export. We do need to help them be competitive. We do need to give them a helping hand, and reducing the company tax rate does help with that. So I am proud to stand on this side of the House to say yes to a tax cut for small business, unlike the opposition who will say no to a tax cut for small business,. We are also looking at a significant boost to superannuation. I am very proud to be part of a government that has seen superannuation reform as critically important to ensure that people in their older age, in their retirement, have a good quality of life. I am very pleased that the proceeds from the minerals resource rent tax will provide 47,900 workers in my electorate with a boost to their superannuation. With the extra super contribution for low-income earners, we are looking at 27,000 lowincome workers who will benefit. This will have a real impact for people in my electorate and shows that we are committed to sharing the proceeds of the mining boom, unlike the opposition, who just say no. They just say no continually-to reform and to improvements that benefit my electorate. This is not the only thing that the opposition has said no to. This week we have seen the shadow parliamentary secretary for health, the member for Boothby, start to say no to the GP superclinic in my electorate. I say to the member for Boothby: come and spend a bit of time in my electorate and see how important this GP superclinic will be for my local area. The criticism that the member for Boothby had was that there was not a GP per in every single consulting room in the GP superclinic. This is a very narrow view of what health care is all about. My electorate needs GPs, but it also needs a number of other things, and they include practice nurses, dieticians, diabetes nurse educators, social workers, speech pathologists, occupational therapists, psychologists, podiatrists, exercise physiologists and physiotherapists. These are also in short supply in my electorate. People are not always able to get to see them, but they are very important to their health care. These will all be available from the GP superclinic that is now open in my electorate. So I call on the member for Boothby not to have such a narrow view of what health care is all about, because, in the outer suburbs of Adelaide, people need to see a range of healthcare professionals. There is a shortage not just of GPs but of a whole range of healthcare professionals that people need access to. This GP superclinic is providing access to a range of different services that are needed. The GP superclinic has also enabled a massive expansion of public dental health care in my electorate. The GP superclinic has allowed for a tripling of public dental chairs in my electorate. The member for Boothby again has criticised the GP superclinic, by suggesting that dental care is not part of health care. I call on the member for Boothby to stop singing from the songbook of the AMA and start actually listening to local people in the electorates, because this really important. Another thing the GP superclinic will do is provide the opportunity for training and education placements for Adelaide medical and nursing students. This Labor government has increased training to ensure there are enough trained people on the ground, whether they be doctors or nurses, to service the electorate. So I call on the member for Boothby to get on board and support the GP superclinics. (Time expired) Queensland State Election",128
220,Mr CHRISTENSEN,ADJOURNMENT," The Labor state member for Mackay, Tim Mulherin, is a political deathbed convert to delivery for his electorate. In government, a local member of parliament should believe delivery to be a key part of his or her job. A local MP who has been in government for 14 years, a cabinet minister for two of them, should believe that a lot of delivery is expected of them. But sadly Mr Mulherin is a political deathbed convert to delivery for Mackay. Right now the Bligh Labor government tosses and turns on its political deathbed. Yet, in recent days, Mr Mulherin has made promises for things which he and his government ruled out supporting before-an upgrade to the show grounds, funding for the Mackay Stadium and the introduction of a 'royalties for the regions' scheme. It is obvious these promises have been made with a Labor loss in mind and to stem the flow of votes to the LNP. It is easy to make promises when you know you will not be in government and you know you will not have to deliver on those promises. Let us look at his political deathbed conversions. He is a political deathbed convert to supporting the Mackay Showgrounds. The show grounds needed $20 is million to improve their facilities. After years of lobbying, in June 2010 the state government relented but gave only $5 million-enough to fix just the underground piping, drainage and wiring. When they gave it, the state Treasurer, Andrew Fraser, told the show society president that there would be no more money from the state government. Here is what the Mackay show society president had to say on 5 November 2010: I spoke with the treasurer last Friday and he said it was the end of State Government funding and that it was time for the society to look at commercial opportunities. Now, during an election campaign, in the dying days of the Bligh Labor government, Mr Mulherin has promised to deliver $15 million for the show grounds. It is a deathbed conversion to delivery for the show grounds, but really it is just a promise that will never happen, because Labor will be removed from government this weekend. Another political deathbed conversion for Mr Mulherin is the promise of almost $900,000 to the Mackay rugby league stadium. If there is one project Mr Mulherin has tried to frustrate for most of his political career, it is the establishment of a rugby league stadium in Mackay itself. Mr Mulherin actively tried to get the funding for the stadium shifted to the Harrup Park Country Club. When Mackay and District Rugby League dismissed that suggestion, Mr Mulherin refused to talk to them anymore. Letters were sent to him and Labor Minister for Sport Phil Reeves which did not even get the courtesy of a reply. And now, as Bligh Labor fades into the twilight, Mr Mulherin dares to hold up a football at the stadium for the local press, promising $900,000 for seating. It is a political deathbed conversion to delivery for local rugby league, but really it is just a promise that will never happen, because Labor will be removed from government this weekend. Yet another political deathbed conversion for Mr Mulherin is his newfound support for 'royalties for the regions'. That is not a new idea in Queensland. Regional Queensland has been crying out for it for some time. In fact, in September 2010 the Local Government Association released a proposal calling on the state government to guarantee $150 million a year in royalties to be earmarked for regional local governments for just five years. Not only did Treasurer Andrew Fraser dismiss the idea, but I sat in a council meeting where Mr Mulherin told all of us Mackay councillors that the state government actually spent more in regional areas than it took out. What a joke, when you consider that, in the greater Mackay region alone, about $2 billion in coal royalties is exported from our ports every year. But now, hallelujah, Mr Mulherin is a political deathbed convert to royalties for the regions. Anna Bligh actually came to Mackay to announce a $300-million-a-year 'royalties for the regions' scheme, with Mr Mulherin nodding furiously for the cameras behind her. It is a political deathbed conversion to delivery through a 'royalties for the regions' scheme, but really it is just a promise that will never happen, because Labor will be removed from government this weekend. The big question in all of this is why three promises have not been delivered for Mackay by Mr Mulherin prior to the Bligh Labor government crawling into its political deathbed. After all, he has had 14 years in government to deliver these promises; instead, we get them before he goes into opposition or maybe retirement. Mr Mulherin claims he has delivered some things for Mackay, but what? A new hospital without any extra staff, so no extra bed capacity, paid for by flogging off the Mackay Airport, a successful state asset? Two bridges that should have been built five to 10 years ago, as evidenced by traffic congestion, with one of the bridges running into a flood-prone creek? A convention centre promised in 2001 that took a decade to build and now costs ratepayers $1 million a year to run? Are these seriously achievements of which Mr Mulherin can be proud? The problem that Mr Mulherin has is the same problem that Queensland Labor has: they have had 14 years to deliver and now, on their political deathbeds, they expect us to believe they are converts to the idea of delivering for Queenslanders and delivering for the Mackay region. Well, forget it. This Saturday, the voters will do them a favour. They will flick the switch off and put the Bligh Labor government out of its political misery. Holt Electorate: Neighbour Day",129
221,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to talk about a great event that will be held on Sunday, 25 March-that is, the 10th annual Neighbour Day. I would also like to talk about two remarkable people, Ruth Murray and Jenny Colvin, who are both champion neighbours in their local community of Doveton, in my electorate of Holt. Neighbour Day is the perfect opportunity for the neighbourhood to come together, for residents of all ages and these backgrounds, wherever we choose to call home, to come together as a neighbourhood, I guess for the common good. We all need to work together, I think we would acknowledge in this place, to rebuild our sense of community and to build a safer and a friendlier neighbourhood. We can all start by inviting the people next door and in our street to come on over on Neighbour Day. Neighbour Day was founded in Melbourne in March 2003 by Andrew Heslop. In May 2008, Andrew spoke at the United Nations in New York about the global development of Neighbour Day, which has grown from a simple idea expressed in a letter to the editor of the Age to become a national community event. Since 2003, there have been five principal aims which have shaped Neighbour Day: (1) to strengthen communities and build better relationships with the people who live around us; (2) to create safer, healthier and more vibrant suburbs and towns; (3) to promote tolerance, respect understanding; (4) to break down community barriers; and, (5), to protect the elderly, vulnerable and the disadvantaged. Two people who I believe embody the principal aims of Neighbour Day are Ruth and Jenny from Doveton. To promote Neighbour Day 2012, I attended a preNeighbour Day barbecue with 22 others at Ruth and Jenny's home last Friday. We held this event because we thought that coming together and firing up a barbecue in Doveton was a good way to celebrate and to promote Neighbour Day. At the barbecue, I was incredibly impressed by how Ruth and Jenny have converted their garage into a communal space, including tables and chairs, a coffee machine, TV, stereo and pool table and an incredible Olympic Games mural, which allows their neighbours to come and enjoy each other's company throughout the year. According to Jenny, the communal garage is used for a variety of events throughout the year, including the Christmas light-up party held on 1 December and for spontaneous events-like when it is a nice day. Ruth and Jenny have lived in the Doveton community since 1979 and, since then, Ruth has been committed to giving to others. In doing so, she has taught her daughter and her fellow friends and neighbours to do likewise. For over 13 years, Ruth and Jenny have run an annual Christmas barbecue for neighbours, local community members, family and old friends at their home in Doveton. Over 150 people are invited to the local barbecue, which coincides with their amazing Christmas lights display. Ruth started this Christmas lights display by simply putting up an angel on the front of her house. Once kids came to have a look, she started welding new objects in front of the house so that kids could come over and even climb on them if they wished. I have driven past the Christmas lights in Doveton on and numerous occasions prior to Christmas and they are an amazing sight. They are an the incredible experience where people can actually come in and fully experience Christmas. People come from everywhere to take photographs, to just be part of and sample the Christmas spirit and to look at the way things should be done. The Christmas lights display also includes a Mr and Mrs Claus, whom I happened to meet at this community barbecue. Mr and Mrs Claus are provided with the assistance of local residents Robert and Cheryl Rawnsley, who are able to distribute thousands of gifts, including books and games to children, which are provided by Pauline Forbes and Rhonda Wagner. Ruth and her family definitely symbolise the spirit of Neighbour Day. They have huge pride in their neighbourhood and a commitment to bringing people together to build a stronger sense of community. According to Jenny, 'The neighbours are the main reason for our success.' For example, when they asked their neighbours if they should have a pre-Neighbour Day barbecue, all these people turned up. The people who turned up were Autumn Place shopkeepers. For example, the butcher, the manager of Jeff's Meats, donated the snags for this event and the baker donated the bread-two local shops from Doveton, there just for this event. Ruth and Jenny's story is an incredible one. In 2000, Jenny and her husband, who sadly is no longer with us, had a band called Country Pride, which used to go round the community and raise funds for various organisations, including the Dandenong Hospital. Due to the large amount of money that was raised, Jenny became the No. 1 torchbearer for the City of Casey and ran in the name of the famous Australian Olympian and middle distance runner Edwin Flack. Ruth and Jenny's story in the Doveton area is just one Doveton story. I could keep going all night but I have 15 seconds so I will not. Let me say that they epitomise what it means to be neighbours and how to run a good Neighbour Day. They are to be commended and they really do summarise the spirit of what makes that community a great community. Bennelong Electorate: Constituency Matters",130
222,Mr ALEXANDER,ADJOURNMENT," The electorate of Bennelong is one of the most diverse electorates in Australia. Located in the demographic centre of Sydney, Bennelong includes a range of cultures, industries, great history and cutting edge new developments. It is a region synonymous with activism. I have met with thousands of politically engaged residents, some wholeheartedly supportive and others not so but all sharing a passion and commitment to our local community. Engagement with my community has led to action representing concerns on a broad range of issues. Bennelong has some of the most congested roads in the state, resulting from intense population growth and little transport infrastructure development during 16 years of state Labor government. In response, I have authored a comprehensive policy paper designed to alleviate the pressure on our nation's greatest city. The new Defence housing development in Ermington will see the suburb's population increase to 10,000 people, with many crowding onto Victoria Road, while the nearby Parramatta River glistens in picturesque tranquillity. So I have written to the state transport minister requesting an assessment of the need for a ferry terminal to help take thousands of cars off Victoria Road. Last week I met with Eastwood LAC Superintendent Peter Marcon to discuss reports of criminal activity. Next week we will be jointly facilitating a Bennelong community crime forum. Significant lobbying from constituents on the mistreatment of cattle in Indonesia has led me to develop an innovative policy response to promote sustainable and ethical slaughtering practices in that country. I have written to the agriculture minister to promote these ideas, which transcend partisan boundaries. Aircraft noise plagues thousands of Bennelong residents. I strongly oppose the recommendations in the Gillard government's Sydney aviation capacity report to increase the cap on hourly aircraft movements. Bennelong has benefited over the years from strong and vibrant democratic institutions. Issues and opinions deserve to be analysed and debated at all levels. I join many constituents in amazement at the actions of six local councillors who have continually refused to attend council meetings, denying a quorum to discuss important local matters and frustrating progress. As the federal MP, I may not always like the government's use of numbers to push through policy I do not agree with or the Speaker using his casting vote to support the government's agenda, as he did yesterday, but that is no excuse not to show up when it is your obligation to serve and represent your local community. These six councillors express concern that there has been insufficient public consultation on the development of the Ryde Civic Centre. I have chosen the positive and proactive step of writing to the General Manager of the City of Ryde to request that council consider facilitating a further public briefing to all members of the community a voice on this important issue. My constituents know that a healthy dose of political competition is a vital ingredient in pushing our representatives to deliver the best results for our community. Labor's track record of faceless men pulling the strings of power and imposing themselves on local communities has clearly been shown to be a cancer on our nation's democracy. Often a faceless powerbroker spends years in a political back office sniping at those who choose to stand up and lead, then expects a healthy pension to sit on the backbench and achieve very little. Local communities demand preselection processes that ensure the best candidate is chosen by the grassroots membership of the party and that ensure this honour is given to respected leaders, not to faceless political staffers or union comrades. The average voter may not have input in this process, but I have great faith that the wise, active and politically engaged people of Bennelong would not tolerate such an imposition. I derive great pleasure from the considerable amount of insightful and intelligent correspondence I receive from Bennelong constituents on a wide range of issues. I continue to be humbled by the responsibility given to me to represent the concerns of Bennelong residents in the highest offices of government, and I will keep fighting on all the issues I have highlighted today and on many more. Centenary of Canberra",132
223,Dr LEIGH,ADJOURNMENT," One hundred years ago Walter Burley Griffin said that he wanted to design a city for a nation of 'bold democrats'. On 12 March 2013 Canberra will celebrate its centenary, a celebration that all Australians can be proud of. Tonight I want give to speak about two exciting aspects of Canberra's centenary. The first is the opportunity to speak in greater depth about what our history means and where it has been going. It was my pleasure this evening to engage in one aspect of this-a forum hosted by the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects entitled 'Sex in the city' in which noted architecture writer Elizabeth Farrelly presented her views on gender and urban development. I would like to thank Paul Costigan; Diane Firth; my fellow commentator, Gary Rake, and many others for an important discussion about where a great Australian city is to go. Better understanding your own city is the first step towards improving it. The second aspect that Canberra's centenary will highlight is the importance of understanding our local communities. When I wrote a book on social capital-the community ties that bind us together-it turned out that Canberra was the place in Australia with the strongest social ties, and I think part of this harks back to our strong urban form. But there are still worrying trends. For example, from 2007 to 2010 the number of informal votes in my electorate rose from 2,679 to 5,171. That is more than 5,000 people whose votes did not affect the outcome of the election. It is important to re-engage Australians with our polity, and part of that will be through the Portrait of a Nation process. I am pleased to be the patron of Portrait of a Nation, which will involve Canberrans coming to better understand their suburbs. Canberra suburb and street naming is unique to the nation's capital. Most of the suburbs and streets are named after famous, sometimes forgotten, Australians. Portrait of a Nation will be a chance for Canberrans to delve deeply into the history of their suburb, whether that be holding a street party on the birthday of the person after whom their suburb is named or simply getting friends and family together for a street party. I have found that street parties are enormously valuable in improving the social bonds that tie us together. My wife, Gweneth, and I have held our street's party in three of six years. We have found it is a great way of getting to know our neighbours better and getting to know those who have moved into the street over the previous year. The Centenary of Canberra also involves many other important events. For the centenary the motto of the ever-energetic Robyn Archer is 'seed now, blossom in 2013, flower for another hundred years'. One of the events will be You Are Here, a 10-day curated festival showcasing the energy, innovation and talent from Canberra's thriving creative and independent scene. Dollars for Dili recognises the sister city relationship between Canberra and Dili and will focus on building the capacity and education of young people. It is based on the principle that it is better to give than to receive. There was an exhibition entitled 'Devotion, Daring and a Sense of Destiny', launched by Mr David Headon, which showcased the key role played by surveyors in the early history of Canberra. There are many other projects that are being discussed as part of Canberra's centenary. I know that you, Mr Speaker, have ideas as to how the quarter-centenary of this very building could be incorporated as part of the centenary of Canberra. It will be an exciting year for Canberrans and an exciting year for all Australians. I urge all Australians to be part of this tremendously important celebration of our nation's capital. Re-Engineering Australia Foundation",133
224,Mr RUDDOCK,ADJOURNMENT," I commend my colleague for his speech about Canberra, as it is my birthplace. He might like to note that I have an interest in the subject matter. I hope he may be equally interested in the matters about which I am going to speak: an organisation with which I have had a long association and which I wish to bring to the attention of members. It is a the last not-for-profit organisation named Reengineering Australia Foundation, REA. A group of visionary companies, organisations, some government departments, educators and individuals established the organisation to address what they believe is a key failing in relation to education: the number of students not studying in the engineering and manufacturing sectors. They wanted to come together to encourage more to participate. Companies and government organisations, like the Defence Materiel Organisation, Cisco WebEx, and education and training departments from Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania all belong to REA. The sorts of skills that they are interested in are the backbone of our modern economy and industry. They saw those skills as being in decline and they formed to target students at all levels, from primary school right through until university, to encourage them to commence and maintain study in these vital fields. I was privileged to share an office building in Pennant Hills with REA. I came to know them quite well. They run the Fl in Schools Technology Challenge, the largest student program of its type in the world. It involves something in the order of nine million students in 31 nations and 17,000 high schools. They hold national finals. They had an event here in Parliament House, in the Great Hall, some years ago. This year the national final, the Grand Prix as it is called, was held in Adelaide. I am sure they were glad to get it back. That was on 7 March. My colleague Senator Bernardi was lucky enough to attend that occasion. To enter the competition, students form a team like a Formula 1 team. They have a manager, a design engineer, and marketing and procurement activities. They come together as a small group, supported and encouraged by their teachers, to learn for themselves and develop a model Formula 1 car. To do this they apply industry standard techniques and technology, using computer aided design, manufacturing and engineering software, and virtual and real wind tunnelsthe sorts of skills normally not taught until second and third years of university. While they are doing this they learn all sorts of skills: aerodynamics, computational fluid dynamics, and drag and finite element analysis. They learn it in an enjoyable environment, spurred on by the challenge of competition, and develop an interest in engineering, technology and manufacturing for years to come. The cars are machined from balsa blocks, but other materials can be used. They are powered by a CO2 gas canister. The sorts of rules, detailed and technical, that apply in Formula 1 apply here as well. The cars reach speeds of over 80 kilometres per hour. The finals, held in Adelaide on 7 March, saw 26 teams from schools all over Australia compete. They were lucky enough to tour the Australian Submarine Corporation precinct at Osborne and visited the corporate box of Cummins Australia at the Clipsal 500. I think they get better experiences for technologically inclined young people. But the main event was of course the competition. The winning team was the home team from Brighton Secondary School in Adelaide, the first time a team from South Australia has won. The team, called Cold Fusion, scored most points across the 11 categories upon which the teams were judged, beating 25 other teams from across Australia to qualify for the world finals, which will be held later this year. The winner for the development class was the Engadine High School team, named Rapid Racing. They picked up four awards, including best innovation, best team marketing and the Cisco Webex Outstanding Industry Collaboration award. The chief judge was Dr Warren Smith of the Australian Defence Force Academy. Other judges came from engineering companies and institutions. Many organisations were involved. Apart from the outstanding work of all the teams that competed, this program is one that is of enormous value. Re-Engineering Australia Foundation is undertaking an outstanding job for Australia. I congratulate the teams and I congratulate Dr Michael Myers, the founder and CEO of the foundation, for REA's continuing success. (Time expired) Animal Welfare",134
225,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT," The new supply-chain-assurance conditions imposed on Australia's live export trade in response to the cruel treatment of Australian animals in overseas markets would be applauded by most Australians. Of course, there is much more to do, but the conditions are an important step in the right direction and, hopefully, will also lead to changes in international animal handling standards. It is notable that the conditions were imposed once the cruelty was exposed on television, yet many within the industry were very likely aware of the cruelty, but chose to ignore it. Since the film footage aired by the Four Corners program, there have been other revelations of animal cruelty, including in abattoirs in Australia. Within Australia authorities at least can take appropriate action, because standards are prescribed and prosecution is an option under the states' animal welfare legislation. Abattoir standards are, however, the last step in the process. Breeding and transportation of animals can also cause considerable distress and suffering to them. For some time now concerns have been raised about the intense breeding of chickens and pigs in countries around the world, including in Australia. Those animals are bred in tightly confined spaces and under conditions that would obviously cause immense suffering. Nor is it limited to pigs and chickens. I understand that some puppy farms are no better. Yet they continue to breed in those conditions because they are out of sight and therefore out of mind, for most people. Confining battery hens to a floor space the size of an A4 piece of paper, preventing them from even stretching their wings, in unclean cages with dead birds around them should be outlawed. I recently spoke with a person who has worked in that industry. He told me that he left the industry appalled at what he had seen and experienced. How any regulatory authority in Australia can condone such practice beggars belief. Interestingly, you kept a pet in similar conditions you would be prosecuted. It is likewise for pig sows being confined in steel and concrete pens about two metres long by 60 centimetres wide for most of their breeding lives. It must be incredibly torturous. The furrowing crates where the sows then give birth are even worse. These are intelligent creatures made to suffer just so that growers can minimise their breeding costs. The growers will say of course that the sows are better off in the pens and that they are well cared for. Consumers may also benefit from these practices, because they buy cheaper meat or eggs. But I firmly believe that the food quality is also much inferior to that of animals kept in better conditions. To change international standards is understandably difficult, but there is no excuse for allowing unacceptable practices to continue in Australia. Furthermore, our efforts to change international standards will not be credible whilst we continue with cruel treatment in our own country. Animal welfare standards are set and meant to be policed by state governments. In reality the standards are set by the industry. The industry sectors inevitably commission and substantially fund the research and reports that underpin the standards and animal welfare policies more broadly. There is very little non-industry research available and, indeed, researchers have limited access to the commercial breeding facilities. To compound matters, the existing cumbersome processes relating to animal welfare regulations can take years to work through before the changes can be made. It is indeed encouraging to see that European standards are changing and that many past practices of animal breeding will no longer be acceptable. It is also encouraging to see if some Australian food retailers taking a stand and refusing to market products that originate from unacceptable breeding farms. I note that the Australian pork industry, after years of denying that sow stalls were cruel, has announced a voluntary phasing out of sow stalls by 2017. I welcome the change of direction. However, 2017 is still years away, and in light of the track record of animal industry bodies to date I treat with caution promises of industry self-regulation. It seems that, to date, industry self-regulation has primarily served to protect bad practice from prosecution. That is why we need an independent office of animal welfare, an independent office that has no conflict of interest and no self-interest and that can set appropriate animal welfare standards for all animals in relation to breeding, transport and slaughter processes. In the interim, I call on the state governments around the country-who currently, through the Primary Industries Ministerial Council, have the power to set improved animal welfare standards-to do so and thereby end the unnecessary suffering of millions of animals each year in this country. Mental Health",135
226,Mr VASTA,ADJOURNMENT," I rise this evening to bring to the House's attention a very important issue in the electorate of Bonner and indeed the wider Australian community, and that is the issue of mental health. Talking with my Bonner constituents when I am out and about in the electorate I have observed a very definite trend emerging. Increasingly my constituents are concerned about mental health and the impact it has not only on their own lives but also on the lives of their families and friends. Almost half the nation's population-45 per cent-will experience a mental health disorder at some point in their lives. That is one in every two people. One of the big problems facing mental health treatment in Australia is that so often mental health is categorised too simply as a condition in and of itself. In talking to several interest in my electorate it has become clear this oversimplification hides the true complexity surrounding the issue. Another significant challenge that faces these local mental health oriented community groups in Bonner is that of funding. I have been told again and again about the enormous struggle these smaller groups face in accessing funding that will enable them to grow and continue to operate at a grassroots level, with the help of hard working volunteers. I have observed that, far from having the large-scale funding grants available to larger established organisations, smaller groups and support networks can have a significant community impact with limited funding. The difference this can make in the lives of those experiencing mental health problems is truly amazing. But without this assistance sufferers can be left frustrated and alone in their struggle. I have frequently witnessed the emotion of those battling mental health issues and their pleas for better infrastructure and resources that would make the ultimate difference in their lives and the lives of others. Recent studies have found that one in five people will experience some form of mental illness in any given year. Yet only one-third of sufferers receive help from health services. A staggering 65 per cent of sufferers battle their disorder alone or with only family assistance. So what can be done to assist those groups in their operations? What strategies will better assist the smaller organisations at a grassroots level to overcome the increasing challenges facing the community in relation to mental health? Mental health care is at a critical juncture. Genuine reform and real action are needed to provide improved access to care, better long term outcomes for patients and more efficient use of resources. As health minister groups in the Howard coalition government, Tony Abbott oversaw the biggest single injection of funding into mental health services.",137
227,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member ought to refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his title.,137
228,Mr VASTA,ADJOURNMENT,"The Leader of the Opposition-yes, Mr Speaker. There was $1.9 billion provided in 2006 for the following five years. The time to tackle mental illness is when it first occurs. The prevalence of mental health problems declines with age. It is our younger Australians-those between 16 and 24-who bear the brunt of mental illness. Evidence shows that with early and targeted treatment many young people can overcome their problems and lead socially and economically productive lives with a lower incidence of progression or relapse. Delay in accessing appropriate treatment can be damaging for a young person, particularly during adolescence. Maturity can be delayed, social and family relationships can be strained and employment prospects can be derailed. Secondary problems such as substance abuse, unemployment and behavioural problems may develop or intensify and the illness itself may become more deeply entrenched. That is why it is so critical that volunteers on the ground have access to adequate support in order to achieve their local operational goals. The coalition's Real Action Plan for Better Mental Health includes those support structures vital to achieving local and nationwide objectives. Twenty early psychosis intervention centres, 800 mental health beds and 60 additional youth headspace sites across the country will assist those already founded networks in accessing quality mental health services. The coalition's Direct Action Plan for Better Mental Health is fully funded and builds on existing mental health funding provided in the previous budget. The coalition will also redirect funding away from new bureaucratic structures, proposed by Labor, to provide additional funding directly to front-line mental health services. These are important steps that need to be taken in order to achieve real impacting change to Australia's mental health system. Chifley Electorate: Rooty Hill RSL Youth Swimming Club Women's Basketball",138
229,Mr HUSIC,ADJOURNMENT," Tonight I am delighted to acknowledge in this place the kids of the Rooty Hill RSL Youth Swimming Club and their impressive accomplishments recently at the New South Wales RSL State Youth Championships in Ulladulla, New South Wales. The Rooty Hill RSL Youth Club has been part of our community for 45 years and works hard to provide our youth sporting groups with the opportunity to compete. These local organisations and sporting groups help bring together our communities and teach our kids the important life skills of teamwork, dedication and the value of persistence. This year, the Rooty Hill RSL Youth Swimming Club was able to send a total of 22 swimmers, competing in 26 events, to the New South Wales RSL State Youth Championships. They came away with 28 places, including eight gold medals and eight silver medals. It is an outstanding reward for their hard work and perseverance. Many of these kids competed in multiple events over the course of the day and were watched by over 2,000 competitors and spectators. I want to personally congratulate Stephanie Batchelor, Tully Fletcher, Samuel Fletcher, Elizabeth Fletcher, Nicole Portelli, Monique Portelli, Alana Kerri Broomham, Taylah Lee, Caitlin Thick, Sharray Brown, Jeremy D'Souza, Brendan D'Souza, Emma Harvey, Justin Munzer and Georgia Lee for tremendous performances. These swimmers put in countless hours practising and training, but I would also like to congratulate and commend their parents and coaches for the continuous support and dedication they show these kids each and every day. It is also worth paying special tribute to President Anthony Portelli and all the members of the club executive for their leadership and commitment to this special organisation. I am very proud of these kids who make up the Rooty Hill RSL Youth Swimming Club and I am happy we were able to help support them in their efforts to attend titles. Congratulations on a job well done. While on the subject of young people excelling and doing our community proud, I want to make mention of another group of athletes deserving of special mention in this place. Last month, at the invitation of the Australian Institute of Sport and of Basketball Australia, I had the great pleasure of attending the AIS women's basketball 2011 graduation ceremony. The work of the AIS in developing fantastic basketballers is recognised internationally. The AIS takes the view that its program transforms promising junior players into mature senior athletes with the mental, physical and tactical skills needed to perform with distinction-and humility-on the world stage. The program also promotes their academic progress, employment opportunities, welfare and personal growth. For years, AIS women's basketball teams have been internationally competitive, securing multiple titles worldwide. For example, the Australian women's youth division, the Gems, finished in the top four the 2011 FIBA Under 19 World Championships. The graduating athletes are Rebecca Cole, guard, from Mt Waverley, Victoria; Rebecca Allen, guard/forward, from Wangaratta, Victoria; Madeleine Garrick, another guard/forward, from Shepparton, Victoria; Sarah Blicavs, guard/forward, from Sunbury, Victoria; Olivia Thompson, forward, from Balaklava, South Australia; Rosie Fadljevic, forward, from Melbourne, Victoria; Alex Bunton, centre, originally from the UK and now from the ACT; and Tessa Lavey, guard, from Swan Hill, Victoria. I will be posting more details about these talented players on my website, with this speech. The Australian government contributes close to $6 million in annual funding to support the development of the sport from the grassroots to the elite level. This includes an extra $1 million per year in highperformance funding. It is money well invested in developing the potential of young talent. The demands and pressures placed on these young players performing at this level cannot be underestimated. They are shining examples of what can be achieved and they follow in the footsteps of those who have stood out in years past: players such as Lauren Jackson and Penny Taylor. A lot of us look forward to seeing the 2011graduates progress and make our country proud. They do so under the care, guidance and occasional tough love of head coach Phil Brown and assistant coach Kristy Flores. It is important to recognise that these players get there because of the sacrifice and support they receive, particularly from their family. I think that special ingredient also needs to receive special attention tonight. Congratulations to all of them. Aston Electorate: Public Transport",138
230,Mr TUDGE,ADJOURNMENT," Whenever I at do surveys of my electorate, transport issues of one form or another inevitably come out as one of the top issues of concern to local residents. Only around six per cent of local residents travel to work using the heavy rail network or other public transport. The vast majority of the rest are sole-occupant drivers. I would like to update the House on three matters that local residents have expressed as concerns. The first concern is the Rowville rail proposal. I have been fighting for this proposal for some time, and it has been on the agenda for many years. The Baillieu government commissioned a full $2 million feasibility study into this proposal. This study was promised by the former Bracks government but never delivered. The Baillieu government has finally delivered on this. We are halfway through this study, the first report of which was released earlier month. The report finds that a Rowville rail link would connect Rowville to Huntingdale station, then connect to the Dandenong line and then into the city. Indeed, there is already some land set aside for that along Wellington Road. This first report outlines a number of challenges, which include the current congestion of the Dandenong line, to which the Rowville line would connect. The report also outlines some of the challenges associated with congestion on the inner-city loop and elsewhere that needs to be addressed. Despite these challenges the report recommends that the study and the analysis continue. We look forward to the final report of this feasibility study being brought down early next year, at which time there will be a full assessment of the economic benefits as well as the full costs associated with it. We envisage that the link will cost at least $1 billion, if not more, to build. Should the cost-benefit analysis prove it to be a beneficial project I will be pushing very hard to ensure that state and federal governments contribute to the project, because it immense benefits. Of course, it would have a benefit for my local residents, who would finally have a rail link into the city. The second benefit would be that it would remove traffic from the heavily congested Monash Freeway. Some of the early scoping studies suggest it would remove the equivalent of a lane of traffic from the freeway. Thirdly, it would connect Australia's largest university campus to the rail network. These are three very important benefits that will be quantified in the second stage of this feasibility study. The second issue I would like to raise is the Stud Road bus lane. One section of that has already been removed, which is something I had been advocating for. The second section of Stud Road that is this dangerous and needs to be looked at is the section between Burwood Highway and Boronia Road. It is particularly dangerous because there are a very short sections, which sometimes are only a couple of hundred metres long. That means that cars are going in and out. This needs to be examined; I encourage VicRoads to do that and provide a safe solution. Finally, in relation to the road network, there are a number of hot spots around my electorate that local residents would like improved. One particular one that was raised with me by residents of the Waverley Country Club Retirement Village just last Friday is along Bergins Road. There is no right-hand-turn lane for these residents to turn from. They are concerned that when they try to turn right into their retirement village traffic banks up behind them and there could be accidents. I would like to see that right-hand-turn lane installed. I have requested that the council have a look at that with a view to then prioritising it in future budgets, because I think it would remove the dangers and make it easier for people to has three access the Waverley Country Club retirement village. Those are three important projects. I am glad to have been able to update the House on them this evening. Bowel Cancer",139
231,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT," Today I would like to support the Cancer Council's campaign which advocates for the expansion of the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program to include mandatory testing every two years for those aged 50 and over and for this to be made available in the 2012-13 budget. Bowel cancer imposes the greatest economic burden on our health system of any cancer, with estimates that bowel cancer treatment expenditure is around $l billion a year, most of it in hospital and pharmaceutical costs. Bowel cancer also kills around 4,000 Australians every year. That is more than any other cancer apart from lung cancer. It is a cancer that is prevalent throughout the community and one whose early detection is critical for survival. It is one of those cancers that can be treated if diagnosed in the very early stages. In my time here I have supported efforts to raise awareness and, indeed, to secure funding from government for screening and preventative programs for a number of cancers. I have been particularly active on breast cancer and ovarian cancer. In fact, my very first private member's motion in this place, in 2002, was to call for breast prostheses for women who have had mastectomies following breast cancer to be rebated under Medicare. At the time. I was shocked to learn that women were resorting to padding filled with birdseed as an alternative because they could not afford the expense of a breast prosthesis. To illustrate my point, I brought a breast prosthesis into the chamber. The member for Scullin was in the chair, and I well recall his reaction to prop, but he allowed me the opportunity to make my point. The public reaction to the news that women used birdseed in their bras-which later became the basis of the campaign they waged to secure a rebate from Medicare-or were even given re-used breast prostheses from women who had passed away was such that the then shadow minister for health, the honourable Stephen Smith, promised to fund a nationally dedicated program for breast prostheses. Labor implemented that program when we came into government in 2007. I stand here again this evening to raise awareness about bowel cancer and the need for early detection. Despite all efforts to broaden awareness, it remains one of the least talked about cancers, especially amongst non-English-speaking communities. The test to detect this type of cancer is very simple. The National Bowel Cancer Screening Program involves the provision of a kit known as the faecal occult blood kit, which allows individuals to test for early signs of cancer in their stools in the privacy of their own homes. At the moment the kit, which all Australians receive upon turning 50-I myself have received one of these-receives only a 38 per cent return. And yet it has the capacity to prevent up to a third of bowel cancer deaths in the screening populationthe over-50s. It is a very easy-to-use kit. I will not pull it totally apart but, for the benefit of the House, I will say that it has a number of little instruments in it and directions which allow people to self-test and then to send the kit away for examination. When I turned 50 I used that year to speak to my electorate and inform them that upon turning 50 the Australian government sends you a birthday present. That birthday present is this bowel cancer screening kit. Everyone who receives it should take the opportunity this to complete it because it could save their lives. The introduction of a national screening program to detect bowel cancer in people without symptoms was a 2004 election commitment from both Labor and the coalition. Seven-and-a-half years later, the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program remains restricted to a one-off test for people turning 50, 55 and 65 rather than a test every two years for everyone aged 50 and over as recommended by the government's own National Health and Medical Research Council. This evening I want to encourage the government to pick up this very important issue and to make funding available for screening for bowel cancer for all Australians over the age of 50.",141
