1,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"There is, in this morning's issue of the Argus, a paragraph to the effect that information has been received by the Prime Minister that the Acting Adminh istrator of Papua., Judge Murray, has suspended the Surveyor-General, Mr Drummond. I should like the Prime Minister to state whether that' information has been received by him, and upon what ground the Acting Surveyor-General has beein suspended? ;",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Perhaps the best answer would be to lay the papers on 'the table. The Surveyor-General has been suspended, not by a personal act of the Acting Administrator, out by resolution of the Executive Council. In laying the - papers on the table, let me add'that the suspension relates to the land transactions of officers. As previously mentioned, so soon as we heard of those transactions, and before any direct charges had been made, I addressed to the Acting Administrator a. strongly-worded memorandum setting forth the only conditions on which officers should be allowed to have dealings in land. - Mr KELLY - Was the Prime Minister aware of this when the Estimates relating to Papua were under the consideration of the Committee?",14
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes , I had just received information.",14
4,Mr KELLY,Unknown,When the Estimates were under consideration honourable members were happy in the belief that the administration of Papua was running smoothly -.,14
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I was asked a direct question on the subject, and replied that the contrary was the case. Mr KE LL Y - Then , I misapprehended the honourable gentleman. In future cases of a similar nature will the. Prime Minister give the House information at the earliest possible moment, instead of waiting for the activities of the press to enlighten honourable members? ",14
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have not waited for the activities of the. press to enlighten honourable members on this subject. The papers were submitted to me on the very day that the Estimates relating to Papua were before the Committee, and, in reply to a 10.30 question, I then stated that I was sorry to say that affair's in Papua were not running smoothly; that charges had been made against! officers, and that a charge, for which, apparently, there was no - primd facie justification, had been laid against the Acting Administrator. vFollowing up that statement, I said more than once, in answer to questions, in the course of the debate, that I thought the. Committee might take it for' granted that the present Acting Chief Surveyor would not be continued in that office. That was as clear an intimation as possible.",14
7,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I regret that I did not hear it.,14
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As a matter of fact I brought to' the House the papers which I had dealt wijtb -- that afternoons and should have laid them on the table had the discussion taken a more direct turn, or had any honourable member asked for information. I am not satisfied with the recommendations made in this connection, and, consequently, as regards penalties, at all events, the case is still sub judice. I did not wish, unless asked to do so, to intervene By laying before the Committee the propositions submitted to me, since they could not be dealt with for at least six weeks or two month's, the time that must necessarily elapse before a reply can come from Papua.",14
9,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Then , there is much turmoil in Papua?",14
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I expressly mentioned, that fact, but did not wish to plunge the Committee into the incomplete inquiry at the time, since ' certain recommendations had been questioned by me.",14
11,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"H a v in g regard to the unsatisfactory condition of affairs in Papua, does not the Prime Minister think that it would be advisable to appoint an Administrator without delay, and to vest him will full power?",14
12,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We already have an Acting Administrator. The honourable member has evidently in mind an independent appointment. I do not think it desirable to make such an appointment until the issues raised by these charges and counter-charges are-cleared'up. STATES DEBTS. NA,14
13,Mr MCDONALD,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"In view of the reported partial failure of the recent New South Wales loan, will the Government introduce without delay a Bill to consolidate the States debts, and thus save other States from a similar experience?",15
14,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,I do not that the Commonwealth would be able to obtain better terms.,15
15,Mr DEAKIN,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"I am satisfied, on the authority of the directors of the Bank of England, and the advice of leading financial experts in Great Britain, that the Commonwealth could secure much better terms. I should not venture to offer my own opinion on the subject as having special weight. When in London recently I found no two opinions with reference to it. financier consulted stated that if the Commonwealth appeared in London as the only Australian borrower, the immediate result would be an' appreciation of Australian securities.",15
16,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"When the Prime Minister expresses the opinion that in attempting to float a loan on the London market the Commonwealth would meet with a much better reception than would the eldest State of the Union, has he in mind the report made two years ago by Mr. Coghlan, in which, after commenting upon - the f all of Australian stocks from ^ 9 9 to Â£ 8 7 since Federation, he said that, having consulted the Stock Exchange, he found the objection to Australian loans was due not to the prospects of the country but to the class of legislation being passed by the Commonwealth Parliament ?",15
17,Mr DEAKIN,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"I did not remember that statement, but that by no means implies""'Shat""Something of the sort may not occur in'"" Mr Coghlan's memorandum. Even if that opinion 'Was expressed, I am happy to' Rave bean convinced on the spot that there has since been a steady improvement in the standing of Australia. I made no reference to the loans of any particular State. a direct question in regard to the flota-' tion of a loan by one of the States, I deliberately replied in the most general terms. I merely expressed the opinion that Commonwealth loans on the London market would meet with a better reception than those of any State, particularly if Australia had only one borrower, and gave my authority for that view. I by no means reflected on the opinions expressed two years ago by Mr Coghlan. If it is not LOAN. irrelevant, I may mention, as further i l lustrating the' necessity and value of placing the public of Great Britain in possession of fuller information upon the affairs of the Commonwealth, that one of the largest firms",15
18,Mr SPEAKER,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,I am afraid that the know honourable gentleman is now proceeding to debate the question.,15
19,Mr DEAKIN,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"The information I am about to give affects the prospects of future flotations of loans. One of the largest firms of brokers in London informed me, without my seeking the information-hav ing called on me in regard to other matters - that immediately after the recent Conference in London, their business in Australian securities increased fivefold. In Every quiries were so numerous that they were sending one of their partners to Australia to obtain more information to enable them to assist their clients by advice respecting Australian investments. I merely point the moral that as we are better known, and better understood, our securities improve, and will continue to improve,- on the London market. POST ANDTELEGRAPH DEPARTMENT. SECRETARY TO CABINET COMMITTEE. Mr - WEBSTER - Does the Postmaster'General think that, having reg'ard to its disorganized state, he is justified in withdrawing from the New South Wales branch, of the Department one of its ablest officers, Mr Bramble, to act as secretary to the .Cabinet Committee? To my mind, Mr. Bramble is the king-pin of his branch in New South Wales, and it is a mistake to take him away from his work when a less responsible officer could discharge the duties of secretary to the Cabinet Committee. '",15
20,Mr MAUGER,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"In the circumstances, I think I am full y justified, and if proof of that justification were wanting it would Being asked be found in the facts which the honourable member has mentioned. SALE OF IMPURE FOODS. Mr MALONEY. - Has the Prime Minister read a sub-leader in today's Age, which shows clearly that poisonous foods are being exposed for sale in Victoria? I put this question to him in view of the necessity of the Government endeavouring to preserve the lives of the people already here, as well as seeking to induce immigration to Australia. W i ll the Prime Minister endeavour to induce the States to put down with a strong hand the .sale of impure foods?",15
21,Mr DEAKIN,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"I understand that there is a stringent Pure Foods Act in Victoria, and that its administration has led to the discoveries referred to. So far as the Commerce Act permits us to deal with imports, every precaution is being taken to protect the public. I quite agree with the honourable member that such a safeguard is absolutely essential. IMMIGRATION. LAND FOR SETTLEMENT. Mr THOM AS BROWN - In view of the debate on the question of immigration which has taken place in connection with the Estimates,- I wish to know whether the Prime Minister has had his attention called to a telegram published in the press that yesterday at the Wagga land office, 249 applications were lodged for one block of 630 acres on a conditional lease, at a rental of is. 6d. per acre, and whether he considers it discloses a condition of affairs that should induce us to invite the immigration of a class that is desirous of settling on the land ? - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Were all the applicants landless?",16
22,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"Yes , nearly all of them.",16
23,Mr DEAKIN,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"I had noticed the telegram. I am noting and recording such information in regard to all the States, because it is material to questions which will be raised presently; but which are not matters for direct consideration by this Parliament at this moment. . Mr KELLY - F o l l o w in g the question put by the honourable member for Calare, I desire to know whether the Prime Minister has read a cablegram in this morning's  of South Australia, in a speech delivered at Bristol, said that there was plenty of land available on easy terms in South Australia, and that there was room there for millions of people.",16
24,Mr DEAKIN,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,I also noted that telegram with great satisfaction. DRY FARMING . ..,16
25,Mr HEDGES,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"Is the Prime Minister aware that Mr Strawbridge, the Surveyor General of South Australia, has lately [346] visited America to inquire into the Campbell system of farming,- which is reported to be suitable for the cultivation of land in dry areas, and will the honourable gentleman communicate with the South Australian Government with a view, if possible, of having the report circulated throughout the Commonwealth?",16
26,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,The Victorian Government have already received a report on the subject from Senator MCColl.,16
27,Mr DEAKIN,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"As I am reminded h'v the honourable member for Wide Bay, the Victorian Government obtained a report from Senator MCColl, giving the result of that gentleman's recent visit to America. The South Australian Government have had a n of f i c e r l at e l y re p o r t in g on the same subject.",16
28,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,Senato r MCColl's report was made some time ago.,16
29,Mr DEAKIN,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"Yes , and the report referred to by the honourable.member for Fremantle is recent; America is a progressive country in agriculture as well as in everything else. I agree with the honourable member that such information cannot be too widely circulated. ' One of the best, methods of obtaining publicity is to call the attention of the press to the matter, when I have no doubt the report,.will be reproduced. NORTHAMPOST - OFFIC E. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - I desire to ask' the Prime Minister whether he has had inquiries made as to the delay in commencing work .at the Northam post-office ?",16
30,Mr DEAKIN,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"I find that there has been a misunderstanding of my previous reply. Being asked, without notice, if I knew of this case, I mentioned that I.had known public works delayed in c --tain States owing to pressure. I did not know the Northam case, and - tile statement. I made did not refer to that post-office. In quiry shows that there has been no such delay in the case of the Northam post-office, The plans have been returned to the Department of Home Affairs, and it is some question in regard to the nature of the work that has caused the delay,",16
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,Is there likely to be any further delay?,16
32,Mr DEAKIN,NEW SOUTH WAL ES,"I shall ascertain the v .exact facts. NA AUSTRALIA,",16
33,Mr KING OMALLEY,SETTLERS IN WESTERN,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister if he will ascertain whether the Victorian Government have decided to repatriate - from Western Australia ioo families reported to be stranded there. I may say that I am asking this question in consequence of a telegram which I have received from Tasmania. I am informed that the Western Australia lecturer has unsettled several families in Tasmania, and I desire to know whether there is any truth in the report that there are ioo Victorian families in Western Australia who desire to return to their own State?",16
34,Mr DEAKIN,SETTLERS IN WESTERN,"I have to inform myself on many matters in order to satisfy honourable members. My last information on this question was an indignant reply from the Premier of Western Australia, pointing out that no Victorians who were desirable settlers had been "" stranded "" in that State, that there was ample opportunity to obtain land, and that he was making arrangements in regard to employment. I believe that the Premier of Victoria stated to the newspapers that, under the circumstances, he intended to take no action in the matter. NA DEPARTMENT . "" Loss OF ARTICLES POSTED AT EAGLEHAWK - INQUIRY FEE - CANCELLED MAIL CONTRACT : GUARANTEE. . Sir JOHN QUICK asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. What action has been taken to investigate the complaints made by Mr Hay Kirkwood as to letters containing cheques, postal notes, and valuables posted at Eaglehawk not reaching their intended destination? 2. Is there any prospect of confidence in the office' being restored by the offenders being discovered and punished? 3. What check and supervision of officials exist in the Eaglehawk office? 4-. In cases of complaints of loss of letters - or property in the past, would it not be sufficient to require aggrieved' persons to sign written pajrticulaTS, in prescribed form, without demanding an inquiry fee of 2.Â£d., which seems like adding insult to injury?",17
35,Mr MAUGER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The answers to A e honourable member's questions are as f o l low1. The complaint of Mr Hay Kirkwood that letters, & c , posted at Eaglehawlc do not reach their destination has been referred to the departmental detectives, who :are inquiring into the matter. 2. Every effort will be made to discover the offenders, and, if successful, .the 'guilty officers will be prosecuted. 3. The staff of the Eaglehawk post-office is under the control and supervision of the Postmistress, and the office is inspected periodically by the District Inspector. 4. As senders who have safeguarded their correspondence by registration are 'required by Universal Regulations to' pay a fee of 2^d. before inquiry is made with respect to alleged missing articles, it is considered reasonable to require the same fee from those who have not ta'ken any precaution, although in - many instances thei'r letters, & c , are said to have"" contained valuable articles. No fee is required when inquiries are made by addressees. In all instances in which the fault lies with the Department. the fee is returned to the sender.",17
36,Mr BAMFORD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"the Postmaster- General, upon notice What is the exact cost to the Commonwealth in actual cash, of the failure of James Laing and Co. to carry out their contract for the carriage of the Commonwealth mails?",17
37,Mr MAUGER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"In view of the fact that this matter is now the subject of legal proceedings, it is not considered advisable to make any statement on the subject at present. PAPUAN DEATH RATE.",17
38,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether the recommendation of Dr Jones, given in his evidence before the Royal Commission on Papua, has been given effect to, namely, that a medical' man with tropical experience be sent to the Northern Division for a sufficient length of time "" to determine what the cause of this alarming death rate is "" ?",17
39,Mr DEAKIN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsYes. Dr Beaumont, the chief medical officer, visited the Northern Division and inquired specially into this matter; and since then Dr Strong has been appointed to a post in - the Division. < FEDERAL CAPITAL SITE.",17

Capacity of small arms factory is estimated at 45,000 per annum, working one shift. Under full pressure a n,umber approaching 135,000 probably could be turned out annually. The Government believe that there will be full work for all time for factory working normally. [346]- 2 3 and 4. The question was submitted to Parliament merely as a business proposition.

There are a number of other matters to which I might refer, as, for example, the question of contingent voting, and that of the second ballot. These are matters upon which great difference of opinion exists, but which are of great public concern. Upon public platforms Ministers have repeatedly acknowledged the necessity for amending the Act. Some have suggested the adoption of the system of contingent voting, and others that of the second ballot.

The defects of the electoral law lie greatly in its administration, though my personal observation leads me to believe that the Chief Electoral Officer and his staff are doing what they can to remove difficulties. I have a suggestion to' make, which, so far as Victoria is concerned, at any rate, I think will prove valuable. At present, separate rolls are made up for many small districts, .whereas the names of the electors residing in them could very well all be put on the one This would make it unnecessary to use absent voting provisions. Any name appears on the rolls for that group should be permitted to vote any of the polling places within the group. If that course were adopted, many of the difficulties which the electors now experience would be obviated, and the returning officers upon the day of election would relieved of a good deal, of clerical work ""in connection with the "" Q "" and other forms. I wish now to refer' briefly to the of the Electoral law. Whilst I make no complaint so far as the Justices the High Court are concerned, I believe that it was the intention of the Parliament that the Court of Disputed Returns should not have regard to mere technical objections It is in dealing with a petition; that no honourable member s'hould be unseated on a mere technicality. I have no hesitation in saying, however, that in my own case, and, I believe, to a certain extent in other cases, to be the decisions of the Court have been largely, if not wholly, based upon techniI f it is the intention of Parliament that cases shall be determined according to equity and good, conscience rather than upon mere technicalities, I think we should take care to have that intention explicitly declared, so that it will beimpossible for a mistake to be made. There are other direcin which improvements might well be carried out. It is well known that many officers selected by returning officers' make serious blunders in the discharge of their official duties. In the Echuca electorate, in in connection with the 'first election at which I was returned, some of the most explicitinstructions by the Department were dis- regarded. It is monstrous that the Crown as well as candidates should be put to regreat expense as .the result of such mis(takes, whilst those responsible for them go free. Those officers, receive emoluments, and, as servants of the Crown, should called upon to .bear some portion of cost incurred by the Government as the result of their blunders. I put these siderations before the Committee with some diffidence, but, as one who has sufspeaking, fered, feel that I am justified in doing The fundamental principle of the Constiscarcely tution is that every adult shall be to exercise the franchise, and any violation land. of that principle should be rectified at earliest moment.",22

Having regard to the confusion which had previously arisen, one may assume that the last elecexistence. tion for the electorate of Echuca was ducted on strictly legal lines. As I said on that occasion, the returns for every one of the booths polling more than 100 votes were separately announced.

In my constituency no polling booth is further, in some disthan a quarter of a mile from the most distant elector; and yet postal votes were exercised at the general election to large number of 1,095. But the report votof the Divisional Returning Officer shows at the by-election which followed, the in number of postal votes was much smaller; the and the reason was that the officers of the it Electoral Department were pn the keen hold' watch, and, therefore, tflie same system of bribery and corruption could not be carried on ' out. as was proved in the High Court to have been carried out at the general election. Honorjable members will be prised to hear that there were more postal votes exercised in Melbourne at the general election before the last than there were the whole of WesternAustralia, or, it may have been, Soutih Australia. And in district of the Melbourne electorate which is the most thickly populated, and where no polling booth is more than a quarter a mile from any elector, there were more postal votes than in all the rest of the constituency. Those who believe in the remarks. secrecy of the ballot, in the exercise of the freest franchise in the world, must give this matter their serious attention. If .postal votes or absent votes are to ercised it must' be under such conditions ihat the papers should be free from the observation of the electors' employers, other interested persons.

122,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"South Australia) I [12.18] - I think that this is a fitting opto discuss the administration of' life, the Public Service Commissioner. I should in reoccupy a considerable time were I to discuss in detail the many matters in regard is unto which I find fault with that administraa tion. It is useless to assume, because the is an admittedly good man, to that the administration of the Department is satisfactory. In many cases, it is exceedingly unsatisfactory, and much discontent is occasioned by grievances which could be easily remedied. The reports of the Public Service Commissioner, when one knows the facts, often make one's blood boil. Is it not idle, for example, for him to report to Parliament that no reductions in salary have taken place in consequence of the classification of the Service when, as has .been pointed out repeatedly in this Chamber, many South Australian, postmasters have had their salaries reduced by Â£ 1 5 0 and lesser sums? A piece of tyranny which recently came under my notice relates to the entrance examination system. Twp young ladies in South Australia passed an entrance examination much more severe than was necessary to show their qualifications for the work which they desired to do, and were temporarily appointed as telephone attendants. I believe that the appointments were not made permanent, owing to a disagreement between the inspector ancl the Deputy Postmaster-General, as to how manv persons should be employed. The Public Service Commissioner is charged with the duty of saying how many persons shall be employed in any Department, the Minister and departmental head responsible for the work to be done having no "" say"" in the matter. Tn the case with which I am dealing, the ladies gave the fullest satisfaction j but, after some months, were told that they must again present themselves for examination. On this occasion, not having opportunity for special preparation, they failed to gain a sufficient number of marks. I ask how many examinations must be passed by applicants for positions in the P.ublic Service ? Every one knows that a person who has passed anexamination well might not be able, twelve months later, to pass the same examination, even if the same questions were set. But once having shown the possession of the necessary qualifications, .appointees who satisfactorily discharge the duties assigned to them should not be again subjected to the ordeal of examination.",26
123,Mr HUME COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,What time elapsed between the two examinations ?,27
124,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Over twelve months', I think. Of course, the case is different where persons pass an examination, and are not appointed to the Service. If such persons presented themselves again after a long interval, it might not be unfair to ask them to. prove that they were still qualified ; but it is altogether unnecessary to submit to a second examination those ' who have given practical proof of their ability to discharge the duties assigned to them. I shall not enumerate all the other reasons for discontent and dissatisfaction. South Australian officers have reason to complain because there has been no reclassification there such as took place in Victoria, and, I think, ih New South Wales. Had there been a reclassification, postmasters whose salaries were considerably reduced as a consequence of the original classification would have had an opportunity to get their positions improved because of the improvement in the business of their offices. These and similar matters, however, could best be investigated by a Royal Commission. If complaints are brought forward in this Chamber, and no action is taken, the effect is apparently to condone the administration. It would be, therefore, far better to have complaints investigated by a Committee or Royal Com-' mission. The appointment of such a body in the near future would allay a great deal of dissatisfaction.",27
125,Mr KNOX,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Kooyong) [12.29] - I have already said that I question the utility of much of the discussion on the Estimates; but I cannot help expressing my opinion in connection with this division that', in the interests of the public and of the"" Service, an amending Public Service Bil l should be introduced. So many elements of discontent are now operating against the effectiveness of the Service that it is necessary that some such step should be taken. T believe that in the Public Service Commissioner we have an officer who is discharging conscientiously, fairly, and to the best of his ability, the duties of his position. It is beyond doubt that he is overweighted by having imposed upon him duties which no one individual could reasonably be expected to overtake. Complaints are constantly being made in the House as to dissatisfaction in the service, but we are debarred by the Act from any personal communication with the Commissioner. I am sure that honourable members generally have faithfull y observed the provision in the Public Service Act that he shall be free from any direct' personal re- presentation by tis. I , - personally, have had no communication with him in respect to any appointment, except in one case. As the law stands, Ave cannot see that justice is clone in cases where we believe that, although the Commissioner himself has been actuated w ith a desire to exercise an impartial judgment, inequalities have occurred in the distribution of the advantages of the service. I hope that at an early stage an amending Bill will be introduced, and that it will provide for the appointment of additional Commissioners to co-operate with and assist the present Commissioner in his laborious work. In expressing that hope, I do not suggest for one moment that Mr. MCLachlan has failed to deal fairly with all cases with which he has been called upon to deal. But the time has arrived when that excellent officer should have additional assistance so that he may be able to devote more attention to general principles than to individual cases, the consideration of which, under present conditions, must largely interfere with his more responsible duties of general administration. Whilst I recognise that it is well that temporary employment in the Public Service should be available, I feel satisfied that the system requires to be better regulated. I. have recently brought before the Postmaster-General cases relating to contract post-offices, and the discharge from the service of male and female employees who have done excellent wprk for the Department. Although I am sure that the Postmaster-General and his colleagues are in sympathy with the representations that have been made to them on the subject, those peqple are suffering a great injustice. If for no other reason than to remove such injustices an amending Bill should be introduced at the earliest possible moment. I also think that it should provide for a Board of Commissioners, as it is unreasonable to expect one Commissioner to attend to the administration of a huge service extending over the whole Commonwealth. Such a change would be in the interests, not only of the Public Service, but of the people. It would be well to review, in the light of our experiences since the establishment of Federation, the whole of the conditions of the service. I hope that the Minisier in charge of these Estimates will convey my representations to the Minister of Home Affairs. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [12.39] I , like other honourable members who have spoken, believe that in Mr MCLachlan we have an officer well fitted for the position of Public Service Commissioner. I am not personally acquainted with him, but gather from honourable members generally that he is a fair man, has a good grasp of the work of the Department, and, in short, is eminently . qualified for the position that he occupies. I have often thought of directions in which the system could be improved. Like the honourable member for Franklin, I am strongly of opinion that, some such system as that which exists in New Zealand, if applied to the Commonwealth, would tend to a very large extent: lo allay the undoubted dissatisfaction that permeates the service. The New Zealand, system, however, could be improved upon.. I do not approve of the rights and privileges of individuals, whether public servants or members of the general public, being adjudicated upon by a tribunal that is practically responsible - to no one.",27
126,Mr MCDOUGALL,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Does not the honourable member think that the Public Service Commissioner should be responsible to Parliament ?,28
127,Colonel FOXTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I shall deal presently with that phase of the question, and the honourable member will find that I am in accord with him. The position of the Commissioner under the Act is such that it is only in respect of his general administration that there is an appeal from him to Parliament. It is difficult to bring an appeal to this House from the Public Service Commissioner's decision in respect of an individual case,, and the aggrieved public servant has to go to law to seek redress: A very important improvement could be made upon the New Zealand system, which, as described by the honourable member for Franklin, permits of an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner to a Board consisting of a representative of the Commissioner, a representative of the complainant or that section of the Public Service which is interested in the appeal, and the stipendiary magistrate of the district. I understand that in New Zealand stipendiary magistrate's are subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commissioner. That might be regarded as a slight objection to the system. In the case of the Commonwealth, however, we should have as Chairman of the Board a stipendiary magistrate, who would be in no way under the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commissioner of the Commonwealth. He would be absolutely independent of him, and might be expected therefore to be more impartial as Chairman of such a Board than he would be if he were under the control of the Commissioner.",28
128,Mr MAHON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"It would cost .Â£100,000 per annum to apply such a system to so vast a country as the Commonwealth.",28
129,Colonel FOXTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I do not agree with the honourable member. My own opinion is that it would not cost more than does the present system. I have had some experience of the system in force in Queensland,'which bears some resemblance to that in operation in New Zealand. The Board, instead of being the final Court of Appeal, is required in respect of every case to make a report and recommendation to the Minister. We should then get what the honourable member for Wannon desires, namely, the responsibility of the Minister to Parliament. It would require very good grounds for a Minister to disregard the report of such an independent board, seeing that for any action he might take he would be responsible; and my suggestion would mean a considerable improvement on the present system, under which the Commissioner is practically an autocrat. nothing to say against the Commissioner personally, because I am satisfied he always acts with the best of motives from his point of view. But there is undoubtedly a very strong feeling of. dissatisfaction throughout the Commonwealth service, a dissatisfaction which the system I have suggested would tend to minimize. Although the Commissioner is eminently well qualified f o i his position, and is a man in whom, I am sure most, if not all, honourable members have perfect confidence, lie necessarily has to see through the eyes of his inspectors. The question arises' whether the inspectors in the outlying States are in all casesthe best men for such positions; and my own impression is that they are not. There cases-whic h I do not care to mention, at all events now-in which it has been made manifest that the inspectors have not reported equitably and fairly. We find that in the Department of the Postmaster General, and especially , in the Department of the Minister of Trade and Customs in Queensland, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction, and large bodies of officers openly state that they have been passed over in the most unblushing manner-that men have been pitchforked over their heads in a way for which there is no justification.",29
130,Mr MAHON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,In any large service there are complaints of that kind.,29
131,Colonel FOXTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Possibly , but we autocracy. ought to do our best to minimize them. If there wereonly occasional complaints, one might hesitate; but when we find the complaints general-whe n we find that oflicers not personally interested join in the complaints-ther e is evidently something wrong. Having . regard to the high character of the Commissioner, I believe that the fault must lie in the reports of the inspectors, .or of the heads of Departments. We sometimes find that , the Commissioner is not in accord with the Government; and I do not blame him for that, because either side may be right or wrong. We have, however, been furnished with a printed paper in connection with the Postal Department, having reference to the approval of the Commissioner as to the status of the Assistant Secretary in the Post and Telegraph Department. That office having been created, the Secretary to .""""e Department very naturally represented u that the officer who was to assist him in his administrative work, should be placed in the administrative branch. To that the ComI have missioner simply replied that he was unable to f all in with the view presented, and refused his sanction. If the work of the Secretary is so great that it has to be divided, it necessarily follows that those who take on themselves a portion of the responsibility for the administration should, along with the Secretary, be placed in the administrative branch. I compliment, the Postmaster-General on the fact that, notwithstanding the attitude of the Commissioner, the Government propose to give the Assistant Secretary a salary commensurate with the duties he has to perform. I hope that, if there is an amendment of the Public Service Act in contemplation, such a provision as that which I have suggested will be included, because I believe are that would largely tend to allay the uneasy feeling there is throughout the service. From my experience of the Public Service Act in Queensland, I do not think that the expense would be anything like what the honourable member for Coolgardie suggests. The inquiries would not be more numerous, nor would the evidence be any more voluminous, than in the cases which are at present investigated ; the only difference would be a slightly different tribunal, whose recommendations would go to the Minister for final decision. With the Minister would rest the responsibility of dealing fairly as between the Commissioner and the public servants; and that, in my opinion, would provide a further check on anything in the nature of",29
132,Mr MAHON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Coolgardie) [12.55] The honourable member for Brisbane suggests a plan of appeal from the decisions t of the Public Service Commissioner;. and raises the question whether it is desirable that those decisions should be reviewed by some authority. The proposal involves a reversal of the deliberate determination of Parliament some time ago that finality should rest with the Commissioner; and for this purpose his office was invested with the security of , tenure enjoyed by the Judges of the Supreme Court. No step backward should therefore be taken without proof that the present system has failed and that better methods were available. Has such proof been given ? To my thinking, the suggestion of the honourable member for Brisbane would involve such a huge expenditure as to render it utterly impracticable as a remedy.",29
133,Colonel FOXTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I do not. suggest a standing board, but a .board which would probably be composed of different individuals for each case.",30
134,Mr MAHON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"That makes little difference as to the cost of the honourable member's proposal. If the hearing of an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner is to be of any value, the board should investigate the case on the spot. That might work all right in acompact country like New Zealand, but in a spacious territory, such as that of the Commonwealdi, it would entail on the people an enormous burden in the shape of travelling expenses and the payment of substitutes for officers who were engaged in hearing appeals. The honourable member may not be aware that this Parliament has already had some experience of boards of inquiry. Under the Public Service Act there is provision for boards of inquiry into any disputes or any charges levelled against officers. ' Colonel FOXTON - That is not quite the same thing.",30
135,Mr MAHQN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I know it is slightly different, but the difficulties and troubles in connection with those boards would be repeated and aggravated in the case of the boards suggested by the honourable member. At the present time, an officer feeling aggrieved may obtain a board of inquiry in certain circumstances. A large number of such inquiries have been held during the currency of the Public Service Act. The Public Service Commissioner summarizes the results in his report, states that there were twenty-six boards of inquiry in 1903, at a cost of Â£i>593'> forty-four in 1904 at a cost of Â£ 3 , 6 5 6 ; seventy-six in 1905 at a cost of Â£ 3 , 2 5 5 . ; and forty-six in 190S at a cost of Â£2,008'- a total of 192 boards at a cost of Â£10,5.12 in travelling and other expenses spread over the four years. Then, 'in the case of Queensland, in the Post and Telegraph Department,'there were three inquiries held in1903 at a cost of Â£ 2 6 0 ; ten in 1904 at a cost of Â£ 1 , 2 6 8 ; eleven in 1905 at a cost of Â£ 9 2 5 ; and eight in 1906 at a cost of Â£ 6 1 5 - a total of thirty-two inquiries at a cost of .Â£3,058. That is a very expensive method ""of correcting thepossible abuses in the Public Service.",30

139,Mr MAHON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Quite right; the honourable member's practice reinforces my contention. We should not encourage litigation in the Public Service at the expense of the country. We ought to devise some cheaper and less cumbrous method of disposing of such cases.,30

143,Mr MAHON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The principal argument which I have urged against the proposal to constitute local boards of inquiry, is based upon the ground of the expenditure which would be involved. But there are many other grounds which justify the Government in disregarding the suggestion of the honourable member for Brisbane. In the first place, these boards would arrive at different determinations regarding the value of similar positions in the various States, so that in a very short time anomalies would be created greater than those which existed previously, thus making uniform classification, or any other arrangement of the service, practically impossible. The proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane has been discussed previously in this House, and the Commissioner was asked to give his opinion upon it, which he did. Amongst other things, he points outI f the proposed substitution were adopted, and he the Chairman would be a local Slate official, - and the Commonwealth Government would be entirely unrepresented. The stipendiary magistrate or Judge, while possibly familiar with the general procedure adopted in administering the Public ServiceAct of his own State, would have no practical knowledge of the questions that would arise or the conditions prevailing in other States, or of - the difficulties that had to be overcome in order to produce a classification, based on a uniform system, and sufficiently elastic to embrace the thousands of officers working under .widely differingconditions, and whose rights were protected by the Constitution upon transfer to the Commonwealth. I think that that statement of the position disposes of the contention of the' honourable member. But in order that it may be revived, I had better quote one or other very conclusive paragraphs from Commissioner's report. For instance, he . saysSix separate Boards of Appeal constituted proposed, acting in their respective States, making recommendations entirely from local parte knowledge and evidence, each Board in its own conclusions differing from the other, with but the scantiest knowledge of the monwealth Public Service Act, of its requireGeneral ments, or of the operations that have taken under it, lo guide them, would in a short time sioner: in matters of policy. produce a state' of disorganization and chaos. After referring to other aspects of matter, the Commissioner proceedsI f the Board's conclusions were final, would be a number of classification schemes, varying according to the different views several Boards of Appeal in each State, a con'tinuation of anomalies, and a fresh crop peals evolved by the difference of action tween Slates. It may be taken for granted that what applies to appeals from classification with equal force and relevance on appeals against decisions as to other matters. So that it would be utterly impossible to get uniformity in respect of anynumbers thing. Now, the main idea underlying the Public Service Act 'is that uniform conditions shall prevail throughout the Commonwealth, due allowance being made to ofBcers who reside in remote localities where the cost of living is high. The missioner adds- . The object aimed at by the Act, that uniformity of classification throughout the monwealth would be defeated. There must one controlling head; if the recommendations of the different Boards were carried out the utmost confusion and dissimilarity'""of payment for the same work would result, injustice be inflicted on officers who were not appellants by others passing over their heads, and there was 'one focussing centre, as in the missioner, the Service would soon become more chaotic than it was in the States. It is unnecessary to dwell further on suggestion ""offered by the honourable member for Brisbane. But I should like to make a few remarks conadministrative , cerning the position which the - Service Commissioner occupies in regard Mr Mahon. to the Government of the day. Rightly or .wrongly, this Parliament has placed the Commissioner in a position of independence and freedom from parliamentary control similar to that occupied by a Supreme Court Judge, whose salary is not voted by Parliament, but is specially appropriated. We appointed him for a fixed term and gave him absolutely a' free hand. After an experience of six years, I do not know never that we can say that that complete indetwo pendence of the Executive and of Parliathe ment has been wholly justified. In' saying this, I do not wish to cast any reflections on the Commissioner, because it would reas quire somebody approaching an archangel and to give absolute satisfaction in such an ex office. But it seems to me that there ought and to be vested in the Executive of the day Com- - eithe r in the Cabinet or the Governorin Council-authorit y to review the place decisions of the Public Service CommisI do. not say that the Executive should be entitled to the review every appointment or promotion made by the Commissioner, but in matters the result of policy affecting the Public Service"" throughout the States and bearing intiofthe mately upon the financial results of our of aplarge Public Service Departments, the conas betrol should b& in the hands of the .Government. In this respect, the Commissioner exercises power which ought not beaTs to be conferred upon any one man. The - Government, for instance, should have something to say as to the grading and wages, not of individuals, but of large ofpublic servants. It should be the function of Ministers, subject to Parliament, to say whether the cost of Departments was excessive, or whether a more liberal policy should not be pursued as to wages and conditions. .In such matters, Comthe Commissioner ought to be more amenable to Executive control, and wherever is, a conflict arises between, him and the ComExecutive, the latter' should have a wider be discretion, provided that the particulars of any conflict between the Commissioner and the Executive should be placed before Par-. - would Iiament forthwith. In that way we should secure the best results. A continuance of unless the system under which the Commissioner Commay pull one way, despite the fact that the Government is unitedly pulling another way, cannot safely be continued. Take the the instance mentioned by the honourable member for Brisbane, where the Government decided that an officer discharging duties should be promoted Public from the clerical division.",30
144,Mr MAUGER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"He had been endowed with administrative duties with the Comcreased missioner's consent. _ Mr Mahon - Exactly . The Commisup sioner argued that, the officer in question should be kept in the clerical division, though charged with duties belonging to a higher grade. If is difficult to follow, and still more difficult to agree with, such reasoning. Those who read .the correslowing pondence will be struck by the failure the Commissioner to reply to one salient July lastpoint. Though the highest salary fixed for the clerical division is Â£600, he himAustralia self classified one officer in that division worth Â£650 per annum, and. .when the necessaries Commissioner leaves such a charge without answer, he discounts the remainder of his argument against the transference of this allowance officer to the administrative division. Some reference may now be made to the attitude of the Commissioner towards the public servants of Western Australia. On many ^7.'93occasions since the Commonwealth assumed 'was3. As control of the Customs-and Postal Departowing ments, I pointed out that the cost of livduties ing in Western Australia was considerably in excess of the cost of living in the other States. Anybody who is industrious enough period; to look up Hansard will find that I reance peatedly brought that fact under the notice of the Government. The reply was that alstances lowances were made to officials located in the tropical and gold-fields' State. But I contended then-as I do now-that the cost of living- evasive and unsatisfactory. even 'in the coastal districts and around Perth-is considerably in excess of the cost of living elsewhere. The Comthe missioner himself recognised the excesmitted, sive cost of living in the gold-fields tropical portions of that State, and ances were accordingly paid to officers and residents in those areas. But he refused to recommend any increase of the general salaries payable to officers in Western Austify tralia on account of the higher cost of ing there. Quite recently, however, he agreed to advance the salaries of all cers who are not in receipt of tropical gold-fields' allowances by 5 per cent. At the same time he hits committed the - inwho consistency of not advancing proportionately the allowances of the officers on the goldhim insolvent. fields and in tropical latitudes. The tive disadvantages of life at these stations, in comparison with life at more - favourably situated places, have not dimiout nished. Yet the Commissioner has reduced - the disparity in the remuneration of officers so placed, and in so doing has in the difficulty of inducing officers located in Perth or on the coast to take duties in the north-west and on the remoter gold-fields. This is not just to the officers, nor advantageous to the Departments concerned, nor is it in the interests of the public. It may refresh the memory of the Minister if I read the folquestions and answers, which I put of to the Postmaster-General on the 16th 1. Has the Public Service Commissioner informed him that, as the cost of living in Western is greater than in the eastern States, as an allowance to meet such enhanced cost of the of life should be granted to the public servants in that State?-Yes . 2. Does the Government propose to grant the recommended by the Commissioner, and, if so, what is the estimate of the increased expenditure on public servants' salaries?-The matter is to receive consideration in connection with the Estimates. The cost is estimated at the cost of. living in Western Australia greater from igoi to igo6 than it is now,. to the disappearance of the sliding scale and to other circumstances, does he propose to grant those public servants who were in the service from 1901 to 1906 any allowance to cover the enhanced cost of living during that and, if not, why?-The proposed allowis based' upon the present cost of living,, and can be varied or withdrawn, as circumwarrant. It is not usual in such cases, nor is it intended in this instance, to make the belts of that payment retrospective. The reply to the third question is palpablv It simply dodges the main point involved. If living now costs less than it did before, why should public servants, whose right is now adbe denied an allowance for the and period when it cost them more to live than allowit doss at present? The Minister should not allow himself to be the vehicle for conveying evasions to plain questions put in this House. If the Commissioner can jushis action, he ought to do so; if he has livno justification, then a frank admission of has the fact is the straightforward course to offitake. Another practice of the Commisor sioner calls for some notice. He is era.powered by the Act to suspend an officer owes a single creditor an amount sufficient in law to entitle him to make But, apparently, public relaservants may. owe their butchers, bakers, remote drapers, and other tradesmen, small amounts, aggregating more than Â£ 5 0 , with the Commissioner taking action, notwithstanding proof that they have been the sued and verdicts obtained against them. When a case of the kind occurred a few years ago, I thought that the Commissioner was in the wrong. A public servant was sued for a debt of less than Â£ 5 0 , and, as he made no defence, the Court gave an order against him; but the Commissioner refused to suspend him or to take any steps to compel the officer to pay up. In justification, he wroteI t would, in my opinion, be a most able precedent for a Department to interfere in money disputes between an officer and tradesman who may, or may not, have a claim. I pointed out that the man had been judged by a Court of law to owe the that money, addingI am unable to agree with the dictum is ""most undesirable"" for the Department to being recognised? intervene in monetary disputes between public servants and their creditors. It should not undesirable to take action, which the Public Service Act authorized (if not required) the partment to adopt in certain cases Respecting this particular case, it is to served that the creditor's claim is not correctly, described as "" a dispute.""' Having been adjudisalary cated upon by a Court of law, which awarded the creditor a. verdict, there is no longer dispute"" between a tradesman and a public vant. The issue now is whether the public servant is to be permitted to disregard an of a Court of Justice. It would, I think, an abdication of plain duty if .the administrators of the Public Service Act refused assistance giving effect to a Court's lawful decision. The Commissioner's statement was that Mr Withers has not, so far as the papers the possession of the Commissioner disclosed, given his version of the transaction leading to, and including, the Court proceedings between  To which I repliedThat Withers has failed to give "" his of the transaction"""" is not now to the point.. His ago, neglect to submit his defence to the Court should certainly not be allowed to operate as to defeat the rights of a creditor, as praised and recorded by a Court of Justice. The Commissioner also said thatIt does not appear that it would be right proper to put the punitive clauses of the Act into sought by those applicants. niotion on the ex farte statement of a ""party interested. My answer wasNo request has been made that "" the punitive clauses of the Act should be put into motion on the ex farte statement of an interested party."" Action is not suggested because of Palmer's statement, but in view of Wither's failure to recognise a decision of the Court-a different matter. Although the Commissioner apparently considers that Withers should "" his version of the transaction,"" I am surprised to notice that he does not propose to ask for it. I do not see the applicability to this case of the Commissioner's reference to "" probable Mr Mahon. extortionate demands."" All the creditor here asks for is compliance with a judgment of a Court of justice, and I apprehend it is not intended to apply the word "" extortionate "" to it . : Here the matter ended, so far as the Commissioner was concerned ; but I believe the individual in question was ultimately suspended, and that, as. the result of the action taken in his case, numbers of others liquidated their petty debts with great undesirpromptitude. The honourable member for a Brisbane says that a number of complaints just have reached him about officers being passed over. Very probably. That is a adgeneral experience. But does he imagine in any large army, such as the Public Service, some will not always be found that it who are convinced their merits are not So long as promotion is by .merit instead of by seniority, combe plaints about partiality will be made. An Deofficer's estimate of his capacity often differs from that of his superior or of those be obworking with him'; and those who do not receive the promotion or the increase of to which they deem themselves en-, "" a titled, naturally find fault. It has been sermy' duty to investigate many of these complaints, and, with a couple of exceptions, award there was no warrant for the belief that be partiality had been shown in the promoin tions. If any complaint is to be made, it is not as to the exercise of political, but rather of social, influence. That, however, in is impossible to trace. The Public Service Commissioner is largely in .the hands up of his inspectors, who, although vested with very large powers and privileges,, on the whole perform their duties fairly well. In the matter with version which the Government dealt some time of inspectors seeking appointso ment as Deputy Postmasters-General, I apthink that Ministers acted quite properly. As these inspectors are called upon to report upon the qualifications of other applicants, or .they, should not compete for the positions An inspector occupies an exceptionally favourable ground, and, if he chose to do so, could undoubtedly damn the chances of an opponent. There is one other matter to which I desire to refer. The Minister is aware that the secretary to the Public Service Commissioner will be due for retirement at the totally end of the present half-year, and I wish to know whether it is proposed that the salary give which he was receiving, after nearly forty years of service shall be paid to his successor. The full amount of Â£600 is on the Estimates. On general principles, an officer appointed to a new position should not start at the maximum salary enjoyed his predecessor.",32
145,Mr HUMECOOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I think that the orable member may take that for granted.,34
146,Mr MAHON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I am glad to have that assurance. Mr THOMA S BROW N [2.47] - I was pleased to hear the remarks made by the honourable member for Brisrally bane in reference to the manner in which the Public Service Commissioner has disunder charged the duties of his office. Most the representatives of New South Wales able member refers. had an intimate acquaintance with him in pre-Federation days, first, as Under-Secretary for Public Works, and subsequently as Under-Secretary for Mines in that State. In both those Departments he did excellike lent work, and in the service of the Comport monwealth he has proved himself a very able and competent officer - A great deal of the criticism levelled at the administion tration of his Department today is founded upon conditions for which the vernment, and not the Commissioner himto self, is responsible. When we passed the things. Public Service Act, we had before us very' limited information as to the general ditions of the service, and the Commismade sioner, who has to administer it, often finds hisefforts hampered, by its provisions. Having regard to the. circumstances under which it was passed, the wonder is that it has not proved more imperfect than it is. It has been in operation for some time, and its imperfections are well known both to the administrator and the Government. In the last Parliament, reform was propublic mised. We were told that the Minister Home Affairs had on the stocks a B i l give expression to the knowledge gained the administration of the principal Act. In other words, it was to remove 'the blemishes of the system and to enable service to run as smoothly as possible. Nothing, however-, has since been heard of it. The consideration of the Tariff interfered, in all probability, with its. troduction, but, in justice to the public vice, it should not be delayed one day longer than can be avoided. I hope the Government have the measure well hand, arid that under it we shall remove the cause of much of the adverse criticism directed against the Department, and great deal of the friction now obtaining throughout the service. In making that statement, I feel that I am only doing justice to the Commissioner. I , in common with other honourable members, wish to see by this important branch of the service strengthened and rendered more efficient; honbut my experience as a member of the Parliament of New South Wales leads me to hope that we shall not revert to the old condition of affairs which prevailed in that State, where the control of the Department (Calare) was practically in the hands of the Ministerial head, and its administration genewas subject to political influence.",34

I do not think that Mr MCLachlan would be swayed by political influence or any improper considerain administering the Department.,34
149,Mr CHANTER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The favouritism) to which GoI refer is due, not to Mr MCLachlan, but those who recommend him to do certain",34
150,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"In that reconspect, an amendment of the Act could be with advantage. The Public Service Commissioner is located in Melbourne, and cannot possibly be personally acquainted with the details of every case submitted for his consideration. He must necessarily act largely upon the evidence submitted to him, of which the reports of his responsible officers form a considerable part. Where there is a conflict between an aggrieved servant and the officer called upon of to report upon his case-a n officer supl to posed to the disinterested, but who may, in nevertheless, be animated by most bitter feelings against the aggrieved party - it is only natural that the Public Service the Commissioner should accept the version of the facts put before him by his responsible servant. If he finds that that officer is has untrustworthy-that his repoits cannot be inrelied upon-h e can get r i d of him. No sermatter who occupies the position of Commissioner, the situation in that regard must that remain unchanged in the absence of an in amendment of the Act. What we need to do is to provide a readily accessible, and not too costly, medium of appeal between a the public servant aggrieved and the officer at the head of his Department. We should have a tribunal to investigate complaints impartially, and put before the Commissioner and the Executive the result of its inquiry. The honourable member for West Sydney has on the notice-paper a motion with that object in view. His proposal is that the Commissioner shall be permitted to avail himself of the services of police magistrates throughout the Commonwealth, and to constitute any one of them a Court of Inquiry to investigate a complaint, ancl to submit the evidence with a report thereon to the officer in charge. It is only by some such method that something like justice in the treatment of these cases can be secured. An attempt made to establish a Board within the Department was found in a large number of cases to be unworkable. The Commonwealth comprises such a vast territory, and our officers are so widely scattered-man y of them being remote from centres of population-that the appointment of such - - a Board would mean the erection of a piece of machinery so expensive that I do not think Parliament would agree to it . ' The suggestion made by the honourable member for West Sydney has very much to recommend it , and I trust that in the amending legislation which the Government has in view something will be done to meet this difficulty. I am sure that the Public Service, from the Commissioner downwards, would welcome any device of this character that would enable a correct understanding of the position to be a'rrived at. Whilst our Public Service comprises many excellent officers, animated solely by a desire to do their duty, it would be unreasonable to assume that it consists wholly of such men. It often happens that a man of grea't ability has also great failings, and allows his personal prejudices to override his sense of justice, so that public servants under his control often suffer injustice, and have no redress. The report and the word of their superior officer always count against them, and, when a conflict arises, they, at the very outset, stand a discredited party.",34
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,What does the honourable member suggest?,35
152,Mr THOMASBROWN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I suggest simplv that the Government replace the present ineffective Public Service Act by a new piece of up-to-date legislative machinery.,35

154,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Yes . Act was brought into existence under conditions that render it a matter of not that it is imperfect, but that it is so perfect as we find it. We had to deal with the public services of the Commonwealth on imperfect information; but we now know where rhe Act' is faulty, and are in a position to amend it. One of the amendments I advocate is the provision of some means to enable an aggrieved officer to appeal to an independent t r i bunal, and have his case properly' investigated. The very nature of the service is such that it is impossible for the Commissioner to make himself acquainted with every case or every grievance, or to investigate it in a satisfactory manner. To the desired end, I - recommended a proposal that is before the House in the shape of a Bill introduced by the honourable member for West Sydney, who seeks to enable the Commissioner to constitute local courts of inquiry, presided over by police magistrates or other local justices.",35
155,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,That is what' the Public Service objects' t a,35
156,Mr THOMASBROWN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I am not aware that that 'is so. If may be that the Public Service has a better proposal, but I know that in one State, at least, the officers are very dissatisfied with the pre-sent state of affairs. I do not believe that the administration is responsible for the friction, but rather that, if inquiry were instituted, it would be seen that the administration is correct. But, in the absence of any inquiry or means of investigation of the character I have suggested, the officers feel there is injustice, and the dissatisfaction increases. The proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney would, in the end, make the Public Service more satisfied with the decisions, even if these turned out to be not very widely, different from tliose arrived at at present'. The services of police magistrates and other justices, who ' discharged similar duties in the States, would be always available in different centres of population, and the courts could be constituted at the minimum of expense.

158,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"To the same extent that it isfinal at the present time ; and I do not think that the decision of has arisen. the Commissioner ought to be , disturbed by any higher authority except for very sufficient reasons. There is trouble in lower branches of' the service, owing to the fact that under the present system is practically the decision of the superior officer that obtains, and, in many cases, the superior officer is actuated by bias to such an exten't that the! public servant placed in an unfortunate and unhappy position. There are other directions in moved. which amending legislation is required, notably the condition that all junior officers, such as telegraph messengers, shall retire at a certain age if the Department is unable to promote them to higher grades. That condition not only entails great injustice, but is largely responsible for the unsatisfactory position into which the Department has drifted. I have now in mind an instance which came under my notice, and which will convey to the Comhas mittee how the condition operates. In a country 'town a. telegraph messenger appointed; and was trained by the postother master to such a state of efficiency that he could take charge of the office. He could do the. telegraphic operating work, and attend to all the postal work; and so satisfied was the Department with him that, when relieving work was the services of this young man were called into requisition. But, as soon as he attained the age of eighteen years, he was called upon ""to retire, on the ground that, there was no opening for promotion at the time. Thus the Department lost the results of the training which had extended over a number of years, and, course, the services of a and intelligent young officer. other messenger was selected to fill means. his place, but he was a young lad knew nothing of the routine work and to learn everything of telegraphy;' and, in the meantime, the. business at the office so extended that it was necessary to provide the postmaster, not, however, until there trouble elsewhere. had been a lot of trouble and inquiry, with an assistant to practically do the work which had previously been done by the trained youth who had been thrown out on the quires world - The operation of the Act in this connection has done a. great deal towards disorganizing and upsetting the routine in any way'. work of the Department, and I believe it is recognised by the Commissioner, and all the controlling heads, that something should be done in order to rectify the trouble that Only recently, in order to .fill up gaps in the Service, and to secure the advantage of the training bestowed ori the youths similarly circumstanced, the Commissioner held a special examination, and, it in this roundabout way, a number of them have been re-appointed. There are many other provisions of the Public Service Act - similarly faulty, and it is only by a comis prehensive and complete amending .Bill that the anomalies and difficulties can be reI n the meantime, it is in the nature of an injustice to place all the burden and opprobrium on the Commissioner. If there is any blame it should rest upon the Government for refusing to arm the Commissioner with the necessary efficient legislation to enable him to satisfactorily discharge the functions of his high office. The Commissioner cannot go beyond the bounds of the Act, no matter how he may feel disposed to do so; and, therefore, he to hold his hand, and do the best he can with the legislation at his disposal. was I trust that as soon as the Tariff and business is out of the way, the Government will bestow on the Commissioner the necessary power-to smooth, away difficulties in order that the Public Service of the Commonwealth may be better managed and more contented than it can possibly be required, under present conditions.",35

There is certainly a re-arrangement of the items affecting the Public Works Staff. The total salaries paid to the officers of this staff is Â£7,201, but it appears to me that the central, or executive, staff is proportionally too expensive. It has a Director General at Â£900' a year, with professional and clerks, making it cost about Â£3,000, or practically as much as the costapof what I may call the working staffs in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and Australia. If we were criticising, a business concern, we should say that the staff is overweighted. The honourable member for Parramatta has said that, in his opinion, it is time that we had a Public Works Department of our own, and serI think so, too.

All who are interested in the construction of public works must know that now often an extraordinary delay takes place between the voting of money by Parliament and the carrying out of a work. A Minister has always been able to stave off applications for works by saying that parliamentary sanction must be obtained for them; but under the present Commonwealth system months, and sometimes years, elapse after the money has been voted before public works are taken in hand. This state of affairs should not have arisen. We should have our public works undertaken with sufficient energy and activity to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth. A great deal of the congestion which has occurred is due to the manner in which this branch of the Department of Home,Affairs has been organized.

This state of affairs was considered by the Government, with the magnificent result that up to Â£ 5 0 can now be spent on repairs without reference to the head office. If the cost of repairing a post office in the remote portions of Queensland, De- Western Australia, or Tasmania amounts to Â£ 5 1 , the officer responsible for undertaking those repairs has to make an elaborate report to the central office in Melbourne, and thus delay ensues. The Inspector of Public Works in my own State - wh o is a thoroughly competent man. and the who has .to superintend a very large expenditure in connection with the work of his State Department-is obliged to make a complete report to the centra! office in. Melbourne whenever a Commonwealth undertaking exceeds Â£ 5 0 . Until we adopt a system of decentralization, and vest greater powers in the local authorities, delay is inevitable. As the right honourable member for Swan has asked, "" How can an official in the central office know the requirements of rewhich mote portions of the Commonwealth?"" The Department can be successful only by adopting a greater degree of decentralization than has hitherto been attempted.  ' some information in regard to the offices of assistant military engineer and inspector of rifle ranges. I cannot understand why the Department of Home Affairs requires the services of these two officials. Whilst the present Treasurer presided over the Department - of Home Affairs he appointed Colonel Owen - as Inspector of Public Works.",42
231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I did not appoint Colonel Owen. It was the right honourable member for Swan. As a matter of fact, I opposed his appointment.  up Hansard, but my recollection differs from that of the Treasurer.",43
232,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Colone l appointment was suggested to me, and I opposed it , because I did not believe in the duplication of the offices, and because I did not know very much about him.",43
233,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The member recommended him to me.  bers of the Labour Party, and some members of the Opposition, as likely to happen in regard to this Department, has happened. We said that the thin end of the wedge was being introduced, and that the Department would ultimately become very expensive. On the first ""Estimates,' provision was made for the appointment of an Inspector-General of-Works and a clerk, at & total cost of about Â£ 1 , 5 0 0 . I was afraid at the time that ultimately there would be the duplication which we now seem likely to get. I do not know why we should need a Commonwealth staff when there are States staffs to do this work. The States staffs have no more to do than they had to do prior to Federation; there has been merely a transference of control. I know that in Queensland, Commonwealth and State works take their turn. Commonwealth work is not put on one side to allow State work to be pushed ahead. If votes have lapsed because State officials have shelved applications, Ministers have neglected their duty in allowing' it. They should have called upon outside firms to do what was necessary. As for the Brisbane Post Office, I know that most f a it h f ul supervision is being given there; in fact, that the contractors are growling that it is too much. spector-General of Works was an officer in the Defence Forces.",43

A man recommended as Colonel Owen was - and I have had a lot to do with him in connection with works carried out in Queensland-mus t be an up-to-date engineer. In the construction of fortifications he is, no doubt, without his superior in the Commonwealth. We were lucky to get such a man. Of course, he has his fads, but we all have them.",43
237,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"They show, at least, an active brain.  Owen's pens that the State authorities pigeon-hole his instructions, and therefore works are delayed; but he shows no want of energy. Generally speaking, I regard the Home A f fairs Department as the fifth wheel of a honourable coach. Its officers are so bound about by red tape that only a knife would cut through.. If a window has to be put into a post office on the Queensland and South Australian border, application to spend half-acrown has to be made to Melbourne, and at one time a broom could not be bought without getting authority from the head office.",43
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I know a postmaster who had .to pay out of his own pocket for a window which he put in.,43

The honourable member probably feels sorry when he remembers the language which he used in speaking of an officer and a gentleman, and I object, to an attempt to place my statement on the same low level.

247,Mr SALMDN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Althoug h there were 200 delegates at that Conference, no remark like that of the honourable member for Wentworth was made there. With regard to the statement made by way of interjection by the honourable member that my opposition to this branch of the Department was due to the fact that the Inspector General came from New South Wales",44
248,Mr KELLY,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I asked the honourable member if that was the reason for his opposition.,44
249,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The honourable member ought to have known, and doubtless did know, that it was utterly unnecessary. to address such a question to me. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The member ought fo be the last to say a word against. New South Wales.",44
250,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The honourable member for Wentworth desires to treat lightly a statement which, if uncontradicted, would do all the damage that he desired it to do. This is the first time that such a charge has been' made against me in this House, and it is utterly unjustifiable. Never by word or deed have I shown the slightest animus towards any person appointed to the Commonwealth service from any other State than Victoria. I ' defy the honourable member to show that I have done so. In these circumstances, his question was unjustifiable- I was going to say ungenerous from him, I shall not use that word. Hi s remark was utterly improper, but it is impossible to pierce his pachydermatous covering. His laugh justifies my criticism. If he were at all sensitive, he would receive this chastisement, which is entirely deserved, in a contrite spirit. His cachinnatory explosions show that he does not realise the seriousness of the position. It is unfortunate, but we ought rather to pity than to blame him.

I have brought under the notice of the Minister a state of affairs which I think ought not to be allowed to continue. I wish to see urgent public works, in respect of which votes have been passed, carried out without delay. Instead of this policy of laissez faire, we should have an up-to-date Department. In many cases money has been voted over and over again for certain public works, but we are unable to get them.

253,Mr KELLY,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Wentworth) [4.3d] - I do not propose to follow the honourable member far Laanecoorie along the particular honourable line of abuse that he has seen fit to adapt, and which does not appear to me to be quite worthy of this Chamber: I ask honourable members who were present to. say whether it is not true that his remarks, to which I objected, were directed, not against the administration of a public Department, nor to the way in which that Department could be made most effective, but against the Inspector-General of Public Works. The honourable member stated that that officer was not the best man who could: be found for the position, but he admitted towards the close of his remarks that he knew nothing about his qualifications. I then rose and expressed the hope that the Minister would judge of this officer's services, from his own knowledge, and not upon the ex - parte statements of an honourable member who, after canvassing his qualifications in this House, admitted that he knew nothing about them. If this attitude on my part has been responsible for the honourable member's abusive frame of mind, it is no concern of mine. sorry that the time of the Committee has been wasted in such a. frivolous way.

255,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Dalley) [4.34] - Some two or three weeks ago, the honourable member for Lang, and the honourable member for Hunter, brought under the notice of the Prime Minister certain charges of corruption, made by way of innuendoes, against members of this Parliament. It will be remembered that the honourable member for Lang asked the honourable gentleman whether his attention had been directed to the report of an interview with , Mr O. C Beale, who, by innuendo, charged honourable members with corruption. His attention was also called, to an article in the Bulletin which, by inference, made a similar charge, against many honourable members. Trie Prime Minister promised that he would try to devise some means to sift such charges to die bottom, and to consider whether the law could; be set in motion. These charges have been the property of the public for something like three, weeks, and I should like to know whether the Prime Minister has yet given any consideration to the matter. I presume he will say that he could not force the people concerned to give evidence, but will' he tell us what steps he has taken ?",45
256,Mr MAHON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"(Coolgardie) [4.35]- In the course of discussion recently, some statements were made concerning the present Acting Administrator of Papua. Although I did not attach much importance to them, seeing that Judge Murray has been amply vindicated by the report of independent Royal Commissioners, still I apprehend the Government will not permit these aspersions on a valued and eminent public servant to pass unnoticed. The Prime Minister having had no earlier opportunity of. dealing with the matter, this will, perhaps, I am be a fitting occasion to remove any doubts entertained that the present Administrator of Papua retains, undiminished, the full confidence of the Government.",45
257,Mr DEAKI N,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.36] - In reply to the honourable member for Dalley, I have, in accordance with my undertaking, communicated with honourable members in different parts of this House, with a view to the nomination of a Joint Committee of both Houses, to lay down a form of procedure to be applied to such cases.",45

261,Mr DEAKIN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"They need have no such power at present.

262,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,On e of the alleged offenders will be leaving for London next week.,45
263,Mr DEAKIN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The honourable member has sources of information denied to me, if he knows who the offenders are. I have stated the progress that has been made.

265,Mr DEAKIN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"In reply to' the honimply orable member for Coolgardie, during the time. I was in the House no statement was made reflecting upon the character of Judge Murray. The only statement that 1. heard that could have been chalway lenged, and that was challenged almost mediately, was to the effect that he had been the '' head and front of the offendfact ing "" in connection with the against the late Administrator of Papua, Captain Barton. The word ""offending,"" or the implication that there was' any offence in giving evidence on that inatter, of course inappropriate, and cannot be tained. Judge Murray, as he then was, gave evidence in that connection of a very important character. . That was He could not have avoided it if he had desired - He was bound to state the facts he knew them, and to give his own opinions. That he did. Although it is not unnatural that the friends of the late Administrator should resent his evidence, yet the only implication that I heard was the phrase have quoted.",46
266,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Did not some private conversations at a dinner table ?,46
267,Mr DEAKIN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"My recollection is that he repeated conversations which took place on board the Merrie England- a public vessel belonging to the Government, and not to any private person-relating ' to the management of Papua and the attitude adopted towards white settlers. I am speaking from memory, bus that is my recollection. It was alleged on behalf of the. then Administrator that those conversations ought to have been considered | t i vileged, because they took place at a dinner table. My recollection'of the rejoinder is that this was practically a public dinner table, at which all the public officers on board attended without needing to be invited, and without being indebted to any one's hospitality.",46

269,Mr DEAKIN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"It was alleged that even at meal times it was really an official gathering, and that official matters were bediscussed in a way that did not preclude being referred to outside. In any case, whatever may have been said in that regard, it would not have justified the imthat an officer who gave evidence the policy pursued in the Possession was an offender. The word did not a charge, because it forms part of a well-known quotation. I took it that the word was loosely applied. Moreover, the statement was replied to by the honourable member for Coolgardie or by others in a that called for no further statement imon the part of the Government.",46
270,Mr MAHON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I called attention to the that the Royal Commission completely charges exonerated Judge Murray ,46
271,Mr DEAKIN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"That is so.
