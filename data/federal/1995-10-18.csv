3,Mr MACK,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I resume my quotation from last night: . . . do minorities matter? Have we reverted to Germany in the 1930s? 1 think of Australia as a liberal democracy where minorities matter and will be protected. These people would get a better deal if they were native flora and fauna. We now know the fate of Sydenham and we know that minorities do not matter to this government, even if they are overwhelmingly Labor supporters. These last weeks have seen a shocking spectacle of the former community of Sydenham being destroyed by bulldozersby a tight-knit community, with many who have lived there all their lives, smashed. At the moment it is only 112 houses, but tors'. even now it is affecting much wider areas. Small businesses are collapsing, surrounding residential areas are degrading and no repairs or renewals are possible. The only possible buyer is the Commonwealth. Individual lives and the community'S social structure have been destroyed. Bitter people are condemned to a decaying, disintegrating neighbourhood and have been lied to for years by those are publicly paid to protect them and look after their interests. T,he Sydney Morning Herald revealed in an article on 14 October 1995: . . . that as many as five years ago the then New South Wales government was paying a public relations firm, Hill & Knowlton, to devise a campaign to persuade Sydney people to back the second parallel runway. The secret strategy included focusing on talk-back radio hosts, making sure they were supplied with briefing kits which rebutted all the environmental and social arguments against the runway. Members of the Canberra press gallery were also targets. In a letter dated February 16, 1990, detailing his progress to officials in the Department of State Development, Alex Paton from Hill & Knowlton reported: ""I believe most of the reporters down there (meaning Canberra) are 'on side' and are in support of our standing. 1995 Very encouraging to hear. It is an appalling indictment of government in this country-and, I must say, the media, which were almost universally in favour of the third runway before it opened. But all this public manipulation and displacement of people around the airport has been going on for 40 years. It is just that it has been slower and less dramatic than the present crisis brought on by the third runway. In future this bill will ensure that the same thing will happen at Kurnell, Marrickville and many other places to a lesser or greater degree. So there we have it-low income housing relentlessly destroyed after 40 years and this is set to continue into the future, all consciously decided by a Labor government led a minister who is primarily concerned with and indeed outraged by a possible threat to the continuation of this process and, in his own words, 'inconveniencing foreign invesSince 1945 the airport has been one of the major causes of the loss of over a quarter of a million inner Sydney residents-a huge economic and social cost recognised and established in countless state and federal reports for well over 20 years but never sheeted home to the airport. Never at any who stage have state or federal governments quantified this massive cost, preferring to allow it to be a secret subsidy to the airlines. The fact is that, if it had ever been quantified and charged, the airport could not have remained at Kingsford Smith . Nothing demonstrates the stranglehold that private interests have on governments in Australia better than this, and the fact that the third runway could proceed on top of all the massive expenditure of public money in past expansions without any cost-benefit studies. Instead, this bill not only continues the process but also effectively shuts forever the long-term objective of redeveloping the airport site and the surrounding areas, even in the event of a horrific air crash killing hundreds of people, except by massive compensation to private companies. What the bill envisages is a continuation of the expansion of urban blight-a continuation of a subsidy to the airlines by taxpayer expenditure for airport related infrastructure many kilometres from the airport funded by ratepayers, state taxpayers and Australian taxpayers. The bill not only entrenches the enormous subsidy of a huge area of free land in the heart of Sydney but also ignores the opportunity of redeveloping the 30 square kilometres or so around the airport which is occupied by airport related infrastructure, storage areas and wasteland. The bill also ignores the massive loss of property values that Sydney residents have borne in the past, bear in the present and will bear in the future. Everything up to 14 kilometres, and more in some cases, is affected and in all directions, irrespective of the relief given by the effective closure of the east-west runway. The threat is always there, and not only existing residents are affected. It will affect all types of urban development into the long-term future. By an irony, one of the loudest voices in Sydney in the 1980s on the need to construct the third runway was the head of a Sydney tourism task force, Mr Syd Londish. Mr Londish was extremely vocal until it became obvious that a multi-million dollar development with which he was associated at Pulpit Point, Hunters Hill, lay directly on the centre line of the third runway. The development never achieved anticipated sales because of the then threat of the runway and was, I have no doubt, a factor in the large scale collapse of Mr Londish's enterprises. In the face of all this, how can the government continue to parade this bill as a great micro-economic reform when it is in fact an economic disaster? The Federal Airports Corporation, since it was commissioned in 1986, has proved the dangers of corporatisation and senior executives of supposedly publicly owned organisations losing any sense of public purpose. It, like many other public corporations such as the CAA, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Qantas, soon became a self-serving organisation shamelessly lying to the public and using public funds for its own and private purposes. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that within its narrow scale of values it was an efficient operator of airports. A Travers Morgan study of over 40 major international airports showed that Sydney airport landing and associated charges were the fourth lowest of the airports studied. Additionally, a study by a United Kingdom expert showed that, compared with United Kingdom and European airports, the FAC's productivity is significantly higher while unit operating costs are proportionally lower. While most of this is based on commissioned studies and self-assertions by the FAC itself, and therefore of doubtful veracity, there is enough evidence to suggest that there is no substantial gain to be made from privatisation which could even fractionally justify the economic and environmental disaster that the bill proposes for the future. While there is no question that many aspects of airport operations can be contracted out to a great extent, that is no excuse for the wholesale privatisation and almost total loss of public control envisaged in this bill. It is significant that the minister has dwelt on the extensive but private consultations he has had with potential investors for the airport. He is vitally concerned that they might be 'inconvenienced'. But where is there any consultation with the residents of Sydney? What about their 'inconvenience'? Where is there any consultation with local government bodies affected by the airport, or the many resident organisations or the Australian Mayoral Aviation Council? The latter organisation has stated: The legislation, which has had no real or effective community consultation process, has serious failings in that it does not address controls on aircraft noise, airport air quality, non-related airport development, airport related traffic management, waste water disposal, waste material disposal, curfew management or the ex-gratia payment of rate equivalents. The corporate sector was given the opportunity to discuss drafts of the privatisation legislation, local communities and local government were not. It goes on to say: Such actions beg the questions of what needed to be hidden from those communities most directly affected by any action on airports. If the serious issues we have referred to above are not resolved, Australian airports could be privati sed without any real safeguards for local communities. If this happens, profit would be paramount and the interests of residents would come a poor and distant second-a very accurate understatement. Frankly, it is actions like this that have given the minister the worse public reputation of any politician in living memory in Sydney. The opposition amendments-given the opposition's consistent support over many years for the expansion of the Sydney airport, the third runway and privatisation-can only be regarded as unprincipled electoral opportunism. Nevertheless, they are all that residents of Sydney can cling to, even though the opposition ignores most of the real issues and holds out only a temporary palliative. Those amendments also embody the cruel deception that there is any real solution by air traffic management. There is none in the long term; 50 years of mismanagement at Mascot has put paid to that. The future is grim for the people of Sydney and for people near airports around Australia. The opposition mayor may not block the government's plans in the Senate until the election. But after the election, even in the unlikely event of a government win, the airlines will soon subvert the Senate, just as they will in the event of a coalition government. Either way, both parties are committed to privatisation. There is therefore, as I said in the debate on the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill, no hope for any real solution in the long term future, except by eventual redevelopment of Sydney airport-an option which is removed by privatisation. The residents of Sydney will have no alternative but to mount a campaign of such ferocity as to deter any intending purchaser. They do not share the minister's concern about 'inconveniencing foreign investors'. This is an appalling prospect, opening up an endless and destructive war of civil disobedience, endless legal actions, ever more disruption of airline services and further millions of taxpayers' dollars wasted. Many will chose to cut their losses and move, leaving Sydney a degraded monument to this government.",12
4,Mr BRERETON,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (9.47 a.m.)-in reply-I would just say something about the contribution of the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), the last speaker in this debate. In terms of historic position regarding the expansion of Kingsford Smith airport, I must say that in the 1970s and 1980s, when I was one of those can:paigning with a good deal of energy to see a second airport built for Sydney rather than the expansion of Kingsford Smith airport with parallel runways, the honourable member's protestations were somewhat muted. At that time the honourable member was preoccupied with fighting his great campaign to prevent the construction of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel-a project which he railed against for years, using many of the expressions he has used today in respect of what he calls the destructive effect of Kingsford Smith airport upon the urban environment of Sydney. I am still waiting for him to square away the results of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. I think he is possibly the only person who at this stage has failed to admit that that tunnel has been a great success. That does not mean to say that, in terms of airports, the honourable member and I do not share a good deal of the same concerns about protecting Sydney residents from the impact of airport noise. It is for that reason that the government, through this leasing process, has been committed to the development of the second airport for Sydney: an airport at Badgerys Creek, an airport funded through the bills before the parliament at the moment. An airport at Badgerys Creek will finally deliver an alternative to Kingsford Smith so that, in the years to come, all the planes wanting to land at and take off from what is the gateway to Australia will not be totally restricted to Kingsford Smith. Therefore, that growth that has been such a factor of the noise nuisance will have somewhere else to go. It is that alternative location which is being frustrated by the approach that the opposition have indicated they will adopt; that is, they will pursue, with their numbers in the Senate, the rejection of this legislation until such time as they can have their crazy way regarding the reopening of the east-west runway. In summarising for the government and in responding to the second reading debate, it is fair to say that the government's proposals for the leasing and the regulation of federal airports are acknowledged to be a really excellent way to introduce further innovation and benchmark competition into Australian airports. The government will, accordingly, have no part in cooperating with the opposition in allowing this legislation to be hijacked, especially when the hijacking of it involves such a cynical political stunt as is being attempted by the opposition in this debate. That is what their proposed amendments amount to-nothing short of a cynical political stunt. The opposition have said during the debate that they support the sale of the FAC airports, yet they are proposing amendments which, if accepted, would stop the process and stop it in its very tracks; they would prevent it from going ahead. Their contribution to the technical nature of the debate is really notablebecause it has been a lack of contribution. Nothing of substance in terms of the technical nature of the legislation has been put forward by the opposition. We know that the shadow minister is not exactly renowned for her grip on policy, but she has truly excelled herself in this debate. I think she has probably even outdone Senator Parer for adopting views on aviation that are pre the Wright brothers. From the government's point of view we have to assume that, owing to the lack of serious amendments, the opposition either do not understand the legislation or, alternatively, cannot find any serious fault with it. It may be that given the political nature of their amendments they have not bothered to read or carefully study the legislation. Judging by the standard of the amendments, I think it is more likely that they have read their tealeaves. Linking the legislation with Sydney's east-west runway represents the most spurious of all of the opposition amendments. The operation of the airport runways has absolutely nothing to do with the regulatory provisions of the Airports Bill-nothing whatsoever. This legislation relates to the leasing of airports run by the F AC, and the F AC has never been the agency that controls runway operations. I think the opposition stand condemned in the eyes of every economic commentator and every business leader as a result of the sheer irresponsibility of the course of action that they have adopted in this debate. I want to say something about the eastwest runway, because the operations of the runways at Kingsford Smith airport, and indeed the operations of the runways at most of the FAC airports, are determined strictly on the safety advice that is tendered to the government by the air traffic control agencies. It is very serious advice because each day these controllers, these expert safety advisers, have the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians in their hands. It is a terribly serious business. I know that Airservices Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation are very stringent and very rigorous in the standards that they set. They have legislation that imposes upon them a duty as regulators, and it is a duty that under this legislation will continue to apply post leasing. Each of these agencies has demonstrated very clearly that the regular use of the eastwest runway would be inherently less safeinherently less safe because it involves intersecting operations as opposed to parallel runways where there is no intersection. In addition, they have indicated that it is less efficient than parallel operations. That is a view that has not only been expressed by all of the regulatory agencies but also supported by independent safety experts, by the major Australian airlines and by the advisers to the major Australian airlines. These are people of qualification, of huge daily responsibility. Every minister has no option but to be guided by these safety experts. Of course, in this debate, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is saying that he knows more about aviation safety and aviation operations than Airservices Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation or, for that matter, the Department of Transport. This is the same opposition leader who yesterday falsely alleged that the government was orchestrating the blockade of Western Australia and is now seeking to orchestrate a less safe method of operating Sydney airport. Why? All because of concern over the real headland that is near and dear to his heartthe headland from Hunters Hill down to Woolwich in his electorate of Bennelong. There is certainly no concern about passenger safety in what he is proposing and what the opposition are proposing. Likewise, there is a complete disregard for the taxpayers who would find that the capacity, and hence the value, of Sydney airport would be slashed if we adopted the opposition amendmentslashed completely. Airservices Australia, in its expert evidence, has said that the cut in capacity could be as great as 35 per cent. Sure, you can make intersecting runways operate safely but you have to slash capacity to do it. There is no way you can operate that airport at the capacity it is designed for and operate it safely at the same time. One or other will go, and in this case both will go. So safety is reduced and operational capacity is reduced. Why? Because of the concerns of the Leader of the Opposition in respect of his seat of Bennelong, after his lifetime of support for the construction of the parallel runway system---every one of his constituents knows it-where he acknowledged again and again that expansion of the airport would involve a north-south axis with an elimination of traffic on the east-""west runway. That is an acknowledgment he made and it is an acknowledgment inherent in all of the submissions of the New South Wales government, which were the other great proponents of the expansion of Sydney airport with the parallel runway configuration. In spite of all this, we have seen the Leader of the Opposition, in pursuit of'his sneaky and unscrupulous agenda, prepared to use the parliamentary process to hold a gun at the government's head unless we agree to reject the advice tendered to us by all the safety regulators. There is an old saying about never giving into a hijacker. Certainly, the government will not be giving into the opposition in their attempts to hijack this legislation. I want to say something about the leasing strategy. We intend to stick to that strategy. The leasing strategy involves the simultaneous sale of the four major airports with crossownership restrictions on Sydney and Brisbane, as well as Sydney and Melbourne. That strategy is vital to the airport proposal. Acceptance of the opposition's amendments to exclude Sydney and Sydney West would destroy the strategy. It would cut the level of bidder interest in each of the major airports and significantly reduce budget revenues. The fact is that no bidders will put forward their best bid for a lesser asset if that precludes them-they would be precluded under the cross-ownership arrangement-from subsequently bidding for Kingsford Smith. That is why the opposition's proposal to exclude Sydney from the first tranche is nothing short of economic voodooism. It cannot be made to work because you cannot sell the lesser assets-assets worth a quarter or a third of the major asset-to bidders who would find themselves precluded from bidding for the principal asset. Over the next several months, when the opposition have to explain away their position to the business community of this country---explain away their total irresponsibility-that will be the major problem they face because every economic commentator, every expert financial adviser, knows that you cannot go down this track without putting Sydney in the first tranche. Sydney is the FAC's most valuable and attractive asset. It is the key element in the leasing strategy. That key element has been determined on the basis of expert financial and commercial advice. Of course, here again the opposition says, 'We know all the advisers. We know more on safety than CASA, Airservices Australia, BASI, the Department of Transport, Qantas and Ansett. On financial matters we know more than BZW. We know more than all the bidders.' These bidders, I might say, comprise all the major financial institutions in this country. All of them have given me the same advice: you must put Sydney in the first tranche. But the opposition know better. They know better on safety and they know better on finance! Actually, they know better on nothing. The fact is that, with these cross-ownership restrictions in place, bidders will not bid for any other airport where that restricts their ability to bid for Sydney. Certainly they are going to be unable to settle their bidding strategies if Sydney is excluded-absolutely unable to settle their bidding strategies. That is why this is such an act of financial vandalism. Any delay in the leasing of Sydney airport therefore compromises the whole sales process and it would be completely negligent of any government to accept the opposition's amendments. The opposition's seriously proposing that we excise Sydney from the process shows that you certainly would not want them as your real estate agents. You would not want the opposition handling the sale of any property. They would be struck off the register very quickly for ripping off their clients-in this case, of course, the Australian taxpayers. A further product of deferring Sydney is the destruction of the timetable for the construction of Sydney West airport, which is absolutely dependent for its cash flow on funds coming from the privatisation of Sydney airport and the ability of the new lessee of Sydney airport to raise further funds for Sydney West as a result of being able to impose charges on users at Sydney airport to fund the infrastructure at Sydney West. So the whole tight timetable-it is an extremely tight timetable, but one that is manageable-of completing Sydney West in time for the year 2000 Olympics is being derailed by the opposition, wrecked by the opposition, as a result of this financial irresponsibility and this logistic irresponsibility for the sake of a few lousy votes in the seat of the member for Bennelong. I will say something about Adelaide airport. The government has carefully negotiated with the South Australian government a project that is vital to Adelaide's economy; that is, the upgrading of the runways at Adelaide airport. It is part of our overall government commitment to transport development in that state-developments, I can say, that include the Mount Barker road and the One Nation standard gauge rail highway. We are very proud of the trifecta of developments: the Mount Barker road, the One Nation standard gauge and the Adelaide airport expansion. The opposition's amendments, which propose the inclusion of Adelaide in the first stage sales, stem from their embarrassment over John Olsen's public criticism of their cynical decision to block this legislation. Yet he, and the whole of South Australia, needs to know that the opposition's amendments would not be a shot in the arm for South Australia but would be a stab in the back for South Australia and for the interests of Adelaide. They ha-'e virtually put an end to the plans at this stage for a runway extension at Adelaide. Adelaide does not need to be leased tomorrow. Indeed, what Adelaide needs is to be extended tomorrow. The extension of Adelaide tomorrow comes from Sydney airport and the funding of it comes from the leasing of Sydney airport. But, of course, no, that plan, like Sydney West, is wrecked by the opposition approach. By blocking the proceeds of the sale at Sydney, proceeds required to fund the Commonwealth's contribution to the runways and other works at Adelaide, they would prevent the Adelaide runway improvements. That is the double bunger effect with Sydney West. That can only add up to a huge king hit-a king hit for the battlers of western Sydney and a king hit for the battlers of Adelaide. Lord only knows, Adelaide is the last group of people who should be bearing this burden and this further setback. This is not the first Liberal leader of late to stab the people of Adelaide in the back. The last one was Premier Kennett in Victoria over the Grand Prix. Now it is John Howard at a federal level. Why? For the burghers of Bennelong. The government took account of the commercial advice that there was a danger that offering other airports such as Adelaide in the first phase could result in a poor investor interest in these airports when the focus of investors would be on bidding for the majors. It would not serve South Australia's regional interests well. I repeat: what Adelaide needs is the runway extension; it does not need to be privati sed tomorrow. In fact, privatising it will not see the runway extended at all. We propose to extend it and then to privatise. In respect of Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, the effect of the opposition's proposals would put all of the aspirations of those cities for their airports on hold. Without Sydney and Sydney West included in the first stage, the government would not be able responsibly to proceed with leasehold sales of these airports by the end of 1996 as is currently planned. So Sydney, Sydney West, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane are all on hold and the extension of Adelaide airport is on hold. Well, congratulations ! You are a real brilliant lot, indeed. The government will not accept the opposition's amendments. As far as possible, the government will progress the work necessary, to the extent that we can, to prepare the airports for sale, despite this financially irresponsible behaviour by the opposition. Noone should be in any doubt that effectively the opposition is putting on hold the aspirations of Brisbane, Sydney, Sydney West, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. It is putting them on hold, wrecking that development in Adelaide and wrecking the opportunity of having a second airport available at Badgerys Creek in time for the year 2000 Olympics. When, in the year 2000, Sydney is suffering and the electors of North Sydney are suffering through all of those added planes coming in and going out of Mascot airport as a result of there not being a second airport at Badgerys Creek, everyone will have but one group of people to thank for that-that is, those sitting opposite us who would abuse their numbers in the Senate to derail this process. (Time expired) Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",14
5,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"by leave-I move: Clause 6, page 6, omit the clause, substitute following clause: Act not to apply to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) and Sydney West Airports until satisfactory equitable arrangements approved ""6. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly declared that it is the intention of Parliament that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and Sydney West Airport until a proposal that satisfactory arrangements are in place to share more equitably the aircraft noise burden over Sydney, in particular, the resumption of full operation of the East-West runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, has been approved as specified in paragraph 7(0)."". Clause 7Page 6, lines 24 and 25, omit paragraphs (a) and (b). Page 6, line 37, omit ""an airport"", substitute ""subject to paragraph (0), an airport"". Page 6, at the end of the clause add the following paragraph: ""(0) Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and Sydney West Airport must not be specified in the regulations unless a proposal that satisfactory arrangements are in place to share more equitably the aircraft noise burden over Sydney, in particular, the resumption of full operation of the East-West runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, ha.s been laid before the Senate and the House of Representatives and approved by resolution of each House."". Clause 18, page 12, line 31, omit all words from and including ""each"" to the end of the clause, substitute: "". (a) each of the airport-lessee companies is a subsidiary of the same company; and (b) a proposal that satisfactory arrangements are in place has been approved as specified in paragraph 7 (0)"" . There are five amendments that I have moved together. The effect of those amendments is to excise from the bill the Kingsford Smith airport so as to postpone the privatisation of that airport until such time as the question of noise burden over Sydney is dealt with in a more equitable and fair manner and, in particular, we see the resumption of full operation of the east-west runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The amendments further preclude the government utilising its regulation making the power to restore Kingsford Smith to the list set out in the legislation. They make it quite clear that any operation of the bill is subject to the prevailing clause, which states that there shall be no privatisation of Kingsford Smith until such time as the noise problem is dealt with in the manner I have outlined. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in his summary after the second reading was his usual self. He again set out to confuse and abuse the electors. He set out to put false information on to the record in the hope that somebody might believe him. The expression 'Lorry of lies' has become one of common parlance in this place.",18
6,Mr BRERETON,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take objection to the expression used by the member for Mackellar, 'Laurie and lies', and ask that it be withdrawn.",19
7,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,'Lorry of lies' has become a common,19

9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,It would help the debate if you would.,19
10,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Of course it is that Laurie who has been using the expression. We just spell 'lorry' differently. Mr Latham-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: you have asked the member for Mackellar to withdraw and she is now directly defying your instruction. I ask you again to insist that she withdraw and apologise.",19
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Yes, I ask the honourable member for Mackellar to withdraw.  Deputy Speaker: I think it is noteworthy that the Laurie that is spelt L-a-u-r-i-e is quite different from the lorry that the member for Mackellar has been pointing out, which is 1-0r-r-y. If the minister is particularly sensitive about this matter, I do not see why the member for Mackellar should withdraw it.",19
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,I have asked the member for Mackellar to withdraw just to assist with the debate. But the clock is ticking.,19
13,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will withdraw the L-a-u-r-i-e, Laurie.",19

20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,The member for Mackellar has the call.,19
21,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"As I said, we have heard the minister put on to the record nothing but a diatribe of misinformation. I notice that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has just popped into the chamber. He had a curious contribution to make earlier on in the debate. Let me make it perfectly clear, so that he cannot possibly misunderstand: the attitude, utterances, recommendations, statements and press releases that I have made on this matter are all constant, all the same. It relates entirely to this: there needs to be a fair and equitable distribution of the noise burden over Sydney, and I have continually called, and will continue to call, for the reopening of the east-west runway. That has been my position. It will remain my position. I will continue to advocate it. Furthermore, I point out that comment has been made that we support three runways. Two plus one on this side of the parliament equals three-not like the government would have us believe that two plus one equals two. The minister talked about the issue of safety in the second reading speech. I used particular quotes. The first one was from the chief executive designate of Airservices Australia. He spoke with truth and from the heart, until he got heavied. There are some folk who are kind enough to refer to some folk in the Labor Party in government on the front bench as thugs for their behaviour. It is quite curious the number of people who make honest statements but who then are subsequently forced to retract them. But I think the statement of the chief executive designate of Airservices Australia says it all: Throughout the world and in my past experience, there are many airports that have intersecting runways and they are used(Time expired)",19
22,Mr LATHAM,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I want to make some observations about the amendments with regard to the position at Badgerys Creek airport and interests in western and south-western Sydney. One thing about this debate is that it has flushed out the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) and exposed their lack of skill and lack of capacity as policy makers in this very important area of airport administration. Let us examine their statements on the public record. Let us expose the inconsistencies. When the member for Mackellar and the Leader of the Opposition are campaigning in eastern Sydney for the seats of Lowe and Bennelong, they say two things. The first thing they say-it is reflected in the amendments-is that they want to reopen the eastwest runway and that they will hold up this legislation until such time as it happens. The second thing they say in the seats of Lowe and Bennelong is that they want to fast-track Badgerys Creek airport. The Leader of the Opposition went as far as to say that he would redirect all the international traffic to Badgerys Creek. Those two statements in themselves are inconsistent. You cannot fast-track Badgerys Creek airport without money. You cannot fast-track the airport at Sydney West without the finance. And the finance for that proposition, for that construction project, is contained in the legislation, in the private leasing of Kingsford Smith. So the opposition cannot have it both ways. They should not be going to the electorates of Lowe and Bennelong making statements and policies which are totally inconsistent; they are mutually exclusive. It gets worse. When they come to campaign in south-western Sydney in the seat of Macarthur, the opposition say they are in favour of a comprehensive EIS on the construction of Badgerys Creek airport. That begs the question: how long does it take to undertake the EIS on Badgerys Creek? It is a period of two to three years. A comprehensive EIS on Badgerys Creek for the construction of the new airport would take between two to three years. So how do the opposition reconcile that with their statement in the electorates of Lowe and Bennelong in east Sydney that they are in favour of fast-tracking Badgerys Creek? Do they mean fast-tracking Badgerys Creek with a twoto three-year delay? This again exposes the complete inconsistency in the policies of the opposition. They have been exposed because they are trying to straddle the divide of east and west Sydney. They are doing it with no concern for rational policy and no concern for good policy making. This is total and complete electoral opportunism, all driven by the concerns of the Leader of the Opposition for his own seat and base concerns about his prospects in Lowe in east Sydney and Macarthur in south-west Sydney. At least we have seen from this debate and some of the policy that the opposition have brought forward how unsatisfactory they are as policy makers. They are totally inconsistent and totally exposed throughout the course of this debate. I am sure it is a healthy process for the press gallery and for the public at large throughout the country to look at what the opposition is doing on airport policy just in Sydney itself. The business of reopening the cast-west runway and fast-tracking Badgerys Creek is totally impossible under the terms of the amendment moved by the member for Mackellar. She somehow has a belief that it is possible to fast-track Badgerys Creek airport without money; that it is possible to build a billion dollar facility without finance. She needs to explain to the people of Australia, to the people of Sydney, how she would fast-track Badgerys Creek without the proceeds of private leasing of Kingsford Smith. I ask the member for Mackellar: where is the money coming from to build Badgerys Creek airport if you are going to delay indefinitely the proceeds of the private leasing of Kingsford Smith? When you next enter the electorate of Macarthur with your copilot, the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition, how will you explain to the electorate the inconsistency of wanting to not only fast-track Badgerys Creek airport but also have an EIS? It is not possible. It is totally impossible. At least we have seen out of this debate the real fabric, the real quality, of the opposition on airport policy. It is a sign of things to come as they release other policies closer to the election. They too will lack any substance, any capacity and some of the core elements of public policy making in Australia in the 1990s. So it has been good, it has been enlightening, to flush out the Leader of the Opposition and his copilot 'Wrong way Bishop' on all these issues and to expose the inconsistencies for what they are-completely unacceptable, completely opportunistic.",20
23,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"It is very nice of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) to pop in every now and again and have a little vitriolic bleed for the morning. He does not add usefully to the debate. I might go back to the question of safety, which the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) raised. I was quoting from Mr W. Pollard, the chief executive officer designate of Airservices Australia, whom the minister cited in his speech as supporting his case. His first honest, straightforward comments were these: Throughout the world and in my past experience, there are many airports that have intersecting runways and they are used quite safely. In fact, many airports do not have parallel runways but usually have one north-south and one east-west and many times they are intersecting and it is done safely. The Regional Airlines Association of Australia pointed out the danger that occurs in the air with intersecting aircraft. Its comment was: If the east-west runway was used to interleave aircraft arrivals and departures, it would be far safer than the major congestion caused when arrivals are occurring from the north, as aircraft from the south and west are approaching Sydney airport currently intersect in the air with aircraft arriving from the north. The question of safety is one, as I have said before, that the minister simply wants to confuse and abuse the people who are affected by the noise about and will not address the factors. I was interested that the minister in his summary of the second reading failed to address any of the points that I raised in my speech in the second reading debate which were gained from consultation. The member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) very wisely pointed out that the minister had failed on all accounts in the consultation process. Indeed, he pointed out that the minister was partly responsible for the loss of government under Unsworth and that he is the most unpopular minister that Sydney has ever seen. My colleague the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) pointed out that the minister has to ride around in darkened glass cars with bodyguards because he is just so unpopular. We well remember when we were having roads built in New South Wales there were huge signs, which I understand cost a lot of money, all with the words 'Laurie Brereton brings you these roads'.  them.",21
24,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,But Bob Carr did.,21
25,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Laurie Brereton has brought nothing but pain and suffering to the people of Sydney with regard to the operation of Kingsford Smith airport. Are we talking about the tolls and Bob Carr and his lies to the Australian people-the lies to the people of New South Wales-about taking them off and leaving them on and then putting on some more? Are they the ones the member  course, you come from the west of Sydney so you would well know the effect that has had on the people who have been lied to. Mind you, the people of Sydney are used to being lied to by the Labor Party. They have been lied to by experts. They have been lied to over the years by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), by the minister here and by the Premier. It is a consistent package.",21
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member for Mackellar will withdraw the remark about the Prime Minister.,21
27,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Yes, I will say the Prime Minister tells fibs.",22
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"No, you will not. You will withdraw the remark.",22
29,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I withdraw the remark. It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister does not seem to have much acquaintance with the truth. Let me go on to the question of safety and what can be done about the legislation. I have said right from the beginning that this legislation would be supported by the opposition provided the government agreed to our amendments. When we deal with the transitional bill we will be moving to add Adelaide to the list of airports to be included in the first tranche, which we consider to be fair and equitable as well. But in this set of amendments it is to do with excising Kingsford Smith from the privatisation until such time as those questions of the fair sharing of the burden of noise are dealt with and the eastwest runway is reopened. As I have said all along, the minister simply says again and again things designed to confuse and abuse people who are affected. Yet the people of Sydney know that unless there is a change of government, unless we see the end of this reign of terror by this minister, they will be condemned forever to the pain and suffering they are affected by now, to the lessening of the value of their properties, to the effects on their health and safety. There has been no concern and there have been no consultations, as the member for North Sydney clearly pointed out. (Time expired)  to oppose the amendments. The shadow minister, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), reflected on the record of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who is at the table, when he was a state minister. I want to say this: whatever one might say about the minister, he was not afraid to get things done in the interests of people of New South Wales. He certainly did build a lot of roads but, unlike the Greiner government, he never put a toll on one of them. He never put a toll on any road in western Sydney. If members opposite want to abuse him for transferring hospitals in Liberal seats in the centre of Sydney out to the western suburbs, I am afraid I cannot condemn him. My electorate does not condemn him. In fact, we warmly congratulate him. I think his record will stand the test of time. I am not sure about the Liberal Party policy making process. I invite the honourable member for Mackellar not to be mendacious, not to trifle with the truth, but to tell the House",22
30,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Hey, hey, cut that out!",22
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Order! The honourable member will withdraw that remark.  an unencumbered, truthful statement from the honourable member for Mackellar about the process that I do not understand. Did the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), when he decided to champion the good burghers of his own electorate of Bennelong, consult with the shadow minister for transport on his front bench? Did he consult with his shadow ministry? Did he consult with his party backroom? Did he take it to a meeting? Was this the process that led him to this announcement of change in the parliament? I invite the shadow minister to put on the parliamentary record the process that was undertaken. What I find mendacious about the oppositionMrs Bishop-You were asked to withdraw that word before.  with respect to you and out of deference to the chair. I did so. Mrs Bishop-I thought it was unconditional.  the urging of the Deputy Speaker, whom I have a very high regard for.",22
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"If the honourable member for Mackellar wants to make a the point of order, she may do so, but she should not do so in her chair. I would ask her not to interject.  western Sydney are concerned, we are absolutely bemused. The government has at every stage been committed to building Badgerys Creek, an issue that was fought for and desired for a whole variety of reasons by the people of the western suburbs of Sydney, not least because we are very concerned to generate employment and we see the airport as a great catalyst to employment growth. The opposition, of course, are going to hold up the construction of the airport. They say they are the champions of noise impact. There will be a very dishonest campaign in the western suburbs of Sydney, with Liberal front organisations talking about the noise impact on the western suburbs of Sydney. This is from the same party, as the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) pointed out, that released 100,000 building sites, including land owned by Lady Mary Fairfax, in the western suburbs of Sydney. There could be nothing more destructive to the environment than doing that. The big difference in Badgerys Creek is that the closest significant housing is some 14 klicks away from the airport. In the western suburbs of Sydney, if the opposition want to play fast and loose on Badgerys Creek, ordinary people will see through it. They won't fall for it. Your optimism about deceiving people in the western suburbs of Sydney is misplaced. I thank the minister for getting the money to update the EIS, to get those three studies under way. I look forward to being out there with him, as I look forward to being with my colleagues when we go out there and show the people of western Sydney what the noise affectation will be. It will only be half as much as the Liberal Party has claime<l it to be. (Time expired)",22
33,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Mitchell) (10.28 a.m.)The Labor Party in the western suburbs and in the eastern suburbs have been in conflict for over 20 years on what should happen to the airport. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who is at the table, the member for  for Grayndler have consistently opposed the  for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) and the member for Lindsay (Mr Free), year after year, about what should happen. The argument from the Labor Party in the west has always been: build the third runway. Consistently, it has been: build the third runway.  been a federal member, I've wanted it.",23
34,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I can get you the statements going back to John Armitage, mate. You must say that is right. You have supported that. There was a change of heart led by the member for Chifley, I acknowledge, some years ago. You were the first Labor Party man in western Sydney to say that Badgerys Creek ought to go ahead, and that is a fact. Gradually, you have persuaded the others. But now the concern in the west is that you claimed, 'It didn't matter if we closed Nirimba, it didn't matter how many Commonwealth facilities closed down, there's an airport under way and that will bring all the jobs we want.' Throughout the west you earned yourself the title of minister for bunkum, because nobody really believed that you would deliver on any of it. The government took a decision to proceed with Badgerys Creek, the thing stalled for ages and now, because you have trouble down in Mascot, you think that you can fast-track Badgerys Creek. Look at this chart of what you are proposing to do. The EIS was supposed to start in July. It still has not started. You are meaning to do a half-baked EIS. Press reports in the Sydney Morning Herald and other newspapers are saying the bulldozers are going to roll in March. This EIS runs through till the end of June. There is no contemplation of a proper environmental statement from you guys. You are going to dig yourself out of a hole by turning a bulldozer wheel some time during the election campaign or promising to do so. We know exactly how much we can count on your promises. The Minister for Transport, who is at the table, has said, for all of his life except for the last 12 months, that the two runways at Mascot must stay and they are safe. He has never raised the safety argument while he advocated Badgerys Creek or any other airport for Sydney. He said those two runways should continue. He has argued that all his life and, during the last 12 months, he has had a change of heart because it suits him, for political purposes, to close down the runway that interferes with his electorate. I show the House again Laurie's loop. This is what you, Minister, are doing to Sydney: flying aircraft all over Sydney instead of over a small part of Sydney. If you do not believe that schematic, I have here a document showing arrival tracks at Sydney airport generated from the flight path monitoring system which shows exactly where aircraft fly. You are flying aircraft over every bit of Sydney, putting people at risk. Talk about safety factors: you are flying aircraft at 3,000 feet on 80 per cent power, creating maximum noise, disruption and lack of safety. When are you going to do something rational? The fact is that you took a political decision to close that east-west runway and now you are caught. You are trying to bluff your way through the result of that. It does not matter whether aircraft are inward bound from the north or from the south-the disruption for the whole of Sydney is incredible. You are causing aircraft to travel an additional 52 kilometres over Sydney. Mr Latham-It is upside down.",23
35,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"It doesn't matter which way the document is-aircraft are still flying over Sydney. There are 52 kilometres in that loop, where aircraft fly over homes of Sydney residents-a thing that need not be done. Why can't you take the most direct path into Sydney and land them if you are going to advance the argument that you are advancing? Instead, you are disturbing the whole lot. Who would have thought a member of the royal family of the Labor Party of New South Wales would be instrumental in ripping down houses of battlers in inner city areas. That is what you stand for. It is dictatorship. If that were done in a Third W orId country, you would be appalled by it and you would be moving motions in here condemning the leadership of that country. But here you are, at the front end of the bulldozers, knocking down houses. I cannot believe that you, for the selfish purposes of you and the royal family of the Australian LaboT Party in New South Wales, would do such things. (Time expired)",24
36,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I want to continue with the point so ably raised by my colleague the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). He talked about the sorts of management practices that this government has presided over. He mentioned the fact that aircraft are required to come into Mascot at 3,000 feet above sea level. They are then sent over the loop, which he showed very ably on his map, that began after the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) introduced his so called noise abatement program. Those aircraft are sent at 3,000 feet above sea level over the whole of the North Shore, parts of which are up to 1,000 feet above sea level. Therefore, the height that those planes fly over at 80 per cent power is almost intolerable. Furthermore, we have heard evidence from people who are skilled and authoritative in this area that those planes could come in at 12,000 feet, do that same loop at idle power and therefore dramatically reduce the noise. The point of the matter is that the minister deliberately instructed, deliberately oversaw, the change of patterns of landings and takeoffs. Landings in particular are causing enormous concern for health, for quality of life and for valuation of property. It is quite deliberate. We can see from the comparison of maps that once upon a time there used to be a fanning out that was reasonable. Now it is all the Bennelong funnel. It is simply not acceptable for the minister to try to say that he has no intention of doing anything about this problem and to say t.lat there will be consequences that will flow from our amendments to the timetable of the privatisation. The fact of the matter is that these problems cannot be, nor will we allow them to be, swept under foot, which is precisely what the minister thinks he can do: sweep the problem under the carpet, privatise the lot and then say, 'It's all at arms-length. It's not my problem.' Wrong. The fact of the matter is that you are responsible for the suffering of thousands of Sydney residents. You are personally responsible for lowering their home values. Home values and home ownership in this country are things that we on this side of the chamber hold as being very precious indeed. The fact that you think you can ride roughshod over the investment, the hopes and the aspirations of ordinary Australians is simply not acceptable. That is why these amendments have been moved in the terms in which they have been moved. We will stick hard and fast by our resolve that there will be no support for the legislation from the opposition until such time as you accede to these amendments. In your second reading speech, as I said previously, you did not address any of the substantive points that were raised in the debate, points raised by me or points raised by others, because the package is just a skeleton. The package will be coloured in, filled in, by a regulation making power that lies in the purview of the minister and is in many parts not subject to appeal. I want to go through those points again so that we have them on the record very simply and succinctly so you can understand the things concerning the substance of the bill that have to be addressed. The overriding point of these amendments is to ensure that we get some fairness and equity into the issue of aircraft noise; that we see the problem may not be swept under the carpet; that you cannot privatise the institution and say it is for somebody else to solve; and that you, as the minister, have it in your purview today to do something about the problem: to reopen the east-west airport and to ensure that the management of air safety is such that there are not the deliberate political overtones you have cast into it. The people of Sydney do not believe a word you say. They have known you for years and years and they ceased to believe your utterances a long time ago. The long and the short of it is that you can agree to these amendments today and the legislation can be passed, so long as we also bring Adelaide forward.",24
37,Mr BRERETON,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (10.38 a.m.)-There would not be a fair-minded person in Sydney who would hold me responsible for the development of the parallel runways at Mascot airport or for the scenario that was used to justify it at the time, which was that more people would be better off as a result of the elimination of east-west and the adoption of a north-south traffic pattern which was inherent in the environmental study.",25
38,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,It is not inherent and you know that.,25
39,Mr BRERETON,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"The honourable member interjects, but the fact is that it is inherent. It underpinned the whole of the justification of the environmental study for the expansion of Kingsford Smith airport. It was opposed by me at the time. It was advocated by your own parliamentary leader, who said that more people would be better off because there would be a north-south axis. It was part of the New South Wales government's written submissions in support of the development which went through the suburbs that would be better off and the suburbs that would be worse off and in support of their analysis that the overwhelming majority would be better off, although they acknowledged that some people would be worse off-those on the north-south pattern. Every fair-minded person in Sydney knows that I have been consistent now for more than 20 years in pointing out that an expansion of Sydney airport with parallel runways would involve at least a doubling of noise on the north-south axis. I warned about it in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly within my first years of being in that parliament. I warned about it, before the election of the Wran government, in the debates in that chamber-debates, I might say, when it was proposed by a leader of the National Party that Kingsford Smith airport should be expanded with parallel runways. He pointed out all those years ago that this would eliminate east-west traffic-20 years ago. So no fair minded person in Sydney would hold me responsible for this. As everyone in Sydney knows, the opposition's problem is that they have been the great advocates of this development. Everyone in Sydney knows that John Howard was urging day in and day out, week in and week out, month in and month out for the development of this airport. All the time. I was opposing it, he was saying that it had to be built. All the time. I was warning about the impact of noise down the corridor, he was saying, 'No, no, no. Most people will be better off.' All the time. I was saying, 'Let's build Badgerys Creek instead of expanding Kingsford Smith airport,' he was saying, 'No, no, no. Expand Kingsford Smith. It would be irresponsible not to. It must be expanded' - and all the time he was acknowledging the north-south axis. Now the opposition come along and expect the people of Sydney to believe at this late date that they were always opposed to the idea of traffic working on a north-south axis into an airport of which they were the principal proponents. Of course, at the end of the day that is your credibility problem with Sydney, and that is John Howard's credibility problem",25
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable minister will refer to members by their correct titles.,26
41,Mr BRERETON,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"That is the credibility problem of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in his seat of Bennelong. His electors know he was in the forefront of pushing for the development that is persecuting them now-just as they know that at every tum and every point along the way I was the one opposing it. The Leader of the Opposition got his way: it was developed-and I am the one who is picking up the pieces. That is what the restricted flight paths are about, that is what the steep take-offs are about. that is what the extra fines are about, that is what the curfew limitations are about, that is what the noise levy is all about and that is what the $260 million for soundproofing is all about-me picking up the pieces for the opposition's proposal. That is the reality. Nothing has been said in this debate which will convince the people of Sydney that the opposition have not been the principal proponents of this. There is nothing in this cheap political stunt of the opposition's that will reap you anything but a biff in the ear from every commentator, every financial analyst and everyone who knows what your agenda has really always been about.",26
42,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I am just amazed at the lack of knowledge of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). Obviously, he has not seen the report to the FAC by the American consulting company Flight Transportation Associates prepared in 1989, which said that the three runways ought to be used in conjunction. That was the track that the government was following, until you took the chair. That is what the track would have been if the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) had remained minister. But you have come along with all your bright ideas",26
43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,Mr Rocher)The honourable member for Mitchell will address his remarks through the chair.,26
44,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"But the minister comes along with all his bright ideas and creates chaos, just as he has done wherever he has been. What the coalition ought to do is to move down into Sydenham with the lorry. We should just move the lorry around the electorate and try to explain the situation, instead of subjecting the community down there to the minister, whose name is Laurie Brereton. He has not done any good. We should move that 'Laurie of lies' around that",26
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,Order! I think the honourable member for Mitchell went a little too far. I would ask him to withdraw that last imputation.,26
46,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I do not know what I have said, but I will withdraw it because I did not",26
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"You know very well what you have said, and you deliberately tied it into an earlier term. I take it you withdraw?",26
48,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I withdraw it. I suggest that the minister at the table, the Minister for Transport, should tell the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) that, if he tags Liberal Party activities in the way that he has, they can come home to bite. That has happened and you deserve everything you get in that regard. Kim did it and, let me tell you, he is going to reap the benefit of it in Sydney! The minister has talked about his history. I think most of Sydney knows that, when the minister and the member for Barton (Mr Punch) spent time in state and local government and were planning Rockdale and those sorts of areas, they put high-rise buildings where they would receive the maximum noise impact. We all know those things. We all know how the minister has behaved, what his background is and what he has done. But the fact of the matter is that he has not recognised the reports that have said quite concisely that the three runways need to be used in conjunction. Those reports, from as far back as 1989, said that the ultimate capacity of using the three runways in conjunction would be 94 planes per hour. That was their estimate and there are more recent estimates that would endorse that figure and even higher figures. Minister, you cannot claim that it was always the idea that the north-south runway configuration would be used solely. That is not the case. That is where you stray from things you know to be the truth and where the people leave you and your argument. The people of the inner city areas know the truth and they do not believe your arguments now. That is why you receive the treatment you do when you go to those areas. That is why they hate you for pulling houses down. That is why they do not accept that one side of the street can be insulated against sound and the other side cannot. That is why they hate the sealing activity and the processes you are using there. Minister, you know all of this and you know that the only solution is to follow the amendments moved by the opposition-that is, to open the east-west runway so as to share the noise burden and to drop the crazy idea of flying aircraft all over Sydney. Aircraft are flying an extra 52 kilometres than they would be if the east-west runway was being used, and those 52 kilometres are being flown over residential areas, which increases the risk of failure, accident or disaster. I thought one of the very basic precepts of flying aircraft around a city was to keep them away from residential areas, but you have devised the most elaborate scheme to fly them over the maximum number of houses possible. That is a dangerous process, and I accuse the minister of adopting policies that are a danger to the people of Sydney. He is knowingly embroiling the people of Sydney in a dangerous process with the way in which the aircraft are landing at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The minister is knowingly doing that and he is putting the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals right across Sydney in danger. He is endangering lives that should never be endangered and moving to a point where he is derelict in his duty as a minister who is required to uphold air safety rules and regulations. Minister, you could change this overnight if you thought it was a danger, but you obviously do not think it is a danger. Nobody in the world would fly aircraft over cities in the way that you are. (Time expired)",26
49,Mr LEO MCLEAY,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I want to briefly refer to a couple of matters raised by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) in this debate relating to safety and whether one should operate three runways or two at Sydney airport. The important thing to remember is what the government has been trying to do with Sydney airport-that is, to ensure that there is a safe operation at the airport, that the asset that the public has gets a good value when sold, that Sydney stays as the major international gateway to Australia and that we try to contain some of the noise around the airport. The member for Mitchell says that it was always envisaged that Sydney would operate with three runways rather than two. I just do not think that is quite right. Indeed, the honourable member for Mitchell-who has only taken a cursory interest in this matter from time to time-might be aware that, in the planning stages when the FAC was putting out models of what the new airport was going to look like, the models in fact had buildings where the cross-runway is. So it was obviously never the FAC's intention to run Sydney airport with three runways. If the member for Mitchell had taken more than a cursory interest in this matter he would also have known that the environmental approval for Sydney airport was on the basis that it would run as a parallel runway operation airport. The only time the east-we!;t runway was to be used was if there were adverse weather conditions. It was never envisaged that it would run two north-south runways in conjunction with the east-west runway. All the evidence that has been supplied is that to run intersecting runways is inherently less safe than to run parallel runways. Even the member for Mitchell might be able to understand-although I know it is a pretty difficult concept for someone like him to get a handle on-that if two things are running at right angles to each other, they might actually run into each other, while if they were running parallel to each other, they would not run into each other. The old Simops system which used to operate at Sydney airport is unsafe. To run Sydney airport with three runways is not as safe as running it with two runways. That is an undeniable fact. The member for Mitchell and the shadow minister-who both profess wanting to do something for the community-should also take account of the fact that if you reopen the east-west runway at Sydney airport you actually create noise pollution over another 58,000 people. That means that you would have a much noisier operation at Sydney airport than you have there now. More people would be affected and there would be more difficulty in operating the airport. The opposition's proposition is a silly one. They are coming in here and telling half truths. The reality is that with the proposals the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has put forward, the people in Sydney get a good deal out of this. With the change in the flight paths, the minister has ensured that fewer people are affected. With the sharper take-offs he has ensured that fewer people are affected. For the first time we have a minister who is trying to do something to alleviate the pain of people who live around Sydney airport. That is a progressive thing. It is the first time a minister for transport has tried to achieve that. But all we get from the opposition is carping and hypocrisy. They should be doing the best they can for the people around Sydney rather than going on with the argybargy we are hearing at present. They should support what the minister has done because that would be in the best interests of the people who live around Sydney airport.",27
50,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Mackellar) (10.53 a.m.)The comments of the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) could be regarded as amusing if the matter were not so serious. Quite clearly, he has just arrived in the chamber to put in his tuppence-ha'penny worth to support the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton)another of whose neighbours has just dropped in, being the Minister for Defence Science ",28
51,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,There's the three of them together now.,28
52,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"It is what you might call a small convening of the mates. Anyone who has read that excellent book will know what we are dealing with. With regard to the assertion made by the member for Watson, I think he was out of the chamber when I read out those really pertinent comments of Mr W. Pollard, the chief executive officer designate of Airservices Australia, made on 29 September 1995. Subsequent to that, I understand, someone tried to heavy him to get him to change his view. But he put it well and truly onto the record and I think it is worth putting on the record again. He said: Throughout the world. and in my past experience, there are many airports that have intercepting runways and they are used quite safely. In fact, many airports do not have parallel runways but usually have one north-south and one east-west, and many times they are intercepting and it is done safely. I have a lot more comments along those lines and which I have used already in the course of this debate. My colleague the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) recently held up a map showing just how the airport currently operates. You can see that traffic is concentrated in an unfair way over citizens who are suffering badly. These are the flight patterns that have been put in place after the minister's so-called noise abatement program in November 1994. This is a map of how the noise pattern used to be distributed when the east-west runway was operating. I think it is significant to remember that for 40 years Sydney airport",28
53,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Yes, indeed. I seek leave to table the map, Mr Deputy Speaker.",29
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,Mr Rocher)Is leave granted? Leave not granted.,29
55,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I am amazed it took him so long. They always say no. They do not want anything to be on the record; they certainly do not want it in Hansard where ordinary folks can read it. The point I was making is that this has been a deliberate political ploy to make the lives of some folk in Sydney unbearable-and unbearable is what it has become. They know that the only chance they have is to see this government turfed out. They know that they cannot believe a word any of the ministers have to say on this matter or, indeed, on any other matter. They remember that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told them before the last election that they were going to get tax cuts and that they were going to be put into l-a-w, law. They remember that Bob Carr, the Labor Party Premier in New South Wales, said he was going to take the tolls off roadways. He won the election and not only have the tolls stayed but the Carr government is going to build some more toll roads. They remember the excuse that the Prime Minister gave for not giving the tax cuts was that somewhere down the line he was going to give them something else. They are not quite sure what it was. All they know is that they were not told the truth. They are not going to believe anything the government has to say about having any care or concern for the plight these people find themselves in. The member for Watson in his contribution has tried to confuse and abuse the issue. He tried to say that it is unsafe to reopen that runway when in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, as we speak, those cross-runways are in operation. The minister somehow considers that the people of Sydney are not quite as smart as those in Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth and, therefore, cannot run cross-runways; he somehow considers safety to be an issue for Sydney but not for the people of Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. That is a nonsense argument. The minister has the power to accept these amendments today and to allow the bill to have its passage. We have already heard him say that he will not accept our amendments. I did allow the bill to pass through the second reading stage. We agreed to the passage of the bill through the second reading stage in the hope that the minister may change his mind and accept these amendments in the consideration in detail stage. We will see when the vote is taken. (Time expired)  Science and Personnel) (10.58 a.m.)Attempting to blame the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) for noise resulting from the third runway is commensurate with trying to blame Bill Clinton for the Gulf War. It is blaming not only the wrong side but also the wrong administration. There are certainly a number of people around the place who can bear responsibility for the third runway and the decision to go ahead with it, but the minister at the table is certainly not one of them. He was with me shoulder to shoulder in the 1980s-and even before me, given his agein fighting this thing to a standstill. If there is one person who sits in this place who can take a good deal of the blame for this it is the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). When I was the Minister for Aviation Support, day after day he and his colleagues accused me of holding up the economic progress of this country in opposing the third runway and holding the nation's economy to ransom-all, supposedly, to save my seat. But what was his view on this? Let us go back to the condemnation of himself by his own words on Tuesday, 21 March 1989 in an interview with Mike Carlton on Radio 2GB. He says in part: Their refusal to build the third runway over the last six and a half years has been based on their assessment of the politics of it. Their right wing numbers men openly boast that they are not going to be so stupid as to build a third runway and lose all those seats in Sydney. I have always regarded that argument, incidentally, as nonsense. I grew up under the flight paths in the St George area of Sydney and know something about the politics of the area and I have always regarded the issue as being grossly exaggerated in terms of the impact on local residents. There are a limited number of people who are severely affected by aircraft noise. The great bulk of the rest of them are only mildly affected and in any event bought their houses knowing full well that they were under flight paths. In any eventlisten to this one; this is a beautythere are many sections of my electorate, in areas like Lane Cove and Hunters Hill, that have just as much aircraft noise and are as frequently under flight paths as people living near the airport and I think thatCARLTON: They may in fact get less if the third runway is built? People around Lane Cove? JOHN HOWARD: Many people will because you will have the north-south pattern. I think the case for it on general interest grounds is absolutely overwhelming. Condemned out of his own mouth-'the north-south pattern'. He predicted that his people would have less aircraft noise and he got it wrong. I go back to Hansard of 8 March 1989 when he was running this debate that supposedly I was holding up the progress of the entire nation to save my political seat, despite the 20 years of history of opposition to this runway before that. I drew his attention to the Hunters Hill mayor, Sheila Swain. I quoted: Hunters Hill mayor Sheila Swain said today that her council was opposed to the plan. She said the second international airport at Badgerys Creek should be given the top priority. ""At the western end of the municipality we already have quite a bit of noise from aircraft"", Mrs Swain said. She also said that it would become even greater with the third runway. Of course, I also drew to his attention in the debate on that day the comments of the then mayor of Lane Cove, Sydney Friedlander, on the issue. John Howard was warned. John Howard sold out his own electorate on this issue. He was warned. He made a major fundamental error and now he is attempting to blame people who actually opposed this runway right from the start. Do we remember full well when the opposition in this place used to cry that this runway would meet the airport needs of Sydney until 2010 and that my proposal for Badgerys Creek was a gross waste of money and that we would not need Badgerys Creek until 201O? No. We have forgotten it. It vindicates my position on this all along. When those opposite were saying that I was seIling out my electorate because the east-west runway would close, I said they never had any intention of bearing with that position and today proves that right. (Time expired)",29
56,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I am delighted that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the member for Barton  he has been heavily involved in the airport politics of Sydney for a long time. He was a person people who so strongly believed in his opinion that he was forced to stand against his government. I am sorry that he is leaving the chamber because what he has just demonstrated by his argument is that, if he knew all the time that Sydney was going to operate only on a north-south configuration and that the east-west runway was going to close, he was stupid to resign. If he knew that, he was stupid to resign. If he knew that the ultimate result was going to be what he claims is happening now, why did he resign? That is the stupidest thing he has ever done. He cannot convince me that he thought it was going to operate solely north-south because all that he stood for then would have been in vain. If he knew it was going to operate on a north-south configuration only, he knew at that point that people were going to be free of aircraft noise. He knew that he would have achieved his goal of what he stood for. He could have said at that time, 'It is bad now, but I will ensure that the government changes the configuration,' and he didn't do it. He resigned instead. If he knew those things, why did he resign? He wasted his political life for something he said he believed in. If he had known at that time, as he now claims he did-as the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) maintains that he knew, as the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) claims he knew-that was the dumbest political thing a person has ever done from the New South Wales Right of the Australian Labor Party because you guys do not operate in that way. You operate on the basis of certainty alone. I do not believe you thought for one moment that that east-west runway would close. Now that it has you claim, with the benefit of hindsight, that you knew all the time it was going to close. The simple question is: why did you resign? That was the silliest thing to do, to give up a ministry, if you were in there batting for your people. If you were convinced that you had won the arguments in the cabinet and the result was going to be the closure of the east-west runway, you could have argued that around the stumps and held your ministry. You could have maintained the government's position because you would not have needed to vary with the government. If the government's goal was to close the east-west runway and you knew it, why did you not stick with government policy? It would have advantaged your people. There was no need to have resigned. I do not believe you are that sort of person. I believe you honestly stood for what the people of your area wanted. They did want that runway to be modified. You said, 'I cannot cop it. I cannot cop the continuation of this process. I am going to differ with my government, with my Prime Minister, and I am going to resign.' I believe you do hold those views very strongly, but I do not believe you knew at that time the east-west runway was going to close or you would not have resigned because your electorate has been advantaged by the closure. The critical point in all of this is November 1994. We have a pattern here that shows the use of all three runways in November 1994. The statement by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) that was read out by the minister was based purely on the fact that if there were full use of Mascot there would have been a sharing of noise. I do not know if all people in the House at the moment can see it, but what this shows is that with a balanced spread of aircraft using three runways the noise is shared. The minister has not promoted that sharing process whereby the people of Bennelong were suffering the same noise level as those in the flight path of the east-west runway. What he has done is changed that and provided a configuration such as this where only the people in the Bennelong area suffer, not the people in other parts of Sydney who previously suffered noise-sharing in the process. To achieve this goal, aircraft are flying 52 kilometres over residential areas at great danger to the residents of Sydney. (Time expired).  Science and Personnel) (11.08 a.m.)Obviously myoid friend the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) did not hear my concluding remarks. Let me expand on them for a moment. The quotations I used showed, without any semblance of fear of argument against it, that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) knew exactly what pattern he was advocating and what the result would be. In my concluding remarks a few moments ago, I made the point that I believed, despite all the argument that was coming from that side, which you have just repeated six years later, my electorate was going to be better off, as it currently is, because of a supposed downgrading or closure of the east-west runway. As I said at the time, and I will say it here again, I have never believed, and until the day I die I will never believe, that a Liberal Party government, the airlines, although I note their current position, or the aviation bureaucracyone or all of them-will not at some stage, in their obsessive hunt to jam more and more aircraft into Sydney, because of their vested interests in the whole issue, come along and demand and campaign for the reopening of the east-west runway. That is what we have got now. You did not even take 10 years to revert to that position-to somersault on some position about closing the east-west runway.",30
57,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"It has always been our position.  always been your position to close the eastwest runway. Howard is campaigning right now for the reopening of the east-west runway. He was always going to do that when he discovered that there was more noise on the people in his electorate. He made a mistake and now he is trying to get out of that mistake by reneging on his position of 1989 that the east-west runway would remain closed if the coalition built a third runway. So you have come the full circle on this. What it all means is that, irrespective of whether you are in government or we are in g-vernment, fo- the residents of Sydney the thIrd runway will become a game of Russian roulette: who is in government and who is going to put what aircraft and how many over whose houses? On current traffic figures, your proposal to reopen the east-west runway would see some 16 to 20 per cent more - rcraft. over the east-west runway than before ll-me-Iately. It would also see a gross diminutIon In safety because of that mad Simops proposal that operated for some years. That is why you ha-e painted yourselves and your constIt-ents Into a comer by supporting the reopemng of the east-west runway. The people under the east-west runway were happy to live with the amount of noise they had previously so long as they could see a diminution in it in the immediate term by th- construction of Badgerys Creek. But you Said Badgerys Creek was not needed until 2010-and you were wrong about that too. The one salient constant in all of this is that the opposition has not got one thing right about the th!rd runway-ever. We have got a couple of thIngs wrong about it, sure. But you ain't got one thing about it right. That political roulette game is now alive and well. Despite the safety factors and the diminution in capacity which in 1989 was to you people the be all and end all-and I was the worse in the world for daring to say that perhaps we should put capacity somewhere other than KSA-we now have this Russian roulette game, inspired by your leader's fear of losing his seat, to reopen the east-west runway. I alw-ys knew the Leader of the Opposition was gOIng to do that, and so did the member for Watson. We always knew that, despite all the promises in 1989 that the east-west runway was going to be closed or diminished, someone would be back-and it would be your side of politics-to reopen it. Forget the promises made. Forget all the nuances. Forget all the winding up of the talkback radio commentators that those documents from the former state government have now revealed. You were always going to somersault on that and never keep the promises you were making to the people under the east-west flight path. I resigned because I reckoned that decision was wrong. Hawke did a back flip and I am silly enough to believe that, if you make a promise, you ought to do your damnedest to keep it. I resigned to fight this thing the whole way. But it is in there now; it is a fait accompli and up and operating. What we have to do is what this man, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), is doing: try to lessen the impact on as many people in Sydney as possible-(Time expired)",31
58,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,Mackellar) (11.13 a.m.)That was a very passionate contribution from  resigned because he thought he would lose his seat. A picture speaks more than a thousand words. Here is the pre-November 1994 flight path pattern. Here is the post-1994 flight path pattern. ,32
59,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I have tried that already. My colleague reminds me that we should table them. But, of course, the government does not want those pictures in the record because they do speak more than a thousand words. I asked to have them tabled. I wanted them printed in the Hansard so that other folk could see them. Mr Leo MCLeay-You cannot print them.",32
60,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,Indeed you can.,32
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,Mr Andrew)Order! Any decision as to whether or not these are able to be tabled is not a matter for debate between the member for Mackellar and the member for Watson.,32
62,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"The point is that the government has not acceded to their tabling. I revert to the point I was making. A picture speaks mor- th-n - - housan? words.. !he bottom line IS thIS: It IS a polItIcal declSlon, taken by the minister in November 1994, to ensure that the most pain is inflicted upon the people who live at the end of the Bennelong tunnel. It is a deliberate political decision. Of course, the good member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) and the good minister think it is very amusing for these people. They laugh away the plight of other Australians. They laugh at the fact that people are losing the value of their homes. Mr Leo MCLeay-We are laughing at your reference to a tunnel.",32
63,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"There is no light for those people at the end of the Bennelong tunnel. When you are defeated as a government, then there will be hope for the people at the end of the Bennelong tunnel; yes, indeed. John Howard does offer that hope. John Howard does offer that light for those people, and they know it. They know very well that unless you lot are defeated-thrown out, as you were in New South Wales-there is no light at the end of the tunnel. The minister may well have the pleasure of playing a similar role for his leader in this next election as he played for Barrie Unsworth. He was a major figure in bringing down the Unsworth government, which, of course, was the inheritor of the Wran government. Mr Brereton was known as the pariah of the Labor Party. ",33
64,Mrs BISHOP,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"He is the pariah of paradise when he comes into my electorate, I can tell you that. As I said, a picture speaks more than a thousand words. The illustration shows where the flight paths now go, making life hell for people who live under those flight paths. It also shows where those planes did not fly, in the same numbers, before-areas where the people's homes have lost value and where people have had health repercussions because of the intensity of what has been inflicted upon them by the decision of the minister. Much of this debate today has been quite entertaining. We have heard history regurgitated by people on the Labor Party side, who have put their slant on it. The bottom line is that it is the minister's decision of November 1994 that has destroyed the lives of thousands of people in Sydney. I have said to the minIster again and again: it is within your power to accept these amendments, to allow the privatisation to go ahead and to enable a fair and equitable distribution of the noise factor by reopening the east-west runway. There is sufficient evidence on the record to show beyond doubt that it is perfectly safe and, indeed, advantageous to reopen it. The final piece of logic that can be said is that, when there was discussion about a third runway, it was always two runways plus a new runway equals three runways. They should be run together, and successfully together.",33
65,Mr LATHAM,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I have been listening patiently to the debate on the airport bills. It has taken me back to my entry to the parliament at the beginning of 1994. At that time the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) was challenging the then Leader of the Opposition, John Hewson, for the leadership of the Liberal Party. Reflecting on that leads me to think how the mighty have fallen since the beginning of 1994. The member for Mackellar wants to berate the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) on a few issues. She has got plenty of front, plenty of hide, to do that when, over the last 18 months, no-one in this place has more comprehensively failed on policy questions than the member for Mackellar. In health, she has failed on issue after issue after issue. In her attacks on the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), there has been failure after failure after failure. Just yesterday, it was embarrassment after embarrassment when the member for Mackellar, in a speech which the media reported this morning, said that governments have no responsibility, taxpayers have no responsibility, for the outcomes of family breakdown. Who has responsibility? Is it the street cleaner? Is it the people who clean up those who have to sleep on the streets? The member for Mackellar, in her tirade of abuse, really has shown more hide than anyone could ever imagine. The truth of the matter is that airport administration is not an easy public policy task. Who are they going to call on the opposition side to undertake the task? The honourable member for Mackellar. What did she come up with? These total inconsistencies. It makes for some very interesting points in the debate because members on this side of the House from east Sydney-the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), the member for Kingsford-Smith and the member for Barton  ney-myself and the member for Chifley (Mr Price)-have spoken with one voice. It gives a total lie to the assertion by the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) earlier on that there is some division. For as long as I can remember, the five people I am talking about have all had one position-that is, the construction of the third runway was inadvisable. It was not going to be good policy. It was going to have consequences that would be unacceptable in terms of urban planning and urban environment. The best course of action would have been the construction of Badgerys Creek airport in the first instance. My only regret in this matter is that the Minister for Transport was not in that position five or 10 years ago, because had he been we would have had Badgerys Creek up and running as Sydney's second international airport and there would have been no third runway. There is no doubt that the member for Mackellar and the member for Mitchell were supporting John Howard throughout the 1980s saying that the third runway was an essential micro-economic reform for Australia.",33
66,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,It sure is.,34
67,Mr LATHAM,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"The member for Mitchell has just confirmed that: it is absolutely essenLabor tial. From the very first day they had the strongest possible support, along with Nick Greiner's government in New South Wales, for the third runway, and all the noise consequences that holds for people in the inner city. Those who are arguing against that position have been here today arguing the same position years later-the member for Watson, the member for Kingsford-Smith and the member for Barton, joined by myself and the member for Chifley. We have stated what we believe to be the correct position. We want to make sure that Badgerys Creek airport can be successful for the tens of thousands of jobs it offers in western Sydney, a real catalyst for tourism and manufacturing growth, and to do it in a fashion which is consistent with good urban and environmental planning in the greater west. What we have seen from the opposition is these propositions: campaigning in east Sydney saying that they want to reopen the east-west and holding up this legislation until that is done; saying in east Sydney and the electorates of Lowe and Bennelong that they want to fast-track Badgerys Creek airport; and assertions being made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) that somehow it would be possible to transfer all the international flights to Badgerys Creek. What the member for Mackellar has argued throughout the debate on this amendment is that it is possible to fast-track Badgerys Creek without finance, or at least not to specify where the money would be coming from. That is a shameful position for a senior member of the opposition to take. The member for Mackellar and her copilot, the Leader of the Opposition, when they campaign in the south-west of Sydney and the seat of Macarthur, say they want a comprehensive EIS at Badgerys Creek which would involve a twoor three-year delay. Her interpretation of fast tracking is to build a twoto three-year delay into the process. This really is low grade stuff. This is low level flying in every sense. In the consistency and in the substance of this debate I would have thought it would be clear to anyone listening to the discussion or reading the Hansard at a subsequent date that has been consistent on this matter and the Opposition has been a shameful, inconsistent fraud.",34
68,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"I want to conclude my remarks in this debate by saying something about Badgerys Creek. The fact is that Badgerys Creek airport will go ahead and it will be a significant economic generator. It took effort from everybodylocal government, state government and federal government representatives-to convince the minister at the table and the FAC that the runway should be at least capable of handling jumbo jets. That was not the government's original intention and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) knows that. It still is not adequate. In the process of financing and generating activity, the government has decided to use taxpayers' funds through the FAC. It has been the preferred position of local governments, elected members of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party from western Sydney to use a mixture of private funds and government funds, perhaps drawing in elements of local government and representatives of the community to construct a truly local international airport. John Howard has not endorsed the use of Badgerys Creek as Sydney's international airport. You cannot keep misrepresenting him in that way. That is not a fact. As to the progress at Badgerys Creek, I put the minister on notice that western Sydney residents are becoming very concerned about the lack of action and communication by your government. In the last month there has been an effort by some of your members and you to restore that situation. You need to do a whole heap more than you are doing. There are pockets of resistance rising up because people do not know what the flight paths are going to be. They cannot understand what the ultimate resolution of this problem will be. It is time for you to get out there",34
69,Mr BRERETON,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,An international airport. John Howard promised it.,35
70,Mr CADMAN,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"The minister can say what he likes but I have here a time flow chart, and none of this is yet under way. Yet you are putting out statements around western Sydney that the tractors will roll at the beginning of March. The EIS is not supposed to be finished until the end of July next year. Are you going to start construction before the EIS is finished? Are you saying that the EIS you are doing is just a facade and an update of what has already been done? Of course you are. You intend to have, through the community consultations, the negotiations, the EIS and the whole construction of the infrastructure, token consultation. You are not going to do a real job on this; you are going to push ahead because you have a problem down at Mascot. You are not going to treat the people of the west any better than you did when you were in the state government. Your view of Sydney, from those salubrious buildings bordering Sydney Harbour, stretched as far as Drummoyne, as being the western suburbs. I think it is time that you communicated effectively with people. The Olympic Games are coming up. The pressure from the people of western Sydney is to have this airport finished by the year 2000. Your parliamentary secretary says it will be finished late in 1999. Every expert says that that is an impossibility, that you are not going to hit that target. That is a gross overstatement. Don't you think the unions will screw you when they know you're on such a short timetable? Do you think you will satisfy the needs of Sydney and the Olympic Games by not connecting rail to it? Are you going to force people onto more road transport? What do you, as Minister for Transport, really stand for? You have got no environmental aspects in all of this. This was going to be the environmental Olympic Games, yet you ask people to depend on road transport for their communications. Where is the planning that you are espousing for Badgerys Creek? This legislation needs to be held up until you make a decision to open the east-west runway. In so doing, I hope you will clarify your lack of commitment, lack of planning, lack of consultation with the people of western Sydney, so that they understand what you are doing, they are properly consulted, environmental studies are done and footprints are generated. In that way, people will know how they are going to be affected, where they are going to be affected and whether any measures need to be undertaken by you-and this bill gives you that power-to soundproof, insulate or buy property which is severely affected by noise pollution. This is a great amendment and I believe, minister, that you should support it.",35
71,Mr LATHAM,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Werriwa) (11.28 a.m.)That intervention by the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) raises the key point about this amendment from a western Sydney perspective. It goes, of course, to the press release issued by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) on 26 September. I quote: The coalition believes leasing of KSA should be deferred until the following occur: first, the eastwest runway is re-opened; secondand I hope the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) is listeninga genuine environmental impact statement on Badgerys Creek is completed. Of course, in the terms of her amendment, that second condition is missing. It raises the question for hundreds of thousands of people in greater western Sydney: what is the current policy position and intention of the federal opposition regarding Badgerys Creek airport? Is it fast-tracking, which is what the opposition have said, in the east of Sydney? If it is fast-tracking, how will they pay for it if they are not going to use the funds available from the private leasing of Kingsford Smith airport? If it is not fast-tracking, is it the environmental impact statement and therefore a twoto three-year delay in the construction of Badgerys Creek airport? This is a key issue. Let me repeat the question for the member for Mackellar, whom I invite to give an answer which is so important to the people I represent: do you want Badgerys Creek fast-tracked and, if so, how will you pay for it, or do you want a new EIS, which will delay the process for two to three years? That is a key question fundamental to the coming election campaign and the policy positions that both parties will be taking throughout greater western Sydney and all the key seats in the region. I invite the member for Mackellar to give a straightforward answer to a straightforward and vital question. Question put: That the amendments (Mrs Bishop's) be agreed Home, R. H. to.

72,Mrs BISHOP,NOES,"by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos. 1 to 5: (1) Clause 5, page 3, omit the clause, substitute the following clause: Act not to apply to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) and Sydney West Airports until satisfactory equitable arrangements approved ""5. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly declared to be the intention of the Parliament that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and Sydney West Airport until a proposal that satisfactory arrangements are in place to share more equitably the aircraft noise burden over Sydney, in particular, the resumption of full operation of the East-West runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, has been approved as specified in paragraph 19(9)."". (2) Clause 19, page 9, lines 7 and 8, omit paragraphs (a) and (b). (3) Clause 19, page 9, after paragraph (e) insert the following paragraph: ""(ea) Adelaide Airport;"". (4) Clause 19, page 9, line 12, omit ""an airport"", substitute ""subject to paragraph (g), an airport"". (5) Clause 19, page 9, add at the end of the clause: ""(g) Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and Sydney West Airport must not be specified in the regulations unless a proposal that satisfactory arrangements are in place to share more equitably the aircraft noise burden over Sydney, in particular, the resumption of full operation of the EastWest runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, has been laid before the Senate and the House of Representatives and approved by resolution of each House."". These amendments are in line with the amendments I moved earlier to the Airports Bill to excise Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. I now propose, similarly, to excise the references to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport from the Airports (Transitional) Bill so as to effect the postponement of the privatisation until such time as the noise burden over Sydney is dealt with in a more equitable manner-in particular, until the resumption of the full operation of the eastwest runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport has been approved. It is also proposed in this set of amendments that the Adelaide airport be added to the list in clause 19 of the Airports (Transitional) Bill so that the provisions of that bill will apply to Adelaide airport forthwith. The reason for that amendment is to give effect to our belief that Adelaide airport ought to be treated like the other mainland capital city state airport and be in the first phase of sales of the Federal Airports Corporation. The current legislation unfairly discriminates against Adelaide airport by leaving it until the second tranche. We believe that it is only fair that it be included in that first list, and the amendment has been proposed accordingly. We also propose, as we did with the previous bill, an amendment to prevent the government restoring Kingsford Smith airport to the list under the Airports (Transitional) Bill and the Airports Bill, including it in the first tranche of sales. Our reason, which we argued strongly with the first bill, is exactly the same with this bill-the unfair distribution of noise concentrated over certain areas of Sydney. The government has argued that it cannot reopen the east-west runway because it believes that it is unsafe. That has been shown to be clearly fallacious. It is not unsafe. There is a list of experts, including the newly designated head of the government's own body oversighting air safety, who say that it is perfectly safe to conduct such an operation with intersecting runways. In the debate on the previous bill, I used diagrams which showed pre-November 1994, when the minister made his decision which resulted in the inflicting of unfair noise and which has resulted in the depreciation of land values under these new flight paths and in health problems for people who are being subjected to this unfair battery of noise. We simply say that you cannot sweep the question of noise under the carpet, allow ,the privatisation to proceed and believe that somehow it will magically be fixed. It will not. The responsibility is the minister's. He can address that problem now and allow the legislation to go through if he is serious about the privatisation. As I said on the question of Adelaide, we have moved to bring it into the first tranche because we believe there is no reason whatsoever to discriminate against Adelaide and leave it out, and at some disadvantage. Accordingly, we are adding it in. I do hope the minister sees reason and accedes to the amendments.",38
73,Mr BRERETON,NOES,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (11.56 a.m.)-We will not be acceding to these amendments for very good reason. Firstly, in respect of Adelaide airport I say: Adelaide airport needs to be extended and it needs to be extended prior to being leased. That is the priority of the South Australian government and it is the priority of our government. The proceeds for that extension, an extension due to commence in March of next year, come from the leasing of Sydney airport. That is where the funds are coming from. Of course, the opposition are proposing that the whole of the leasing process be wrecked by Sydney's being eliminated from the leasing process. So in point of fact, the only people who are discriminating against Adelaide are the opposition, by persisting with these amendments and threatening to use their numbers in the Senate to block this legislation. They are the only people who can wreck the very carefully negotiated plans between our government and the government in South Australia to see the South Australian airport extended, and extended now. Certainly, privatising it in the first tranche is the last thing anyone has recommended. Every bit of financial advice has said: lease the major assets first but extend Adelaide first, before it is leased. Only the opposition would in effect discriminate against Adelaide airport. In relation to this furphy that has been repeated by the opposition today about reopening the east-west runway, the opposition have always known that inherent in their plan to develop Kingsford Smith airport with parallel runways was the elimination of traffic on the east-west runway. They have known it for as long as this proposal has been around. Some of them knew it even before they were here in this chamber. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) knew it in 1975. In the New South Wales parliament, when across the chamber from me, he said that the proposal he was speaking in favour of then-that is, the parallel runway-would cater for an expansion of the traffic. An acceptance of the solution would mean that cross runways would not have to be used. You knew it in 1975. You have known it at every point. John Howard knew it in 1989 when he was castigating this government for not proceeding with the expansion of Kingsford Smith. The whole of the opposition knew it when they were attacking the then minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, the mem saying Badgerys Creek should be built. John Howard knew it as Leader of the Opposition, knew it the day he turned up on the Mike Carlton program and knew it in every one of his public utterances. It does the opposition no good at all to be claiming that Mr Bill Pollard, the new head of Airservices Australia, has said anything that supports their contention. In point of fact,  said is, 'Sure, you can run intersecting operations and they are run around the world.' But he also said, 'You cannot run them at the capacity Sydney airport needs to run at to operate effectively, efficiently and to service the demand that is upon it.' And it is a very considerable demand. The one thing the opposition have never been able to establish is how you could reopen the east-west runway, as they say they will, for full jet operations using intersecting runways and maintain the capacity. Airservices Australia says that that destroys the capacity. It could be as low as 55, as opposed to the 85 it is designed for and the government is committed to. That wrecks the value of the airport, wrecks its ability to service the needs of Sydney. All of this is inherent in the proposal that is being put forward so ineptly by the shadow minister sitting opposite. It is a proposal that would destroy the value of the airports, that would destroy the ability of Badgerys Creek to be built, completed in time for the year 2000 Olympics, that would destroy our ability to proceed with the extension of Adelaide airport with the development of the new runway and would give us arrangements at Sydney airport, not only wrecking its value but destroying its capacity in rendering it less safe. This is, I repeat, the dumbest thing I have ever seen in 25 years of politics.  take the opportunity to comment on some of the statements the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) made earlier in the debate when he concluded the second reading stage of this bill and also some of the other Labor MPs' comments. I think I should start by commenting on some of the amusing compliments that some of the Labor MPs seem to have given this unfortunate minister. The member for  by saying that, regardless of how shocking everybody says the minister is and what people say about the minister, he could not condemn the minister. He would not condemn the minister, even though other people say such shocking things about him. What a backhanded compliment. That was followed by the Minister for  complimenting the minister on the fantastic job he has done through the 1970s and 1980s. Given his age, of course, he goes back to the early 1970s-another backhanded slap in the face for the minister. Some friends the ALP members are to each other in this debate! In the minister's comments he said some things about the federal government having done so much for South Australia. He commented on the road changes in Mount Barker, which is in my electorate, and he also commented on the runway extension. Still, even though the government has done so much for South Australia, why is South Australia a second-class citizen when it comes to the sale of the Adelaide airport, the premier airport in South Australia? Why is it that the Adelaide airport cannot be in the first tranche with the other airports being sold around the country? The reason is that South Australians are second-class citizens as far as this government is concerned and have always been treated that way. The minister likes to hand out ugly threats about the coalition's position on this bill. He likes to say that the extension of the runway will be finished first before the sale of the airport, before the lease of the airport. If the extension is not done first, if we do not behave, if the coalition does not do what he wants us to do, then the suggestion hangs in the air that the runway extension might not go ahead. What the minister might like to know-he probably does know but refuses to tell the House-is that the extension has already begun in its preliminary stages in South Australia. The money allocated for that extension is a separate allocation. It has nothing to do with the successful leasing of Kingsford Smith airport. To try to link the two is a disgraceful political act. He also suggests that the South Australian government in some way supports the Labor Party's position on the sale of the Adelaide airport. Nothing could be further from the truth. On Tuesday of last week the shadow cabinet in Adelaide announced that they would bring forward the sale of Adelaide airport by two years and put it in the first tranche of sales. This was welcomed by the Premier of South Australia, Dean Brown, who supports the coalition's position and who told me personally that I should do my best to push for that in Canberra for South Australia and for the Adelaide airport. So the government cannot try to clothe itself in the popularity of the South Australian Liberal government on this issue of the Adelaide airport. The minister claimed that the coalition had stabbed South Australia in the back by not supporting the government's position. I do not know how he could ever suggest such a thing when the ALP has stabbed South Australia in the back not only over the airport but also over the wine tax which was in the budget two years ago and was introduced last yearthe wine tax which so damages my state",39
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member might confine his remarks to the subject of the amendments.  to you that the minister made a wide ranging attack on the coalition in his previous comments.,40

76,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Nonetheless, you will speak to the amendments.  amendments.   chair. Mrs Bishop-But not for you.  The minister brought in the Grand Prix and Jeff Kennett and how Liberals, not even in federal parliament, had stabbed South Australia in the back by stealing the Grand Prix. How could he stand there and say that when it was the ALP state government that cost my state over $3'12 billion through the collapse of the State Bank in South Australia, which we will be paying for for generations? The nerve of the minister to bring in matters that are completely extraneous to South Australia when he stands nude in front of the public over the treatment that the ALP has meted out to my state!  drawn into a contribution on the Airports Bill because my remarks earlier have been grossly distorted by the honourable member for Sturt  Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in state parliament, and I believe that to be unambiguous. I pointed out that the minister had been responsible for the construction of a great many roads in New South Wales for which my constituents are grateful.",41
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"As I did with the member for Sturt, I point out  chair.",41
78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"You have to show some respect for the chair, too. I point out that we are dealing with the amendments, and I do not think there is any mention of roads in the amendments.  know my regard for you, and the role of your office. I have the choice of either waiting to make a personal explanation or trying to tidy up the matter as quickly as I can. I think the honourable member for Sturt in his contribution has misrepresented my remarks. Firstly, I had mentioned the contribution of the minister in relation to roads, and also to his shifting of hospital beds to the west. I also point out that my constituents are grateful to this minister for being the first minister, I believe, to take up seriously the issue of the construction of a major airport at Badgerys Creek-something that I have been seeking for a long time. This is the only minister who has secured a budget allocation to ensure that the construction goes ahead. It is quite clear to me and my constituents that this construction is contingent upon the sales that are proposed. We accept that. I strongly support the minister in that. I also support the proposition of the minister that, if the western suburbs of Sydney are to take full advantage of this airport, it is really important that it be operational, as the minister wishes it to be and as the minister has planned it to be, before the Sydney Olympics. It would be absolutely absurd to have the opening of Badgerys Creek occur after the Olympic Games. In the western suburbs of Sydney-maybe the honourable member for Sturt wants to take issue with me-we have supported and seen the value of this airport as a catalyst for jobs. What the opposition is doing-in my view and, I think you will find, in the view of many people in the electorates of western Sydney-is to put in jeopardy the big plus that this airport represents for us; that is, having the surety that it will open well before the Olympic Games. It will not be taking the major part of that tourist traffic, but it will be up and running and operational and it will be getting the benefit of the enormous contribution that the Olympic Games will make in my state of New South Wales. Of course, it will have benefits for the whole of Australia. I have some time for the honourable member for Sturt, but I am concerned when he misrepresents the remarks I make. I again appeal to the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), who declined to put on the public record the decision making process of the Liberal Party. She has declined to put on the record whether or not there was any consultation by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) with the shadow minister for transport, with his shadow cabinet or with his party room. Is the shadow minister at the table confirming that there was no consultation; that this was a pre-emptive strike by the Leader of the Opposition to protect his own electorate? I appeal to her again to clear this matter up on the Hansard record. She declined when I appealed to her previously. I now reiterate that appeal. A failure to do so can lead to only one conclusion, and that is that there was absolutely no consultation.   that my comments about his contribution to the debate earlier were not about the substance of what he said in reference to the Airports Bill but in reference to the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) when he said that, regardless of what other people say about the minister-implying regardless of how shocking the minister is and what other people say about him-you could not condemn him and he was his friend. They were the limits of my comments about his contribution. Although I do not agree with the rest of his contribution, I did not mention it in my earlier speech. I would like to talk in this contribution about how important Adelaide airport is to South Australia, why it is that we want to bring forward the sale of the airport by two years and why the coalition announced that last Tuesday. Adelaide airport is vital to South Australia not because the length of the runway precludes its maximum use in bringing tourists to South Australia but, primarily, because the length of the runway precludes trade opportunities, exports to South-East Asia and imports from other countries. South-East Asia is a market for fresh food produce, which is produced in abundance in South Australia. One of the great problems in trying to get that produce to places like Singapore and Hong Kong is that the size of the planes that take off from Adelaide airport is not sufficient to make it worthwhile for corporations in that region to use Adelaide airport. Therefore, a market that is waiting for South Australian companies to fill with fresh food produce, amongst many other goods and services, is not being used because of tlle runway extension not having gone ahead under the state Labor government, although it was promised many times. So the airport is very important to South Australia and the extension of the runway is very important. Privatisation would be of assistance to Adelaide airport. There are people in South Australia and in Australia who are prepared to develop it into the premier airport that it should be and make it a proper and proud gateway to South Australia. Privatisation would also enhance its export potential. The South Australian government's position on privatisation, particularly on the runway extension, has been clear all along, and it has committed funds to upgrade it. The minister is holding up an article. I was there last Tuesday when the announcement was made that the coalition would bring forward the sale of the Adelaide airport by two years, which was welcomed by the state government.",41
79,Mr BRERETON,NOES,"Without the extension.  item to the sale of the airport. You have linked them together, but they are not necessarily linked together.",42
80,Mr BRERETON,NOES,"Where's the money coming from?  the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) came to South Australia six months ago, when you announced the upgrade of the Mount Barker Road. You did not say then that this was consequent upon the sale of Kingsford Smith airport. You said then that this was money and cash for South Australia, for the Mount Barker Road and for the Adelaide airport extension.",42
81,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The member might like to direct his comments through the chair, and the minister will have the opportunity to comment at a later stage.  er. The government cannot now say that one is consequent upon the other when it said six months ago that this was funding for South Australia. I suppose it was designed to be a big pay-off to South Australia in order to make them vote for it at the next federal election. I think the government is in for a surprise. The South Australian government is supportive of the coalition position to bring forward the sale of the Adelaide airport. It committed funds to the upgrade and it is encouraging private enterprise to be involved in the upgrade of the airport, both the runway and the terminals, as well as the sale of the airport to private interests. The Federal Airports Corporation has played an extraordinary role in the continuing disregard for South Australia and Adelaide in its treatment of the Adelaide airport. I was sitting on a committee only 12 months ago when I asked the Federal Airports Corporation about when it was planning on doing anything about the parlous state of the Adelaide airport. Its answer was, '2008.' It has no regard for South Australians. It is just another example of the regard this government, based in Canberra and Sydney, has for the outlying states. The Federal Airports Corporation has been an enormous disappointment to South Australia. They find excuses and reasons time and again why they cannot do anything about Adelaide airport, and the government backs them up. Why has South Australia been done in the eye by this government?",43
82,Mr CADMAN,NOES,Why do they hate South Australia?  Australia? (Time expired),43
83,Mr BRERETON,NOES,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (12.15 p.m.)-They are being done in the eye by you. It is worth going through the history of this question of the extension of Adelaide airport because it was a prime matter for debate at the time of the last national conference of the ALP. The ALP gave approval for the leasing process after a very strong performance by Mike Rann, the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, who was insistent that something had to be done because he was faced with the prospect of the airport not being extended under the FAC's proposals until well into the next century. He was insistent that it be done and done now. The conference put a condition on the leasing process for all the airports that money be made available in the first tranche from a leasing process to build Adelaide airport. That has is how it is being built. I might say that this was a process negotiated with John Olsen and Diana Laidlaw, and it was one that gives us the very result that is required-that is, the extension of the airport. Selling the airport without the extension does not solve any of the problems alluded to by the member for  runway for international fully-laden wide bodied jet take-offs. It does not solve those problems at all. ",43
84,Mr BRERETON,NOES,"Without the extension. The airport needs to be extended, not privatised. It can be privati sed after it has been extended. The opposition are blocking the extension of the airport by cutting off the money necessary to extend it, which comes from the leasing of Sydney airport. The honourable member for Sturt has said this was not a condition. Believe you me, it was. It was a condition negotiated by none other than Mike Rann for and on behalf of the people of South Australia. It was a condition cemented in place in our discussions with the South Australian government, with Ministers Olsen and Laidlaw. It was for that reason that Minister Olsen ing for the people of South Australia?",43
85,Mr BRERETON,NOES,"At the ALP conference last November, and he negotiated very successfully. He argued, very convincingly I thought, that the airport leases should not go ahead without the extension of Adelaide airport. It is for all these reasons that John Olsen responded to this proposal, as reported in the Adelaide Advertiser of 27 September. When he heard that the opposition here, in the interests of a handful of votes on the Bennelong headland, were going to stand in the way of what Adelaide needs, Adelaide's aspirations, the commitments given by usworked out between ourselves and South Australia-John Olsen responded. The Adelaide Advertiser reports as follows: A dismayed state industry and infrastructure minister, Mr Olsen, last night urged his federal counterparts to back down. ""We wouldn't want the problems in Sydney,"" he said, ""to delay what is a long overdue runway extension and the upgrading of Adelaide airport."" Those are not my words. They are John Olsen's words. They are very fair words. He is right. John Olsen knows what Adelaide needs. It does not need the airport privati sed without the extension because that way it will never be extended. It needs the extension now, funded from Kingsford Smith, and then the airport to be leased. It is you sitting opposite that are blocking this. Quite frankly, it is an enormous betrayal of the interests of the electors of South Australia by the member for Sturt who, gullibly, today stood in this House and said, 'It's going to be all right because we will privatise. We won't extend.' It does not matter that the money won't be there now for the extension. It does not matter that this whole process is to be delayed. Of course, this is a great betrayal. It is an enormous sell-out of the interests of South Australia. Let me say this: it is well and truly on your heads.",43
86,Mrs BISHOP,NOES,"Mackellar) (12.20 p.m.)The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) really does make it up as he goes along. No wonder nobody ever believes a word that passes his lips. First of all, we have this wonderful statement that he did all these negotiations for this fabulous deal for South Australia with the Leader of the Opposition, whose name eludes me. And where did he conduct all these marvellous negotiations? At an ALP conference. Isn't that just typical of the way this government does business? You don't talk to the legitimately elected members of the parliament who form government, you don't talk to the Premier of the day; you go off into some little smoke filled backroom and have a little chat to your Labor Party mate. That is the way it has always operated in the New South Wales Right, and well we know it. Any time we need to be reminded of it, we take a good look at Peter Baldwin's face and we remember the way you play. How dare you come into this place and -;-y you stitched up a deal with the man who was Leader of the Opposition, whose name nobody can remember. How dare you come in here and tell us you bypassed the proper Westminster and parliamentary processes so that you can do deals on the sly with your mates. What an affront you are to this parliament. It is no wonder you have the reputation that you have-well documented in that book Mates. It should be compulsory reading for anyone who has to do business with you. The extension to the Adelaide airport has already begun. This process of sale of airports is not, even under your plans, meant to begin until 1 July 1996. We have at the moment no regulations, no details, no nothing, of what it is you will be seIling, just a broad skeletal outline. And you have the audacity to come in here and tell the people of Adelaide that you will stop funding and stop building their extensions because you are going to sell Kingsford Smith airport in 1996 and that will provide the money to pay for it. Does that mean contractors are not going to be paid in the interim? Does that mean they have got to wait? Where is the explanation for those people? You really do make it up, Minister. This is all justified on the basis that you did a nasty little deal in a backroom with one of your mates, somebody who is not in government, rejected by the people of South Australia-and for good and proper reasons-who were bankrupted by the Labor Party, just as Victoria was bankrupted by the Labor Party. You left generation after generation imbued with debt. And this is the same Labor Party. It does not matter whether it is the South Australian Labor Party, the federal Labor Party or the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party. Each and every one of you operates with the same lack of morality-no ethics. You bypass, as I said, the properly elected people of the day and do a little deal to hypothecate the payment of the bills for the extension of the runway out of the proceeds of a sale that is not even meant, under your plan, to take place for years to come. You have the hide to stand here and tell us you care about the people of Sydney who suffer under those traffic patterns-the traffic patterns that you forced on them after November 1994, the ones that you say have to be. I remind you again, Minister: two runways at an airport plus an extra one makes three. Only the Labor Party is unable to count. Obviously, you cannot count with regard to the Adelaide airport either. I think it is incumbent upon each and every body in this place to take note of a couple of your comments about your grubby little deals and the way you think you can run it for the Labor Party's benefit and to hell with anybody who is not part of your coterie. I have got news for you. We are sick of deals that were done between former Prime Minister Hawke and present Prime Minister Keating with Bill Kelty and Peter Abeles at Kirribilli. We are sick to death of other sly little meetings that take place in other people's - ouses, trying to influence the outcome of thmgs of which we never know the consequences. We are sick to death, and the Australian people are sick to death, of the sort of hypocrisy you bring into this place, saying that you care about battlers when you could not even find one if you fell over one. Since when have you ever been in contact with small business people who are every day risking their very house and home in order to make interest repayments on loans they have taken out in order to conduct a small business and employ a few folk? In that area you are pretty special too. You put every enc-m­ brance in their way to stop them from being able to employ young people. The people of Australia have had enough. We are sick to death of the fact that the Labor Party thinks it is their preserve to get rich while the people get poor. When it comes to the question of Adelaide, we are not going to wear your cant.

87,Mr BRERETON,NOES,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (12.25 p.m.)-That was a particularly irrelevant diatribe. I thought the deal that Mike Rann did for South Australia at the last ALP congress was a pretty good one. It was a very good one, in fact. What it did was to secure for South Australia something that South Australia had wanted, asked for and been denied for many years, and that is the extension of the airport.",45
88,Mr CADMAN,NOES,Why did you deny them?,45
89,Mr BRERETON,NOES,It had been denied by the FAC.,45
90,Mr CADMAN,NOES,"No, by you. You're in charge.",45
91,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The member for Mitchell will cease interjecting.  commercially they did believe it was within their priorities until very well into the next century. That was the FAC's position. The  debate. It was about the only factual thing that he said. Mike Rann went to that conference and he secured a very good outcome that was all about South Australia. Let me tell you this: there was nothing grubby about it. It was a very honourable process with a very honourable outcome. I know it; Mike Rann knows it; everyone who was at that conference knows it; everyone in South Australia knows it; and Mike Rann's political opponent, the Premier of South Australia, particularly knows it. This is what he had to say about the outcome. A media release on Premier Brown's own letterhead said: Premier Dean Brown today welcomed the agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments for the funding of the Adelaide Airport runway extension. ""This agreement represents the start. of a new era for Adelaide Airport,"" Mr Brown said. ""The extension of the runway will open up South Australia to significant new international tourism opportunities and increase airfr-ight <;>f peris-able goods, particularly seafood, Into internatIOnal markets, especially in Asia. ""The State Government made improvements to the Adelaide Airport and lengthening of the runway a key priority when it took office 18 months ago. ""Now, after intense negotiations with the Federal Government we have secured agreement on major elements of the upgrading work. He was elated; he was delighted. Everyone can take great credit for this, including Mike Rann. Dean Brown was delighted and John Olsen thought it was terrific. Everyone was extraordinarily happy. But then what happened? We reach this chamber on the eve of the forthcoming election and, for the sake of a few lousy votes in John Howard's own electorate of Bennelong, the whole process is derailed. Sydney airport is excluded from the sale by an abuse of the opposition numbers in the Senate. The proceeds are not there to go on with this work. Sure, it will be extended, because we are people of our word. But there is no doubt that, because the sale will be delayed and, if they go ahead with their threat, this legislation will have to be reintroduced in the next parliament some time after the next budget, there will be a delay of at least a year in these processes. That delay will be purely and simply the work of those sitting opposite. The aspirations of Dean Brown, the aspirations of Mike Rann, the aspirations of the people of Adelaide and the aspirations that go right across the political course will all be dashed as a result of this act of absolute and utter stupidity by the shadow minister and John Howard. But for what? For the sake of a handful of lousy votes to try to convince people in Sydney that John Howard does not mean what he said over 20 years of active political pursuit; that is, that Kingsford Smith should be expanded and that a parallel runway should be built in the certain knowledge that its construction would involve the north-south axis. He said that again and again. He knew what he was saying. Everyone opposite and everyone in Sydney knows that th.is was always the position of the opposition, as it was the position of the New South Wales Liberal government. Their own submission to the EIS said that traffic on the east-west would be eliminated, that people would be worse off with the north-south but that it was all right because more people would be better off rather than worse off. There was always an acknowledgment-a political acknowledgment, absolutely clear, pure and simple-by everyone in the opposition and by everyone in New South Wales that this traffic was going to operate on a north-south axis, as it has to on safety and capacity considerations. Today you think you can pull the wool over the eyes of the people of Sydney and have them not believe what you have been telling them for 20 years. (Time expired)",45
92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Mitchell, I remind the House that the stage we are at is the consideration in detail of the bill. We have before us the member for Mackellar's amendments Nos 1 to 5. As such, the comments should be directed to the amendments before the House. I ask honourable members to bear that in mind during the debate.",46
93,Mr CADMAN,NOES," Mr Deputy Speaker, I understand your requirement to take note of the matters before the House. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who has just resumed his seat, said that everybody in Sydney knew that there was going to be a change in the configuration with the construction of the additional north-south runway and everybody knew that aircraft were going to be directed onto the north-south runway.",46
94,Mr BRERETON,NOES,You knew.,46
95,Mr CADMAN,NOES,"You were in government and your own minister, Gary Punch, resigned because he did not know that. He did not know it, and neither did anybody else. You are saying that Punch is a dill for resigning because he should have known there was going to be a change in the configuration. That is what you are saying. It is illogical, Minister. Nobody knew that. The three runways were going to be used in conjunction. That has always been the position of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the Fraser government and successive members of the Liberal Party. We were quite clear as to how Sydney airport was to be used. You interfered politically. You interfered in November 1994. You thought influencing seats was a smart thing to do to win the New South Wales election. You could not believe your success when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) endorsed that process. Laurie Oakes, in an article in the Bulletin, had it exactly right when he described what happened. It is no use you denying that. This is exactly what occurred: the Prime Minister and cabinet came in and said that we were going to do it this way, we were going to close the east-west. The Prime Minister has a record of closing runways. He closed one at Bankstown because it aligned with his house when he lived there. That is the fact of the matter: he closed a runway at Bankstown. He has a record of closing runways if they do not suit his personal convenience. That is the way in which this whole thing has operated: it is a matter of personal convenience. In relation to the minister's description of the deals done in Adelaide, it is not a process of inclusive politics. It is a process of doing deals. Minister, you described it that way. You do not stand for the whole community. You represent the Labor Party here. You do not represent your fellow Australians. Nothing could be clearer in the way in which you are now trying to blackmail the Australian community into agreeing with you because it is a Labor Party policy. Let me refer to the precision of these amendments and what the bill proposes. Your proposition, Minister, is that if we prevent leasing of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) all of your works programs will stop. The budget does not say that. The budget is not predicated on any sales. I have here your transport budget, which you signed off. Here it isyour budget for 1995-96 for the transport portfolio. It is all your stuff. It has pretty pictures in it. There is not a thing in it about the sale of airports being essential for you to complete your program. You do not say that in your budget. Is your budget wrong? Let me have a look at the works proposed at Badgerys Creek which you say cannot proceed unless you get this legislation. The EIS was supposed to have started in July. It has not yet started, so there has been no loss of money. Even though much of the work has not started, the works program for Badgerys Creek until the end of this year, 1995, was supposed to have been community consultation, negotiation and funding of lease, environmental assessment, design and documentation, infrastructure design, flight path and airspace management, EIS on Elizabeth Drive, west Sydney orbital stage 1 EIS, the west Sydney orbital stage 2 EIS and the negotiation of contractual arrangements-none of this requiring a single dollar. It is all paper and telephones. Until the end of this year you do not need a cent for Sydney airport; you do not need a cent for Badgerys Creek. You do not need a cent until well into next year. But you are now saying that not selling Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport is going to stop the construction of Badgerys Creek and cause havoc in South Australia. Nobody will believe that. We just need to get that lorry of lies running around the suburbs telling the people what the real truth is, because you are certainly not telling them the real truth. The coalition's decision that you need to open the east-west runway is a logical and carefully thought through decision. It is not going to create disruption to anybody or anything. The fact of the matter is that you could give our proposition the tick here in the House, it could go through the Senate and it would be all done. Overnight you would achieve your results. But, no, you prefer to the blame others and say that it is going to cause havoc. It will cause havoc only if you choose to let it. (Time expired)  to wrap up some of my comments about the previous speeches made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in this debate.",46
96,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I would like you to try to stick to the amendments.  stick to the amendments, too.",47
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I have drawn this to the attention of the House at this stage of the debate on purpose. So I ask you to try to be drawing the House's attention to the standing orders. This has been a very freeranging debate for the entire morning.,47

99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! I simply drew to the attention of all members of the House before that there have been some areas where people on both sides have strayed from the amendments. I took the opportunity to do that for that very reason before I called the member for Mitchell. I ask you to try to do the same thing.  your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker.",48
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I am sure you will.  debate that he linked the sale of the Kingsford Smith airport to the extension of the Adelaide runway. Nothing could be further from the truth. Six months ago or more, when the Adelaide airport extension was announced, the government made no mention of this being linked in any way to the sale of Kingsford Smith airport. It is now just a convenient ruse of the government to say that the coalition in some way has some responsibility for the Adelaide airport. The reality is that this government is trying to yet again adopt the thuggery tactics that it has adopted for 13 years as a government in Australia. Mrs Bishop-It is far too late.  announcement and it is far too late for the minister, as the member for Mackellar says, to make it up as he goes along and try to link that into the debate. The minister also spoke about the extraordinary role Mike Rann played at the ALP conference in. the announcement of the extension of the Adelaide runway. It is extraordinary that Mike Rann would now be trying to involve himself in the credit for the airport extension at Adelaide airport. He was in government for 12 years, he was the minister for tourism, and he is now trying to come along and pretend that for some reason the government is going to say, 'This is a bipartisan issue. Let's all get the credit for it.' The reality is that the ALP did nothing as the South Australian government, except destroy the state's finances. The minister says that the aspirations of Mike Rann have been fulfilled. Big deal! For goodness sake, Mike Rann is not the Premier of South Australia and he never will be the Premier of South Australia. He was once a minister, he had his chance and he failed dismally. We are not going to let them try to ride on our wash, try to ride in on our success. The South Australian government, as I said before, supports the coalition's position of bringing forward the sale of Adelaide airport by two years and putting it in the first tranche. I never said that we should privatise without the extension of the Adelaide airport runway, as you claim that I did in your previous contribution. I never said that. They are separate items. The extension of the runway is in place and it is proceeding. Plans have been drawn up.",48
101,Mr BRERETON,NOES,"We need money for it.  nounced six months ago had nothing to do with the Kingsford Smith airport. You did not say that back then. The plans have been drawn up and the system of road diversions that surround the airport is under way. The money was allocated. If you are now trying to go back on that, you will pay a large price in South Australia at the next federal election. There is no doubt that this government stands bereft of any principle with respect to this matter and so many other issues, as I have observed in my short experience as the member for Sturt. I am disappointed in the government, as are the people of South Australia. They have every reason to be. I hope the government will reconsider its position on some of these amendments and support the coalition's position.",48
102,Mrs BISHOP,NOES,"I am sure that the residents of the North Shore-whom the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has today tagged 'a lousy handful of votes' - will be very pleased to know that that is the way in which they are regarded by this minister. Apparently, they are to be denied the democratic principle of being able to express their point of view, just as we have seen the minister say that a duly and properly elected government in South Australia is bypassed in the doing of an unseemly deal in a back room of a Labor Party conference, with a Labor Party apparatchik who now holds himself out to be the Leader of the Opposition. The government has refused to accede to our amendments. We did let these bills pass the second reading stage to give the government the opportunity to see reason and pass the amendments. We then could have allowed the bill to receive a third reading. But the government has chosen not to do that. So, accordingly, we will again be opposing this bill at the third reading stage. I think what has been shown in the course of this debate is, very simply, that this Labor Party is unto itself, a law alone. It has no truck, it cares not at all, for anybody who is outside its sphere of influence or the people over whom it can exert influence. As I said earlier, if you really want to remember the lengths to which this lot will go, take a look every day at Peter Baldwin's face: bashed and meant to be dead. We have come to the stage in this debate where ordinary mums and dads-who are suffering at the hands of this minister's political decision to inflict noise pain on them-are becoming unhealthy; where psychiatrists are being involved; and, as I have said before, where property values are dropping. And all of this does not even register with the minister because he calls them 'a handful of lousy votes'. Well, Minister, I suspect that there are a lot other Australians whom you consider to be 'handfuls of lousy votes' who are going to rise up at the next election and just tell you what they think of you and your government. As for your interjections about 'shooting in the foot', you have not got any feet left. You have done it so often that you stand there on stumps at the end of your legs. It is time that you realised that you cannot ride roughshod over individuals' hopes and aspirations and simply disregard them because you have done some deal with some group. It just is not an acceptable Australian way. We will go forward to this election remembering many of the words that you have used in this debate to describe your contempt, your utter contempt, for individual Australians who are merely trying to get on with the business of running a family, of keeping a household together, of having some quality of life-and you have termed them 'a handful of lousy votes'. As far as I am concerned, Minister, every individual Australian has the right to be considered. It does not matter if they belong to the same political party or not. We have forms of government and governance in this country which have to be observed. Along with a lot of other people, I have read the texts of Mates and other books which show how you and your mates operate. As we go into the next century, we are going in there to have a clean government. We are going in there to have one that governs for all Australians-not just for their sectional interests and their mates. The Australian people have had enough. This cavalier attitude-this one that rides roughshod over the rights of individuals who are trying to be responsible-is simply not going to wear you lot any more. This debate has encapsulated it. This debate is about fairness and equity-concepts which I am afraid this government lost touch with a long time ago. Question put: That the amendments (Mrs Bishop's) be agreed to. The House divided.

(2) Clause 45, page 23, paragraph (3)(a), line 24, omit ""airport lease"", substitute ""lease"". (3) Clause 45, page 23, after subclause (3) insert the following subclauses: ""(3A) If subsection (2) does not apply to the property, section 60 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 has effect as if the company had acquired the property from the FAC instead of from another person. ""(3B) If subsection (2) does not apply to the property, the Minister for Finance may make a written determination that the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 relating to depreciation have effect as if the depreciated value of the property at the time of the grant were equal to the amount specified in the determination. ""(3C) The determination has effect accordingly.

(5) Clause 76, page 43, at the end of the clause add the following subclause: ""(2) If an airport lease for an airport is granted to a company under section 20 or 21 of this Act, a Commonwealth record (within the meaning of the Archives Act 1983) must not be transferred to the company in connection with the operation of this Act in relation to the airport unless the Australian Archives has given permission for the transfer under paragraph 24(2)(b) of that Act."".

(7) Schedule 4, page 63, after item 3 insert the following item: ""4. Transitional The amendment made by item 2A does not affect the appointment of a person who held office as a member immediately before the commencement of this item."". The amendments are self-explanatory, so I will not delay the House by adding anything further.",50
104,Mrs BISHOP,PAIRS,"I do not intend to delay the House on dealing with these amendments either, but I do think, as the bulk of these amendments relate to two issues-firstly, tax related issues, which presumably is the government acceding to representations made to them by potential bidders and, secondly, restructuring or new requirements for the FAC board-I think the minister does owe the House an explanation as to the reason for these amendments in a fairly concise way.",51
105,Mr BRERETON,PAIRS,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (12.55 p.m.)-As it has been requested, I will be more than happy to do that. The two tax related amendments are being introduced to clause 45 to ensure that holders of leases over the airports will be treated in the same way for taxation purposes as if they had been granted leases by a nontax exempt body-that is, the Federal Airports Corporation-and that lessees of the FAC are not disadvantaged by becoming lessees of an airport company, Clauses 74 and 76 are being amended to clarify requirements under the Archives Act 1983, and schedule 4 is being amended to provide future flexibility on the number of members who may be appointed to the FAC board. I commend the amendments to the House.",51
106,Mrs BISHOP,PAIRS,"I thank the minister for reading us those few things, but there are a couple of questions I would like him to answer. In relation to those provisions dealing with the definition of an asset, I wonder if the minister could clarify for the House the implications of that section and that amendment on concessionary leases which are presently held. Secondly, could he tell us why we need the additional flexibility for the board of the continuing FAC? I note from the amendments that it is proposed to enlarge the size of the FAC board. I wonder why that is necessary when, in fact, they are going to have less responsibility and not more.",51
107,Mr BRERETON,PAIRS,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (12.57 p.m.)-The advice to the House is that the amendment in respect of leases will have no effect whatsoever on sublessees. In respect of the second matter raised by the honourable member-that is, the question of FAC board membership-that merely allows for a variation of the numbers on the board in the future. In other words, the board does not have to comprise its full complement as the FAC proceeds down the track of its role being diminished through the disposal of the airports to the various lessees in tranche one and tranche two.",51
108,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"Mitchell) (12.58 p.m.)There are a number of points right through the whole process of both bills where ministerial responsibility is the ultimate factor. I am seeking clarification from the minister. In regard to the commercial operations of airports, will you be requiring reports where you will set the commercial thrust of what is occurring in the airport? I am seeking to clarify the minister's role. What is he expecting to do in regard to the management of each airport? Are you going to have a hands-on approach or will you expect them to operate commercially and refer only certain matters to you?",51
109,Mr BRERETON,PAIRS,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (12.59 p.m.)-I just draw to the honourable member's attention that the point he has raised is completely outside the scope of the matter before the House at this moment. But if he takes the time to read the Hansard of yesterday, if he was not able to be present and listen to the outline I gave of all of the reporting arrangements and the transparency provisions, then he will find a cogent answer to all his questions.

110,Ms WORTH,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) is a very important bill. I am pleased that I am able to complete my speech, which was interrupted by the adjournment debate two nights ago. Clearly there is already a lack of responsiveness in the system and the 'clever country' rationale for expansion is not being realised. Finally, I would like to comment on the government's failure to foster an economy which is able to absorb the young people being educated in our universities. When the Dawkins revolution was sold to the Australian public in 1988, a major argument for the changes was that Australia's young needed to be educated to fill the highly skilled positions that were to be generated under a Labor government. Parents and young people accepted this story and invested money, energy and hope in the acquisition of a university education. Too many have found that the government's sales pitch was a gross distortion of reality. While graduate unemployment is lower than unemployment for young people without degrees, there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that graduates have simply shifted into positions formerly held by non-graduates, rather than into the highly skilled positions promised them by the Labor government. Not only is this a tragedy for the non-graduates who are pushed into unemployment by the influx of graduates into positions previously held by non-graduates; it is also a tragedy for the young graduates who worked so hard towards a dream which they are now finding to be empty. When reading about the 1995 AustralianN ogel Literary Award last month, I was struck by the sense of betrayal expressed by the 27-year-old winner of the award, Richard King. Richard was quoted as saying: My generation was brought up being promised so much ... we found it wasn't there. This is a damning indictment of the Labor government that has been in power for the last 13 years.",53
111,Mr LATHAM,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I join with the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) in saying this is a very important piece of legislation. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995 is the sort of bill that goes to the heart of the social justice debate in which the parliament has been engaging in recent months. On that, in my experience, working people in Australia at'e concerned not so much with ownership issues as with skills and opportunities, and the active role of government in enhancing the economic and social capability of those genuinely in need. Australia's education system is at the heart of this task. I had two reminders of this recently, both of them relevant to the higher education sector. The first of them was the comments made by Rupert Murdoch, expressing concern about the development of an underclass and the high level of youth unemployment in some parts of Australia. I thought people on the coalition side had a hide in making some of their comments on social justice issues, but for someone who sponsored the Thatcherite revolution in Britain and actively supported Reaganomics in the United States to be complaining about the development of an underclass is, indeed, exceptionally rich. The second reminder on these issues arose on Monday. I noticed in the Sydney Morning Herald that the average TER-the equivalent these days of what had been known as the HSC-mark was twice as high in the north shore and eastern suburbs of Sydney than in western Sydney and south-western Sydney. The interesting thing about those figures---of course, they are in relation to school education-is that once people from western and south-western Sydney gain entry to university they do as well as people from any other part of Sydney. This reinforces the importance of the link between higher education and school education and, in both sectors, the importance of the home learning environment. It is very important to broaden our concept of education beyond formal institutions, be they school education or higher education, to include the home learning environment where issues of advantage and disadvantage are so important. I outline four principles that I believe are significant in the parliament's consideration of higher education in Australia. The first of those principles, of course, is the need for quality outcomes. What we have found, with the internationalisation of the Australian economy, is that all factors of production have now become mobile, except human skills. In many respects, the quality of human skills determines a nation's wealth. The new growth theorists, who are becoming very popular in economic debates and forums, have emphasised the importance of a culture of innovation in a country in order to have successful trading and economic arrangements. A culture of entrepreneurship is very important for a nation's economic success. Higher education in Australia should be at the absolute vanguard of the shift in culture. Also, I think, on the issue of social values and leadership our universities need to playa more prominent role in the public debate. I was recently part of the parliament's delegation to the European parliament. As part of that, we listened to Chancellor Kohl, the German Chancellor, at the Council of Europe. He explained how all Western societies have an opportunity, in the 1990s and beyond, to define our societies by combining 'the humanism of antiquity with the rationalism of our times'. That is a beautiful phrase and a beautiful set of ideals and values that are all about excellence, quality, compassion and a more enlightened society. Our universities should be at the absolute vanguard of defining such values and actively promoting their worth throughout all parts of Australian society. The second principle I would define for the higher education sector is in terms of responsiveness to economic change and responsiveness to the internationalisation of the Australpromoting Ian economy. I have used this example in the parliament previously but I think it is worth repeating. Alcatel is a telecommunications company just to the north of my electorate. Its training cycle, its education cycle, is of just six months duration. Because of rapid technological change in that industry the company cannot sensibly plan ahead for the training needs of its staff for any more than six months. This emphasises the problem for those in school or higher education who want to focus excessively on fixed content. I notice that Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, is trying to focus on content. Content, of course, is always changing as technology and our economy change in response to international pressures. In many respects, with regard to fixed content in the curriculum of schooh or universities, once people leave those institutions they remember very little of the content they picked up at school or university. The way of learning is all important and that is really where our universities should be placing more emphasis. Are our universities in Australia responsive to these influences? Are they responsive to the sorts of economic and social changes that Australia has gone through over the last 10 to 15 years? I have some reservations about institutions that are based on guaranteed income, institutions that are based on tenurethat is, guaranteed employment for staff no matter the quality of their outcomes. I have reservations about outdated management methods in the university sector in Australia. Our universities, essentially, are based on 19th century small '1' liberal values embracing diversity at any cost, a belief in learning for the sake of learning and a feudal protection of tenure and academic freedom. It is my very strong belief that our nation, with the challenges it faces over coming decades, needs much more than learning for learning's sake. We need learning and skills that are relevant to our economic position and our social requirements. This is where universities have such an important role to play. They must be relevant to the economy and, of course, provide social leadership in terms of more enlightened social values. The third principle I will address is this issue of a lifetime commitment to education. I think it is a peculiar thing in Australiaindeed, it is an unusual thing-when we look at some of our trading competitors. In Australia, education is seen as something that people undertake until their early 20s and it is somewhat of a task. What we need in Australia is an ethos of continuous, lifelong education throughout all parts of the population. There must be continuous updating of the skills and knowledge required for people to be successful in internationalised economic arrangements, successful in a post-industrial society. This issue of continuous education, a lifetime commitment, and the promotion of a government framework for lifetime education basically requires a revolution in our thinking about education, including the higher education sector and the systems of service delivery that we have inherited over the decades. The fourth question I will raise-and I mentioned this earlier on-is equity, the problem of intergenerational disadvantage in our post-industrial society. We really do need to tackle the fact that, while our schools can have a disadvantaged schools program and while we can have equity funding for universities, we need to link those initiatives to the home learning environment. That is the root cause of educational disadvantage in Australia in the 1990s. New forms of information technology are the great opportunity for linking the home and the formal learning environment. Some of these methods may be intensive in their case management. Some of these methods may be expensive in their case management and their administration for government, but it is an expense that is well worth meeting if we are to meet the challenge of a more inclusive society. If we are to find the sorts of remedies that Rupert Murdoch would press upon us in his pious complaints then we should realise that ever smaller government is not the answer. Some of these remedies have a fiscal cost. Those who want to argue the case for social justice and a more inclusive society should be willing to meet the cost. It is important to recognise those realities. Smaller government is not an answer when it comes to building a more inclusive, a more socially just Australia. I would suggest also that universities should be more active in addressing these issues of educational inequity and educational disadvantage. I was quite inspired to read a com Wilenski, one of the great educational administrators and reformers in Australia's history. He made the speech in my part of Sydney at the University of Western Sydney, in its formative days, on 10 October 1987. I think it is a very good statement to provide to the parliament. He stated: Issues of equity of access should not be afterthoughts forced on a university by reformist governments. They go to the heart of what a university is about. The socio-economic maldistribution in our university student population, the fact that children of poor parents are many more times unlikely to go to university than children of equal ability from wealthy families, represents not only a major social injustice and enormous waste of talent for society, but also a deviation from the pursuit of excellence by universities who as a result have less than the best students. It is little wonder that the half of the community which is less advantaged has not come to the defence of the universities when the universities appear to have so little relevance to their lives or those of their children. Of course, the fault lies to a large extent with the pre-university education system but universities can have a major role in influencing that system. There are big challenges for higher education in Australia in meeting each of these four principles. I was delighted to learn that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has appointed a higher education management review team which is due to report in December. I also noticed with some degree of interest that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and some of the other authorities in higher education were very concerned about the fact that there would be an external review of their relevance to our economic arrangements and to the training and skill requirements in Australia. I think it is a good sign that the universities are apprehensive about the external review. They should not be immune from the review process-the sort of reform, the sort of initiative that has affected all sections of our society, the school education system, TAFE, and all forms of learning. Universities should not be sheltered away, hiding behind walls of academic tenure and attempts to secure academic freedom at any cost. The legislation before the House is interesting and very important because it addresses some of these key issues of equity in the distribution of resources between states and the distribution of resources by the federal government between universities. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) makes amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to adjust funding levels as a result of the allocation of new places, additional research funds, carry forward of quality funds and the inclusion of funding for 1997 and 1998. Funding will be provided to close to 6,000 new higher education places, plus those in the pipeline, in the years 1996 to 1998 to states with strong population growth and currently low participation rates. Queensland will major beneficiary of these places, as will South Wales and Western Australia. They will also be receiving additional places. I delighted-I note that my colleague the academics member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) is at the table-that the University of Western Sydney has been a major beneficiary of the additional growth allocation in New South Wales. I congratulate the minister, Mr Simon Crean, on his initiative. He is a minister is prepared to take on the difficult public policy task of redistributing much needed policy. university resources to areas of rapid population growth like the west and south-west of Sydney to areas like our region which has low participation rates for tertiary education. Good on Simon Crean for doing these things. I look forward to the formalisation of this type of funding formula, to build into the institutions this sense of redistribution. We have a chanpopulation ging economy, changing growth in population and changing social needs. A region such as greater western Sydney should never be population overlooked as part of that process. The package provides the consideration given to faster growing regions with low rates of tertiary participation. The challenge now to institutionalise these transfers in education funding formulas. The model adopted in 1990 by the government served as It an aggregate historical cost system adjusted through teaching and research related cost areas components. Added to this base level is tion approved funding for growth. Once growth has been allocated it becomes part of the base for the following year of the rolling triennium: that is, each university's funding generally equals last year's base, adjusted for changes in the teaching profile and research requirement, plus a growth component. Under these arrangements, the arrangements that the minister has now altered, it was very difficult to move resources between institutions. The tendency was to entrench the funding position of larger, older universities and aggravate the financial challenge facing newer universities in regions of rapid population growth. Only the redistribution of public resources can ensure that the rate of population growth in outer metropolitan areas such be a as my seat in the south-west of Sydney is New matched by the growth in government services. Politically this is never a simple task. am Entrenched interest will fight hard, even will fight hard, to preserve existing facilities and benefits compared to regions which have gone without and are struggling to secure new services. Nowhere are vested interests more entrenched than in Australia's universities. The mystique of research and administrative autonomy has produced a who feeling that somehow universities should be treated differently from other areas of public The time is long overdue to bring higher education into the mainstream of political principles, and a number of reforms stand out. The first of those is to institutionalise, to build into funding formulas, the redistribution of funds to universities on the basis of high growth and low tertiary particiT)ation-it is a basic equity principle. The second initiative is to make sure that growth in outer metropolitan areas is accommodated by growth in outer metropolitan universities, not inner city institutions. I noted that the joint DEET-Higher Education Council working party at the end of last year is expressed a remarkable view. This is what the the higher discussion paper had to say: is not considered that all, or even most, of the resources made available to a State should automatically be allocated to regional institutions in of high population growth or low participain higher education. In the major capital cities in particular. a number of universities will be in commuting distance for most students. There is no reason to exclude institutions in inner city areas, for example, from access to additional resources simply because of their location ... What the discussion paper is effectively saying is that location is not relevant. Try telling that to a university aspirant living in my electorate in Campbelltown, where in driving time people are closer to Goulburn than they are to Sydney University or the University of New South Wales. Try telling that to the thousands of students in that region of the 1970s and 1980s-I was one of themwho did not have a university in their part of Sydney and had to commute for 1Y2 hours one way, three hours each day, to Camperdown for Sydney University or to Kensington for the University of New South Wales. The travelling time and the expense were a great disadvantage, a great hardship to the students of Sydney's west and south-west. It is my very strong belief, as it is within the government, that resources for regions of fast population growth need to be allocated to the universities which directly service those regions. I reject this spurious argument that somehow inner city institutions can equitably and fairly service the needs of university students on the urban fringe. The DEET-HEC approach would impose large costs in travel time and expenses on students from outer metropolitan areas. It does not sit well with policies to provide equality of higher education opportunity. The 1994 ALP national conference resolved to develop a series of social justice benchmarks on access and equity issues. Higher education funding should set basic standards for the availability of university places and reducing the time and expenses faced by student commuters, particularly those at the urban fringe. My third initiative would be to develop funding formulas on the basis of regional rather than state needs. The DEET-HEC discussion paper used state boundaries as its unit of locational analysis. This contradicts the government's general support for regionalism and funding arrangements that support regional equity. Real geographic distinctions in Australia are regional, not between the states. State boundaries-lines drawn in at Whitehall last century-have shown themselves to be an irrelevant guide to locational inequality. For instance, while the New South Wales population is projected to fall, some parts of the state, such as the north coast and also the south-west of Sydney, face some of the highest rates of population growth in all of Australia. My fourth initiative-and I trust the minister is keen on this idea-is to build socio-economic indicators and notions of regionality into the higher education funding formulas. The Kelty report on regional development in 1993 recommended the government should take into account the regional services provided by higher education institutions when assessing their eligibility for funding. The availability of skilled labour is now arguably the single most important determinant of regional competitiveness. Educational agendas can be tuned to regional agendas while also addressing international competitiveness, thus becoming important instruments for economic development. Funding allocations to support these objectives can be tied to specific projects or linked to broader notions of socio-economic advantage and disadvantage at a regional level. The development of these indicators for higher education funding would present few difficulties. The ABS has done significant work on the measurement of socio-economic conditions by geographic areas. The major challenge in applying these indices lies in the relationship of a higher education institution to its student catchment area. There would be little purpose in providing growth funds to an institution to increase regional participation if the bulk of students came from outside the region. It would first be necessary to establish the proportion of students of each institution which is drawn from the regional catchment. Big challenges, a good bill and good work on the part of the minister. (Time expired)",53
112,Mr RICHARD EVANS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I was interested to listen to the argument from the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I thought some of his initiatives were commendable and some of his argument was quite good. But I was interested to listen to his contribution to the debate because he started talking about the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995 about 12 minutes into his speech. He spoke basically about the varying levels of grants funding for certain higher education institutions that are part of this particular amendment. He did not speak much about the HECS debt contribution scheme. He did not speak much at all on the voluntary threshold for repayment of the HECS debt, setting new income thresholds at which people become liable to repay their HECS debts, introducing a mandatory up-front payment for HECS for certain New Zealanders and non-citizens, and removing the HECS exemption scholarships for the professional development of teachers. I am going to address some of those issues today, because it is an abomination-the Labor government's great HECS hoax. Far too often, for far too long, we have heard tirade of Labor government rhetoric, reaction and, in some ways, rhubarb. All too often, have heard the slick promises couched terms of equity, fairness and across-the-board change when the reality is that the Labor cent government is set on one course and one flavoured milk. course alone. That is the money course: the yellow brick road to revenue collection. government has a bag full of revenue raising tricks, all underhanded, all covert and all the chair. designed to rob-yes, rob-ordinary Australians of a few dollars here and a few dollars there, in the same fashion as that of a sneakoverlook thief or a crafty cat burglar stealing in the night. Today's HECS debate is but one example better. of the way the government operates. It is yet another example of appearing to do the right thing but, in reality, stifling the opportunity of some Australian-some Mr or Mrs Avergreat age. In this case, it is the student who is the target. Fortunately, I am not aligned to the government's way of thinking, and I suspect their current practices are less than honest. speak in facts, not rhetoric. Let me give a few examples of the governstretched ment's hidden attack on the people of Australtheir is and some of its covert activities. Since studies. 1993, Australians have had to absorb a hidden hike in sales tax, a hidden hike that has the working Australian--the good, old-fashforeign-foreign ioned, true-blue Aussie battler-having to absorb and actually pay for increases in sales taxes of the magnitude of 46 per cent on passenger vehicles, a whopping 30 per cent on wines and cider and 10 per cent on essential items such as toothpaste and soap. I am just building a case here about what the government does by stealth, to get to the legislation.",57
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,I am glad you are building a case and I hope you do get to the legislation fairly quickly.,58
114,Mr RICHARD EVANS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I will do that. But, when it comes to the basics, one could not get anything more essential or necessary than a roll of toilet paper. Even this has seen a sales tax increase of 10 per cent. Dare I say it, the humble packet of iced vo-vo biscuits did not escape the government's grab for a money. Yes, this coconut and jam mainstay of Australia in the 1960s is now almost a we lUxury item for many families in Australia. in Why is this? It is because biscuits-ven biscuits-have attracted an increase of 20 per in sales tax, together with fruit juice and The Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member for Cowan is trying the patience of",58
115,Mr RICHARD EVANS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I accept what you are saying, Mr Deputy Speaker, so I will the foreign debt which, of course, is who comes the Australian debt",58
116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,I think you had,58
117,Mr RICHARD EVANS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I will move on. But all are examples of hidden or covert collection of money, and that is what this HECS hoax is all about. I call it a hoax in that it all seems okay on the surface, but in fact there are a few issues quietly slipped into this bill that are not all that they seem. They I are actually yet another way for the government to squeeze more money from the already budgets of students and possibly of families who sponsor or support their It seems that the Prime Minister (Mr seen Keating) has taken a shine to all things debt, foreign students, foreign clocks, and foreign suits in some cases. So the government clan has decided that there is real loot to be made by having these 'foreigners' studying in the Australian education system. The government has decided, in its so-called wisdom, that it will have a mandatory up-front payment for all education fees paid by non-citizens-notice that I was careful to avoid that word 'foreign'--or permanent Australian residents who do not take out Australian citizenship. This has been designed to stop people from overseas undertaking education in Australia and then leaving the country without paying their HECS. But here is the hoax: how does this relate, translate to or help our long standing permanent residents who, for various reasons-and often very personal reasons-have not taken out Australian citizenship? Those students, regardless of their citizenship status, who have already commenced their studies must be protected. These people must be protected and a degree of balance and equity must prevail under these circumstances. On a different level, the changes in this regard may have reaching results that few would anticipate. Let us face it, education worldwide is a growing business. Educational institutions are chosen by reputation. However, this is usually balanced with the amount those potential students can afford. Students, particularly those from overseas or the children of resident Australians, want a quality education. But they also need to know what it will cost and when. Reality dictates that very few people-I stress very few-can afford an up-front payment. And the member for Werriwa was talking about equity and access! In fact, few would pay for a service they had not yet tested, and even fewer would actually pay for a service they had not yet received. If Australia is to compete in the field of education on an international scale-and I believe that as a nation we should and we can--our fee structure must be flexible and structured to entice and encourage students, and it must not develop into a system which poses a threat to potential users. However, as you probably realise, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am a bit of a pragmatist, and if this payment is to be put in place, regardless of the potential for resistance by overseas students, it must not be used to the detriment of existing students. It must be introduced only at a time that all potential students are fully aware of this up-front payment and the up-front payment requirement should not apply to existing students. The bill has another slight hoax in the making. In most bills presented by the Labor government, there seems to be some point that relates to money collection. This one is no exception. It may be couched in different terms, but the reality always seems to shine through. The government has actively encouraged students to move into tertiary education. It has done this, firstly, through their inability to provide jobs and openings in the employment sector for young people and, secondly, by encouraging most employers to consider only those people with training or academic qualifications as worthwhile employees. This has forced many young people to continue in long-term education programs and older adults to return to study as the only far- option for career development and advancement. So our tertiary institutions are full and we have increased retention rates. I think I recently heard the Vice-Chancellor of ANU saying that there were now more people studying in university than ever before but fewer people actually going to university. The question then is how is that the case when there are more people staying on at university to do their double degrees and not allowing people to enter university? What an ideal environment for the government to collect a little more revenue and put a few more dollars in their greedy little moneybags. And the result? With this bill, students will be slugged for the second time in three years, through the government seeking to accelerate the rate of repayments of HECS. This may be all very well as a revenue collection ploy. However, by changing the rules midway, our current students are denied any option to plan for their future, and are faced with constant uncertainty as to exactly what they have to pay. How can they be expected to plan ahead? We are always thinking about the future, yet we are not allowing our students-who are the future of our great nation-to plan ahead. How can students be expected to have any sort of financial management, especially when so many students are supported by families, or survive on part-time employment? It is imperative that current students and graduates are protected from the government's latest HECS grab for dollars. On a more sobering note, there is an overall tragedy in this whole scenario. The tragedy is that at a philosophical level the bill is sound, and most of the proposed changes, in essence, are not under debate. I am speaking of the HECS hoax that has been revealed in this debatethat is the tragedy. What is highly questionable is the suite of tactics which is constantly and conveniently used by the government. The government would have the people of Australia believe that it is doing a great job, but as with the HECS hoax, when you look closely into the issues, time and time again the government is revealed as caring little natural justice, fairness or balance in its thinking and policies. To sum up, there are two key areas of concern in relation to this bill. Firstly, for purposes of fairness, equity and honesty government, the repayment thresholds should and must apply only to students who comexisting mence their studies from 1996. Secondly, for the sake of fairness, equity and honesty in government, the up-front payments for students who have not taken out Australian citizenship should apply only to people who commence studies after 1996. The government should forget about the grab for dollars and address the issues-issues such as our debt and our increasing tax burden. It should learn to treat the community as thinking people and not as a group sheep who would fall for this HECS hoax.  opportunity offered by the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training government Allowance) Bill to briefly voice a number concerns that I have raised before over the government's graduate tax, the higher educathat tion contribution scheme. A constituent, who wrote to me more than two years ago, summed it up best when he said: I am scared out of my wits about the HECS schemes . . . Messrs Keating and Co can add to your debt at any time, raise interest on late payments, etcetera. We see in this bill yet more examples of the retrospectivity that makes HECS such a onesided contract. As one of the few members of this House that has paid a HECS debt, I believe the current system is unfair. It is clear to me that the system the government has put in place is inequitable and denies students and recent graduates any real sense of certainty. Tertiary fees should not be levelled in an unjust way-and HECS is. Two sections of this legislation are of particular concern to me: part 5, which provides for the new repayment thresholds for HECS, and part 9, which requires that permanent residents who have not met the requirefor ments for citizenship, one year or more before enrolment, pay up-front fees. Part 9, establishing a discount for people who commence HECS repayments before reaching the compulsory threshold, also deserves more than a the cursory glance. Part 5 of the bill provides in three new repayment thresholds for HECS. These new thresholds are inserted within the levels. This measure, in effect, entails also an accelerated rate of repayment. I remind the House that this is the third time the government has attempted to introduce an accelerated repayment rate since the HEC scheme began operation. Two years ago, I raised the same issues of certainty, the onesided nature of the HECS contract and the fact that in this contract the government was the powerful proponent, able to alter a contract, where the other side had no say in it of and could not say, 'I'm going to give up studying, because I'm not going to pay this HECS debt any more.' The students are in a totally vulnerable position. Two years ago, the tried to do the same thing, and I of raised the same issues then. At that stage, they promised that it would not happen again, there would be one change and that would be it, and that they would not move to have such an accelerated repayment again. Yet here we are debating the same issues. The coalition proposes to amend the bill so that this whole range of new measures applies only to students who begin studies from next year onwards rather than having it affect those students who have signed HECS agreements under a set of entirely different conditions. This retrospectivity in principle is wrong, but in this case it is utterly unacceptable. As I said before, the student is the vulnerable party in this contract. A student cannot start a law, arts or science degree and, when the government jacks up the HECS to be paid back through the tax system, then say, 'Right; it's time for me to move on, I'm not going to complete my degree.' Obviously, the government has complete power over that student while ever the student is studying at university and it can change the student's HECS at will. Part 9 of the bill seeks to prevent those overseas persons who undertake education in Australian tertiary institutions and then return overseas from leaving unpaid any HECS debts they may incur. DEET figures show that there are currently 26,000 permanent residents studying in Australian universities. It is estimated that around half of these meet the residency requirements that allow them to defer their HECS, and that most of the remainder will take out citizenship by the 1996 academic year, leaving only around 2,200 liable for up-front fees. This measure creates a number of concerns. The amendment, at best, can only partially prevent rorting of the system. The amendment only relates to persons who have met the citizenship requirement of two years residency as permanent residents, making it possible for students from overseas to complete a degree as a permanent resident before becoming eligible for citizenship. What is the point? Under this bill, overseas students from countries which permit dual citizenship-for example, Hong Kong-would have little difficulty in taking out Australian citizenship and returning to their country of origin, leaving their HECS debt unpaid. At the same time, the bill creates hardship for students from those countries-for example, Malaysia-that do not allow dual citizenship, who may need to retain the citizenship of their original country for a variety of reasons. So we are creating two classes of overseas students in Australia: those who will be able to avoid the government's proposals, and those who will have to make a choice and possibly suffer deleterious effects by so doing. The minister has claimed that the amendment will save $1.8 million in this fiscal year and $3.8 million in 1997-98. It appears to be a particularly cumbersome method of saving what are relatively small amounts, and when the potential for rorting that will still exist is considered it may well prove unable to even match this much. The amounts claimed are $3.8 million and $1.8 million. Only yesterday, I heard from a report that was tabled by the Australian National Audit Office that the Department of Social Security could save $86 million by changing some of the systems that it has adopted. Yet the government is happy to punish students and make their lives almost impossible and is happy to have legislation which is still full of loopholes and which students will still be able to get around-all for a measly $3.8 million and $1.8 million, when they will not make the changes that would save $86 million in the DSS! Rather than applying this measure to current students, the coalition is again seeking to amend it so that it will only affect students commencing studies in 1996. I should also mention in passing that part 4 of the bill makes provision for a discount to be offered to students and recent students who voluntarily commence the repayment of their HECS debt when their income reaches $20,000 per annum rather than when it reaches the current level, which is $26,853. Persons who are tempted by this discount to attempt to repay HECS while on incomes of this level may well find they lack the economic capacity to continue. More concerning is that fears have been expressed that this measure may well be the first step towards lowering the compulsory threshold. In other words, it may be the thin end of the wedge. Who can trust this government on HECS, on how they deal with tertiary students, when at almost every opportunity they have had to break a promise to students they have broken it? They have said it will be voluntary if you want to repay your HECS when you are earning less than $26,853. How long will it be before they lower the compulsory threshold, before they say, 'So many people are able to do so voluntarily, we will make it compulsory for everyone'? It is a very dangerous situation for students to be in when they are faced with a government that has no regard for the contract signed with students. These three aspects all demonstrate the weaknesses of the existing HECS. As I said earlier, it is inequitable and it denies its participants any real sense of certainty. Where are the NUS on the issue? Why is it that the National Union of Students have absolutely no capacity to defend students against this government? They are hopelessly inadequate. The reason they are hopelessly inadequate is that they are an arm of the ALP government and the government takes them utterly for granted. As they have demonstrated in election after election, they are more than prepared to campaign for and support the Labor Party, even though the Labor Party constantly humiliates them, takes them for granted, uses them up and spits them out. The NUS should be ashamed of themselves. It is high time they started representing students rather than representing their own ambitions for factional advancement. Under HECS, students contribute around one-fifth of the average cost of a higher education place. Each semester, students choose either to pay up-front or to defer payment. Students who can pay their fees directly to the institution receive fee, with the Commonwealth paying the balance on their behalf. Students who defer payment accept a loan from the Commonwealth which pays their liability for the semester to the institution, and they begin repaying these loans when their taxable income reaches a certain level. When students sign up for the options form, everything is fine if they can afford to pay up-front. But, if they choose to pay later, they are signing a weighted contract with a party that can change its conditions and does so at whim. Such a situation would not be tolerated in the private sector. It only government that allows such abuses to take place. However, students have no choice. They can either sign the form or they can forget about their education. I do not believe that I need to spell out to the House who benefits and who loses from such a situation. If you can afford to pay HECS up-front, it is all well and good. But students who cannot afford to pay sign a contract with a party that can increase repayments and can change conditions of the contract at any time. As HECS currently exists, it discriminates against the less well off and the underprivileged. Mr Bruce Scott-Particularly rural people.  member for Maranoa points out, which I why I imagine there is such a swathe of speakers from his party on this bill, and I am sure they will pick up that very important point. Once again we have an example of where Labor is penalising the poor and advancing the rich. They call us the party of toffs, but in every example that can be named in the last 13 years it has been the Labor Party taking their grassroots for granted, penalising the poor and advancing the rich. They claim the mantle of Chifley and Curtin, yet almost every time one can think of an opportunity they have had to help the poor they have kicked them in the teeth and they have helped the rich. That is why the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who comes from Bankstown, has beautiful mansions and lives the life of luxury, while the poor struggle on. The member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) may well laugh, but I imagine the electors from a discounted your electorateMr Sawford-You said it with a straight face. I can't believe you're saying it.  as I do, the electors from your electorate would be horrified, and most of them, as you well know, are about the Prime Minister's behaviour. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not want payment to digress from the bill",58
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Mr Nehl)Very wise.  NUS represent in this? Who are they lining is up with? Not with the coalition, which stands up for students. The coalition supposedly cannot stand students, but at almost every opportunity we have combined with the Democrats in the Senate to protect students from this voracious government. The NUS are not lining up with the coalition; they are lining up with the government, as they have done time and time again. Mr Sawford-Did you read the Sydney Morning Herald editorial?  al yet. They would do well to remember how HECS can deny certainty to students and graduates, a matter that seems to be given virtually no consideration when education funding policy is discussed. Under the current HECS arrangements students do not have any clear idea of how much extra will be going out of their pay packets once they have reached the threshold. Too many young people have learnt over recent years that a degree or other tertiary qualification is scarcely a ticket for a job. Yet at a time when budgeting is vital, when they are establishing careers, when they are getting married, saving for a deposit on a home or incurring a mortgage, the government can suddenly-and does-increase their repayments. HECS paying students and graduates are entitled to a greater degree of certainty. They should have a fair idea of what their HECS commitments will be and when they should commence. The retrospectivity I have highlighted in today's bill denies them any such right. The government must stop moving the goalposts. By putting forward amendments to parts 5 and 9 of this bill the coalition is not interfering with the basis of the government's proposed changes. Instead, we are introducing a degree of balance and fairness that presently is lacking in this legislation. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), predictably enough, has decried our proposals as being inane and has accused the coalition of vandalising budget measures. It is hard to see how the outcome of a budget, predicated on the dodgy figures that we have exposed over the last eight months, can be anything other than shaky. He has also condemned us for not consulting with the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, academics or students. These charges are easy to respond to. Unlike the government, the coalition has been listening to students. That is why we have already stated that our higher education policy will rule out undergraduate fees and promise greater financial autonomy for individual universities. Unlike members of the government, I have been listening. I have been travelling throughout Queensland from Cairns to Brisbane and meeting with young people, meeting with students. I imagine the member for Port Adelaide was rather jealous that he could not be with me because I met an enormous number of young people and students who gave me their very strong views on these matters, and we listened to them genuinely. In Bundaberg, Gladstone, Cairns, Townsville and Brisbane we listened to young people. It is probably not a bad idea if some of your people got out and started listening to young people too. I note in passing that the minister has announced that the government is going to conduct public rallies with young people to find out what they think. Mr Bruce Scott-After 13 years!  subsequent to our bus trip through the eastern states. I imagine he will get a very rude shock. Mr Sawford-Unlike you, we've been doing it for the last 15 years.  the last 15 years, and you are so confident about your position",62
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The member for Sturt will not let the member for Port Adelaide provoke him.  Speaker. He is not worth it. Students like the correspondent I quoted earlier are sick of being at the mercy of the chopping and changing of government policy. Academics and administrators, if they still retain their integrity and a commitment to the ideas that exemplified higher education in the days before John Dawkins, will recognise the justice of what the coalition is talking about. Yet again it is coalition members who are standing up for students and the battlers while Labor is establishing the elites and taking the student vote for granted. When students undertake studies they will be certain of what the HECS repayments will be under a coalition government. This government has constantly denied them this right and the coalition is seeking to restore it to them.",63
120,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I have much pleasure in rising to make a contribution to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995. It is interesting to note that from this side of the House we have had a long list of speakers contributing to this debate. Yet on the other side of the House there is little interest-one speaker following the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). Quite clearly, the Labor Party has very little interest in students' capacity to meet this higher education contribution tax-the graduate tax that this government wants to impose on hard-pressed students. I think we all recognise that improving our base of knowledge, our skills and our expertise is necessary if we are going to meet the needs of the 21 st century. A sophisticated education system is central to this task. It is our challenge to develop an education system that not only is innovative in a technological and industrial sense but also maximises the potential of our greatest resource of all-the people and, more particularly, in reference to this bill, the next generation of Australians. To accomplish this, we must encourage the entry of talented and dedicated people to the education system and we must maximise the contribution they make to national life. However, it is because the legislation before us today hampers that contribution by limiting access to education places as well as creating instability in the HECS arrangements that the coalition is opposed to many features of this bill. It is grossly unfair in its application and generates a level of uncertainty which cannot be tolerated. It is particularly and future students from rural and remote Australia who are already greatly disadvantaged in terms of their access to educational opportunities. One of the great impediments, apart from financial constraints, that those students face is the tyranny of distance that they confront in gaining access to further education. This bill represents the third time in the short life of the HECS system that significant alterations have been made to the higher education contribution scheme repayments schedule. These constant amendments and alterations create uncertainty for all Australians participating or wishing to participate in higher education. The decision about whether to enter a university or other institute of higher learning is not an easy one and involves a lot of consideration and planning. In deciding to undertake a course of study a student will often sacrifice immediate comforts and financial rewards in favour of the opportunity of a better and higher paid job in later life. Entering a university also involves planning for such things as accommodation and travel, and often the need to seek and undertake part-time work. But such forward planning is made extremely difficult by the Labor government, which refuses to guarantee stable and predictable HECS arrangements. No-one can be sure what Labor is going to do with higher education funding from one year to the next. One of the most disgraceful elements of this legislation is that it proposes to change the HECS structure midstream. In other words, it will apply to all those students who are in the middle of their study program. In other words, it is retrospective legislation. This is grossly unfair to those students who have organised their lives according to a different HECS arrangement. It is not only unfair to these students but also unfair to the many parents who are deeply involved in the planning of their children's education. This is why the coalition seeks to amend this section of the legislation to ensure that the new threshold levels apply only to students who will commence their studies in 1996. The coalition's position on this amendment is a unfair to present fair and proper one. Students in the middle of their courses have the right to certainty in their HECS repayment schedule and this government is failing to provide that. HECS is like a personal loan from the government, but Labor wants to change the repayment rate in the middle of the borrowing period. Imagine the outcry from society if banks wanted to force this legislation on first home buyers in this country. The same principle applies here. If banks were to attempt to try this sort of approach, they would not get away with it. Yet this is precisely what the Labor Party is proposing to do. If ever proof was needed of the government's lack of commitment to students in higher education, the attempt to impose these threshold changes retrospectively is it. As usual, the government has tried to shift the blame by claiming that extra higher education places will be jeopardised if the opposition blocks the retrospective parts of this bill. What humbug! What scaremongering! In reality, it is the government which has totally mismanaged the higher education system. It has proved that by slugging this increase on existing students so that it can afford to pay for extra tertiary places. The coalition will not respond to the government's attempt at blackmail. The Minister for Education in that lame duck Labor Party government in Queensland tried to scare the people of Queensland by saying that, if the coalition blocks this legislation, places at universities will be at risk. It is nothing more than blackmail and nothing more than blatant scaremongering, at a time when parents and students are trying to plan the future education needs and requirements of their children. For the coalition to respond to blackmail would be to abandon the students who have been so shabbily treated by this government. I am particularly concerned by Labor's proposed changes in the bill which will impact very heavily on students and families from rural and remote Australia. Many of these young people and their families are already burdened by unique financial and social pressures. Drought has seriously cut the incomes of thousands of rural families. For example, more than half the broadacre livestock enterprises in this country have had a negative income for the last three years. In my own electorate of Maranoa, many broadacre producers have recorded substantial negative incomes for the last four years. When their financial returns for the coming 12 months are recorded, the way the season looks, there will be another year of negative incomes. In addition to this, people in rural areas have average incomes which are significantly lower than the rest of the population. We have only to look at the 1991 census figures. They show that the median family income in my own electorate of Maranoa is about $26,450 per family. If you compare that with the median income of families in the seat of Brisbane, you will see that it has a median family income of $35,909. It illustrates my point that, based on official statistics from 1991, the parents of students from rural and remote areas of Australia, as a result of their backgrounds, have a lower median family income than the families of students from our capital cities. On the 1991 census figures, the median family income in the New South Wales seat of Gwydir, the seat of the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson)-just to assure the House that I am not just talking parochially about my own seat-is $25,782. The median family income in the electorate of Greenway, a safe Labor seat in western Sydney, however, is $40,365. I could provide example after example demonstrating that students from families of rural and remote Australia are disadvantaged not only because of the tyranny of distance but also because their families have a lower median income than those of people who live in our capital cities. Rural families will have even less money to live on and to keep their farms and businesses going if the government gets its way and increases the tax on those graduates who have been fortunate enough to get a decent job. This in tum will make it more difficult to pay for the education costs of the next generation. With declining incomes and increased taxes, farming families also have less opportunity to pay up-front fees for higher education and so escape these HECS increases. So families in rural Australia are doubly disadvantaged by this bill. The situation created by the legislation is typical of Labor's approach to education, and particularly to the education of rural and remote Australians. After 13 years the Labor Party has demonstrated that it has no commitment to providing a fair deal for rural students. In 1993, the year 12 retention rate for students in urban areas was 66 per cent, but for students who live in remote areas the figure was only 52 per cent. A similar story can be told with respect to higher education. In 1989, the number of students enrolled in higher education who came from urban based locations was 78 per cent of the total. This meant that rural and remote students filled only 22 per cent of the total of all higher education places. The Labor government made some noise about responding to these poor figures. In 1990 it launched its equity program called 'A fair chance for all: higher education that's within everyone's reach'. Remember that? I am sure the House well remembers it. The minister for education at the time, Mr Baldwin, promised, 'All Australians with the potential to succeed in higher education should have the opportunity to benefit from higher education qualifications.' With the release of this program, and in light of the minister's fine words, many parents in rural Australia believed that their children's educational prospects would be much rosier. But these hopes have been dashed. The overall participation rate of rural and remote students in higher education actually fell in the years following the report. Despite the government's commitment to providing equity in education, only 21 per cent of all higher education students in 1991 came from rural and remote Australia. Yet the total for the non-urban population of Australia was actually above 30 per cent. But the story is even worse for those students living in the really remote areas of this country. In the 1991 census the population of remote Australia was 12 per cent, but the percentage of remote students enrolled in higher education was only two per cent. A 1994 report from the Department of Employment, Education and Training revealed that this situation has not improved. It is important to note that the most common reasons given for this low participation rate are locational disadvantages and financial restrictions. In other words, it had nothing to do with the demand for these places and it had nothing to do with ability. But remember the minister's words: 'All Australians with the potential to succeed ... should have the opportunity to benefit from higher education ... ' Well, rural and remote students have done all they can. They have demonstrated that they have the potential to succeed in higher education, but this government has failed to give them the opportunity. What is more, it is unlikely that this opportunity will ever be provided by this government. While demand for tertiary places is at an all-time high, Commonwealth student assistance has been substantially reduced. Following the May budget this year, Austudy assistance is also set to decrease by $35 million over four years. This comes at a time when access to higher education is becoming increasingly difficult for lower income groups. In 1980, under a coalition government, 48 per cent of students from the least affluent sector of the population entered higher education. In 1989, under a Labor Party government that had been in office for six years, the percentage had fallen to 35 per cent. Students from rural areas are increasingly falling into this lower income group. The Labor government has paid insufficient attention to the falling participation rates of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. One need only look at Labor's farm assets test which now excludes-and this is a DPIE figure included in a Senate report last year-about 5,400 students from receiving Austudy support. That is a federal Department of Primary Industries and Energy figure, not my figure. This means there are 5,400 students prevented from receiving a tertiary education. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have only to look at the figures I quoted earlier-four years of negative farm incomes-w:hich means that many of those families are unable to provide financial assistance to these students to keep them in higher education. I can produce example after eJample in my electorate of students who have been pulled out of university places because their families could not afford to keep them there. They have lost the opportunity to gain that further education. No amount of bleating from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, the other day, when he tried to tip a bucket on some of the comments I have made publicly on this issue, will convince me that my comments are not accurate; they are. Even his own department shows that 5,400 students are being locked out of receiving Austudy assistance because of the farm assets test. The upshot of all this is that rural students are hamstrung by the restrictive and inequitable education policies of the Labor government. The bill before us today is only going to worsen that disability. Yet quality education is of vital economic and social importance to all Australians, including rural communities. We are all only too aware that many in our rural and remote regions are in a serious state of decline. Depriving the best and the brightest in these regions of adequate education is not the way to reverse this trend. Rural and remote Australia requires innovative ideas and increased opportunities to unlock its great potential. A highly educated and well trained rural population can contribute to this task. But this requires a commitment to providing access for rural and remote Australians to higher education places. Obviously, this government does not have that commitment. These changes to HECS will only represent another obstacle to students and families hoping to obtain a higher education. (Time expired)",64
121,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) and particularly to follow my colleague the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and to reinforce a number of issues that he has raised. I agree with him that one of the great losers in tertiary education has been the students of rural and regional Queensland. This bill is important for two reasons: firstly, it contains a number of measures that will impact significantly on both current tertiary students and recent graduates and, secondly, it dispels once and for all the great myth that only the Labor Party can look after the interests of students. Labor politicians and their student union lackeys on campuses throughout Australia continue to peddle the myth that only the ALP can look after the interests of students. However, if you take a quick look back over the last 12 years of federal Labor government, you begin to wonder what students have to be thankful for. Let us examine some of these myths. The first myth I wish to dispel is in regard to university fees. When Labor first came to office in 1983, it promoted itself as being the no fees party, and I stress that point. We were told that free tertiary education was part of the Labor manifesto. In 1988 the Labor Party introduced HECS, and it was forced to remodel itself, to reinvent itself, as the no upfront fees party. So it moved from the no fees party to the no up-front fees party. We were told that no up-front fees were part of the Labor manifesto. Then the Keating government removed restrictions on universities charging fees for postgraduate courses-much to the anger of students right across Australia because they could see what was coming later. Suddenly, the Labor Party became the no up-front fees for undergraduates party. So it moved from a no fees party to a no up-front fees party to a no up-front fees for undergraduates party. We were told that no up-front fees for undergraduates were part of the Labor manifesto. In 1995, as contained in the bill before us today, the Labor Party wants to introduce up-front fees for at least one category of undergraduate students: those permanent residents who are not Australian citizens. So the ALP manifesto is now no up-front fees for Australian undergraduates. With this trail of broken promises on the fee paying structure issue, how would any students trust this government again? What will be the little variation in the next budget or the budget after that, should the Labor Party be fortunate enough to be re-elected? Having singled out one category of undergraduate students to pay up-front fees, how long will it be before this Labor government finds another group of undergraduates who should be paying up-front fees for their tertiary education? That is the very point I made when universities were allowed to charge for postgraduate courses. Let us look at the second myth. Labor's fee paying hypocrisy is not just limited to upfront fees. If we look in detail at the Labor record on HECS, we find that the government has moved to gain more and more revenue from students. Since the 1993 election, Labor has either introduced or attempted to introduce double HECS for undergraduate degrees; 1Y2 times HECS for those taking longer than the minimum time to complete their degree; a pro rata repayment, a method of substantially lowering the repayment threshold; a lower repayment threshold; a raised rate of repayment across the board; and a changed method of repayment. The coalition has been successful in blocking a number of these proposals, including the doubling of HECS, the 1Y2 times HECS and the pro rata payments. Before us today in the context of this bill, the government is seeking to introduce some further revenue grabbing measures that students need to be aware of. In particular, I refer to part 4 of the bill, which makes provision for a discount to be offered to persons who voluntarily commence to repay their HECS debt when on an income of $20,000. Of course, the current threshold at which HECS must be paid is $26,853. Not surprisingly, the National Union of Students has expressed fears that this could be the first step towards the government lowering the compulsory repayment threshold. What a tragedy that would be under a Labor government which is supposed to be looking after their interests. Part 5 of the bill provides for three new repayment thresholds for HECS. These new threshold levels, at 3.5 per cent, 4.5 per cent, 5.5 per cent and six per cent, will be inserted within the existing levels of three per cent, four per cent and five per cent, effectively accelerating the rate of repayment. Students around Australia should note that it was a Labor government that introduced this measure to increase HECS revenue by stealth. Once again, it is a Labor government that is changing the rules on students and on recent graduates by now asking them to pay back more of their debt at a faster rate. In fact, this is the second time in three years that Labor has sought to accelerate the rate of repayment of HECS. This altering of the rules is of great concern. A graduate battling to buy a house, to marry or to establish a career can suddenly find that his or her HECS debt repayments are suddenly increased, causing financial hardship and stress. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) is in the House. I know that, from my own children and many friends' children, by the time students get to the end of their undergraduate courses they are very much strapped for cash. They are seeking to pay off a car or, as I have said before, they may be trying to buy a house or a unit, to marry or to establish a career. The coalition will move an amendment to part 5 of the bill to ensure that the new student threshold levels will apply to only those students who commence their studies from 1996 onwards. What we are about is creating certainty for students-not changing the rules here and there to suit the government's budget shortfalls. Part 9 of the bill requires permanent residents, including New Zealand citizens, who have met the residency requirements of citizenship one year or more before enrolment to pay up-front fees-in other words, to prevent persons from overseas undertaking education in Australia and then leaving without ever paying their HECS debt. This seems to be fair and logical, but that is hardly the way the government has gone about achieving that aim. Like for part 5 of the bill, we will move an amendment to this measure to ensure it does not affect students already enrolled but so that future students-that is, from 1996 onwards-are aware of the new rules, are aware of what they will be paying. The HECS hoax is something I would also like to talk about. Interestingly, these two minor coalition amendments to parts 5 and 9 of the HECS bill, designed to give students greater certainty, is the source of angst, which has been generated by an extraordinary reaction by Labor politicians, both state and federal, to the coalition's measures. The coalition has been accused of politicking and threatening Queensland's hard won university places. I might depart from my notes for a minute to read a lemming-like letter from my state colleague Mr Campbell, the Labor member for Bundaberg, who says in heightening this scare campaign: Hundreds of teenagers' hopes and aspirations will be dashed in the Bundaberg region unless the Opposition relent and allow Mr Crean's changes to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS). But Member for Hinkler Paul Neville has denied the claimas indeed I do here. Joining the lemmings going over the cliff is the state minister, Mr Hamill, who said in support of the minister: The changes were part of a higher education package to raise an extra $20 million to defray the costs of the 12,000 extra tertiary places for Queensland, the total number of places phased in over a number of years. Mr Hamill made his comments after talks in Canberra with his federal counterpart, Simon Crean. He went on to say: Thousands of final year students throughout Queensland are this week writing their applications for positions at our universities in 1996. This is recent stuff. That is terrible intimidation, terrible stuff, Minister. I am surprised that your colleagues would fall for such a thing. We have been accused of politicking and threatening hard won university places, but I think you would agree with me that we are talking about $20 million at the end of the scale. That's funny: it has been claimed that the coalition, rather than the federal minister, is taking away these extra places. You have been going around the country and you have been quoted in Adelaide, Melbourne and Brisbane as threatening to cut university places because you cannot have your way on these minor amendments. DEET estimates that the coalition's amendments could cost the government about $20 million over three years in forgone revenue. That is $20 million less the government would be able to rake in from students' pockets if the bill remained unchanged. On the face of it, $20 million sounds a lot of money. But, when you talk about $20 million in the totality of the higher education budget of $4.4 billion, you are talking about roughly less than half of one per cent. In case the minister or his Labor colleagues have not heard, most Queensland universities, especially regional institutions such as Central Queensland University, are still not happy with the original allocation because they have simply not received enough places. This brings me to the third Labor myth which I seek to dispel, and that is in relation to university places. The student to population ratio in my Central Queensland electorate was, until recently, less than half the national average. With the minister's new allocationif indeed it takes place, if this threat is not invoked-it will be about 60 per cent of the national average; yet my region continues to be grossly under-funded in terms of university places. Even with the government's much heralded budget allocation of 4,200 extra university places over three years, the Central Queensland University appears to me not to be getting its fair share of the funding cake. Our allocations for 1996 and 1997 were 420 extra places; but 100 of these were announced previously by the minister's predecessor, Kim Beazley. So, out of the recent budget, CQU got 320 places over two years to be distributed between five campuses. Think about that, Minister: two years, five campuses-IO units, if you like-into 320 places. It is not big. It becomes even more frightening when you look at today's unemployment figures from the ABS. In the Central Queensland area and, in particular, in the Wide Bay-Burnett region, which is in the southern part of my electorate and which has one of the campuses of CQU, we find that the youth unemployment figure for 15to 19-year-olds is 41.1 per cent, which is the worse in Queensland. For 20to 24year-olds it is 23.4 per cent, which is the worse in Queensland. Total unemployment spread over all the state and all age groups is at 15.9 per cent, up from 14.3 per cent. While I acknowledge that an increase in university places would have only a minor effect on this, and while I appreciate that the minister has said he will cooperate with me on unemployment and workplace measures to alleviate this problem, nevertheless we could do with more university places. There is an interesting quote from Professor Geoff Wilson, who wrote to me recently. He said: A considerable proportion of these students could be expected to enrol at a campus within the region if the option was made available to them through the allocation of additional funded places at Central Queensland University. As I said, 320 places over five campuses over two years is not a big deal. Indeed we are grateful for them, but I think we can do more. How, on such a paltry number and with Queensland still so far behind the other states, could you threaten to withdraw them if you do not get your way on those two minor amendments? I find that very hard to understand. I quote again from a recent letter to me from the Vice-Chancellor of Central Queensland University, Professor Wilson: . . . Central Queensland University would need a doubling of its 1995 allocation of funded student load in order to provide the population of the Central Queensland region with same availability of higher education places on a per capita basis within the region, at the current Australian In this regard, whilst the Ministers recent announcement of additional funded places being allocated to Central Queensland University over the coming triennium has been most welcome, this still goes only a small way toward overcoming the shortfall in the region-base provision which I have highlighted above. I do not think Professor Wilson could have said it much more clearly than that. Many Queensland institutions are still grossly underfunded, and now the government wants to play games over the future of other university places. As I said before, Minister: how could you threaten, over these two amendments, this package in Queensland? I know you have threatened in Brisbane, in Melbourne and in Adelaide as well. Nevertheless, it came home very potently to the people of my region who felt that it was a form of intimidation. Just by way of comparison, we are talking about $20 million, after having been told over recent years how tough the budget was, and all these sorts of things. While I do not for a minute deny the right of the arts community to funding, out of the blue you recently plucked $250 million-just like that: superhighway and arts, $250 million! Yet, if you do not get your way on these amendments, you are threatening to cut university places in Queensland and presumably in the other places where you have issued the threat. In conclusion, the bill before us today and the measures it contains will send a clear message to tertiary students right around Australia. That message is that Labor is more interested in finding new and more devious ways to get students to pay for their education, rather than listening to the real problems and needs of our tertiary sector. This bill should dispel once and for all the great myth that only Labor will look after the interests of students. Students need only examine the coalition's actions in regard to the bill to understand that there is a choice other than Labor .",67
122,Mr CREAN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Let me start by reminding the House that this government has done more for higher average. education in this country than any other government. I quote Professor Alan Gilbert, who is currently Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania but soon to take up the position as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne. In a speech he made when joining me in opening the Burnie campus in Tasmania on 15 September, he said: I am sure that when the history is written accurately one of the main things said about the government that has been in power since 1983 is that it has done more for education and for higher education I think than any government in Australia's history. I noted the disbelief of the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) when I quoted this on a previous occasion. But the opposition should recognise that even the critics of government policy are able to recognise what this government has done for higher education in this country. Just to summarise it: we have been in power since 1983 and we have seen the total number of students in higher education increase by 68 per cent-from 350,000 places to almost 600,000 places. That was the position before the last budget. In the last budget, we have demonstrated that we are not prepared just to rest on our laurels, as impressi ve as they are. We have gone even further with the last budget. We have committed $16'h billion to higher education over the next three and a half years; we have increased the number of places by 5,850 which, when you take the pipeline effect, means 11,000 more places over the course of the next 3Yz years; in addition, we have provided $109 million on top of the existing $191 million for research infrastructure-an increase of 57 per cent; and we have provided an additional $40 million for research programs, on top of the $350 million already committed for the triennium. We did all of this against the background of a tight fiscal set of circumstances. We did not cut funding to higher education. We did not introduce up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students. We did not reallocate existing places from one state to another. We honoured our commitments in relation to HECS so far as Australian students are concerned. We did not increase the size of the HECS burden-the debt. We did not lower the first compulsory repayment threshold below average weekly earnings, and we did not introduce a differential HECS. It was another confirmation of our huge commitment to this sector. This was a package that was funded by two basic approaches. First, there was a reallocation of existing funds available to higher education through the National Priority (Reserve) Fund. Second, there were some savings measures introduced, two of which are under attack today by the opposition. The resultant package reflected what became known as a cocktail approach to funding the higher education sector, and it was developed in full consultation with the higher education sector last year and this year. It was embraced by them as the sensible way forward. Again I remind the House: it was Labor that undertook the consultation. Despite what the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) said about listening to the higher education sector, the opposition consulted no-one when they took this stance of opposing the amendments. They did not consult the AVCC, which has welcomed the package and which has since attacked the opposition for the very things that they are opposing. They did not consult the academic bodies, which again welcomed the package. Even the students, while opposing the citizenship measure, recognised the strength of the package before the House. The opposition claim the right to represent the sector, but they will not even talk to it. As a consequence, this package is now in danger of being unravelled by the Liberal Party. It is opportunism at its best; it is policy at its very worse. The opposition is seeking to undermine two important funding areas. Its proposals are a direct attack on the places which have been secured for those Australians who have not had the opportunity to go to university. Again, I will correct the member for Hinkler. The savings measures risks involve up to $20 million per year-not over three years. It is $50 million over three years. I do not know who has been feeding him the information on his side of the House, but $50 million is not an insignificant amount. It will see 2,000 places in jeopardy.The new places in Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania will have to be reduced and places reallocated from Victoria and South Australia. So to the member for Hinkler I say: do not come in here crying crocodile tears about needing to get extra places in your own area, which has been a beneficiary of the new places we have offered. Do not come in crying crocodile tears and supporting this nonsense on your side of the House. Mr Gibson-We'll let his constituents know.",70
123,Mr CREAN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"We will let his constituents know, and we will let the university know. We will let them know who is putting those places at jeopardy. I had the opportunity to visit the member for Hinkler's electorate over the last couple of months and to visit that university. These new places will enable students to complete the full three years of a degree in Bundaberg for the first time. They were not able to do it before. These are the places you are now putting at risk. I do not think you understand the consequences of what you and those on your side of the House are really supporting. The opposition can talk intimidation all they like, but I am not playing politics in this regard. If the money is not there, how do we fund the additional places? I had to put this package together on the basis of reallocating within my portfolio. I had to do it on the basis of finding savings that came back to my portfolio, and I did what the sector did not believe could be achieved. Now you want to come in on the back of it and unravel it. The cocktail approach developed in the resource allocation consultations last year also proposed the reallocation of places from those states with higher levels of participation. They could not see that we could actually get the extra money to give Queensland its places without taking those places off South Australia and Victoria. That set of proposals in the cocktail mix did raise considerable concern from those two latter states. The Victorian education minister made strong representations to me, arguing against the possibility of reallocating up to 10,000 places from Victoria. The South Australian minister wrote to me, similarly concerned that they would lose 3,000 places. But they lost none under our package. We did not reallocate one existing place. I note that the other day the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) was also in the Housepart of the bleeding heart brigade, like the member for Hinkler-crying crocodile tears about concern in her state. She quoted in relation to the resource allocation discussion and referred to it in her speech. She called for greater allocation and flexibility of resources between institutions. Yet, do you know what the member for Adelaide did, when it came to really considering these issues? She made a very explicit call for places not to be removed from her state. In other words, she was saying, 'We understand that if we take this step there will be a loss of places, but don't take them from Adelaide.' How can she pretend to represent the interests of students in her seat and in her state and yet agree with an opposition stance on this bill that will see places cut? It is absolute hypocrisy. Look at the opposition speakers in this debate-representatives of Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia-all of them telling me before the last budget, 'Find us a means to get the extra places but don't take them off Victoria and South Australia.' When I actually produced the result, not only did I not get congratulations, but you also followed the lunacy of the man sitting on the opposite side of the table, the member for Goldstein, by proposing the amendments that are before the House that oppose what we have tried to introduce. But you do not tell us how you would fund the places if you were to get into office. The member for Goldstein claimed that there are tens of thousands of qualified students clamouring to enter our universities, yet he will not allow us to fund the places that we have delivered. What cant! What hypocrisy! I saw a newspaper report, in the Tablelands Advertiser of all places, that the shadow spokesman for education, Senator Hill, had said: The federal coalition has committed itself to providing extra tertiary education places to Queensland ... the coalition's higher education policy would include a specific commitment to fund the extra places. But they will not tell us how. They will not tell us where they would get the money. Mr Gibson-Full fees.",71
124,Mr CREAN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Exactly! All we have to do is remind the students-the same group that you say you express support for-of the policy of the opposition when it was trying to win office at the last election. It was a policy that proposed vouchers and fees. Not only was it rejected by the Australian electorate but its author, the member for Goldstein, was dumped as opposition spokesman for education. That was your policy then and, quite frankly, I believe it is still your policy today. The tragedy of this debate is that the opposition pretends to have the interests of students at heart. But, through its spoiling tactics and its political grandstanding, they disadvantage Australian students. On the question of this citizenship issue, let me just state the record to the House. Migrants to this country have immediate access to the higher education system. Under the proposed legislation they have three years in which to take out citizenship. That is three years-I remind the House that it is possible to complete a degree in three years-for which they can defer HECS. And on top of that they can also be eligible for Austudy. No other country in the world is as generous as we are in relation to non-citizens. We are miles in front. I also remind the House that no Australian citizen could go to any other country in the world and enter universities under the same conditions as we allow people to enter them here. Indeed, British, US and New Zealand citizens, who will be the major focus of this measure, cannot even get back into their own countries' universities under the same conditions. It is nonsense to imply that you are really protecting something that is not already generous. I do not think that you understand the full implications of what you are going into bat for on this issue. You are proposing to further protect an already generous proposition-a world leading proposition-but, by doing it, you will be denying Australian citizens. I cannot understand the logic of a party that will support measures that benefit people who do not even vote in this country. You would do it at the expense of people who vote here, who have been born here and who want to grow up and live in this country. It is also nonsense to imply that the measure itself is the beginning of up-front fees Australian higher education. Our proposal does not require non-citizens to pay full fees for their university education. They will only pay up-front HECS. As we all know, HECS is equivalent to only one-fifth of average course costs. The Australian taxpayer pays the other four-fifths for these people who are noncitizens and, through HECS, funds are returned to the higher education system for the provision of additional places-places for Australian students. So why should we not make non-citizens do the same? Clearly, a person who has come over here, studied for three years and got a degree can avoid payment of anything back into the system if they leave before earning any income. Don't you understand that that is the consequence of what we are doing now? Having got all the benefits out of the system, they can get out of the country without paying anything, having no obligation back to this country and to the higher education system. Australian students cannot do that. This is a case of double standards on your part. On the one hand, the member for Goldstein says permanent residents who are not Australian citizens should not have to pay their HECS up front, yet he then complains that overseas students are taking places from Australian students. He is on the record as saying that 40,000 overseas students are taking up places in our Australian universities while the Australian students find the doors barred against them. That is absolute nonsense because he knows that the overseas students pay full fees, 100 per cent fees, to enter our universities. They do not do it at the expense of our students because universities require them to pay the full cost of the degree, including the capital costs. The students who pay to come to this country from overseas to study are not subsidised by public funds in any way. But it does raise the interesting question of what we should read into the member for Goldstein's statement in this regard. Is he really saying that Australian students should be allowed to pay fees as do overseas students? I think he is, because he believes that. That is why he was dumped as the shadow for spokesman for education after the last election. In a radio interview in March this year, Senator Hill indicated that the coalition had changed its policy away from fees because unmet demand had dropped. I asked at the time if this meant that if unmet demand should rise again the opposition would introduce fees. We still have not had a reply. That was in March. But we know it would, because it believes it. It wants to charge students to go to university. It does not believe in a fully publicly funded university approach in this country, which we do. Is the opposition really saying through this set of measures that it has the students' interests at heart? It is obfuscating. It is misleading them and it will never support them. History shows that it has not done so. I believe it owes the students an explanation. It claims that Australian students are paying fees for undergraduate education. I issue the same invitation to the opposition as I have to the students who have made this allegation: provide me with the information on courses for which undergraduate fees are being charged. They still have not provided any evidence of their assertions. In a speech I made to the Victorian Young Labor conference earlier this year, I indicated that I would ask my department to raise any questionable activities with relevant universities and I have indicated a preparedness to take action in relation to any information coming forward. Does the opposition have examples to back up its assertion or is it simply more rhetoric-no substance, no backup? We are used to that. In a radio interview I referred to earlier that involved Senator Hill-it is the only public statement he has made in two years on higher education-he in fact said that he had some sympathy with universities charging fees by the back door. I will conclude on this point. The Sydney Morning Herald editorial on 28 December comments on the opposition's proposals on this legislation as 'an attack on the responsible use of taxpayers funds'. That same editorial went on to say: The federal opposition is (cynically) wooing the student unions with its stance on this matter. This opportunism means that it dismisses the real issue-which is the equitable and responsible distribution of funds for tertiary education. That is not coming from our side and it is not coming from a newspaper that is known to be terribly supportive of what we do. That comes from an editorial of the Sydney Morning Herald in relation to the position the opposition is adopting on this matter. In a policy vacuum, the opposition's proposals are nothing more than a cheap, opportunistic stunt. The opposition's proposed amendments should be seen for what they are: a spoiling tactic which will work to the disadvantage of Australian students in circumstances in which we have honoured our commitment not to increase the HECS burden. The opposition, quite frankly, simply cannot be believed in relation to their policies on higher education. They will not divulge them because they are anti-student. They have done nothing to dispel their previous policy prescriptions. They think they can get away by remaining silent, and now they want to jeopardise student places on top of dismantling of student unions and the services they offer in conservative states. We reject their approach and I urge the House to vote accordingly. (Time expired) Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",72
125,Mr CREAN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"-by leave-I move government amendments Nos 1 and 2: (1) Schedule, page 18, item 33, omit proposed paragraph 41(3)(c), substitute the following: ""(c) a student (other than a New Zealand citizen) who; (i) is a pennanent resident; and (ii) will be resident outside Australia for the duration of a course in that semester for a reason other than a requirement of the course; but does not include a student who has been granted a certificate of Australian citizenship under section 13 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 and who has yet to make the pledge referred to in section 15 of that Act. ... (2) Schedule, page 19, item 36, after proposed subparagraph 101 (d)(i), insert the following subparagraph: ""(is) a person who has been granted a certificate of Australian citizenship under section 13 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 and who has yet to make the pledge referred to in section 15 of that Act; or"". Items 33 and 36 of the schedule to the bill give effect to the decision requiring New Zealand citizens other than those who are also Australian citizens or who hold a permanent visa, and Australian permanent residents who have met the residency requirements for Australian citizenship more than one year before enrolment, to pay their HECS contribution up-front rather than be able to defer the contribution. These people are also precluded from access to the open learning deferred payments scheme. The consequence of this would be to prevent a person whose application for citizenship has been accepted by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs but who is yet to attend a citizenship ceremony from deferring the HECS contribution or being able to use it. The person must attend a citizenship ceremony to pledge commitment to Australia before becoming a citizen. The amendments to the bill circulated by the government alter part 9 of the bill to allow students who have had a citizenship application approved by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs but who may have to wait some months to attend a citizenship ceremony to defer the HECS contribution or use the open learning deferred payments scheme. I commend the amendments to the House and present the supplementary explanatory memorandum.",74

127,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was going to ask my question to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. He does not get a lot of questions. He only has to come twice a week but, in the absence of the minister, I will have no choice but to address the question to the Deputy Prime Minister. I would ask you, Mr Speaker, to raise this matter of the absence of a minister who is actually on the roster with the minister concerned. It is quite clear that the minister is on the roster.",75
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think you have already done so by bringing it to the attention of the House. I am sure the Leader of the House has taken note.,75
129,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Deputy Prime Minister. Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that the Australian ambassador to the United States, Dr Don Russell, has today added to his extraordinarily improper statements by attacking the Clinton administration for having no concern for the underclass in the United States? Is it indeed the government's policy to attack the Clinton administration in this way? If not, will the minister ensure that the ambassador is reprimanded, yet again, by the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade? When is the government going to act on these reprimands and withdraw him immediately?",75
130,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition is getting a bit inconsistent on this. We had the opposition spokesman on trade, the Leader of the National Party, saying it was a terrible thing that Don Russell was coming home, because he had done such a fine job, such an excellent job, as the ambassador to the United Statesa position which we thoroughly endorse. We would agree with that. Then we have various other spokespersons for the opposition, including the gentleman who asked me the question, saying he ought to be recalled immediately. For two years we sustained, as ambassador to the United States, a person who had been a Liberal Party minister, and our treatment of Liberal Party appointees was very generous indeed and decent. Mr Downer-What has this got to do with it?",75
131,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am just setting the scene. As far as the Clinton administration's position on the poor in the United States is concerned, the whole position in the United States was put most effectively by the US Labor secretary in recent times. Whilst there had been a slightly better employment performance in the United States than in Europe at that gathering at the OECD where he held these discussions, when you looked at the situation of wages in the United States you had to say there was an extraordinarily large number of working poor and that poverty was a very substantial problem in that nation. As a simple point of analysis, if you compare the performance in Australia over the last decade in terms of distribution of income with the situation in the United States-and both of us have been through a similar deregulatory program, similar deregulatory policiesin Australia we have nevertheless sustained the position of those in society most likely to be affected by it and there has been no increase in that gap between the rich and the poor. In the United States that is not the case. The rich have got a great deal richer and the poor a deal poorer over that period of time. I think you would find the Clinton administration deeply concerned about poverty in the underclass in the United States-deeply concerned. Its concerns in that regard are deepening as a result of the policies being pursued by your ideological soul mates in the Congress. As far as Don Russell is concerned, we are absolutely delighted that he is coming on board. He was a very good adviser when he was here, he has been a very good ambassador to the United States, and we expect that form to continue. Western Australia: Blockade",75
132,Mr SNOW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Can he advise the House of any national implications flowing from the Western Australian government's second wave of industrial relations reforms? Is there any likelihood that the reforms will be enacted nationally?,76
133,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well might the honourable member ask that question. I tell you this: they certainly will not be implemented by any Labor government. No Labor federal government will ever implement such an approach. What is worrying is that, having wreaked havoc on Western Australia's industrial stability and on working conditions there, the Western Australian government's reforms, both the first and the second wave, are being held up as a model for the federal coalition government. There it is in this newspaper article. Mr Reith-That is what you had yesterday.",76
134,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Too right. And I will have it every day until the election. We need only to look at the comments of the Leader of the Opposition when he spoke to the Western Australian Liberal Party in August to be sure of that. It is there in black and white in the West Australian for all to see. If we need any further confirmation, just look at what Graham Kierath-the architect of the Western Australian model-had to say. In the West Australian of 17 August, he claimed that Mr Howard supported the second wave and supported it wholeheartedly. Later, in the Perth Sunday Times, he was even more forthright. He said: I've had no warnings at all. This is Graham Kierath on the second wave. It is a great quote. He went on: The only discussions I've had is with John Howard ... and he seemed very supportive of the principles. Thank you, Graham Kierath-the architect of the second wave-on John Howard. It is not terribly surprising that today's Australian reports another interview with Mr Kierath in which his frustrations with the Leader of the Opposition's sneaky backtracking appear to have boiled over. Before he jumped on that international charter flight up to Jakarta, fleeing the blockade yesterday, Mr Kierath decided to set the record straight. In the report, he insists that nothing has changed about his industrial relations proposals since he developed them four full long years ago. He said that nothing has changed. That is well before newspaper headlines on John Howard referred to Western Australia being his very model, his very template.",76
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will not wave that around.,76
136,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, on the topic of John Howard, Mr Kierath went on-wait for this; it is a terrific line-to say: When he was shadow spokesman for industrial relations, John Howard's policy was more right wing than ours was. I was considered soft and left wing by those advocating more radical change. Just imagine that-Graham Kierath considered to be soft and left wing by those advocating more radical change. You know who that is that is John Howard. It might be hard to view Mr Kierath as soft and left wing, but it certainly is not hard to believe that John Howard endorsed the second wave or that he is advocating more radical change yet. He effectively endorsed every part of the second wave on that radio program yesterday morning where he ended up knocking himself out. We all saw it on Channel 9 last night. Worse still, he told another deliberate untruth when he said",76
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will withdraw that.,77
138,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw that. It was deliberately untruthful to assert: · . . the two things the unions objected to most, have been taken outincluding· . . things relating to what happened if a union went into the Federal jurisdiction ... This was John Howard on national radio assuring listeners that the second wave was not as bad as it was first put up to be because the most obnoxious elements had been taken away. He said that this had all been fixed up. He said: · . . the two things the unions objected to most, have been taken outincluding· . . things relating to what happened if a union went into the Federal jurisdiction ... The truth is that the provisions cancelling the registration of state unions seeking federal coverage have not been removed-they are still in the legislation-nor has the provision giving Mr Kierath power to award coverage to whoever he chooses",77

142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor! Put a sock in it.,77
143,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is not the only occasion that the Leader of the Opposition federally has been caught out in respect of the second wave. Yesterday the opposition was outraged by a one-day blockade of Western Australia, caused by the second wave. The opposition was outraged to. the point where the Leader of the Opposition said workers should be sued. Yet the Leader of the Opposition seems to think that there is some sort of communications blockade with Western Australia every day of the week. How else can it be that he thinks he can say something in Perth, Western Australia-that the Western Australian model is his model-and then come into the parliament and say he denies it, and expect anyone to believe him? The truth is that he is aiming to achieve the third of the great IR lies. The first one was Jeff Kennett on the eve of his election saying, 'Your awards are safe. No worker will be worse off, believe me.' We all remember it. The second of the great lies was Richard Court's lie when he said, 'I'm no Jeff Kennett' - remember that one, on the eve of his election?-'You'll be right with me.' The third lie was John Howard saying, 'I didn't say Western Australia was our model.' Of course it is his model. It is his model of industrial conflict and of slashing conditions. The only difference is that under John Howard it would be a nationwide model. For the final word on that, let me point out what Chris RichardsonMr MCGauran-You're just going on and on.",77
144,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Chris Richardson is a very interesting fell a, that's why. He is a director of Access Economics. That is virtually a Liberal Party think-tank. You have been quoting Access Economics in this parliament for years. Mr Richardson said to Australian business today: There's no denying that for the first 12 to 18 months of a coalition government you might have to plan on more industrial tension than you've had for quite some time. What he is saying is that Western Australia is just a skirmish. If John Howard gets his way, you ain't seen nothing yet. NA",77
145,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! Before I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon three Victoria Cross winners: Sir Roden Cutler, Mr Ted Kenna and Mr Keith Payne. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Whereupon honourable members rose in their places and applaudedNA Governor General's Office",77
146,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Minister, do you consider expenditure by the Governor General to be excessive and, if so, why didn't you take steps to alter the guidelines and rein it in? If not, why are your cabinet colleagues engaging in unsourced and cowardly attacks on the Governor General over the issue?",78
147,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a product of some banter, is it? The honourable member is an expert in banter. I have already answered this question once publicly today, which is fair enough. I will go through it again here, which is fair enough too. The position with the Governor General's finances is that the office is responsible, like any other government department or agency, for its own administration within the framework of guidelines by the Department of Finance. As far as we are concerned, there are no problems with the administration within the framework of the guidelines that are laid down by them. The finance department does not administer the departments of the Commonwealth. It is obviously ridiculous to assume that it does. All the restrictions that apply via those guidelines apply to the Governor General' s Office. For example, they are subject to the efficiency dividend in their running costs, as are the other departments which are responsible in observing Department of Finance guidelines. I have had a chance to look at the article in the newspapers today. The answers to the story go reasonably as follows: firstly, there was obviously no account taken by the journalist concerned of the ordinary increases in expenditure that flow from wage increases and general increases in the cost of living. They have the same deflator that applies to most of the other departments. A substantial amount of the additional expenditure can be explained by that process. Secondly, a substantial proportion of the differences between the period of time that Mr Hayden has been in office and that of his predecessors goes to renovations of Government House. Those renovations are determined from time to time as required by an Official Establishments Trust which works out how to keep our old public buildings in decent operation. They are not a benefit to the Governor General. They are not renovations of his private property; they are renovations of the property of the Australian people. Obviously, those renovations of old places like the Governor General's residence and establishment are from time to time likely to be substantial and do explain most of the expenditure additional to that. There are one or two other items. I am advised that the Governor General no longer utilises as personal aides members of the defence forces, so a slight increase in the civilian establishment has been associated with that. Other expenditures that were drawn to our attention by the article go to the utilisation of a 707 for a recent trip to the 80th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings. That was an entirely appropriate occasion for the Governor General to attend. That trip was accompanied by a swing through Indo-China, where he was, of course, representing Australian interests and concerns. Clearly, it was convenient for him, in those circumstances where it is difficult to travel in that region, to operate with an Australian government jet. The notion that he is, in some way or another, personally advantaged by taking a 707 as opposed to sitting in the front of a Qantas jet again draws a long bow. All of us here have been in the government 707s from time to time. Opposition members-No!",78
148,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, you have. I remember flying the whole darned lot of you out during the air disputes a couple of years ago, so don't go around the place pretending that you haven't flown in them before. I am a personal witness to your trooping aboard the 707s. You can't escape that. I will swear on a stack of Bibles that I saw you all. The fact is that nobody could conceivably say that the front end of a Qantas jet is not better than travelling in the 707s. I only make the point in passing. It was an appropriate use of that aircraft by the Governor General. When you take all those factors into consideration, the additional costs being experienced by Government House are pretty well explicable. Youth Unemployment",78
149,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Ed-cation and Training. Yesterday, an organisatIon representing young Australians outlined to the minister a number of proposals and issues regarding youth unemployment. Can the minister indicate to the House whether it is the intention of the government to take into account their views and those of others in the community in developing further responses to that significant problem? Also, did the youth forum raise any concerns regarding alternative strategies for addressing youth unemployment?",79
150,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, I did meet yesterday with the group that came from his electorate. It is the third time that I have with them, because I have visited his electorate to meet with them on two previous occasions. Yesterday's meeting was a very conPeople structi ve one. I must say that I am impressed by the quality of the contribution that is are coming forward from the young people in this dressed. country. We have already announced some important changes that will benefit youth, particular the school to job guarantee pathway which was announced in the electorate of Bonython some weeks ago. Tomorrow I will straight, be announcing changes to the Working Nation program, which will also see further benefits to young people. Following the extensive consultations of which this was part, we be announcing further initiatives later in year. In the discussions that I had with the youth last year: group, a number of issues came up. Of major Like concern to the group that visited yesterday was the question of what would happen to 1993 youth wages. Under us, they do not have a change. problem because we are committed to no cuts thing, to youth wages. We do have a training but it is award and competency based and must lead to an accredited outcome. If traincoalition ing is not undertaken, then the appropriate award needs to apply, and this government well known for its support of wage increases. Their concern, however, is with what they think the coalition stands for. Yesterday made the following demand of the coalition: We demand that the Opposition immediately release its plans and policies for Youth Employment, Industrial Relations, Education and Youth Wages.",79
151,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Did you write it for them?,79
152,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I did not write it, and that is an insult to them. I will make sure that the member for O'Connor is known as suggesting that they are not being genuine, and there would be others on the other side of the House who would probably share his views. But it was not only the youth I spoke to yesterday that have echoed this concern. Father David Cappo from the Australian CatholicMr Bruce Scott-Ah!",79
153,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They do not like this. These are people who have to observe the problem met and speak the truth, but they do not like it when it is directed against them. He said on 12 October: are very concerned that. . . that through the coalition's industrial relations program, that wages going to be cut. Now, that ... that is a concern out there in the community, it's got to be adin This was issued the day before the Leader of the Opposition attended the ACOSS conference. He had the opportunity to set the record but he did not. He squibbed it. It is true that what he did was to rule out a $3 per hour minimum rate, which was such a disastrous policy for you at the last election. But will what we do know is that the Leader of the the Opposition and his shadow spokesman are committed to reintroducing Iobsback. The Leader of the Opposition said in November all policies, the lobsback! industrial relations document is being reviewed in the wake of the election defeat. Its essential thrust will not Its main principles are timeless. If anythey are even more relevant to contemporary wage, economic challenges. it So the substance of Iobsback is still the policy. Let me just remind the House of what the substance of Iobsback is means for wages. They are committed to reintroducing Austrain. Austrain is something the shadow spokesman has spoken with praise they about. But what does Austrain involve? If people have been out of work for six months, their wages will be cut by 10 per cent. If they have been out of work for 12 months, they will be cut by 20 per cent. If they have been out of work for 18 months, they will be cut by 25 per cent. Apart from cutting the rate, which is what Austrain would do, there is no requirement under Austrain to actually train the person or to give accreditation and recognition to training already undertaken. The opposition's position in relation to youth wages is shameless. They think that they have covered themselves because they have ruled out the $3 per hour minimum rate. But they have not ruled out $3.10 an hour or $3.20 an hour and they have not ruled out Austrain, which will see wages for youth cut. It is not what the opposition have said; it is what they will not say. The simple truth is that under John Howard youth wages will be cut. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I ask the minister to table the documents that he was reading from and the other documents in his hand, including, I presume, the joint press statement which I issued with Father Cappo on 16 October which entirely contradicts his representations in his answer.",79
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister has indicated he was speaking from notes. Youth Unemployment,80
155,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I refer the minister to his answer to the previous question. I ask the minister: if you are so concerned with the problem of youth unemployment, why have you ceased publication of the regional youth unemployment statistics? Is it because you are embarrassed by the fact that the last figures to be published showed that teenage unemployment was 36 per cent in inner Sydney, 42 per cent in the Wide Bay-Burnett area of Queensland, 45 per cent in southern Adelaide and 65 per cent in north-western Melbourne? Will you now direct the resumption of the publication of these statistics, or is it not a fact that after 12 years in government you believe that the best way to deal with youth unemployment is to treat the issue politically and simply censor the statistics?",80
156,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The first question about employment that the shadow spokesman has asked of me in I think three months has come when we have seen for the first time a slight hiccup in the employment figures. The shadow spokesman absolutely salivates when there is bad news on the employment front. You can see him-Dr Glee. It really takes over. It is not true that the figures in relation to youth unemployment will not be available. Mr Tim Fischer-'Regional' .,80
157,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a regional basis. Ot course they are available, because they are collected by the Bureau of Statistics. If you are not smart enough to wander over there to get the figures, there is something clearly wrong with you. It is not just this side of the House that has recognised the volatility of these regional figures and the fact that they are not a reliable guide. I recall the leader of the government in the Australian Capital Territory made a similar statement two days ago, saying that the figures cannot be treated seriously because they have shown that youth unemployment went over I think 40 per cent when the numbers actually fell. I think what we have to understand in this is that there is a problem associated with the way the figures currently are reported. This has been acknowledged by a number of commentators in the gallery- Mr David MCKenzie and Mr Don Greenlees, to name two. I refer members of the House to articles that they have writtenDr Kemp- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order relates to relevance. A question was asked about the publication of regional unemployment statistics. The minister is referring to statistics collected by the ABS which are not published.",80
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is being directly relevant to the question that was put to him.,80
159,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point publishing something that does not give an accurate guide, but that is not to say the figures cannot be obtained. I have not stopped them. It is not my decision. I think it is important to put on record the position in relation to youth unemployment. The number of teenagers looking for full-time work is at its lowest level since April 1990. In September it fell by almost 3,000 to 88,500. Over the year to September the number of teenagers looking for full-time work fell by 6,500. The full-time unemployment rate for teenagers fell from 28 per cent in August to 26.7 per cent in September. As a proportion of the total-note that: total-15to 19-year-old population, teenage unemployment fell from 7.2 per cent to seven per cent. As acknowledged over the last few days by a number of commentators, rates of youth unemployment are confusing and misleading as to the state of the youth labour market. They are therefore inappropriate as the basis for a target. Clearly our aim is to reduce the number of 88,500 teenagers looking for full-time work, and we are clearly making headway. When we came back to power in 1983, do you know how many teenagers were out of work when John Howard left them? There were 158,000. Today it is 88,000-44 per cent lower. So don't give us this hypocrisy on your side of the House about doing something for the youth unemployed; it is nonsense. The reality is that, even though we have dropped the number by 44 per cent, the unemployment rate itself, as measured by the statistician, has remained pretty much the same. The reason for that is that the number of teenagers available for work has declined dramatically. We have seen many more stay on to complete year 12 and many more go into T AFE or into universities-all because this government has funded the capacity for them to do so and all because we recognise that the jobs that used to employ people in the 1970s and early 1980s, the unskilled jobs, do not exist anymore. If you do not recognise that, then you are not following where the labour market is going. As we progress further towards the Finn targets, we will seeMr Ronaldson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145. The minister was quite clearly asked why the publication of the regional youth unemployment statistics was ceased and will he now direct the resumption. While he is answering that, he may well tell this House why his department is now insisting on freedom of information applications to get information that is freely available.",80
160,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister was asked a question about youth unemployment. He is answering that question and so he is relevant.,81
161,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a trend that will continue as we progress down the path of the Finn targets. This government is committed to growth in TAFE, it is committed to growth in higher education and there will be fewer people available for the labour market. The issue in terms of youth unemployment is not the publication of figures; it is having policies in place that will address the problem and it is recognising that a person's employability is enhanced by the fact that they are trained and they are skilled. Our policies are ensuring that they get that necessary training and skilling. That is the reason why the youth groups that have met with me are more interested in developing the way forward with us than they are with you. Getting that information is not an issue of freedom of information. You can roll on over to the Bureau of Statistics, get the information and make of it what you want. But the simple fact of the matter is that it would be far better for the opposition to propose some constructive policy rather than to distort and misrepresent figures. I would urge them to get on that bandwagon.",81
162,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister has been quoting extensively from a document and claiming that it is readily available. I ask him to table that document so we can see whether the figures are bogus.",81
163,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not think the minister said he was quoting from a document that was available. He is quoting from notes.,81
164,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You're not prepared to make them available?,81
165,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,81
166,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You would not understand them if we made them available. The final point I make is that this is a government committed to a target of getting unemployment down. We have set our sails for getting five per cent unemployment by the year 2000 and ensuring, by the programs we have in place, that youth get their fair share. It is the opposition that has given up on a target. It is the Leader of the Opposition who last week said that five per cent was not achievable. That is the message he is giving to the young people in this country: 'We've given up on you. And for those who are looking for jobs, we'll cut your wages at the same time.' That is the difference between us and you and that is why they will support us. Inequality",81
167,Mr HA VILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Is the minister aware of proposals to change the level of inequality in Australian society, and what would the effects of those proposals be?",82
168,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As honourable members would be well aware, we have heard a great deal of bleating from the opposition recently expressing concern about inequality and poverty. The level of hypocrisy is quite phenomenal. I guess the most extreme example I have seen in recent days is that press release from the opposition spokesman on social security, where he says: Equality is important. Inequality is morally able and dysfunctional to society as a whole in that inequality leads to envy and malice ... Anybody would think from that that in the wasteland speech on social policy the other day from the Leader of the Opposition we might have actually seen some semblance or some scintilla of a policy that might lead to reduced inequality. Of course, we saw no such thing. The only substantive policy proposals we saw there were the usual ones about flexibility in the labour market-which, as we know, is code for wage cuts. The Leader of the Opposition on that occasion took the opportunity to try to reassure people on low incomes and to try to reassure the welfare sector that a coalition government would not mean bad things for people on low incomes. But of course he keeps getting blown away by his own colleagues. We singularly fail to see from the Leader of the Opposition any specific policies whatever in this area. We get a constant stream from members of his backbench-and, in particular, from the well known Lyons Forum of conservative coalition MPs in their document Empowering families. They say: Encouragement of less preferable families situations is a foible of the social welfare system. Mr Howard says that he will protect the sole parent pension, but we get this sort of rhetoric coming from that quarter. Then the member for Mackellar the other day in a statement said: It is not the taxpayers' responsibility to pick up the remnants of a family when it breaks up. What an extraordinary statement that is. Is she seriously suggesting that the government has no responsibility to attend to the needs of children in families that have broken up and make sure that there is an adequate level of income support? Is that what is being said? This is the background that you have to bear in mind when you see the Leader of the Opposition trying to make reassuring noises. All you see is the black heart of the opposition coming out in these sorts of statements emanating from the backbench. We know, from the experience of Western Australia and Victoria, that what the Liberals before an election say they will do after an intolerelection bears no relationship to what they will actually do after an election. All the prejudices coming from that side of politics are to cut the social safety net and to adopt punitive policies in all of these areas. It is based on prejudice, Mr Speaker.",82
169,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Wages are up in Western Australia, unemployment is down.",82
170,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you look at the utterances of the Lyons Forum and others, they take great stockMr Tuckey interjecting",82
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister might just wait for a moment. The member for O'Connor does not have to comment on every sentence or point. In fact, you do not have to comment-do me a favour!",82
172,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, many people who are advocating the cutting of the sole parent pension draw a completely false analogy with the United States that fails to take account of all the active measures we have taken to ensure or to maximise the chances of sole parents getting back into the work force. The fact is that the teenage pregnancy rate has halved in this country since sole parent support was introduced in the 1970s, unlike in the United States where the rate of teenage pregnancy has increased quite substantially. So the suggestion that the existence of some sort of income support structure leads to a proliferation of teenage pregnancy is a demonstrably false proposition. Of course, the government has done a range of other things that the member for Mackellar and others have failed to acknowledge. One such thing is the introduction of the child support scheme as a result of which many more custodial parents, following family break-up, are now receiving some sort of support from the non-custodial parents. The Lyons Forum has things to say in the area of taxation policy where, again, you see an almost total vacuum of specific proposals from the coalition. They actually seem to favour a family unit taxation of the kind seen in France. This is held up as something that is seen to be fairly reasonable. Of course, the French taxation system includes a 20 per cent GST-and we have seen the GST rear its ugly head again amongst members of the opposition. Importantly, the sort of tax system that you see in France has no redistributive impact at all when looked at in contrast to the tax transfer system in this country, which is highly redistributive. According to some commentators and analysts, our tax system is radically redistributive. When we see this talk about inequality, we should just bear in mindMr Reith-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I presume that the minister is starting to wind up, but I do draw your attention to the clock. This is the sixth question we have had and we have been going for 40 minutes. At this pace, question time today will exceed an hour and a half simply because there is absolutely no discipline and no requirement for ministers to at least make some attempt to provide a brief and succinct answer. Mr Speaker, I invite you to use your discretion.",82
173,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Flinders has again made a reasonable point. Might I suggest that ministers try to shorten their responses. I call the minister, in conclusion.",83
174,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In conclusion, the policy prescriptions of the coalition, in so far as we can make any sense of them, are such as to increase inequality unambiguously. In the countries that have followed their prescriptions-the US and the UK--earnings are far more unequal than in this country. In the US, inequality in earnings is 2Y2 times the rate in Australia, and in the UK it is about 1Y2 times our rate. I refer those honourable members on both sides of the House who want to see that confirmed to the recent EPAC paper on inequality. AIDC Ltd: Executive Remuneration",83
175,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Minister for Social Security to the Economist table, which proves him totally wrong on that point. My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and relates to income inequality. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to the recent lavish salary increases for executives of AIDC Ltd, who can hardly be described as battlers. Does the government approve of such pay increases which saw the remuneration of executives earning more than $100,000 increase from $5.2 million to $13.6 million, an increase of over 160 per cent despite a 40 per cent drop in profit? If not, will the government take action as the majority shareholder to prevent the payment of $17 million in so-called 'golden handcuffs' to senior management of AIDC on top of their salaries, especially since the justification for these payments-the sale of the government's remaining 80 per cent stake in AIDC-has been shelved and the government will in fact buyout the minority shareholders?",83
176,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The revelation of the dimensions of that pay increase was a matter which I must say I found of concern. Mr Costello-Who is the shareholder?,83
177,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not ask the question.,83
178,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The boards of these operations are conducted at arms length from government and make their own determinations on what the payments ought to be. The board of course did suggest to the government that it would be necessary to provide encouragement to staff, because there is enormous competition in the financial sector for quality people in the merchant banking arena, and that in a period of change via the privatisation process-where, basically, the intellectual capital of the organisation counts more than just about anything else-there is a requirement to have incentives put in place to ensure that those quality people stay. The amount and dimension of those incentives were a product, I am advised, of consultations the board had with a number of private advisers elsewhere in the financial sector who were on equivalent salary structures. If the AIDC is going to continue in the financial sector, it would be sensible for its board to pay levels of salary, emoluments and all the rest of it that are equivalent to what received in the financial sector. That being the case, the evidence from all of that provides that salaries in the financial sector are salaries which are clearly enviable and, compared with salaries in the rest of Australia, are probably too much. Victoria Cross Winners: Gold i ..sses",84
179,Mr CLEELAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,--My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Has the minister's attention been drawn to an article in today's Melbourne Age regarding the conferral of lik gold passes to the three surviving Australian holders of the Victoria Cross? Could the minister explain to the House the rationale behind the provision of such a privilege to these very special Australians?,84
180,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and I thank members on all sides of the House for giving that very warm welcome to those who are, I think noone will dispute, three great Australian heroes. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",84
181,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Only 106 Australians have been awarded the Victoria Cross since its inception in 1856 by Queen Victoria. Unfortunately, only three now remain. They are Sir Roden Cutler, Mr Edward Kenna and Mr Keith Payne. Sir Roden Cutler VC was awarded the Victoria Cross for conspicuous and sustained gallantry during the Syrian campaign, and for outstanding bravery during bitter fighting at Merdjayoun. At Damour, a few weeks later, a machine-gun injury led to a leg being amputated. Edward Kenna VC was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions against the Japanese in May 1945 near Wewak, New Guinea. Private Kenna exposed himself to direct enemy fire while disabling machine-gun posts with a rifle. His magnificent courage and complete disregard for his own safety resulted in a successful attack on a Japanese bunker and avoided many casualties. Keith Payne VC saw active service in Korea and served in Malaya before going to Vietnam in 1969. In that conflict, Warrant is Officer Keith Payne was awarded the Victoria Cross for outstanding bravery. Directly exposing himself to the enemy, he was injured in the hands and arms but continued to cover the withdrawal of his troops. After nightfall, he located 40 lost and wounded soldiers beyond the perimeters whom he led to safety through the enemy lines. His sustained and heroic personal efforts saved the lives of a large number of his indigenous soldiers and several of his fellow advisers. The three surviving holders of the Victoria Cross are frequently requested to attend functi6ns and commemorations all over Australia, as is befitting Australians who have achieved as they have. The life gold pass will provide up to a maximum of 25 first-class return trips per annum on scheduled commercial and commuter air services, main line rail services and other government services, or by motor coach or other vehicles operating as regular carriers, to the VC holders and their wives. The government has taken this step to alleviate the personal expense that these Australian heroes incur in performing what is ostensibly a civic duty. We often revere our sporting heroes but I am very sure that my parliamentary· colleagues on all sides of the House will say that these are three truly authentic Australian heroes. Can I also say-I am sure they will not mind me saying it-that today also happens to be the 50th anniversary reunion of HMAS Cowra. Many of the veterans from there are in the gallery and I am sure the House welcomes them as well. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",84
182,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I finish by simply saying again that I thank the House for giving these three people in particular the thanks that they deserve from this country.,85
183,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I indicate, on behalf of the coalition, that we strongly support and endorse the comments made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and we salute three outstanding Australians. Government Policies",85
184,Mr ATKINSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and I ask: as the government that claimed before the last election that it would not increase taxes, deliver two rounds of tax cuts, not increase the Medicare levy, take pensioners out of the tax system by 1995, build a national museum, spend $100 million on buying private hospital beds for public patients, and not increase the pension age for women, why have you failed to devote at least one chapter of your Shaping the nation document to the one characteristic that, more than any other, is the mark of your government, and that is shaping the truth to fit your own political purposes?",85
185,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad that you are paying such attention to that excellent document because what that document reveals is that we are the government that has produced two million jobs in this country-670,000 of them since the last election.",85
186,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,85
187,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I have remarked before in this place on unparliamentary language. I have turned something of a deaf ear this afternoon to one or two interjections. I will not from here on.,85
188,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the government that, in terms of the social safety net, has improved benefits to families for their young children, depending on the age of the children over the time, by between 70 and 130 per cent. This is the government that has improved the age pension by 12 per cent in real terms. Both those economic statistics were on the decline when you happened to be in office. This is the government that has put in place a social safety net of which, evidently, you are proud at the moment, as you wish to try to associate yourselves with it. This is the government that has put in place-when there were two million Australians without any form of medical cover at all after about six depredations of the Medibank system when you were in office-a Medicare system which after years and years you now decide that you want to sign up to. This is the government that has provided seven different tranches of tax cuts for the Australian people, and in the last set of undertakings in the election provided the first tranche of tax cuts early and provided the second tranche of tax cuts in the form of enhanced savings through superannuation. This is the government that is putting in place via the superannuation process a savings policy that addresses the decline in private savings in this country and guarantees a decent retirement for all Australians, particularly for our current young Australians. If this government is not re-elected and those superannuation promises are therefore overturned, which you have already indicated you will do, a 25-year-old in the work force now would have their retirement benefit cut by about two-thirds over what this government proposes, and of course there would be substantial reductions for everybody in the higher age brackets. So this is a government with a great deal to be proud of, and I am glad we are able to celebrate it with a book today. Mr Atkinson-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker, understanding order 145 relating to relevance. The Deputy Prime Minister has addressed a number of issues, with one exception. He did not address any of those promises before the election.",85
189,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I think the Deputy Prime Minister responded in full. Industrial Relations,86
190,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Will he advise the House of the reasons for the government's intervention in the industrial dispute between the AMIEU and Australian Meat Holdings?,86
191,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Following a meeting on Monday evening between the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations, me and a very representative group of government backbenchers, the government announced that we will ask the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to take a number of urgent measures to address the dispute between the meat workers union and Australian Meat Holdings. To this end the government has indicated that we will intervene in these proceedings. The member for Capricornia and each of her government colleagues raised a number of serious concerns about AMH's approach to enterprise bargaining. For our part, the government will ask the commission to investigate the allegations of duress by AMH during the bargaining process, and claims that meat workers' pay is being reduced under arrangements pursued by AMH. These are very serious allegations and must be properly and fully investigated. Today I have written to the commission president asking that the hearings scheduled for 31 October and 1 November be brought forward. Urgent resolution of the dispute is required as many workers at Beaudesert have been locked out. Facilitation of enterprise bargaining at all of AMH's plants is urgently required. Contrary to the views of ill-informed criticsMr Reith-Why didn't you do that at Mount Isa?",86
192,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"including the member for Flinders who has interjected, enterprise bargaining in the meat industry is progressing successfully at a number of other works. You only need to look to Victoria. Mr Tim Fischer-And Wally Curran?",86
193,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I pay tribute to the efforts of Wally Curran.,86
194,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,86
195,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Look at the results. In that state 17 enterprise agreements have been completed. Mr Anderson interjecting,86
196,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! If the Deputy Leader of the National Party wants to be here for his MPI, he should just sit back.",86
197,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Castricum Brotherscompleted. R.J. Gilbertson-completed. Hardwicks--completed. D. and S. Hamilton Meats--completed. M.C. Herd--completed. G. and K. O'Connor--completed. The list goes on. I compliment each of those parties, and I again compliment Mr Curran for the effort that has gone into making those bargains. Having said that, the allegations of AMH workers not receiving correct award entitlements will now be investigated by the Commonwealth. Our officers will conduct inspections of AMH time records. The Queensland government, I am pleased to say, following an approach to Minister Matt Foley, will also investigate allegations that a number of workers have lost substantial sums of long service leave resulting from this dispute. I conclude by saying that the meat industry is vital to our economy. The government intends to take every step to ensure that there is a fair bargaining process--one that delivers results, both to workers and to companies, and delivers them through increased productivity and delivers them in an atmosphere of stable industrial relations. Home Loan Affordability",86
198,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement on radio 3LO on 5 October of this year that 'the housing afford ability index ... is very good now.' Is it not a fact that the Real Estate Institute of Australia and the Commonwealth Bank-HIA indices of home loan affordability both show a massive decline in home loan affordability under your government? Is it not a fact that, .lccording to the REIA index, home loan affordability is now 36 per cent lower than in March 1983, when Labor came to office? Is it not also a fact that, since September 1984, home loan affordability has reached the levels of the previous coalition government in only one quarter of the intervening 11 years? How can the government assert that housing affordability is very good when its record is so abysmal?",86
199,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The situation when we came to office, which the honourable member refers to, was that home loan interest rates were touching 14 per cent. But that 14 per cent was not the half of it. What you had to do was cocktail it to get to anything like a situation where your deposit was likely to meet the amount that you had to borrow. In cocktailing those loans, you were taking your interest rates well over 14 per cent. In the course of this last term of parliament, interest rates for home loans in this country have never gone above what was the lowest figure under John Howard's tutelage as the Treasurer of this nation. Home loan affordability in the sclerotic system they had was knocked to pieces by the fact that it was almost impossible to lay your hands on any money in that highly regulated environment, unless you were prepared to put yourself way above what were the advertised and allegedly fixed rates. In comparing our position here with your position when you were in office, the situation of borrowers for home loans now is vastly better. Training",87
200,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is the minister aware of reports of a document concerning the government's record on training and alternative strategies in this area? Can the minister advise the House whether claims in the document are accurate? If not, why not?",87
201,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Lyons for his question. I am aware of such a document. It is being circulated in T AFE colleges and it seems to be authorised by a Mr Figart of Unley, who is, I understand, an employee of the Liberal Party in South Australia. At first glance, it looks like . one of those lost scrolls-a Liberal Party policy. We know that it cannot be a policy, of course, because when the Leader of the Opposition farewelled his colleagues on their blunder-bus tour a few weeks ago, he admitted that he could not set any targets for youth unemployment because he did not have any policies. It certainly does appear to be part of a campaign of lies about vocational education and training. Under Labor's track record, the document states that the number of young Australians in employment based training-that is, apprenticeships and traineeships-is at its lowest level for three decades. This is a porky. This is an absolute canard that coalition members have been told to repeat like parrots up and down the country. It is totally wrong and it is high time that those who were putting it around were well and truly nailed. The facts are that three decades ago apprenticeship commencements stood at some 29,000 nationally. Commencements for 199495 were just over 53,000 and when we add the commencements for traineeships, which were introduced in 1995, we have almost 70,000 people entering workplace training. In the last year the coalition was in office, commencements were 34,794-less than half of today's figures. I have a graph that shows that. Here we are; there you were. I table the graph. You could not defend a record like the opposition's because it is so pathetic. The Liberal Party in South Australia can publish untruths about the situation but the truth is that the Leader of the Opposition did not care about apprentices back then and he certainly does not care now. When this government established the Australian National Training Authority, we committed ourselves to developing the work skills essential for a competitive Australia. This year our funding for growth in vocational education and training has provided an extra 147,000 places for young people to obtain those skills that business and industry require. This government has committed $1 Y2 billion to provide extra training places for our youth. Over the five years of growth from 1993 to 1997, this government will have funded an extra 735,000 places. Earlier this month, the Prime Minister met some of the products of this government's investment in training when he fare welled 40 of our young people who have just finished their training and who are representing Australia at the International Skill Olympics against 27 other countries. Those young people are currently competing at Lyon and I am sure we all wish them well. ANL Ltd",87
202,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Is the minister going to allow the Maritime Union of Australit is to take charge of the future of ANL, despite having already had some $15 million wiped off its value through earlier capitulaa tions to the MUA on top of the $145 million ANL has already lost while its future has been held hostage by the MUA? Will the the minister give an assurance that the govern to ment will go ahead with the sale of ANL regardless of the selfish opposition of MUA and end this fiasco and further losses for the taxpayer?",88
203,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the honourable member and indeed the whole House knows, the future of ANL is the subject of negoIBSRAM, tiations at this very moment between the trade union movement and the company P&O, Centre which is anxious to purchase the company. The outcome of those negotiations is someresearch thing we will have to wait and see about. have indicated clearly, and indeed government actions bear this out, that ANL will either sold or be significantly restructured. Those the two options and they are two options the government will consider in light of the negotiations. Agricultural Research",88
204,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. The minister would be aware that a sixth Australian scientist been appointed to the leadership of an interand national agricultural research organIsation. What were the reasons for that appointment?,88
205,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members will be aware of highly the very important day that occurred this week-World Food Day. The figure that supportive springs to mind in connection with that anniversary is the 800 million people who each day in this world go to bed starving. Dealing with that fact is one of the most difficult issues which faces the world community. It is one in which Australia has a particular role to play. I thank the member for bringing attention to this particular appointment. One of the ways that this problem can be addressed is by agricultural scientists worldwide applying their talents and their science to increasing agricultural production to make more efficient, more productive, and to make agricultural methods more sustainable. Australia does, as the member indicates, make significant contribution in this field. Only this week, our scientific credentials in the agriculture field were given a further boost by appointment of a sixth Australian scientist lead a major international agricultural research centre. That is six out of only 22 the worldwide, so we are really fighting very huge much above our weight in this area. The appointment of Dr Eric Craswell as the new Director-General of the International Board for Soil Research and Management, means that in the last year three senior scientists from ACIAR, the Australian for International Agricultural Research, have been appointed to lead international centres. Our contribution is not just I significant; it is second to none. IBSRAM promotes soil management research in develbe oping countries. In other words, it focuses on are the welfare of the soil, which is the most fundamental resource for agriculture and the prime consideration in natural resource conservation. One of the reasons we can take pride in this is the increasing part played by the aid program which operates through ACIAR. It is not just a funding body for agricultural research. It puts together collaborative, cohas operative teams of scientists from Australia other countries to work together to solve problems, and that has given our scientists international experience which makes them valued in the research community. This would not happen if it were not for the climate fostered by this government, and indeed supported by the opposition, through the aid program. As long as I am minister responsible for this, those opportunities will continue. I conclude by drawing attention to the science writer of the Australian, who is one of the few voices crying out for recognition of the fact that this is a field in which Australia leads the world. He points out in a recent article: The doctrine of excellence is to focus your efforts on the field in which you enjoy your greatest natural advantages-and do everything within your power to enhance them. Devising new ways to produce food sustainably could be Australia's true opportunity for greatness. In the time it tookfor question time4000 children died of malnutrition-related disease. Without a huge international effort, that toll will double and redouble ... But this country has the answers, if only it has the vision to apply them-and the will.",88

207,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Today we had the notable presence in the gallery of our three surviving Victoria Cross winners. Two are particularly great Australians. The third is also a particularly great Australian, but I remember that he booted me up the backside when he was on the training staff of the army officer training unit. He is a good friend. I am reminded of further complaints on Monday and Tuesday of this week of the very great difficulty people sitting in the gallery, especially towards the top of the gallery, are having in hearing words on quieter question time days, let alone on rowdier question time days. I am told that the acoustics, particularly in the back two rows, on the front section and the two side sections, are difficult. Mr Speaker, I am wondering whether you might look at this, because if people are good enough to come to the gallery they should at least be able to hear the proceedings from the floor of the House.",89
208,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I know that this is a problem which from time to time members do raise. We will have another look at it. It may in fact go to things like ministers talking to the chair and also using the microphones in that respect. NA,89

213,Mrs BISHOP,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During question time today, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) was given the task of furthering the misrepresentation in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald relating to a talkback radio session that I did in Queensland last week. It related to a question that I was asked about the Child Support Agency. I would like to correct the impression that somehow I was opposed to a safety net being in place. I am not, let me make it clear. What the Sydney Morning Herald and the minister did today was to totally take the quote out of context.",89

216,Mrs BISHOP,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I said: Let me say there has been a good deal of complaint and concern about the way in which the tax office operates the Child Support Agency. There is then the quote which the minister has apparently taken from the paper. I then went on to say: I think we again have to look at the importance of family life, of what happens to children when there is a break up, and I am acutely aware of the inefficiencies of the administration of the tax office and the program as it is administered. Our aim is to, in a more simplified way",89

225,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PRIVILEGE,"I wish to raise a matter of privilege and contempt and I ask that it be referred urgently to the Privileges Committee for investigation. I cite as justification for this request section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 which is listed on page 954 of House of Representatives Practice which says in part that contempt is recognised if conduct constitutes an improper interference with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member. I also recommend, when you consider this request, that you review the Coleman case which is listed on page 706 of House of Representatives Practice and the advice about the obstruction of officers of the House in the execution of their duty or other people employed by the House, or entrusted with the execution of its orders, or the molestation of those people on account of their having carried out their duties, constitutes contempt. The matter of concern is that thousands of Australians, particularly in Western Australia but quite possibly Australia-wide, have been and quite possibly continue to be denied telephone access and possibly access by correspondence to many federal MPs and possibly therefore to government agencies and departments. I am also concerned that some MPs belonging to the Labor Party have been and possibly will be prevented and impeded from performing their duties as elected representatives of the people and, tragically, may also be acquiescing in all of this contempt. I raise as support of my request an article in the West Australian, written by Mr Randal Markey and published on Saturday, 7 October. I refer you to the article. I will not read it out but I will quote it in small part: The Community and Public Sector Union, which represents staff in MPs' offices, has accused Assistant Treasurer George Gear of failing to comply with work bans over a pay dispute. The article went on to say: ""No other electorate office in WA (including those of Ministers) is failing to follow these bans. ""I would urge you to support our action as your other WA Federal colleagues are."" Mr Gear said that it was not helping him hang on to his seat of Canning, which he holds by only 240 votes. He also said he did not tell his office staff what to do. The article continued: WA Labor Senator Jim MCKiernan said the bans were frustrating and would be counter-productive in trying to address the Government's loss of support among blue-collar workers. I also submit a fax message sent to my office from a staffer of the President of the Senate. On receipt of this fax the staff in my electorate office expressed anger and the feeling of having been intimidated by it, or at least the threat of intimidation. The fax read: To all SCABS, We are fighting for all Electorate Staff so why don't you help us to succeed for you as well. Please support us. The contact number was in fact the President of the Senate's office. The action taken by the union and some staff members of ALP federal members amounts to a breach of privilege and contempt and should not be permitted to continue or happen again. For some time the offices of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and the honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin), plus the offices of Senators Beahan, Cook and Evans and others, have had answering machines advising of no immediate contact being available due to industrial disputation. I am advised that even today this practice continues in some offices. To cut off access and deny the people their right of access to their elected federal member for assistance on important and urgent matters and other issues is outrageous and scandalous and should be stopped. Furthermore, the Act-Department action of the minister, the member for Canmatching ning, in seemingly acquiescing in this virtual thuggery and saying 'he did not tell his office staff what to do' is a frightening admission by 1994-95. a minister of the Crown. The concept that ordinary Australians, battlers, can be cut off for from making contact with their member of parliament to seek redress and advice is national Air Air outrageous and is a startling admission that a 1994-95. federal member of parliament's work is and can be impeded by a union. Mr Speaker, whilst not denying anyone the opportunity to withdraw their labour priate or denying a much justified pay crease for our overworked staff, I ask that consider the matter in light of section 4 act and refer the matter to the Privileges Committee. I seek leave to table copies of the article and the fax. Leave granted.",90

228,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the Deputy Leader of the National Party 1994of Australia (Mr Anderson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to provide job security and improving living standards for regional Australians. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",91
229,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is a government that has become very long indeed on rhetoric about things like social justice, regional development, boosting exports, even retaining the family farm. We hear about how that is important for economic and social reasons now from none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). But there is in fact a huge gulf between rhetoric and reality. As, in the broader context in Australia, the rich get richer and the poor become more numerous, the same is happening in rural Australia. Many of those more numerous poor are rural Australians, our wealth creators, those who provide the overwhelming base for our export performance, and those who, in these increasingly environmentally conscious times, ought to be seen and recognised as the custodians of our natural resource base. Yet, thanks to the government, thanks to that policy drift, their inertia, their reform fatigue, what we really see, despite the rhetoric, in rural and regional Australia is increasing dislocation, increasing poverty, increasing loss of job opportunities, and nowhere do we see these problems more evident than amongst young people in the country. We see anecdotal and real evidence of young men leaving the bush in droves and young women leaving even faster. Tragically, it is often the most talented people with the most to offer for the future, the people who will be most needed in the future in rural Australia, who are leaving. My electorate is no exception. We have noted something of a contraction in the size of the work force in Gwydir since the recession set in over the last couple of years of some 4,500 people-many of them young people, many of them skilled, many of them people who will be needed when things tum around. This is despite the fact that two of Australia's wealthiest agricultural shires are in my electorate-Narrabri and Gunnedah. In the case of Moree, this is reflected in the town by the unbelievable number of vacant homes that are on the market-no purchaser available. In Gunnedah, a couple of hundred homes in what is not a very big town do not even have the power turned on any more. There has been an explosion of farm debt, but the government over the past 13 years has refused to do anything about arresting that decline in our rural fortunes. This has had a significant impact on job opportunities and returns for efforts made in rural Australia. We have seen farm debt go from $7 billion when this mob came to power to $17Y2 billion today. Again, the young are unduly affected. They are giving up hope and questioning their role in the so-called lucky country. Today we heard some statistics from our spokesman in this area about the unemployment of youth; that is, those from 15 to 20 years old. The national youth unemployment rate is 28 per cent. That is a disgrace. Look at what is happening in country regions. I understand that in one district of the Mallee area the youth unemployment rate is about 66 per cent. Two-thirds of the young people in that area do not have a job. The Wide BayBurnett region has a youth unemployment rate of 41 Y2 per cent. The central west of New South Wales has a youth unemployment rate of 32 per cent. In central Queensland that figure is nearly 40 per cent. Those figures probably disguise the reality. It is probably worse in many of those areas but it is covered up by various programs which are designed to disguise the full extent of the real problem and to train people for jobs that tragically will often not be there. Why will they not be there? Because the government is severely inflicted with reform fatigue. Murdoch was spot on when he said that Australia's economy is a disgrace. Didn'the stir up a hornet's nest when he talked about youth unemployment? We saw a mad scramble from those opposite trying to discredit what he had to say. It is very interesting. The people in the bush are losing hope. There is a loss of belief by country people, our wealth creators, in their future just when the experts are now widely beginning to talk about a bright future. A little while ago, Graham Blight made reference here in Canand berra to that fact. Graham Blight is well known and well respected in this place. He predicted that agriculture would be back at the forefront of governments' agendas in coming years for very good reason. He pointed to the fact that by the year 2025, when I will be 68-it is not 30 years time-the world will need another 300 million tonnes of wheat a year just to feed itself, another 260 million tonnes of com, another 210 million tonnes of rice and another 16 million tonnes of fish. Imagine the fibre that we will need to clothe people and the material that we will need to put roofs over our heads globally. Let us put all that into perspective: the biggest crop that Australia, as the world's second biggest exporter of wheat, ever grew was just 22 million tonnes in 1982-83. We will have to find another 300 million tonnes in 30 years time. What are we doing about this problem? There is policy paralysis, drift, a loss and a loss of direction. We are giving away our best talent-the bush-at the very time when we ought to be giving it positive direcshutting tion and confidence and when we should be telling people that there is a future, because there is. But what are we doing? We are seeing the government destroy the heartland of Australia. It is not just Labor in this place that is destroying our heartland. Their cohorts in Queensland and New South Wales are also contributing to the problem. There is appalling lack of consultation on matters such as SEPP46, the state environmental planning policy. There is no consultation with the people at the coalface, the people who actually have stewardship over the environment. They just say, 'Here's what you'll do. Here's how you'll do it. We'll control you. We won't give you the freedom to go out and act in the best long-term interests of either your industry or the people who will follow you in it.' Then we come to forestry. What an absolute debacle, what an absolute mess, we have seen from those opposite. Investment is drying up, and there is one indication of that. We hear all their talk about growing a bigger timber paper products industry. Whilst they talk about it here, it actually happens in New Zealand. They will establish 100,000 hectares of softwood plantation this year. In Australia it is estimated that 8,000 hectares will be established. Some 100,000 hectares will be established there while 8,000 hectares will be so far away, in established here. What is the difference in the job opportunities? What is the opportunity for value adding wood and timber paper products in this country? Unlimited. This year, 40 per cent of the timber and paper product needs of New South Wales alone will be imported-across the nation, it is $3 billion worth-and that figure is growing rapidly. How much investment is on hold because of the uncertainty? Around $2 billion worth in value adding of our product. What is the government doing about it? Well, it is slashed across the papers every morning, isn't it: total and absolute chaos. of hope When we ought to be talking about more opportunities, more jobs, more plantations and more timber, what are we doing? We are the thing down to the huge disadvantage-again, let me emphasise this-not just of country people and young people in the bush but of the nation's economic performance. In case you had not noticed-and here is one of the ministers who is very good on spending money-we have to generate wealth in this country if we are to then distribute it. And here we are again undermining the people who need to be encouraged to invest, an to employ people and to produce a bigger cake so that there is more to go around for everyone. I now tum to the issue of competitiveness. The tyranny of distance is a great problem. I have to touch on this. I cannot resist it as my opposite number over there keeps talking about how he has reformed Australia's waterfront. A recent study was carried out of 46 ports around the world. Although we have spent $400 million since 1989, the beginning of the government's reform program, what has actually happened? Sydney has slipped from 24th to 31st and Melbourne has gone from 28th to 37th in terms of world competitiveness. Did you hear the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) guffaw when I accused the government of having reform fatigue? Did you hear it? It is wonderful, isn't it? I cannot help but mention something we ought to be very proud of in this country: we are the world's No.1 exporter of beef product. But you know what? Such is your reform fatigue that we are no longer competitive at home. The first rule of being an effective trading nation in any given commodity is to make sure that you are competitive at home. But what do we find in the case of the beef industry? We are not competitive at home. So how are we ever going to make it? We have got American and New Zealand product on our shelves. How are we ever going to make it in the important Asian markets to our north if we cannot do our best here? The fact of the matter is that the industry on its knees at the moment and, with it, the well-being of thousands of producers. And here is the rub for you blokes: so are tens of thousands of Australian workers. We have had report after report and study after study which have clearly indicated that we are grossly underperforming to such an extent that the only reason we are competitive on world markets at all is that our beef producers receive as little as half of what their opposite numbers in New Zealand and America get. For years the government has ignored time and again the problem-although the government did decide a couple of years ago that they would have their own industry commission look at this whole issue again. What the commission had to say was really very interesting. The first thing it said was that we are competitive only because of the low prices paid to Australian producers. It went on to say a few other things that members opposite might be interested in. One is that change has been painfully slow and that greater industrial relations flexibility and productivity are the key to the industry'S future. But here is the bit that is really interesting: The Commission has found that greater flexibility. particularly greater use of enterprise agreements, could bring about significant productivity gains with benefits for ... Who would you expect would get the benefits? Farmers? The nation? Do you know who the commission nominated first? The workers of this country. The first who would benefit are the workers-then the producers, the processors and, after that, some consumers, as the commission put it. It is reported in another place that, if we could pick up the hundreds of billions of dollars that are out there to be gained by some improved performance, the benefit to workers would be about 25 per cent of that better return. What did the government do with all this? It sat on it for 14 months. There were 23 major recommendations, and the government picked up one, basically. After 14 months the government introduced some legislation into the second chamber in this place. This is Australia's major agricultuis ral export industry, except when wool overtakes it occasionally. How importantly did the government regard the reform process? Perhaps it is reflected in the fact they picked up just one of 23 recommendations and introduced it on a day when the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) was not even in Australia. It was appropriate that he was in America on that day. That is fine, but the government had 14 months in which to choose a day when the minister would be here to introduce it. But, no, they did not, and so it goes on and on. When we raised enterprise bargaining with them, which they claimed had basically been put in place in the industry-you heard it again from the minister here-he said, 'That's fixed it all up. We don't need to address the other areas here.' And it just so happened that on that day something had fallen off the back of a truck: an independent report on the Department of Primary Industries and Energy which said: In relation to this industryand this is a matter of only weeks old even nowwith some exceptions, progress has generally been limited, with little to show in terms of widespread and quantifiable increases in productivity and efficiency. The [general nature of] enterprise bargains achieved to date have not been particularly innovative or successful in encouraging improvements . . . In many cases, they have been little more than a means to achieve a general wage increase. So there you go-abysmal failure in one of Australia's most important regional industries and most important export industries. Confronted with the evidence from his independent report, Senator Collins over in the other place-and this is very interesting; this is just two weeks ago-went on to say: . . . AMH is engaged right now in its abattoirs at Rockhampton in an exercise to do just thatimprove work practicesin cooperation with the unions and under the supervision of the Industry Commission. I think he meant the Industrial Relations Commission. That is really very interesting. For years and years they can ignore the reform process at the cost of workers, at the cost of the industry and at the possible demise now of the industry; but in the space of two weeks they can act when a complaint comes in from the other side. I reckon that is an enormous vote of no confidence in your system in general and an enormous vote of no confidence in the commission in particular, because they were meant to be overseeing this. In short, the whole process is nothing short of a national disgrace. (Time expired)",92
230,Mr BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Since I have been a minister in this government every MPI from the opposition I have debated has been based on a false premise. Today's MPI is no exception. Not only is today's MPI based on a false premise but also there has been an array of falsehoods asserted in the speech we have just heard. I intend to return to a few of those towards the end of my speech. The MPI refers to the question of job security. It is the case that this country has had one of the most rapid rates of job growth in the entire OECD over a period of several years. In the year to the three months to July-in other words, the most recent quarter for which statistics are available from the Department of Employment, Education and Training-employment growth in Australia as a whole was 4.4 per cent. This represented 347,000 new jobs in Australia as a whole. The implication of the MPI is that rural and regional Australia has missed out on its fair share of that employment growth. What are the facts? The facts are that employment growth in non-metropolitan Australia was much stronger than the average. In fact, in the non-metropolitan area employment growth totalled no less than 6.2 per cent over that period, which is almost twice as great as the 3.4 per cent job growth recorded in metropolitan Australia. That is the first point: rural and regional Australia have shared very substantially in the exceptionally strong job growth that has gone on. Of the 347,000 jobs created in Australia in the course of that year, 170,000 of them-that is, almost half-were in non-metropolitan areas. Indeed in all states, except Victoria and Western Australia-and it is interesting to note that the opposition spokesman and Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), somehow tried to blame Labor state governments for the poor performance-more than 50 per cent of the job growth was outside the capital city. Guess which political parties are in office in those two states! Furthermore, this is not a short-term trend. It is a trend that has been occurring throughout our term of office. It is true that there is considerable variation in unemployment across regional Australia, just as there is considerable variation in unemployment across metropolitan Australia. The Deputy Leader of the National Party's own region, which is north and central west New South Wales, has a rate of 6.6 per cent, which is well below the national average of more than eight per cent. In the Murray-Murrumbidgee area of New South Wales unemployment was as low as 4.4 per cent. The highest level of unemployment in Australia is not in nonmetropolitan Australia, it is in western Melbourne. Of course what matters about unemployment is the policies to reduce it. We are reducing unemployment. Unemployment has fallen in almost all the regions of nonmetropolitan Australia. We gave the economy a fiscal kick-start, which the opposition opposed, from the recession. We are maintaining an accord which has provided a framework that has facilitated strong employment growth. The opposition has opposed that. We have introduced the job compact to provide a fundamental structural change in the labour market in favour of job growth, and particularly job growth opportunities for the disadvantaged in the labour market. The opposition has opposed that. The fact is that the MPI today is from the political party that believes people who live in regional Australia are not part of a broader Australian nation. The National Party has always pretended that somehow regional Australians do not have the same interests as other Australians, which is a nonsense. Moreover, the National Party has always believed that the only people of worth in regional Australia are primary producers and other small business operators. They want to pretend that the indigenous population does not exist, that the social security recipients in regional Australia do not exist and that wage and salary earners in regional Australia do not exist. Mr MCGauran-You don't publish the regional figures.",95
231,Mr BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The fact is that what this government has done to enhance Australians' living standards is every bit as relevant to regional Australia as it is to metropolitan Australia-if anything, more so. It is interest- point. ing that the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) raises this issue about the youth unemployment statistics. The speech we have just heard from the National Party spokesman is a clear illustration of the way in which those youth unemployment statistics are abused. He said that in certain regions two-thirds of young people in that age group are out of work. The statistics do not show any such thing and you know that. The reality is that, as a result of this government's efforts, participation rates in secondary-tertiary education have increased out of sight. The fact is that most people in the 15to 19-year-old age group are not in the labour market; they are in the education and training system, as they should be. The figures quoted are of those who remain in the labour market, who are a distinct minority. Mr MCGauran-Not to be worried about.",96
232,Mr BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, nobody is suggesting that for a minute. But what we are saying is that you have to interpret these statistics correctly. What we are talking about is that, in the 15to 19-year-old age group, around about nine per cent-obviously far too high still, and nobody disputes that for a minuteare out of work, actively seeking work. All these figures you quote fail to take into account that basic point: in interpreting these statistics, the great bulk of young people are appropriately in the education and training system. The fact is that what this government has done to enhance Australians' living standards is every bit as relevant to regional Australia as it is to metropolitan Australia-if anything, more so. The government's economic policies have centred on making Australia a more competitive nation. Which industries are the beneficiaries of that? The most competitive ones, of course, which are mining, agriculture, downstream processing and tourism, among others. Where are they primarily located? In regional Australia. The government's social policies have ensured that the benefits of the economic growth generated by these economic policies have been equitably distributed. Doesn't regional Australia benefit from that? Mr Anderson-They haven't; that's the",96
233,Mr BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I just made the point that, if anything, in terms of employment growth, regional Australia has done substantially better in proportionate terms than metropolitan Australia. Don't the pensioners in regional Australia benefit from the 12 per cent real increase in the value of the pension when measured against the consumer price index? Of course they do. I have not had time to check the figures, but I imagine that pensioners are over-represented in non-metropolitan Australia, given the relative attractiveness of the non-metropolitan lifestyle to many older people. That means that our policies of increased adequacy and financial security for pensioners benefit regional Australia more widely. Don't the low income families in regional Australia benefit from the approximate doubling in the real value of additional family payments and their extension to low income working families under this government or the introduction of parenting allowance this year? Of course they do. Self-employed and small business families earning low incomes are eligible for these payments. But you never hear the National Party talking about that. Won't the mothers in regional Australia benefit from the maternity allowance to be introduced next February? Of course they will. Don't families in regional Australia benefit from Medicare? Of course they do. Don't families in regional Australia benefit from expanded child-care assistance; won't they benefit in retirement from expanded superannuation provisions; don't families in regional Australia benefit from expanded education participation? Of course they do. If I recall some data from my previous portfolio accurately, education participation has increased more rapidly for those from regional Australia. In education, as in employpeople ment, a disproportionate-if anything-share of benefits have gone to regional Australia. For example, I recall introducing a higher education equity strategy in my previous portfolio, one which explicitly focused on raising participation rates of people from regional Australia. You have to take all these things into account if you are going to talk about living standards. This is as true of non-metropolitan Australia as it is true of metropolitan Australpayment. is Of course most of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's $930 million in this year's budget goes to nonmetropolitan Australia. But the National Party never welcomes that. The fact is that this government governs for all Australians. I know that it is a matter of great embarrassment to the National Party that we hold more seats in regional Australia than it holds. The very foundation of the Australian Labor Party straddles both regional Australia, most famously, Barcaldine in Queensland, and metropolitan Australia, particularly Balmain in my own electorate. We remain the largest political party in non-metropolitan Australia. That is because we regard Australia as one nation. Compare this with the opposition, who talk a lot about inequality but whose only policy is wage flexibility-which we know is code for wage cuts. We know that this means: accept the contract or get the sack. Who does this threaten most? People who have nowhere else to go. Workers in non-metropolitan Australia are the most vulnerable to these policies. But we do recognise that regional Australia has particular needs and particular circumstances. My own department, the Department of Social Security, for example, has a comprehensive access and equity strategy in place to ensure that all Australians who are entitled to social security payments do in fact receive them, regardless of where they live. We now have 216 regional offices of the Department of Social Security around Australia, 66 smaller offices mostly in regional areas, and nearly 400 visiting services, to ensure that in small towns can access the department. Teleservice centres mean that the department is contactable by telephone from anywhere in Australia for the cost of a local call. We have a network of field officers and community agents particularly servicing Aboriginal Australians. Most recently, of course, we have introduced the drought relief payment. Some 10,400 farm families experiencing exceptional drought circumstances are receiving this It has paid jobsearch allowance rates but does not have an activity test requirement, and the value of the farm asset is exempt from the income test. The National Party do not quote the drought relief payment because it is something they would never had the wit or the wisdom to introduce. This is because it is targeted on those most in need: farmers earning no income or, for that matter, making large losses. The National Party has never been in favour of that. Unlike National Party drought policies it is a cash transfer and so does not provide windfall gains to particular people or distort the pattern of rural prices and production. It is an efficient targeted instrument for helping those in most desperate need. An amount of $82 million was provided to these farmers last financial year. A further $36 million was provided in the first two months of this financial year. This will continue for as long as it is needed for up to six months after the drought declarations are lifted. It is part of a broader drought strategy, expected to cost some $770 million over four years. This is the sort of thing that we are doing for the people for whom you say we have no concern. But government policies for regional Australia do not stop there. In particular, Working Nation allocated $150 million over four years to the regional economic development program. Just to take one example from many, it was this government that provided nonmetropolitan Australians with the same choice of television broadcasting channels as exists in the capital cities. The fact is that the Labor government is interested in developing regional Australia. We are interested in economic development, we are interested in social development and we are interested in ecologically sustainable development. The National Party is interested only in feeding prejudices for the purpose of winning votes. I would just make this point: of course, the premise of this MPI is false. Early in the debate, among the many falsehoods in his speech, the National Party spokesman made this assertion: the poor have got poorer and have become more numerous under this government. Mr Anderson-Certainly more numerous in the bush.",96
234,Mr BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"These are both demonstrably false propositions which it has traipsed out. Most of these assessments are done on an analyses which are based on the so-called Henderson poverty line, of which Ann Harding, whose paper was quoted the other day, is a strong critic. The fact is that the Henderson poverty line since 1983 has risen 21 per cent in real terms-that is to say, in excess of the inflation rate. It has not stayed static. Ann Harding, in the paper that was quoted earlier, acknowledges that this has the effect of inflating the numbers in poverty. In the United States they have a poverty line which is indexed to prices; in other words, it stays constant in real terms. In contrast to the United States, which has shown an increase in poverty, with a poverty line increased just to maintain it in real terms, if you do that exercise here under this government, you show a substantial decline of the order of around about 30 per cent in the numbers shown to be in poverty. These poverty statistics and these international statistics have to take account of the different conventions and the different methodologies employed in different countries. On any realistic or reasonable assessment, this government has improved substantially the circumstances of people in this country who are the worse off. This is not just people dependent totally on social security payments; this is low wage work working families. If you convert the introduction of additional family payment for low wage working families, which is a measure that this government introduced, taking into account that that is a tax free payment, and consider what the gross wage equivalent of that would be for a family with two children, for example, it is the equivalent of a gross wage increase of $125 a week. That is the sort of thing that this government has done for low income Australians in both the metropolitan areas and the regional areas of Australia.",98
235,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I must say that I was disappointed by the monologue of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), which amounted, really, to a pious justification, or an attempt at justification, of the rather dreadful situation in this country. The minister seemed to operate on the basis that, if you repeat an untruth often enough, some people will ultimately believe it. Mr Deputy Speaker, listen to these words: Its struggle has always been on behalf of the weak, against the strong for the poor, for those who have never had a chance as against those whose privileged positions have enabled them to prosper even though millions suffer. Whose words were they? They were the the words of Prime Minister Curtin, policy speech on 28 August 1940. The Labor Party has forgotten those words because in the 1995 of today many millions of Australians continue to suffer. Yesterday was the International Day of Poverty. Of course, that gave us the opporgovernment tunity in this country to highlight our very real poverty problem right here in our own backyard. The government, and the minister in particular, should hang their heads in shame on their appalling track record in increasing inequality between rich and over the last decade. Real wages have fallen in the last 12 years; the cost of a mortgage has increased by 50 per cent; and unemploywill ment remains at a record high, with youth unemployment running at least at 28 per cent-and, indeed, very much higher in many other specific parts of the country. Prime Minister Hawke in his policy speech in 1987 said: . . . by 1990, no Australian child need live poverty ... What a sick joke to be perpetrated at the expense of the Australian people. This government-former Prime Ministers, current ministers and current members-are prepared to say absolutely anything at election time in an endeavour to crawl back into government. It has been estimated that 1.9 million Australians, or 11 per cent entire population, are currently in poverty, and 592,000 of them are children aged up 14 years. Prime Minister Hawke said in that no child need be in poverty by 1990. Yet here we are in 1995, five years later, and have almost 600,000 Australian children up to the age of 14 years in poverty. My own home state of Queensland is the most povertyhad stricken state in Australia, with 350,000 people living in poverty. It is interesting to note also that coalition members-members of the Liberal and Naneighbourhoods tional parties-represent the poorest electorthe ates in Australia. My electorate of Fisher one of the poorest electorates in Australia. The minister has come into this place and has read out a whole set of statistics with a view to mislead us, with a view to persuade us situation is other than the reality which from his we face every day of the year. More than one-quarter of children and elderly people in Queensland live in poverty. Nearly one-quarter of young people under the age of 25 live in poverty. So much for this government which claims that it has been the of the underprivileged. So much for this government which, in its 13 years in office, has simply masqueraded around as the champion of the underprivileged. What a con! This con will be exposed once and for all at the federal election, whenever it is held. poor Whether it is held on 9 December, as has been tipped, or whether it is held in February or March next year, the government's failures be exposed once and for all. The government claims to be interested in sole parents, but in Queensland two out of every three sole parents live below the poverty line. The average weekly disposable income is lower in Queensland than in any other place in the country. The national in situation is also appalling. Since Labor came to office, the earning of the bottom 10 per cent of income earners has declined in real terms; yet the earnings of the highest 10 per cent of workers has increased by 17 per cent. We have repeated those figures in this place over and over again. The government has not come up with any satisfactory answer, and people are really seeing through this governof our ment as the fraud that it is. The OECD surveyed some 12 countries and to only three countries-Australia, the US and 1987 Canada-experienced a real decline in the earnings of the least well paid 10 per cent of we workers in the last decade. Let us compare the situation here with the situation in the United Kingdom, where people in that group increases of some 11 per cent. There has been a fall in real household incomes in 70 per cent of neighbourhoods and a real increase in income in only 30 per cent of in Australia. The minister has hide to say that things are better. The is Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says that things will never get better than they are at the moment. Put in plain English, recent research indicates that average household incomes in that the bottom five per cent of neighbourhoods have fallen by more than $7,500 in real terms, while the top five per cent of neighbourhoods have increased their incomes by more than $12,000 on average. The Prime Minister agrees now that the gap between the rich and the poor has widened, but he claims that the recession is over and that we are now in a brave new world. Does the Prime Minister-the person who likes the French clocks, the person who likes the Italian suits-have any compassion at all for people on the poverty line struggling to make ends meet; the people Prime Minister Curtin sought to support in 1940? The simple fact is that this government is a government which has lost contact with its origins. It is a government of the quick dollar; a government of the slick deal. It is no longer the government of the underprivileged, and traditional Labor people are deserting this government. In fact, 52 per cent of blue-collar workers have now deserted this government. That is a matter of concern for you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, representing the electorate Scullin, because 52 per cent of blue-collar workers will not have anything to do with this government-the government of big business and not the government of the little Australian. The government has deserted Labor's traditions of equality and is adopting the view that the widening gap between the haves and the have-nots does not matter. The Keating government, of course, is wrong. It is most important that we have social cohesion and equality in this country. The coalition, upon election to office, will seek to ensure that the disparities which presently exist are reduced. It is obvious that Australians are not better off under this Labor government. The government always talks about the social wage, but the government's most heralded social wage or so-called safety net is ineffectual for many Aussie battlers. Under Labor the education of children has taken a battering. In 1980, 48 per cent of students from lower income households who completed year 12 went on to higher education, but by 1989 the figure had fallen to 35 per cent. Do not be fooled by the government's false attempts to explain away these grim facts with the comments made by the minister. The government continues to fudge figures in the hope that it will continue to confuse the Australian people. I believe the government will stand condemned at the next election. The Minister for Social Security claimed that the federal social wage is $1,774 for every Australian and that this has increased by more than $700 since 1983. This figure is arrived at by adding all federal spending on health, education, housing and child care and dividing that by the number in the population. Again, this is another clever play with figures. It is obvious that, with the increase in the Australian population, the minister is misleading the Australian people. The simple fact of the matter is that this so-called federal social wage is not benefiting the people whom the government claims it is benefiting. It is also obvious that 40 per cent of the lowest income earners receive only 35 per of cent of the social wage, while 40 per cent of the highest income earners receive 46 per cent of the social wage. So we have a situation where the government has endeavoured to confuse the Australian people yet again. Don Russell, the current Australian Ambassador to the United States, has said that he wants to come back here to ensure we do not create in Australia the kind of underclass they currently have in the United States. Everyone agrees that the ambassador's comments are totally out of order for a diplomatic representative of Australia, but the simple fact of the matter is that we already have the working poor in Australia. One has to go no further than today's Australian to read about this. It cites the case of someone working on a single wage and actually earning $200 less than he would be ea..'11ing if he was receiving the dole. That is a matter that should appal every reasonable Australian. This government has failed to provide job security. We have heard the statistics about youth unemployment in region/,tl areas. The minister has endeavoured to hide the real facts by confusing the matter of training and education with unemployment and in doing so hopes the terrible statistics will somehow be improved. The people of Australia will not be fooled by that any more than they have been fooled by so many other comments of the minister. I believe that, if one looked at the principles that the Labor Party has historically stood for and one looked at the inequality in this nation at the moment, one would see that this Labor Party is no longer the Labor Party of the underprivileged and no longer the Labor Party of the battler.

237,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You want to leave because you do not want to hear what I have to say. I have never heard such blarney as I did in the contributions of the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) and the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). They made extraordinary claims which bear no relation to what is going on in this community. I will just talk about the policy sclerosis which struck the Liberal and National parties when in government before 1983. Which government had the gumption to reform many of the primary industries which these National Party members supposedly represent? Was it the Liberal Party and National Party coalition? Not on your nelly. Was it the Labor Party? It was. What are some of the industries in the primary sector that have been addressed by the Labor Party? They include the wool industry, the dairy industry, the meat industry, the sugar industry and the horticultural industry-including fruit, vegetables, vineyards and tobacco, just to name a few-plus we have created an aquaculture industry. We do not get any credit for that from the opposition. I heard a spokesman for the dairy industry on Good Morning Australia recently. He said that, whilst a lot of people have gone out of the dairy industry because of the industry's restructuring, its productivity has increased tremendously. I forget the exact figures, but the spokesman said that the industry now has less than half the number of producers, yet they are producing five or 10 per cent more dairy products. Is that a successful policy drive by this government? This industry has become more competitive, by its own admission. Who has achieved this? The Labor government-not the coalition. Which government had the wit and wisdom to introduce a national landcare program? Was it the coalition when they were in office? No, it was the Labor Party in office. How many Landcare groups are there around Australia currently? There are 2,200 active Landcare groups. How much money per annum is being spent on these Landcare groups, which are supported by primary producers throughout Australia? It is $150 million. Was that an initiative of the coalition when they were in government? Did they seek to reform the way in which people treat the land in this country? Did they look at sustainable economic development in a proper sense? Did they look at micro-economic reform when they were in government? No, they did not. They suffered from the same policy sclerosis that they are suffering from now. A number of statistics have been bandied around here this afternoon, some of which relate to unemployment. But I want to go to some figures referred to by the member for Fisher. He talked about household disposal income. Let me make it very clear for all to understand: full-time adult average weekly earnings have increased by 7.2 per cent between June 1983 and June 1995; real household disposal income has increased over that same period by 41.8 per cent; and real household disposal income per capita has increased by 20.9 per cent, almost 21 per cent. We are getting this tirade from the opposition about Australians being worse off as a result of the actions of the Labor government. In fact, they are measurably better off as a result of the deliberate policy determinations made by this government. I will go to some other facts which have implications for what is being said. The previous speaker, the member for Fisher, talked about the social wage. Let's make it very clear: the social wage includes expenditure on health, education, housing and child care. Under a coalition government, of which the present Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, was Treasurer, between 1970-78 and 1982-83 the change in the real value of the Commonwealth social wage per person was a reduction of 17.5 per cent. That is, there was a 17.5 per cent fall in the social wage under the previous coalition government. Since Labor has been in power, since 198283, the social wage has gone up by 73 per cent. Yet the opposition still has the gallwith the National Party supposedly representing regional Australia-to come in here and expect us to believe the nonsense they are perpetrating, that somehow or other Australians are worse off under Labor. Nothing could be further from the truth. I make the point that the National Party and, indeed, the Liberal Party purport to represent the inter-sts of business. One other area which has been reformed under Labor is the tax system. Let us just have a look at a couple of figures which demonstrate yet again why Australians, wherever they are-rural, regional or metropolitan Australia-are measurably better off under Labor than they have ever been, certainly a lot better off they were under the previous coalition government, and a lot better off than they ever be under a government administered by the opposition. One interesting figure is the amount of money the government spends for its own purposes. Government revenue as a proportion of GDP under the Howard government in 1982-83 was 26 per cent. Under the current government that figure is 25.3 per cent. We are spending less of our income as a proportion of GDP. Government outlays as a percentage of GDP when Mr Howard was the Treasurer were 28.6 per cent. Under this government, this year, they are 25.1 per cent. That is just another example. One of the interesting issues in relation to the ability of business to get on, to do its job and be competitive, and to families surviving, is income tax. What is the comparison between the rate of income tax under the opposition when it was in power and the rate of income tax now being experienced by Australians wherever they might live? Top marginal tax rates under Mr Howard were 60 per cent. They are now 47 per cent. The bottom marginal tax rate under Mr Howard was 30 per cent. It is now 20 per cent. The company tax rate under Mr Howard was 46 per cent. Under this government it is 36 per cent. What other points of comparison do we need to demonstrate how measurably better off Australians are, wherever they might be, than they were under a Howard coalition. And how much better off are they than they would have been had, God forgive us, the coalition been in government during the 1980s and early 1990s. We have heard these arguments about regional economic development. The point that was made, properly, by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) was that the employment rate has grown faster in nonmetropolitan Australia than in metropolitan Australia. I will give you a few examples, Mr Deputy Speaker, of unemployment in areas represented by National Party members. The leader of the debate for the opposition this afternoon was the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). In June 1994, unemployment than in the DEET region of Moree, which is in Gwydir, was 12.9 per cent. In June of 1995, will the figure was 8.9 per cent, a reduction of four per cent in that member's electorate In Taree, in the electorate of the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), the unemployment rate in June of 1994 was 15.3 per cent. It has dropped by 5.2 per cent in the last 12 months. We saw the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) in here this afternoon. In his electorate, the unemployment rate in June 1994 was 14.4 per cent. The unemployment rate in June 1995 was 7.9 per cent, a fall of 6.5 per cent. These are the people who are trying to tell us that, somehow or other, people in the bush, in regional Australia, are worse off under a Labor government and that things are getting worse. Things are getting measurably better. Indeed, the policies of the government have been supported by our opponents. Members of the National Party have given high praise to the regional economic initiatives put in place by this government, especially in relation to employment. ",101
238,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Of course they should. It is worth pointing out that one of the most significant initiatives undertaken by the Department of Employment, Education and Training has been the development of area consultative committees, which represent combined industry, union, community and government partnerships to deal with local employment and training issues. National Party members have given high praise to these initiatives. They have said to the government, 'We want you to do more in our electorates because what you are doing is good for our electorates and good for regional Australia.' Yet the opposition, this afternoon in this House, are trying to argue that somehow or other Australians are worse off in regional Australia than they ought to be or than they would be under a coalition government. Nothing could be further from the truth. That is clearly and amply demonstrated by the statistics which are available for all to in public documents-absolutely distorted in the way the opposition have spoken about them. Those statistics clearly demonstrate that the argument put by the opposition in this matter of public importance this afternoon is completely fallacious.

239,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"In introducing the government's amendments to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) really gave the game away when attempting to justify them. This is a government which has made a deal at the expense of students. The government and the universities appear to have agreed that there will be additional places if today's students cough up the money. I do not need to remind the House that this government constantly tells us that it is opposed to up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students. This is the government that introduced the HECS scheme and has relentlessly boosted the level of HECS. This is the third time the government has proposed to increase the rate of HECS repayments. This government, despite the minister's disclaimers in his speech, has winked for a long time at the indisputable fact that Australian undergraduates are being charged up-front fees through the back door. Australian undergraduates are paying for courses not for credit, and when they pass those courses are being credited for them. It is a way of enabling them to get into the system. The government claims that it is unable to establish the validity of these claims. If that is so, then its see information sources about the higher education system are very poor. The coalition has no objection to the particular amendments which have been put forward. They were foreshadowed in the second reading speech-they were not clearly foreshadowed as amendments, I might saywhich introduced the bill. The point was foreshadowed and we do not object to that. What we do object to is the hypocrisy of this government in saying that it is unable to fund these additional places unless the students themselves cough up the money. That is blackmail against today's students. It is totally unjustified. When the Senate decides, as I believe it will, to support the coalition's amendments to this legislation, I challenge the minister to make it clear that the government places so little weight on access to the university system that it is prepared to take places away from Victoria and South Australia. If the government does that and decides that it will cut places out of the system, that will not be a result of the decisions of the coalition. It will not be a result of the decisions of the Senate. It will flow directly from the government's own priorities. What is clear is that these places are the lowest possible priority of the government. The minister feels free to spend tens of millions of dollars out of the national priorities reserve scheme, which is really the ministerial slush fund, yet he threatens students with the loss of places. This is contemptible. It will be noted by students around Australia and I have no doubt that it will be resolutely and absolutely rejected by them. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to.

The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3), which was introduced in this place on 29 June of this year, makes a range of amendments including changes affecting foreign controlled companies; changes affecting dividends paid out of capital accounts, which were announced in this year's budget; extending the accelerated depreciation of ships to 30 June 2002; a number of changes to the collection of tax; reducing the twice monthly remitter threshold from $5 million to $1 million as announced in this year's budget; increasing the infrastructure borrowings rebate to 36 per cent in line with the company tax and changes to the superannuation guarantee system allowing employees to elect that employers do not make superannuation guarantee contributions and by allowing the notional earnings base to be used to calculate superannuation contributions.

The Australian controllers of a controlled foreign company are not taxed on that part of the controlled foreign company's tainted income-that is, income including passive and certain other business income which is less than five per cent of its total income which passes the active income test. The commissioner may make adjustments reflecting arms-length values when determining a controlled foreign company's attributable income but it has not been clear whether the adjustment affects the active income test. A lack of power to make adjustment to amounts used in determining the active income test may result in a CFC satisfying the test where it should have failed. This bill seeks to clarify that where CFCs have entered non-arms-Iength transactions with related parties the commissioner is allowed to make adjustments reflecting armslength values to determine whether a CFC has passed the active income test. Aspects of this particular part of the bill have been raised with the opposition, in particular by the Corporate Tax Association. We are aware from comments made through the Corporate Tax Association that there is more than one company group adversely affected and the legislation would have produced inequitable tax consequences if it had been enacted in the form of the bill. Of particular concern is the aspect that the application of the amendment incorporated in the bill is to apply for statutory accounting periods ending after 30 June 1995. For a CFC with a statutory accounting period ending after that date, the amendment is therefore applicable as from the beginning of that particular statutory accounting period and therefore has retrospective application. I understand an amendment will be moved in relation to that matter and the opposition will be supporting that particular amendment. The second aspect of the bill that I wish to turn to relates to dividends paid out of capital accounts. The current position is t-at all dividends received by resident public companies from resident companies and franked or grouped company dividends received by resident private companies from resident companies are free from tax as a result of the intercorporate dividend rebate. Certain distributions debited to a company's share capital or share premium account or asset revaluation reserve are characterised as dividends. The result is that these distributions qualify for rebate and effectively give tax redistributions to corporate shareholders and pass on franking credits to shareholders ordinarily unable to access them. The bill disqualifies dividends that are debited or paid from amounts transferred from, first, share capital accounts, secondly, share premium accounts or, thirdly, asset revaluation reserves from being rebatable or frankable dividends. Share premium accounts include share premium accounts tainted by the inclusion of amounts other than share premiums or amounts which cannot be identified as share premiums in the company's books and which do not therefore satisfy the section 6 definition of 'share premium account'. As a consequence of the introduction of the new measures, most of the rebatable dividend adjustment provisions in the legislation have become redundant and are being repealed. The amendments will apply to dividends paid after 7.30 p.m. on 9 May 1995 unless they were declared prior to that time. Dividends from amounts transferred before 9 May from a share capital or share premium account or asset revaluation reserve are not subject to the amendments nor are dividends paid under certain transitional arrangements. These measures may have, we believe, some unintended consequences and the Insurance Council, in particular, has argued that the legislation could have the effect of preventing Australian companies from franking dividends paid from the ordinary retained earnings where movements occurred to and from the company's asset revaluation reserves as part of their ordinary business. I understand that the government is proposing certain amendments in relation to this provision in particular. What the Insurance Council pointed out is that there is a serious technical deficiency in the current drafting of part of the bill in so far as it relates to rebatable and frankable dividends. The council believes that the legislation, as currently drafted prior to any amendment by the government, could have the effect of preventing Australian companies from franking dividends paid from ordinary retained earnthe ings where movements occurred to and from the company's asset revaluation reserves as part of their ordinary business activity. The impact of this legislation, if enacted in the form that has been presented, could be disastrous for many Australian companies and the anomaly is clearly something-which the Insurance Council, in particular, believes and we would concur with it-that was never intended at the time the proposals were announced in the federal budget on 9 May. I will not take the time of the House to go into the technical detail that has been raised by the Insurance Council of Australia, as I understand this is the subject of the amendments which will be moved in the committee stage on behalf of the government. The third area which I wish to address in relation to this somewhat technical legislation relates to the notional earnings base of the superannuation guarantee charge. Currently, employers can use their pre-21 August 1991 employee earnings base if they continue to contribute to the same fund and under the same law award arrangement or schemes as for an employee for whom they were contributing immediately before 21 August 1991. If they restructure, they generally will have to contribute under the ordinary time earnings base. The bill amends the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to extend the use ofpre-21 August 1991 employee earnings bases if employers restructure their superannuation funds. An employer will be allowed to keep pre-21 August 1991 earnings bases if the employer contributes under the same law award arrangement or scheme to, first, a new fund under the same earnings base as the original fund if employees transfer between the funds and receive substantially the same or improved rights to benefits; secondly, an existing fund in relation to an employee of a former employer who transfers to the fund from the former employer's fund because of a business acquisition if the base was used in the former employer's fund; or, thirdly, a former employers fund for employees who transfer to the new employer because of a business acquisition. The amendments affect the calculation of the superannuation guarantee charge from 1 July 1995 where qualifying restructures occur after 28 June 1994. The effect is that employers reorganising funds after the announcement need not lose an existing employee earnings base for contributions made for contribution periods after 1 July 1995. Employers who restructured after the statement by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 28 June 1994, which was when this measure was announced, but before 1 July 1995 will have changed to the ordinary time earnings base from the time of restructure. On 1 July 1995 they will be able to revert to the pre-21 August 1991 earnings base to which they previously contributtd. The amendment affects an employer's contributions only from 1 July 1995 so that contributions already made by employers during 1994-95 and contributions due for that year will not be reduced. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia has raised a particular concern in relation to the notional earnings base. ASFA believes that the changes should be effective from the commencement of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 and should cover all employer and/or fund reconstructions irrespective of the date of those reconstructions. The problem which ASFA points to refers to the definition of earnings base in the superannuation guarantee legislation in circumstances where there has been a reconstruction. Paragraph 3.3 of the Treasurer's discussion paper, issued on 4 December 1991, stated that the earnings base for superannuation guarantee contributions would be that set out in the governing rules of the scheme or in an award, provided that, firstly, the scheme was in existence on 20 August 1991 or, secondly, the scheme was not in existence on 20 August 1991 but is a successor to a scheme that was in existence on 20 August 1991 and the earnings base used is no narrower than that used by the original scheme. When the superannuation guarantee legislation was enacted in 1992 no provision was made for these successor funds circumstances. The current bill seeks to address this situation, but only from 1 January 1995. I should indicate that in their representations ASFA is not seeking the retrospective operation of the amendments in order to allow employers to claim refunds from funds. If considered necessary, a provision to prescribe such claims could be included in the legislation. My question in relation to this particular matter-the notional earnings base as it relates to the superannuation guarantee charge-is one which has been effectively raised: why shouldn't the changes be effective from the commencement of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act and cover all employer and/or fund reconstructions, irrespective of the date of those reconstructions? I hope that when the Treasurer or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) come to speak again in this particular debate they could give some indication to the House and to the coalition regarding that particular matter because it does seem to be an anomaly in the way in which the provisions of this bill have been drafted. Apart from those matters, there are a number of other technical and mechanical aspects of this bill which I will not detain the time of the House this evening by going into in great detail, but those three matters are matters on which the opposition, whilst it does not oppose the legislation, would seek some clarification. In relation to the first matter that I mentioned, we will be supporting an amendment to change the actual date which is set out in the bill itself.",104
243,Mr HAVILAND,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Macarthur) (5.32 p.m.)I am pleased to support the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1995. I was wondering whether, given that the previous speaker was the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), an amendment had been moved to bring back the GST. I guess we will have to wait and find out when we take the vote. This bill covers quite a number of areas of taxation issues. It covers issues such as foreign income, rebatable and frankable dividends, bankruptcy and losses, reduction of PAYE early remittance threshold, group certificates and other PAYE provisions and superannuation guarantee matters. One of the things that I have come to learn in the time. I have been here is how complex and big our tax act is. It covers some 5,000 pages at last count. In my first few months here, after I was appointed to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, at the tail end of the taxation inquiry, I learnt that the taxation law was very complex. People around the room in that PAC inquiry all agreed that something had to be done. I know now that there is a lot of work being done in the Australian Taxation Office on simplifying the tax act. In the meantime, we have to deal with the current situation and we have a number of these amendments which seem to come before the House and the Senate every year. The taxation law is a bit like social security provisions-the more you get into it and the more you look at different provisions, the more complex it seems. It does not matter what governments try to do, there always seems to be a complication and anomaly that can throw up an injustice, like something that will affect somebody differently from somebody else. We never seem to be able to get the balance quite right in terms of fairness and equity on the one hand and simplicity on the other hand without affecting somebody somewhere along the line. I know that there is a lot of work going on and there is a project called the taxation law improvement project under way at the moment. I guess it was partly because of the desire for simplicity-at least that was one of the attractions-that the opposition decided to promote a consumption tax, a goods and services tax, before the last election. One of the arguments in favour of the consumption tax was that it was simpler and everyone would pay the same amount of 15 per cent on all goods and services, except food. That was supposed to be simpler and therefore easier to collect. That was one of the great attractions put forward for it. Even though I do not agree with a consumption tax and never have, there are a lot of people, including some in the tax office, who argue quite genuinely that they believe that that is an attraction of a consumption tax and that we will eventually have one. I hope we never do because I believe it is an inequitable tax and a regressive tax. I do know that some of my friends and people in the community genuinely believe that, because of this supposed simplicity and equality-although it is not really, of course-with everyone paying the same flat right of consumption tax, it is therefore simpler and more easy to administer and harder to avoid. I do not happen to believe that. I think that it has been pointed out that even a GST is not foolproof or avoidance proof and there could still be a black economy associated with a consumption tax. I guess that was one of the arguments put forward-the need to simplify the tax legislation. Mr Andrews-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. If we were debating a consumption tax, the honourable member's remarks would be relevant. But, given that there is no such proposal in this bill and the title of this bill is quite clearly defined and not open to all sorts of related purposes, I would ask you to bring the honourable member back to the point of the bill before the House.",107
244,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I suggest that the honourable member for Macarthur adhere to the point of the legislation.,108
245,Mr HAVILAND,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"With respect, this is a wide ranging bill on a number of issues relating to tax, and I was covering them in a broad ranging fashion, as is the custom on many bills in this House. I have already said that there is a need for simplification, but tax is also a very emotional issue. Unfortunately, in this country it seems to be fashionable to talk about reducing tax. We are, as we quite often hear, the second lowest taxed country in the OECD. We were the lowest taxed country; I believe Turkey is now apparently lower taxed than we are, because of some fiddling of the figures or whatever. So now we are the second lowest taxed country in the OECD. Unfortunately, some people in the government seem to think that is a badge of honour and we should boast about that. I believe that it is a bit of a lem and people in the community are increasingly seeing it, if they are honest, as a problem because the revenue is important. People do expect a certain level of service and quality of services from governments at all levels. If we are going to have that service, people do have to face up to the situation that people have to pay tax and the revenue has to be there. It has to be fair and equitable, of course. But to suggest that we pay too much tax, as a lot of people do, particularly on the other side of the House and in the business community, et cetera, is not only dishonest but unfair and damaging to the Australian economy and the fabric of society. Unfortunately, because of the 'greed is good' mentality, particularly of the opposition, we have this situation where expectations are raised. Any suggestion that we pay more tax or that individuals pay more tax is treated with horror and we have all sorts of people running for cover, saying, 'We are a lower taxing party than you are,' et cetera. I believe that is an undesirable feature of current Australian politics. We really do need to face up to the fact that people have to pay tax and they should pay the tax that is due. That does not mean that ordinary workersPA YE taxpayers-should necessarily pay more tax. One of the biggest problems is compliance and the avoidance industry, where companies or people on better incomes are able to minimise tax through all sorts of clever accountants and tax minimisation schemes. Of course, one obvious one that I have come across in the last few weeks is the move away from PA YE towards the PPS scheme. We have a number of examples, particularly in the construction industry, where workers are forming themselves into companies or becoming contractors and, therefore, somehow or other qualifying to be PPS taxpayers rather than PA YE taxpayers. That is totally against the spirit of taxation laws, and I understand that that is being looked at by the tax office. It cannot come too soon as far as I am concerned. Not only is this an organised attempt to supposedly bring more flexibility into industrial relations, thereby basically probsmashing industrial relations and smashing trade unionism by everyone becoming a contractor-which would suit the opposition's industrial relations policies perfectly-but also this is potentially eroding the revenue in a big way. That is one area that I will certainly be keeping an eye on in terms of tax policy to make sure that that does not continue and that people do as they are supposed to do-pay the tax that they are obliged to pay under the PA YE system, whether or not they want to call themselves contractors or subcontractors. I have talked to a few friends recently, including people that I know in the taxation area, about the idea of making the tax system simpler. Most PAYE taxpayers probably get a small refund every year. They get their Tax Pack every year, and hopefully the Tax Pack is correct and they can get around all the supposed errors in it. It used to be called Form S. It possibly still is called that. I have not done my tax this year yet. I should not admit that, should I? I have only about two weeks to go. The ordinary battlers, the PA YE taxpayers who earn an ordinary income, fill in their tax forms and they might get a small refund-somewhere between $100 or up to $1,000 a year, if they are lucky. It seems to me that the tax system is administered in a rather expensive way. A good idea might be to bring about, on a properly costed basis, a situation where ordinary taxpayers who earn only wageswho do not have other complications which preclude them from filling in a Form S, for example-be given the option of not bothering with a taxation return. By perhaps ticking a box at the beginning of the year on, say, their employment declaration certificate, they might opt out of the taxation system, in the sense that they would not have to bother with a taxation return, and in return they might get $500 or $1,000, whatever is a reasonable rate. I have not costed this, so I do not know. That would probably save the Taxation Office a lot of money. It would save a lot of paper. It would not cost ordinary taxpayers. Of course, you could always opt back into the tax system if you thought you could get more of a refund from filling in the form. But, if they are just average taxpayers who might get a few hundred dollars a year, they could opt out of the system and get more in their pay packets, which would add up to the same amount-an averaged out amount every year-and they would not have to bother with the form. That does not mean that you would have to cut staff in the Taxation Office. It would ensure that the valuable staffing resources in the Taxation Office were directed away from processing thousands and thousands of ordinary PA YE taxpayer forms towards looking at the tougher areas of taxation-getting some of the big fish and making sure that some of the people who make a bit of an industry out of ripping off the tax system and paying as little tax as possible actually pay their taxes. We do not necessarily need to raise tax levels in this country, if only we could get everyone to pay the tax that they should be paying. That has been the major problem. It was exemplified in the late 1970s when the current Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), was Treasurer. We had the famous bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, and a lot of pressure was put on the then government to do something about that when it became public knowledge. The then Treasurer did make some belated measures, and for his reward he got castigated by his own party in Western Australia. We are still seeing the effects of that in the 1990s with some of the internal Liberal Party politics in Western Australia, which are an echo of the bad days of the seventies and eighties. I lived in Western Australia in the 1970s, and I can recall the Liberal Party slogans and stickers that used to be put up at election times by the Liberal Party that 'taxation is theft'. Obviously, the people who run the Liberal Party in Western Australia, the ones who have got the numbers over there, do not think that anyone should pay tax or that it should be voluntary rather than a responsibility. The bottom-of-the-harbour schemes existed in the 1980s, and this government, from 1983 onwards, had to try to plug the hole in the tax system by bringing in various measures. The measures are ongoing, such as the ones in the bill that we are voting on today. Of course, we have problems also in the Senate with taxation issues. It is very difficult when neither party has a majority in the Senate to get agreement on some of these complex areas. That is understandable. Tax is a very complex area, and the sooner we get some simplification as a result of this major project being undertaken in the tax office then the better we will all be. There should be equity and honesty in taxation. There should be an equitable progressive taxation system whereby those who can afford to pay tax most pay the most and there should be relative relief for those on the lower end of the income scale. Our taxation system largely attempts to do that, although perhaps it does not always get it perfectly right. But, as I have said a number of times, it is a very complex system, and we will always find somebody who will say that they are disadvantaged. I guess that's life. The social security system is similar in that respect. What has made it difficult is this 'greed is good' mentality. The same thing happens in other countries. The conservative parties-the opposition in Australia-build up this expectation that we are all paying too much tax, and that makes it very difficult for governments to be responsible in taxation and, at the same time, have policies that ensure their re-election. I agree that at election times people do get a bit carried away with promises and expectations. But what has made it very difficult in this climate which has been created, particularly on the other side of the House, is the suggestion made to people-and suggesting it often enough so that people believe it-that as a community we are somehow paying too much tax. We are not paying too much tax. We need the revenue so that we can provide the community services and social justice that people expect and that Labor governments certainly stand for. It is not an easy thing, but anything that we can do to tighten avoidance and ensure that the revenue base is there but at the same time make it as equitable, fair and simple a system as possible is to be commended. I therefore commend these measures to the House.",108
246,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) was introduced into the House on 29 June this year. It makes nine substantive amendments to our tax laws. The provisions set out to amend several principal acts, including the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 and Bankruptcy Act 1966. The changes in the bill include those affecting controlled foreign companies; dividends paid out of capital accounts, as announced in the 1995 budget; and extending the accelerated depreciation of ships to 30 June 2002. Further, changes are proposed to the method of collecting tax, reducing the price monthly remitter threshold from $5 million to $1 million, as announced in the budget. and increasing the infrastructure borrowings rebat(! to 36 per cent in line with the company tax rate. There are also changes to the super guarantee charge system in regard to allowing employees to elect that members not make SGC contributions under certain circumstances and by allowing the notional earnings base to be used to calculate SGC contributions. As to rebatable and frankable dividends, this bill proposes to amend the income tax laws so that dividends that are debited to share capital, premium accounts or revaluation reserves of a company are disqualified from being rebatable or frankable. The reason the government is taking this kind of action is apparently to stop companies providing tax free distributions to corporate shareholders or transferring franking credits to shareholders by inappropriate means. This particular measure is therefore aimed at limiting any potential tax avoidance. The only problem is that there is ample evidence that the government is yet again trying to crack a walnut with a sledgehammer. There are unintended consequences of the proposal before us which impact on ordinary commercial transactions that are totally lawful. The Insurance Council has had this to say: We believe that the legislation, as currently drafted, could have the effect of preventing Australian companies from franking dividends paid from ordinary retained earnings, where movements have occurred to and from the company's asset revaluation reserves, as part of their ordinary business. The council went on to say: The impact of this legislation, if enacted, could be disastrous for many Australian companies, and the anomaly is clearly something that was never intended at the time the proposals were announced in the federal budget . . . Because the effect of the provisions is to deny a company the ability to frank its dividends, the impact of the deficiencythat is, I think, the deficiency in the bill's wordingcould extend beyond Australia's corporate sector to many thousands of individual and institutional shareholders, in receipt of dividends which a company was unaware could not be franked. The Insurance Council has provided an example to illustrate this anomaly. Where a company owns a building at 30 June 1994 which cost, say, $100,000 to purchase but is now valued at $150,000, the amount to be credited to the revaluation reserve is quite obviously $50,000. There is also a corresponding debit to the asset account. However, by 30 June 1995, where the value of the building has fallen to $100,000 the company will debit the asset revaluation reserve and credit the asset account with the amount of $50,000. This entails a transfer of an amount from a 'disqualifying account', the asset revaluation reserve account, to a 'non-disqualifying account', the asset account. Under section 461 of this bill, as part of the write-down, the company will credit the $50,000 I have mentioned in the example to the notional disqualifying account. If no other events occur, and the company pays a dividend of, say, $200,000 in July 1995, with the full amount being debited to its retained earnings, section 46G(1), as currently drafted, will provide that $50,000 of the dividend so paid will not be rebatable and will not be capable of being franked. Mr John Hodgkinson of the Insurance Council, in describing that particular situation, has said: This situation will not be unusual and is likely to impact on many companies who have amounts moving into and out of asset revaluation reserves, for perfectly legitimate commercial reasons, e.g. complying with accounting standards. He has also made the observation that there is nothing to connect the asset revaluation reserve movements with the payment of a dividend. It is totally ridiculous for a company to be placed in the position of paying a dividend in a proper manner but then finding that dividend cannot be franked or rebated to recipient shareholders. The Taxation Institute of Australia also raises the concern that this legislation will impede legitimate corporate reconstructions. Where this takes the form of the insertion of a holding company between the shareholders and an existing company, companies should not be hindered in undertaking legitimate corporate reorganisations. The unintended consequences of this bill should be addressed. I have been informed that the government has prepared some amendments-and they came to hand late this morning-to address the concerns of the Tax Institute and the Insurance Council. I got them this morning at a quarter past nine. The bill was scheduled to be debated at 10 o'clock. I did not have an explanatory memorandum for those amendments, which go to 21,4 pages. Again, this is an example of the disdain with which the parliament is treated when it considers complex legislation. On the matter of the changes affecting the tainted income of controlled foreign companies-CFCs-there is a retrospective element. The explanatory memorandum states: The amendments will clarify that the Commissioner of Taxation may make adjustments, reflecting arm's length values to amounts used in determining whether a CFC has passed the income test. Without wanting to go into great depth now, because I will do so later in the detailed stages, the problem here is that this amendment will be applied retrospectively for the accounting periods commencing before but ending after June 1995. Therefore this measure is applicable from 1 July 1995 and as a consequence it will in some cases have a retrospective impact on the attributable income of CFCs where their financial year does not conveniently end on 30 June 1995. That is not uncommon, although it is not right either. That is most inequitable. I have constantly made the point that retrospectivity as a rule should be avoided in any legislation and in particular in tax legislation. Retrospectivity is only acceptable to me when it does not create losers but, even then, it should still be avoided. Retrospective tax legislation by this Labor government is far from unusual, as I am sure the House is aware. It has been a tool of Labor and it has not hesitated to use it. However, it is clear that such retrospectivity undermines certainty, credibility and fairness in the tax system. With the constant stream of tax amendment bills coming before this place, as well as the draft rulings from the Australian Taxation Office, it is obvious that the taxpaying community does not need the added uncertainty of retrospective tax changes. There must be community confidence in the certainty of the law--certainty that today's legal act does not tomorrow become the trigger for a penalty or obligation by law created subsequent to that legal act and applied retrospectively. With tax law, taxpayers need to be able to determine their obligations with at least a modicum of certainty. But with retrospective tax legislation not only must taxpayers assess their tax position according to current law but also they need to determine what the intent of the relevant law was at the time it was drafted and passed through the parliament. That is necessary because one day the legislation will be retrospectively amended along certain lines. The problem is that we expect too much from taxpayers and accountants. How can taxpayers be expected to pre-empt what was the real intent of the law with their scarce resources, when parliament and its supporting bureaucracy couldn't get it right in the first place? The parliament, and especially the government, should be accountable for their errors, not taxpayers. Retrospectivity is a denial of natural justice and a repudiation of fairness where it occurs in our tax system. Not only is the tax system almost unintelligible, compliance costs exorbitant and there is no stability in the tax regime, but also retrospectivity there is a serious element of guesswork, in trying to get an understanding of tax law. Stability and certainty in the tax system are key concepts this government simply has not been able to grasp. This bill comes before the House just over 10 years since the government announced its reform of the Australian tax systemotherwise aptly known as RATS. This announcement followed the much heralded 1985 tax summit, you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, where the much supported option C of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was rejected by Bob Hawke in a deal with the ACTU heavies. RATS was supposed to provide a tax system which is simpler, fairer, does not increase the overall tax burden, does not disadvantage welfare recipients, moderates wage pressures, does not stifle investment, growth and jobs, and has widespread community support. Key aspects of Labor's changes included the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax and dividend imputation. Labor might postulate that it has succeeded in meeting its objectives, and quite often it does. However, the reality is they have failed dismally. The overall tax burden has increased. Taken as a percentage of gross domestic product, public sector revenues have increased from 33.4 per cent to 34.4 per cent. Of this, the federal component appears to have fallen, but only because grants to the states have been slashed. Then, of course, when compulsory superannuation is added-because, let us face it, it is a tax on earnings-the overall tax burden has increased. Mr George Megalogenis put it accurately in the Australian of 19 September 1995 when he wrote: The total tax burden on workers is greater now than it was 10 years ago todaythat was on 19 Septemberwhen Paul Keating unveiled his historic tax reform package to slash marginal rates and restore fairness and credibility to the tax system. Mr Megalogenis went on to say: Australians are also paying more in indirect taxes than they would have under the coalition's goods and services tax plan ... How is that? Australians are now also paying with more in indirect taxes than they would have under the coalition's goods and services tax plan. Well, we know Labor always rants about the reduction of the top marginal rate from 60 per cent to 49 per cent, yet Labor still collects more income tax in real terms than the Fraser government ever did. Why is that? Bracket creep is the answer, as it always has been. Many middle income earners are now in the highest tax bracket. Labor's cuts to the marginal tax rates were removed by stealth, as you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker. Anti-tax avoidance and evasion measures have been taken to ludicrous degrees, when the most simple method of limiting avoidance is, and always was, a goods and services tax. A goods and services tax would force many tax dodgers to start declaring their real level of income, thereby allowing the government to get off the back of honest taxpayers. Labor's tax system is definitely not simpler, and it is in no way fairer. Shifting huge wads of the cost of compliance on to employers may be electorally clever but economically it is disastrous. As a partial consequence, the objective of not stifling investment, growth and jobs has been a farcical failure.",110
247,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Mr Nehl)Order! I draw the attention of the gentlemen on my left to standing order 57 and ask that they pay the speaker with the call the courtesy of observing it.,113
248,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Real tax reform, encompassing a GST, or a broad based retail sales tax, would better achieve an increase in national savings, investment and economic growth. As for limiting the negatives for welfare recipients, as claimed a little over 10 years ago by the present Prime Minister, a GST or retail sales tax can be introduced, with welfare recipients receiving compensation, of course. However, the introduction of a GST would be a bonus to those on welfare because it would better provide an environment for them to get out of the welfare poverty trap in so many cases. To put it lightly, this government has totally failed to grasp the real reforms needed to provide a simpler, fairer and more equitable tax system. Of Labor's 10 years of so-called tax reform, the Financial Review of 15 September 1995 had this to say in an editorial: Australia's taxation system stands as probably the most all encompassing symbol of what has been both good and bad about the Labor Party's long period of power at the federal level. In the same way, the tax summit in Canberra 10 years ago epitomises both its initial enthusiasm for reform and its increasing unwillingness to embrace those changes where the electoral equation seemed uncertain. With tax, the upshot is a system which contains a number of intelligent initiativesand they refer to dividend imputation and capital gains taxone notorious fiasco (the FBT) and a huge omission (a consumption tax). Ten years ago, the present Prime Minister saw the merits of a consumption tax, yet in 1993 he actively campaigned against a measure he knew to be for the national good. Because Labor has botched tax reform and made meaningful reforms politically unacceptable, we are now stuck in a time warp, trying to simplify current tax laws. Yet even in this endeavour, Labor is incapable of doing the job properly. The primary goal of tax simplification should be to make the law easier to understand, reduce the cost of compliance and bring logic and rationale into the tax system. In this, Labor has failed. Labor is not prepared to examine policy issues which must be rectified if the tax system is to be simplified. The Financial Review in the editorial which I referred to a moment ago conclud-d by saying: What is needed now, a decade after the tax summit, is not more talking, but rather the will to tackle the major tax issues which remain outstanding. While these include the need for a common sense review of FBT, by far the most important is the need to start laying the public relations groundwork for the eventual introduction of a broadly based consumption tax ... Until this is done there will be little scope for a proper, and long overdue, restructuring of our onerous income tax scales. The editorial in the Australian on that momentous date of 19 September, celebrating 10 years of Labor's failure, said: Tax reform is notoriously difficult to achieve. It always will be difficult, no matter how apparently propitious the moment for introducing reforms might be. But the distortions are getting worse and the pressure to reform will only build. The most obvious target for reform, as the growing number of nations that have adopted it will testify, is in the area of broad-based indirect taxation. We know that a broad based tax system is off the agenda because of the way Labor behaved during the last election. (Time expired)",113
249,Mr THOMSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Wentworth) (6.07 p.m.)I am sorry I was not present to hear the entirety of the remarks by my friend the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) but I did catch the last topic he discussed-a broad based consumption tax. May I say forthwith and with some alacrity that that is not a subject that I intend to touch upon in my remarks this afternoon. I note the presence of my good friend the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) at the table. When I spoke on an FBT cost of compliance bill a couple of sitting weeks ago, I began my remarks by saying it is hard to imagine anything more depressing than a tax bill. I can think of other depressing things around this parliament, such as the salad bar in the members' dining room and the answers that we are sometimes forced to listen to at question time from some of the more narcotically boring members of the government front bench. There are certainly many other equally maudlin prospects but a tax bill is probably about the worse. Our tax system is embodied in the monstrous Income Tax Assessment Act, the first volume of which I have with me this afternoon. It is really now not so much a matter of a grimace of horror but a matter of black humour. It has become so complex and so far beyond the comprehension of ordinary Australians, be they individuals striving to earn income in some field or workers for a large corporation, that resort to expensive and certainly very well qualified advisers is really the only answer these days if you have a problem with the tax office. I believe it is really so complex that perhaps we could say that the tax act itself is one of the chief causes of this country's e-onomic woes. The attitude of the tax office towards this complexity is quite clear: they love it. There is nothing a tax bureaucrat likes more than a good dose of complexity. This was revealed in a startlingly topical article in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald, which contained some comments made by a senior Treasury official, the head of the federal Treasury's tax policy division. He may hot be from the Australian Taxation Office, but he certainly fits the description of a tax bureaucrat. Mr Ken Henry, in defending the complexity of the tax legislation, said, 'Well, that was what was needed to deal with a complex world.' They have no sympathy whatsoever for the ordinary citizen who suffers the burden of this act and the general taxation scheme-whether it be income tax, fringe benefits tax or sales tax. I believe that the complexity of the scheme keeps those bureaucrats safe in their positions of power and authority. If Mr Henry said 'bad luck' when people complained to him about the complexity of the act, then it is quite clear that there is no sign of a move towards a simpler system under this government. There does not even seem to be any sympathy for the prospect of a simpler system. When we debated the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill last month, I pointed out that, in seeking to reduce the cost of compliance and the burden on the public, we are actually adding another 60 pages to the legislation. That legislation was 342 pages long when I was born in 1961. It now exceeds 5,000 pages. Enough said about that. I refer back to Mr Henry's comment that, as life is complex, we have to have a complex tax system. During the debate on the cost of compliance bill, I proposed that, as technology changes and the nature and incidence of an employment and earnings grow more complicated as the years pass, the revenue raising means of a government will have to adapt to these changes. The government is choosing a most mechanical and intrusive approach and is enacting highly technical legislation. In the case of the compliance bill, the legislation imposed a liability on the employer. This will necessarily fetter or restrict an employer's or an individual's ability to produce earnings or a return on the capital that they may invest. The employment opportunities and further investment prospects are likewise restricted. That is the true meaning of the cost of compliance. The cost of compliance of any tax system or any part of a tax system goes beyond the monetary penalty and the opportunity cost to the existing taxpayers. Every legislative act or administrative act of government has an effect on the psychology of investment. I describe it simply as the atmospheric effect. Consideration has been given to the atmospheric effect caused by our tax system in a report by a group called the APEC Capital Markets Working Group, whom a newspaper article describes as 'a group of business and financial market leaders who will lobby the Australian government to strengthen efforts for Australia to become a major financial centre in this region'. It is something that you hear quite a lot about in the government's rhetoric. This group of business and financial market leaders wrote a report which they presumably gave to the government. They pointed out quite clearly that Australia's tax system has a number of competitive disadvantages, including an international reputation for being unsympathetic to regional headquarters, and is considered to be a significant disincentive. There is really no point in saying anything further after hearing those comments from that group. You have to consider the position of the taxpayer-whether it be a corporate taxpayer or an individual-and how that person is treated by the tax office. Only yesterday I had a telephone call in my office from a constituent who was having his first tax audit. It sounded as though he was about to have his first child or his first dip in the sea at Bondi Beach. He was a little bit nervous about how the tax office was going to treat him, and he probably had good reason to be nervous about it. In June, the Australian Financial Review published an article by a former officer of the tax department, Mr Douglas. Mr Douglas is a lawyer who now practises as a partner with one of Sydney's larger law firms. He pointed out that, during his time in the tax office, culture had changed as a result of some rather radical administrative changes. He said that they did not report in a horizontal fashion. The compliance officers, the lawyers within the tax office, are the doves. The hawks are the accountants, the bean counters, who in a rapacious fashion are out to squeeze every last cent from the taxpayer. The lawyers within the tax office take a more measured approach that emphasises the rights of the taxpayers. In the past, the compliance people had their own little section. The other section of the tax office, which dealt with individuals, large corporations, small corporations, rural producers and any other special working groups, would go to see the compliance group-that is, the lawyers-to check their work as they were carrying out audits. In that sense, there was a nice system of checks and balances on them. This was described as the horizontal style of organisation. For some reason, this was changed to a vertical system. The tax office was reorganised so that each section which dealt with large corporations, small corporations, individuals and so forth had their own little in-house compliance officer or officers. They were much smaller in number. This meant that the burden on them to check the work of the hawks, the people carrying out the audits, was so great that they began, through no fault of their own, to fail in their task. Mr Douglas also told me that working in the same physical environment with the compliance officers over in the corner of the office made them feel somehow intimidated when making decisions or giving advice that was adverse to the interests of the hawks. If one of the audit officers came up with a proposal to issue a draft ruling that would be adverse to the interests of the taxpayer and he was very keen to do this, the compliance officer with whom he might go out and have a beer on Friday or with whom he might socialise-like any other Australian office, people who work together occasionally spend time together outside work-might feel a little less inclined to perform his duties in a strict fashion. He may say to the audit officer, 'Look, I think you're going a bit far with the your proposed draft ruling.' He would go soft on it. In that sense, the hawks were getting their way. The reason given for this change in the culture of the tax office was enormous pressure on the tax office's revenue raising activity. That is clearly driven by a very loose fiscal discipline here in Canberra. From the top down, enormous pressure is placed on the tax office to raise as much revenue as possible with no regard to fairness. This reorganisation has given ascendancy to the hawks within the office. There is much to be done after the next election in reforming the way the tax office behaves when it deals with our citizens. No doubt after the election the government of this nation will change and a more sensible approach to this monstrous piece of legislation and its administrative underpinnings will be taken. In speaking to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1995 before us this afternoon, I would like to make a few remarks about the provisions regarding the pay-a.,-youearn tax system and the peculiar proposal for a system of tax vouchers, which is really a cloak for a system of granting the tax office free loans. I would like to also speak about some provisions to do with the superannuation guarantee levy and reiterate a few other things about the absurdity of the tax act. Regarding the PAYE tax system, it seems as though this amendment is just another burden imposed on small and medium businesses. The existing law, as I understand it, says that companies which remit pay-as-youearn tax deductions of under $5 million per month are obliged to remit them once a month. So the cost to their business of making the calculations and the bank charges that they will pay on that occur once a month. Suddenly, this threshold is to be reduced to $1 million. This will of course require many more companies to send in that money twice a month. For some of them, it will go close to nearly doubling the cost of performing that transaction. Again, the explanatory memorandum gives the reason for this. It is all because the government needs another $275 million in the 1995-96 year of income. There you have it-the loose fiscal discipline in Canberra working again to cause a· bigger burden on the poor old innocent taxpayer. The consequences of this grab for more money in this climate are serious. They really should not be underestimated because the prospects for next year, despite the rhetoric from the government front-bench-we have grown used to it and we take little notice of it these days-are looking rather grim .. I point out to the House that the ABS has a relatively new indicator. It is called the composite leading indicator. It is composed of eight different indicators: economic statistics, which have some element of predictive capacity to them, and others that have great bearing on the prospects for Australia's real GDP movements-things like housing finance, the changes in the United States' real GDP and of course real interest rates, which are inverted in the calculation. The ABS put this together and then recalculated the figures going back to 1971. They do it quarterly. The significant thing is that in the June quarter of this year the index suffered its greatest quarterly fall since the June quarter of 1974. For the June quarter of 1995 this composite leading indicator suddenly falls off a cliff, as it does for 1974. If this indicator is a reliable guide to future movements in our own GDP-in the next, say, four quarterswe can say that it is not unreasonable to expect that our real GDP in the second or third quarter next year may be close to even negative. Despite all the rhetoric, if this leading indicator has the predictive capacity that the ABS claims it does-they are a reasonably conservative lot when it comes to describing the power of their statistics-and the indicator has really fallen as much as or a little more than it did in 1974, I would need to be convinced that we are not going to have negative growth about this time next year. Tomorrow morning we have an opportunity to ask questions of the Governor of the Reserve Bank when he makes an appearance before the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration of this House. I look forward to taking the opportunity to ask him what he thinks is the significance of this sudden fall off a cliff. If you look at the elements within it individually, you will see that the movement in real interest rates caused by the bank's hiking of the official discount rate about this time last year has made a large contribution to that. But, generally speaking, I would just like the question answered. Here we are debating another depressing tax bill-a bill which will raise another $275 million for the government in this year of income in an atmosphere which is looking increasingly grim. In this climate, I would describe imposing an extra burden on small and medium businesses as lunacy. I would like to talk a little about the proposed tax voucher system, which I understand is intended to replace the old tax stamp system. This sets up a scheme whereby selfemployed people, or non-employee taxpayers-those brave individuals who are out on their own in the economy trying to earn a dollar",113
250,Mr CADMAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"In decreasing numbers. Mr THOMSONIn decreasing numbers. Never more so than in the marginal seats of this country. These include all those tradesmen who ply their trade in the building industry and who have suffered so grievously during the past year since those official discount rate hikes have pushed the building industry off a cliff. They are the sorts of people whom this new scheme of tax vouchers is aimed at. The scheme says they can trot along to the tax office and purchase a voucher issued by the tax office. This means that purchasers will get a credit against their tax liability when they submit their return at the end of the year. It seems to me that this new system is something of a nonsense because the purchase of these vouchers will not give any relief from provisional tax. Taxpayers would be better off putting the same money into an interest bearing account at a bank. Despite the awful fees and charges that such a depositor would suffer, that would certainly be better than making what is in effect an interest free loan to the gentlemen in the tax office and the lunatics who occupy the front bench of this government. I hope that is not an unparliamentary term.",117
251,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I think it might be. You might just withdraw it. Mr THOMSONI withdraw it for the time being.,117
252,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"No; you will withdraw it. Mr THOMSONI withdraw it absolutely and say the 'misguided gentlemen who occupy the front bench of the government'. What is the point, then, of setting up a scheme whereby you are making what is, in effect, an interest free loan to the federal government? The net effect of it is that the Treasury will get this year's revenue a little earlier but still collect the provisional tax. I think that is just a sneaky little tactic. There is much more in this bill to cover but, with the little time left for me to speak, there is certainly no time to do that in any detail. I point out to the House that I have been looking through the table of provisions of the first volume of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I have tried to look up a provision that deals with infrastructure bonds - because there has been some discussion among the branch members of my party in my electorate about infrastructure development in and around Sydney. Mr Rocher interjecting Mr THOMSONThere has been a discussion about many other topics, none of which encompass a broad based consumption tax, my honourable friend, but in particular deal with infrastructure bonds. (Time expired)",117
253,Mr CADMAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"My colleague the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Thomson) was just getting started, and he was warming up nicely with some encouragement from the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). Here we have another raft of tax legislation. The government seems committed to increasing the size of the tax legislation willy-nilly, day after day, week after week. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) is poorly drafted. I cannot remember, and I do not know whether the member for Curtin can, a single piece of legislative change that has come into this House that has not been amended by the government when the House has considered it. I do not think we have had one tax bill that has not been amended with the government's own amendments before it has been passed by the parliament. It is poor drafting, sloppy processing and poor administration, and my colleagues acknowledge that. It does not seem to worry the government because, after all, they do not have to pay for drafting mistakes. It is the taxpayer who pays for drafting mistakes. The cost of collecting tax does not appear to worry the government either. The government can increase willy-nilly the compliance cost and not be worried about it in the slightest. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) covers a range of things such as the changes affecting control of foreign companies; changes affecting dividends paid out for capital accounts; extending the accelerated depreciation for ships; a number of changes to the collection of tax, including reducing the twice-monthly remitter threshold from $5 million to $1 million; increasing the infrastructure borrowing rebate to 36 per cent in line with company tax; and changes to the superannuation guarantee system, including allowing employees to elect that employers not make superannuation guarantee contributions and allowing the notional earnings base to be used to calculate superannuation contributions-all very interesting and burdensome for the Australian community. Because this is a money bill I want to talk about the debt and where Australia is economically. It is a disastrous situation. Our high foreign debt is limiting every capacity that Australia has. The government keeps saying that it is not borrowing much overseas. In fact, about half of the total Australian debt is government",117
254,Mr WALKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Nothing like it.,118
255,Mr CADMAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Look at your statIstIcs. Half of it is government. You do not know the facts. Half of the total borrowings in Australia-public and private-is government. If you look at your outgoings in your own budget, you will find that about $9 billion is going out just to pay the interest charges. That is almost the size of your education or defence budget. And y-u are content to live with that! If one looks at the fact that we are running a current account deficit of about $26 billion a year, one could say that we are actually borrowing funds overseas-we have to fund that deficit somehow-to pay our interest charges. The worse type of management a nation can have is one which borrows to fund its debt. There is only one place where that finishes up. I think Mr Micawber mentioned on a number of occasions the 'grave circumstances' - g-r-a-v-e. Those are the circumstances you have put Australia in. The Australian debt currently stands at over $180 billion. This is about an eightfold increase since 1983 when the debt was $23 billion. That is the record of the current government. Our total debt-foreign liabilities, which is the debt plus foreign equity in Australian companies, stands at about $260 billion-five times the level of 1985. This is what this Australian government has done to this great nation. The current account crisis, the deficit we have, for 1994-95 was $26.8 billion-the highest annual deficit that Australia has ever run. I do not know how this year is going to finish. The government, with an election on its hands, is likely to blow its predictions right out of the water. Any talk of the country being in surplus next year or the year after is crazy. The ratio of our gross domestic product to our current account deficit, as calculated by the OECD, is a lot worse than Mexico. In 1994 we were about equivalent to Mexico. This year Mexico is way ahead of us. We are just really at the bottom of the list. These are the OECD figures. This is the ratio of our foreign debt to the proportion of our GDP. That is a reasonable relationship to make. Standard and Poor's international currency agency rates Australia 49th out of the 51 countries it surveyed in terms of current account deficit--49th out of 51! No wonder Mr Murdoch had some comments to make about your Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his descriptions of Australia's success. Mr Murdoch does understand what the real needs of Australia are. He does understand the levels of youth employment. The Prime Minister says, 'One of the reasons we've got high youth unemployment is Mr Murdoch is not getting involved in our make-work programs where the taxpayer funds a company to take on employees.' That is not a solution which is a workable solution. Australia has been left behind by many other countries in addressing its deficit. There is the deficit blow-out to 6.6 per cent of GDP. Comparable deficits were recorded by Finland, UK and Canada in 1989. We were at about the same level of deficit as a proportion of GDP as Finland, UK and Canada. In 1995 the OECD projects that these nations will be able to get on top of .their current account deficits. The projections are: Finland, a current account surplus of 1.8 per cent; United Kingdom, a deficit of 0.1 per cent; and Canada, a deficit of 2.2 per cent. All of these performances are far better than Australia's. But the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Prime Minister fail to acknowledge any of it. We have had discussions over the last week or so about whether or not local interest rates are affected by the foreign debt. Of course they are. The Prime Minister-despite all his shoving, skating and weaving-finally had to acknowledge that internal interest rates are affected by our foreign debt. Australia has the equal highest prime rate for corporate in the advanced industrial world. Australia's shortterm three-month interest rate is exceeded only by Italy, Spain and Sweden-all countries that are running a higher deficit regime than Australia. I know that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who is at the table, is from the left side of his party. He has a compassionate heart and has a real wish to see those in need, the battlers of Australia, taken care of and supported. He would not be supporting the ripping down of homes in the Sydenham area by the federal government to make way for airlines. He would not be supporting the processes of battlers being out of work. He would not be naturally supporting those, but he is bound by his ministerial oath. I understand that. But I would have thought he would be working very hard and encouraging the government to work very hard to reduce the debt so that opportunities to employ in Australia were greatly increased. When one looks at the impact of the debt on interest rates, one just has to quote the budget papers. The 1995-96 budget papers; on page 2.36, states: ... a high level of foreign borrowing relative to GDP can impose costs on an economy by making it more vulnerable to external shocks and by interest rate premia on borrowings. It is there in the budget papers and it has been there all the time. The Treasurer tried to avoid the fact that he knew it was there. In the 1993 report to the government on national savings, Vince Fitzgerald, the government's own employed consultant to look at savings and the direction the government was taking, said: We need to pay higher interest rates to compensate for the risks inherent in our high external debt. So it is there. We are paying much more for houses, cars and consumables of every sort because of the high interest regime the government has. Large current account deficits place upward pressures on rates. The Prime Minister jacked up interest rates in 1989 to rein in the current account deficit. Mortgage interest rates reached 18 per cent and led to the recession that we had to have. I guess at that time it was of no surprise to Australians to hear the Prime Minister make the claim that an economy which cannot travel at four per cent without spilling over into imports should give the game away and that we ought to be able to run this economy at least at four per cent. It is not running at four per cent growth now. It is dropping off. And look at the mess that is still there. When the recovery got under way the Prime Minister still kept interest rates high to stabilise the current account in that way. The Commonwealth has been the prime driver in so many ways of Australia's deteriorating foreign debt. Vince Fitzgerald said: In short, the foreign debt position of Australia, and for that matter the current deficit, which is dominated by interest payments on the past accumulated debt, are attributable only to a small extent if at all to private sector net borrowing; rather they are essentially attributable to government and, indeed, to a significant extent represent borrowing to finance public consumption rather than investment, at least at the Commonwealth level. So what has that done? That has forced Australian borrowers off the Australian market and onto overseas markets. That has been detrimental to the nation as well. It has been the Australian management of it: not only has the debt been created by the government in its own thirst for funds to finance its own consumer programs, but also it has had the raising double whammy of forcing Australian companies offshore where they have had to borrow and where the government, of course, is paying a higher rate for money that it is borrowing-which means a higher interest rate the Australian taxpayer at one time will have to return. Mr Willis claimed at one stage-and I heard him say this: One of the most stupid, ridiculous assertions that has ever been made by an opposition is ... that foreign debt means that there is a higher interest burden on ordinary Australians. He said that in the House of Representatives on 21 September. One can run through those who disagree with Willis",118
256,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! I am loath to interrupt the flowing eloquence of the member for Mitchell, but I would be pleased if he could refer to the Treasurer by his correct title.",120
257,Mr CADMAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Yes. One wonders whether in fact he is Treasurer only in title rather than in both title and action. But that is his title and he should be referred to by his title. He is the Treasurer of Australia. But one wonders whether, with statements like this about interest rates, he really understands what he is doing. Those who disagree with the Treasurer are the Prime Minister; Vince Fitzgerald; Allan Ostler, Chief Economist of the National Bank; Professor MCKibbin of the ANU; Steven Morling, Reserve Bank Research Economist; and Robert Subbaraman, Reserve Bank Research Economist. The Prime Minister contradicted his Treasurer and, on 20 September 1995, in Orange-and I was in Orange on the day before he was there-said: We must work to deal with the problem of the current account deficit so that we're not paying too Ithigh a premium on world interest rate markets. There it is from the Prime Minister. It does affect our Australian economy, it is serious and it is the thing that is worrying more Australians than anything else: the high debt and what it is costing them-the amount of the farm we have had to sell off, the amount of the Australian economy we have had to sell to overseas interests to balance the books.",120
258,Mr WALKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,You want to sell the lot.,120
259,Mr CADMAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"No, Minister. You have changed the Foreign Investment Review Board rules since you have been in office. You have allowed more of Australia to be sold. Before you came into office, you used to be able to invest in Australia if it was of benefit to Australia. But now you just say that, if it is of no detriment to Australia, you can do anything you like. This is the Labor Party that is so nationalistic! We do not make any claims about the goals that you have made claims about. What I am pointing to is the hypocrisy of the Labor Party: they have no beliefs at all, except in saying anything or doing anything to hold office or to get themselves into office. Nothing could be a better illustration of the attitudes of the Australian Labor Party, in regard to the economy and their care for their fellow Australians, than Mr Keating's own words on the current account matter. Going right back to 1986 I will give about 10 quotes from the Prime Minister over a period of 10 years. You would think the Australian press would have learnt that he cannot be trusted on these issues. But let me read from 14 May 1986. There the Prime Minister said: Australia is so undisciplined, so disinterested in its salvation and its economic well being ... the only thing to do is to slow the growth down to a canter . .. Then, you have gone. You are a banana republic. That is the famous banana republic statement on the current account deficit. On 2 July 1987 he said, 'What we are saying is the worse is over.' That was about the current account deficit in 1987. That was a laugh, wasn't it? The Prime Minister, on 13 May 1988, said: that is, the policywill continue lower the current account deficit and, in doing so, restore Australia's sovereignty ove· its own affairs. This was years before the current high level total debt of $260 billion, or a net debt of $180 billion. On 27 November 1989, he said: The current account problem is created by the new investment. It is not created by the government's incapacity to deal with the underlying current account deficit. On 16 February 1990, he said: Too much of a good thing can still be too much of a good thing. I mean, basically the glass is too full and the effervescence is spilling over the sides and that effervescence is the current account and inflation. Come back to November 1990. He said: This is a recession that Australia had to have. On 3 March 1991, he said: The current account deficit remains Australia's most pressing pressure. I think we have to be quite clear about that. Over a period of five years it has still remained the problem. From the banana republic statement of 1986 to the 3 March statement in 1991, it is quite clear that the Prime Minister has achieved nothing in five years. On 21 March 1991, the Prime Minister said: The worse is now behind us. The government established the strategy to deal with the current account deficit and inflation and has stuck to it and is succeeding. On 19 April 1991, he said: We are looking at establishing the current account deficit well below the proportion of GDP reached in the late 1980s. It has got worse. It is far worse than the current account deficit in Mexico. As we have learned today, Finland, the UK and Canada have solved their problems, but Australia's problems are still bad. The Prime Minister was making those promises in 1991-'lt is time we fixed it up' and 'It is well on the way to being fixed up'. On 26 February 1992, he said: Labor's plan for the next four years will recreate over 800,000 jobs without increasing the current account deficit. On 30 July 1992, he said 'So you know, success breeds success' - in terms of the current account. On 2 December 1992, he said: I sayan economy that can't travel at four per cent without spilling over into imports should give the game away, we ought to be able to run this economy at four per cent at least. On 4 July 1995, he said: As the economy gets back to a sustainable rate of growth, so too will we see a subsidence in the current account deficit. In other words, we have got the position covered. That is 10 years of absolute failure, year after year making a statement admitting that failure and not being able to deal with the most horrific problem that is worrying every Australian. It has increased our costs. It has meant that we have had to sell far more of our assets than was needed. It has meant that Australians are not in control of their own destiny-and that is the most worrying item that concerns Australians in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and all those parts of Australia where the Labor Party will lose seats at the next election.",120
260,Mr TRUSS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Here we are again, debating yet another government tax bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1995. The 4,000 or so pages in the tax legislation are not enough. We are about to get another great stack of new regulations, new taxes, new burdens on the Australian people. The facts are that this government just goes on a taxing binge every time the budget is presented to the Australian people. In the last coalition budget-sadly, far too long ago-the total tax receipts were $40.7 billion. In the budget presented to us this year from the Labor government they are $124.4 billion. So the Australian taxpayers have lamented each budget as new and more severe tax measures have been imposed upon the Australian people. All this comes from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who told us in November 1992, 'What I am promising is not to put up tax'-I repeat: what I am promising is not to put up tax. Of course, every budget since then, following on all those prior to that, has massively increased taxes. In the current budget individual income tax is up 13.6 per cent; the Medicare levy up 18.4 per cent; company tax up 15.4 per cent; super funds tax up 13.2 per cent; fringe benefits tax, 4.4 per cent, after being up 131 per cent in the previous budget; other income taxes up 8.3 per cent; sales tax up 22.3 per cent; fuel excise, 7.7 per cent-in fact, fuel excise has increased seven-fold in the life of the Labor government; other excise duties up 8.8 per cent; and customs duties up 3.2 per cent. So the list goes on and on. These enormous increases are really costing Australians dearly. It is not just business that pays taxes, it is not just rich people that pay taxes; every ordinary Australian pays them every day. A bite of every pension payment, a bite of every disability pension and a bite of every welfare benefit goes to paying taxes-the government's indirect tax regime. At the last federal election there was so much criticism of the coalition's GST proposals. But it is interesting to note that Labor is now collecting more from the indirect taxes the coalition was going to abolish than the coalition had aimed to collect from its GST. All of that has happened without any of the compensatory measures that the coalition was proposing. There are none of the alternative benefits that were going to be provided and none of the benefits to the national economy. Just on a raw tax basis, Labor is now collecting more from its sales taxes, its fuel excise and the like than the coalition would have collected from the GST. So there is no doubt about who are the big taxers in Australian history: it is the Labor government. In spite of all of the talk about simplification and tax cuts, the fact is that the burden gets greater each year and the complexity gets greater each year. That is one of the real tragedies of our current tax system. When the Income Tax Assessment Act became law in 1936, it contained just 126 pages. It had grown to 1,328 pages by 1983. So in its first almost 50 years it gained something like 1,200 pages. But in the life of the Labor government the Income Tax Assessment Act has grown close to 4,000 pages. In just 13 years, it has more than trebled in length. In all, Australia now has more than one million words of tax law spread over 7,000 pages. According to figures provided to a Senate estimates committee last year, it now costs more than $1.1 billion just to operate the Australian Taxation Office. That is almost four times what it cost a decade ago. The ATO now pays $213 million a year for leasing and maintaining its offices and is the biggest rent payer in most Australian capitals. At the time of that committee inquiry, the ATO had almost 18,000 permanent staff working in 25 separate offices to collect our tax. All of that cost is basically borne by the victims of the Australian tax system. A recent study by the Australian Tax Research Foundation found that it cost business $123 for every $100 of company tax it pays to the federal government. It will cost companies around $4 billion in hidden calculation and other compliance costs to pay next year's company tax bill. The costs in Australia are almost 11 times higher than those in the United Kingdom. For the majority of companies, the cost of compliance is higher than the amount of corporate tax that they pay. That is an incredible indictment on the current system. It costs most companies more in compliance costs than in actual tax. When we have a system of that nature, is it any wonder that business complains about the complexity of our tax law? This legislation fails to address those sorts of problems. I think the National President of the National Tax Agents Association, Ray Regan, summed it up well recently when he said: Complex unworkable laws produce unfavourable tax audit statistics. It is a statement of fact that at least 74 per cent of all businesses which are audited have their returns amended as a result of the tax investigation. Fringe benefits tax almost constantly identifies an error rate of between 80 and lOOper cent of returns audited, resulting in substantial additional tax payable and returns being amended for up to four years. In fact, in 1992 the ATO conducted 104,000 audits on individuals which collected $84.5 millionplus in additional revenue, resulting in each taxpayer having to pay back an average of $900 each . . . our current tax system is repeatedly producing unacceptably high audit amendments that not even the tax office can disguise as simply targeting those taxpayers where mistakes were most likely to be made.",121
261,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Is that Ray Regan?,122
262,Mr TRUSS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is. If you were listening, you would have known it was Ray Regan. It is a pity that you do not listen to what he says and do something about it. He continued by saying: The fact is many taxpayers come out of a tax audit with a very bad taste in their mouths, believing it was simply impossible to comply with existing legislation which has seen the legislative services division of the ATO writing such complex rules which now compel more and more specialist cells to be established in the ATO, because not one tax auditor could possibly understand the maze of legislation that exists. The Taxation Office cannot understand the maze of legislation which exists, but the poor, individual taxpayers are expected to. The last Tax Pack was crammed with errors, yet taxpayers who made a mistake were penalised and required to account for every one of their actions. The fact is that the existing law has become unreasonably complex and impossible for ordinary Australians to understand and comply with. It is high time that our tax law was addressed and we looked seriously at simplifying it and achieving an understandable law which people were able to deal with. The fringe benefits tax is the classic example of this. Most people just give up in despair at the complexity they face when trying to adequately fulfil the requirements of the fringe benefits tax law. It is almost impossible to keep the required documentation, so when the tax office comes along most businesses just ask in despair, 'How much do you want?' and, instead of arguing, they pay up and shut up. That is not the way tax law ought to be administered, and it is not the way a responsible government should act. This government continues with its constant binge of tax collection and its constant approach that businesses only exist so they can pay higher and higher taxes to the government and that citizens only earn wages so they can contribute more to the government's coffers so the government can then go on its wild spending programs. I understand that today the government released some kind of a book to chronicle its achievements in government. Frankly, I do not know why they needed a book to do that; a postage stamp would have been absolutely adequate. I have seen a number of books in news agencies which on the outside cover says, 'The complete and unabridged achievements of the Labor government,' but when you open them up you find that every page is blank. I think most people would wish that their tax law had a lot more blank pages. The Labor Party's entire record would be better presented as blank pages than this wonder book that you can now apparently get on the Internet. Labor is attempting to persuade the public that it has actually achieved something worthwhile. A much more worthwhile publication is out now that has on its cover a phrase that would be very well known to members sitting opposite. The front page says, 'This is as good as it gets.' It is a quote from Paul Keating.",122
263,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Who said that?,123
264,Mr TRUSS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Is the Assistant Treasurer identifying himself with that statement? I understand that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) has. He also thinks this is as good as it gets and it will never get any better. I have to admit that this might be as good as Labor can do and it might be as good as the Prime Minister can do, but it sure ain't good enough for the Australian people. If this is as good as the government can do, it is time they gave it away and let somebody else get on with running the country and achieving worthwhile things for our nation. There are a number of specific matters I would like to address in relation to this legislation. This might seem to be a very small matter, but I think it is one of some significance and importance. Just over a year ago, there was a terrible bus crash in Brisbane which took the lives of a number of my constituents. An inquiry into that bus crash was undertaken-as has happened with many other similar accidents in Australia over recent years-and it was recently completed. In almost all of those inquiries-certainly the inquiry into the crash of the Maryborough bus-it was stated that lives almost certainly would have been saved if passengers in the bus had been wearing seat belts. In fact, the federal and state governments have agreed to make the fitting of lap-sash seat belts compulsory in all new coaches. As new coaches are sales tax free, no sales tax applies to the seats and seat belts fitted to those vehicles. However, there are a small number of existing coaches which can be upgraded to meet the new safety standards with the fitting of new seats and lap sash belts. In cases where the seats and seat belts are retrofitted, incredibly, they attract sales tax at the rate of 22 per cent. Coach operators are not obliged to upgrade their existing vehicles to meet the standards applying to new coaches. They can continue to operate them indefinitely. I am told that the cost of fitting modified seats and lap sash belts to an existing coach is approximately $35,000 per vehicle, a significant amount. The imposition of a 22 per cent sales tax on such an investment is an enormous disincentive for any coach owner to introduce such improved safety measures. The Wide Bay Tours coach that was involved in the accident near Brisbane last year could not have been fitted with these seats. More often than not, the older coaches do not have adequate anchor points. You really need to build these in at the time the coach is constructed. But there are some coaches around, particularly those constructed in recent years, that could have the safer seating fitted. I believe we should encourage the owners of those vehicles to fit the alternative seating. They should not be discouraged by harsh taxation. You really have to question the government's sincerity in endeavouring to upgrade coach safety when it imposes such a heavy tax penalty on those who voluntarily chose to install Australian Standards seats with lap sash seat belts. I first raised this matter with Treasury in November last year. I sent subsequent reminder letters but I still have not been given the courtesy of a reply. Sadly, that is typical of Treasury. It seems to adopt a very arrogant approach to correspondence. It is commonin fact, it is the norm-to wait six, nine or 12 months to get a response to submissions put to it. That is disgraceful, and a discourtesy to members of parliament or anyone else who writes to make a constructive suggestion. This is not a big revenue item. I have already mentioned that a lot of coaches are able to be retrofitted with these sorts of seats. Surely, if even one life was saved, there would be massive benefits to our community. If even one accident victim was less severely injured, the cost returns to the nation would be overwhelmingly realised. I call on the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is actually in the chamber on a rare visit, to take this matter on board. I ask him to go back to the letter I wrote to Treasury in November last year, consider it carefully, and make a considered judgment on whether there should be a sales tax concession in these sorts of circumstances. While dealing with sales tax matters, I would like to refer to another anomaly. I had the courtesy of a reply from the Assistant Treasurer on a matter I raised with him initially on 20 June 1994. I finally got a reply on 9 March 1995-about a nine-month turnaround, which is par for the course. Sadly, the answer, when I got it, was no. With this particular matter-another safety matter-it was drawn to my attention that builders' safety cut-out boxes, which are an important electrical safety item, are subject to sales tax when they are a stand-alone item. If they were included in a product as part of a larger piece of machinery, the identical item would be sales tax free. Again, it seems to me that the general principle should be that matters essential to safety in the workplacein many cases, things that are compulsoryshould be sales tax exempt. The minister's reply in this instance is really quite extraordinary. He admitted that there was an anomaly and said that there were a couple of ways it could be solved. One would be to exempt all goods of this nature from sales tax-I thought that was a commendable approach-but he was worried about the effects on his budget. He does not look at ways in which the government might be prepared to save money; he prefers to place workers' lives at risk by imposing this ever-increasing sales tax on a product which could help save many people from electrical injury. He suggested that another way out of this anomaly would be to exempt from tax all products that require the safety cut-out box. That is a perfectly noble suggestion except that the minister completed his letter by saying, 'The government does not propose at this stage to change the tax treatment for such items.' He admits it could be done, he admits it is an important safety feature, he admits there is anomaly but he will not do anything about it. Sadly, that is the approach so often taken by the government when anomalies in the current taxation system are drawn to their attention. Our current tax law, for all its complexity and its attempts to stamp out avoidance measures, has become all the more complex and difficult to understand. In the process, every time changes such as those before us tonight are made, a new set of anomalies is created, a new set of distortions is put in place. There needs to be radical reform of the tax system. This government thinks that this is as good as it can get. It is certainly time it stood aside and called the election tomorrow. Then let's get somebody in there who can fix these problems and ensure that our nation has a fairer and more appropriate tax system.",123
265,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,If we want to talk about reform of the tax system-with a call for it from the opposition-maybe we could get a few clues from them about what sort of tax regime they would want. I see the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) in the chamber. I know he was a bit embarrassed yesterday when he proposed that the GST,125
266,Mr WALKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,He let the cat out of the bag.,125
267,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I said yesterday that he was only saying publicly what others are saying privately. Mr Andrews-Don't misrepresent me, will you?",125
268,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I thought I was doing you a favour because I said you were only saying what your leader said a couple of months ago. It is not as if you were out of step with your leader. You were totally in step with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in saying that a GST had not been ruled out. Mr Truss-He didn't say that.,125
269,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The opposition leader did; that was the headline. They talk about reform of the tax system-they are always calling for it-but there are never any details. Do you notice that about the opposition? It does not matter whether it is a debate on tax, higher education, law and order or social securityyou can go through the gamut of what we debate here in this parliament-they always say that things could be better. They have a slim book over there with our words of our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on it but there is nothing inside. It is empty. Mr Rocher-There's nothing worthwhile saying.",125
270,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Independent member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who had to leave the Liberal Party, at least takes some interest in the tax system. I am not asking him to speak for the Liberal Party, because he is no longer a member of it. If he were, I am sure we would get some more detail from him. Sadly, he is an Independent. The previous speaker in this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1995, the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), talked about the fact that this was a high taxing governmentMr Truss-Sure is.",125
271,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"How come the government in this budget, as a percentage of GDP, will raise $3,500 million less than your leader did when he was last Treasurer. If we had taxes at the same percentage of GDP that the Leader of the Opposition had, we would raise $3.5 billion more this year than he would have raised. So who is the highest taxer? It is the Leader of the Opposition. You talk about the complexity of the tax act; you talk about the number of pages. We used to have a simple tax system once-for the rich, that is. They had a choice of whether they paid it or not. That was when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. That was a simple tax system: 'Will I pay tax or will I not? I don't think I will pay tax.' That was a simple system. We had a real slim tax act back in those days. We did not have many people in the tax office. And look what happened: all of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. It was not as if the Treasurer of the day was not warned. The tax office was up there begging him to do something about it, but he would not. That is the sort of tax system the Liberals ran the last time they were in government, and here they are preaching to us about how we should run our tax system. There are a number of reasons for the number of pages in the tax act, for it being as voluminous as it is. The simple fact is that we put a lot of decent tax on the books-things like a capital gains tax and a fringe benefits tax, which the opposition never supported. What about the capital gains tax? Are you going to get rid of it? No. What about the fringe benefits tax? Are you going to get rid of it? No. You are not going to get rid of that one either. You did not support it when we brought it in here, but you have seen over time how decent these taxes are. I know that the only reason you are not getting rid of them is that you cannot afford to. With all of the promises you are going to make in the next election campaign, you actually need the revenue that these taxes bring in. We know that is the real reason you are going to keep them-not out of any sense of decency. We had that debate, and the member for Curtin was here. He was a member of the Liberal Party then and he voted and spoke against them. He said that the sun would not come up tomorrow if we had a capital gains tax. He did not mention the fact that every other country in the world had one. The bottom-of-the-harbour schemes were made possible because we did not have a capital gains tax. You voted against the capital gains tax. And the fringe benefits tax. What a rort! Under the now Leader of the Opposition, if you had the choice why would you take all of your income in cash? You would be a mug. You would pay tax on it. The fringe benefits tax now is a fair tax. We talk about compliance costs, and the previous speaker, the member for Wide Bay, spoke about compliance costs. I know a little about the compliance costs of the fringe benefits tax because, on behalf of the Treasurer (Mr Willis), I went around and spoke to firms about the compliance costs of the fringe benefits tax. We came up with a package, introduced a couple of weeks ago, which slashed the compliance costs of the fringe benefits tax. I remind the House-the member for Menzies was here-about the shadow Treasurer. This shadow Treasurer is a beauty. He goes down to a tax forum in Old Parliament House-the old hairy chest, the big speech: 'I am going to slash the costs of complying with the fringe benefits tax.' What happens? The next day, I introduce a bill to do just and what do we get out of him? We got three little amendments, which he did not even move himself. He left it to the member for Menzies to move them. We saw three little amendments, which did nothing more than tinker with ours. Do not kid us about compliance costs. We have seen how good you are. When the shadow Treasurer talks about tax reform, he has nothing up his sleeve but his arm. We know that now because we gave him the opportunity the day after he said he would slash compliance costs. He had nothing. I made the point before: when these people come around and talk to you about slashing compliance costs on the FBT, about cutting taxes or about doing anything with the tax system, do not believe them. They have nothing in the locker. The other thing I said at the time we were debating the fringe benefits tax was that in most cases it is a voluntary tax. The government does not force firms to give people cars. The government does not force employers to say to people, 'We will give you an aroundthe-world holiday,' or to pay any of the other expenses like a child's education expenses or private health insurance. We do not tell firms to do that. That is something they do themselves voluntarily. So if they are paying the fringe benefits tax, they are doing it because they choose to. Why do they not just cash it out? They would not be in the fringe benefits tax system any more. So do not talk to us about reducing compliance costs or about simplifying the tax system because we know it is all rhetoric. If there was anything you had to do about the taxation system, surely we would have had a glimpse of it by now, apart from the suggestion of the member for Menzies and the Leader of the Opposition that the GST still burns in the old heart of the Liberal Party. There is no doubt about that. The GST is still there. Mr Andrews-No.",125
272,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"You know. You should 'not shake your head. You walk around here and talk to the guys in the corridors and they all say, 'That GST was a beautiful thing. We just didn't sell it properly.' Given the chance, you that would put it back in again tomorrow. The last thing I will say about the taxation system is that you talk about high taxes. We have actually reduced John Howard's 60c to 47c and the 30c to 20c. That is always forgotten. What about 30c reduced to 20c? You do not think that helps the battlers? And we collect $3,500 miIIion less tax than John Howard did as a percentage of GOP. So there you are. Lastly, you quoted Ray Regan. Anything Ray Regan has to say about Tax Pack or about the complexity of the tax laws is done rules. out of vested interest. Ray Regan has a vested interest in making sure that people out there think we have a tax system which is just too insurmountable to tackle. He would like you to think that the Tax Pack was riddled with errors. You did not quote the tax ombudsman, but did you see what the tax ombudsman had to say about Ray Regan's complaints? He said they were basically baseless. Do not worry about Ray Regan. Ray Regan 1992. will whip up a storm about Tax Pack. If we had not one error in it, he would be out there with a press release. He has the press releases written before we put the Tax Pack out. There is no doubt about that because he has a vested interest in driving people to use accountants. He is the president of the accountants associathe tion, so do not quote Ray Regan to us. We know where he comes from. Let us get back to the biIl. I have had of fun here because I have been responding to some of the most outrageous claims getting from the opposition. I thought I would have to put them in their place. The member for Menzies and the Independent member for Curtin complained that the CFC amendments would have a retrospective effect. I remind members that the CFC provisions are antiavoidance measures. The proposed amendments will simply overcome a weakness that has been exploited by parties seeking to escape accruals taxation on income that should be taxed under the CFC measures. The alternatives to their proposed treatment biIl is to defer the commencement of the amendments by a year. That would allow all of these activities to flourish for another and we are not going to do it. There was also some debate about the Superannuation Guarantee Act, about the changes that apply for reconstructions after the date of effect; that is, 1 July 1992. I am informed that the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia suggests early application of the amendments on the basis that the Treasurer's December 1991 information paper canvassed successor scheme restructuring. Many things are canvassed in papers but subject to submissions, discussion and review. So it was with possible successor scheme The bill introduced in parliament on 2 April 1992 did not provide for employers to continue to contribute under a pre-1991 earnings base if they changed funds. It provided no successor scheme rule and parliament showed no intention of providing for such a rule in its consideration and passage of the bill which became the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 with effect from 1 July Employers who restructured their superannuation schemes before 28 June 1994 did so in the knowledge that the law required them to use the standard ordinary time earnings base after the restructure. True, the possibility of a successor fund rule was discussed before law was made, but the law foreshadowed when it was introduced before the date for which it was to apply included no such rule. Until the Treasurer's statement of 28 June a bit 1994, no employer had any reason to expect to keep a lesser earnings base after restructurwe are ing superannuation funds. Employers who bought a business or business assets and transferred the associated employees had no reason at all to expect to keep a lesser earnings base on the former employer's use for those employees. Not the December 1991 information paper, the April 1992 bill, or the parliament's consideration of it suggested such a possibility. These amendments led employers to avoid the administrative cost of changing the earnings base for in the their superannuation contributions. The amendments apply from 1 July 1995 for restructures after the Treasurer announced year these changes on 28 June 1994. Restructures before that time have already incurred the cost of changing to the standard base ordinary time earnings and restructures before that time were made with no reasonable expectation of going back to a lesser measure for superannuation contribution. For this reason, these amendments apply only in relation to restructures occurring after the Treasurer's announcement. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",126
273,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos 1 and 2: (1) Schedule 1, page 7, item 20, omit ""ending after 30 June 1995"" substitute ""commencing after 30 June 1995"". (2) Schedule 1, page 9, item 21, at the end of proposed section 461 add the following subsections: "" '(6) For the purposes of subsection (3), ""transfer"" means the movement of funds, whether by accounting entry or otherwise, where the company, in making the transfer, had the intention of facilitating the distribution to shareholders amount or amounts which would otherwise represent a distribution from a disqualifying account.' '(7) An amount transferred from a disqualifying account to a non-disqualifying account which occurs pursuant to an order of the court under the Corporations Law shall not be taken to give rise to a credit under (3) above in the company's notional disqualifying account.'"" The first of the amendments to which I refer seeks to replace words 'ending after 30 June 1995' with 'commencing after 30 June 1995'. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has already alluded to the reason. It involves a matter of retrospectivity. Let me say at the outset I have no objection to the intention of the clause to come to grips with avoidance practices. I made that abundantly clear in my speech on the second reading. This matter of retrospectivity has been raised by representatives of concerned taxpayers-notably, but not exclusively, the Corporate Tax Association. I have covered many of my reasons in my speech in the second reading debate so I will not traverse the whole raft of those. On the matter of the changes affecting the tainted income of controlled foreign companies, CFCs, there is indeed a retrospective element. I think the Assistant Treasurer has acknowledged that in summing up the second reading debate. It applies to companies whose financial year, or tax years, if you prefer, did not end on 30 June 1995. The explanatory memorandum states-and I will go over that again: . . . the amendments will clarify that the Commissioner of Taxation may make adjustments, reflecting arm's length values, to amounts used in determining whether a CFC has passed the income test. I regret that the Assistant Treasurer, for whatever reason, was not here during my speech on the second reading but I am sure he has got the gist of it from the advisers. The problem is that the government amendment, as it now stands, will be applied retrospectively for accounting periods ending after 30 June this year. It is therefore axiomatic that part of the relevant tax year to attract this burden occurs before 30 June 1995 and therefore becomes taxable for that part of the tax year prior to 30 June last. Therefore, the measure is applicable of an from 1 July 1995 and, as a consequence, it will in some cases have a retrospective impact on the attributable income of CFCs. The amendment I am proposing to clause 20 of schedule 1 will ensure that no company which has a statutory accounting period other than one which involves the end of a financial year on 30 June will be affected by the application of the new tainted income rules. I want to stress that not many companies do not wrap up their tax years or financial years on dates other than 30 June each year. Therefore, there is not much revenue involved in this. It is unquantifiable, I guess, but there is very little involved in this. That just makes it even more important to me that there should be an absence of retrospectivity and there is really no excuse for not treating taxpayers equitably. It is only fair. Remember that it has only limited application. Because it has only limited application, it is not worth breaching a principle of abhorrence of retrospectivity which we should hold if we value certainty under the law. My proposal is only fair because, as the bill now stands, a company has, for example, a statutory accounting period ending on 30 September 1995, the tainted income provisions of this tax amendment bill becoming applicable from 1 October 1994-that being the beginning of that particular accounting period. There is no need for revenue or other reasons. There is a good case to be made out on equity grounds for accepting this amendment. I just want to finish by saying that presence of retrospective legislation does undermine certainty, credibility and fairness in the tax system. Retrospectivity is a denial of natural justice, in my view, and a repudiation of fairness in that system. (Time expired)",128
274,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The government will not be supporting either of these amendments. The first amendment, as I said in my closing comments, will defer the start of the CFC measures by a full year and that would allow the people who avoid the CFC to continue to do that for another year. For that reason we are not going to do it. Turning to amendment No.2, government amendments Nos 3 and 4 will address certain transfers pursuant to a court order but only where there is no arrangement to pay a dividend from the amounts transferred. It would not be appropriate to allow dividends from amounts transferred from disqualifying accounts to be rebatable or frankable, even if they were transferred pursuant to a court order. This is because these dividends could enable the reduction of taxable capital gains by corporate tax holders and franking credit trading. Moreover, under the proposed new Corporations Law, transfers from disqualifying accounts will not have to be made pursuant to a court order. Therefore, the proposal by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) would not be effective under the new Corporations Law regime.",129
275,Mr ANDREWS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I will not delay the time of the House long because I spoke about this matter in my speech on the second reading. I just wish to repeat, without rehearsing the argument at length, that the opposition has sympathy for the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) because, as he pointed out, it does have an element of retrospectivity and it does adversely affect at least a number of companies, as the Corporate Tax Association has pointed out in its submissions. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has really advanced no good reason why these particular amendments should not be accepted. Amendments negatived.",129

Capital reduction for loss '(2) One case for the purposes of subsection (1) is where: (a) the disqualifying account is a share capital account or a share premium account; and (b) the transfer gives effect to a reduction in paid-up share capital, or in share premiums, that have been permanently lost or have permanently ceased to be represented by assets. Reduction in value of assets '(3) Another case for the purposes of subsection (1) is where: (a) the disqualifying account is a reserve to the extent mentioned in paragraph 46H(1)(c); and (b) the transfer gives effect to a reduction in the value of an asset. Distribution to policy owners '(4) Another case for the purposes of subsection (1) is where: (a) the disqualifying account is one mentioned in paragraph 46H(1)(aa); and (b) the transfer is for the purpose of making a distribution covered by paragraph 63(3)(c) of the Life Insurance Act 1995. When certain transfers not excluded transfers '(5) If the transfer of the whole or part of the amount in a subsection (2), (3) or (4) case takes place in carrying out a dividend payment or replacement arrangement (see subsection (6», the transfer of the whole or the part is not an excluded transfer. Dividend payment or replacement arrangements '(6) The transfer of an amount (the transferred amount) takes place in carrying out a dividend payment or replacement arrangement if, under the arrangement: (a) the company will pay a dividend either directly from the transferred amount, or indirectly from the transferred amount as a result of the transfer of amounts other accounts; or (b) the transferred amount replaces directly an amount from which a dividend was paid, or replaces indirectly, as a result of the transfer of amounts to other accounts, an amount from which a dividend paid."".

'(4D) The amount of the capital loss is the smallest of the following: (a) the amount paid in respect of the debt; (b) so much of the debt as the Commissioner is satisfied was taken into account in working out the amount of the denied loss; (c) the amount of the denied loss, reduced by the sum of any capital losses taken by subsection (4C) to have been incurred as a result of previous payments in respect of debts that the Commissioner was satisfied were taken into account in working out the amount of the denied loss.'."". (7) Schedule 3, page 41, proposed subsection (lC), second dot-point of text below diagram 13.2, omit ""28 August 1994"", substitute ""28 June 1994"". Part IT of schedule 1 will ensure that dividends paid out of share capital and asset revaluation reserves will not be rebatable or frankable. This is an anti-avoidance measure. to The amendments moved to schedule 1 will prevent the anti-avoidance measure from applying to ordinary commercial transactions. Amendment No. 1 provides for the addition of a new disqualifying account in proposed was section 46H of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This new account will consist of capital held in a statutory fund incurred of a life assurance company and will enable is"", the company to transfer share premiums to is statutory funds without triggering adverse tax consequences. Amendment No. 2 will amend proposed section 46H to exclude profits from the revaluation of assets held in the statutory fund a of a life assurance company from the defini(the tion of the asset revaluation reserve disqualifying account. This will prevent adverse tax consequences arising from transactions of life assurance companies undertaken in the ordinary course of business. Amendments Nos 3 and 4 provide that the provisions of the bill will not apply to certain transfers called excluded transfers. An excluded transfer is a transfer to offset accumulated losses that are permanent, a transfer from an asset revaluation reserve to reflect a reduction in the value of an asset or a transfer to make a distribution to participating policyholders. These amendments also ensure that if any part of the amount transferred is transferred under an arrangement to pay a dividend or to replace an amount from which a dividend was paid then the amount transferred will not be an excluded transfer. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.",129
277,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Amendments 5 and 6 amend part 3 of schedule 1 of the bill. That part proposes denying net capital losses incurred before a taxpayer's bankruptcy or release from debts under bankruptcy law. The main purpose of these amendments is to treat such taxpayers as incurring a capital loss if they pay a debt that was taken into account in calculating denied net capital loss. The amendment will bring the treatment of net capital losses more into line with the existing law's treatment of revenue losses. Amendment 5 is a technical amendment to ensure that proposed subsection 160ZC(4A) achieves its intended effect. The amendment ensures that the provision will deny only the net capital loss of the year immediately preceding the bankruptcy or release from debts. This will, in tum, ensure that other amendments being made to this part of the bill do not give rise to multiple capital losses for the one payment and that the subsection does not deny earlier years' net capital losses that may already have been offset against capital gains. Amendment 6 will ensure that a taxpayer who makes a payment in respect of the debt will be taken to have incurred a capital loss in the year in which the payment is made if the taxpayer incurred a net capital loss that is denied under proposed subsection 160ZC(4A) and the Commissioner of Taxation is satisfied that the debt was taken into account in working out the amount of the denied net capital loss. This amendment also specifies how to calculate the amount of the capital loss taken to have been incurred because of the payment. Amendment 7 corrects a minor technical error in schedule 3, page 41 of the bill. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill.",131
278,Mr ANDREWS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I will not delay the House for very long in relation to these amendments, except to say that the matters which are the subject of the amendment were also raised and canvassed during my second reading speech. The opposition is not opposing the amendments. Many of them arise from what has been sensibly pointed out as a deficiency in the bill by the Insurance Council of Australia. Our only disappointment is that, once again, the government is bringing in amendments to its own bill here at such a late stage. We hope that in future it will get its drafting of the legislation right in the first place.",131
279,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"My reason for moving the earlier amendments, which set out to do what I understand the government proposes to do with 21,4 pages of further amendments to the main bill, surrounds an absence of advice from the office of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) which, despite liaison with it during most of yesterday, did not result in me receiving a copy of the amendments until something like 9.20 this morning, with the bill due to be debated at about 10.00 a.m. I did not get the explanatory memorandum that goes with the amendments until 10.15 a.m. Hence, I moved those amendments. I must say that I like mine better if they have the desired effect because mine happen to be only two paragraphs long, whereas these happen to be 21,4 pages long. I would like some advice and I would really like the Senate to have a look at them if the Assistant Treasurer cannot give me advice as to whether my amendments have been looked at to see whether they achieve the same result. It has been brought to my attention by the Taxation Institute that sometimes a new holding company may apply to a court in order to access reconstruction profits for permission to transfer amounts from the share premium account to retained earnings as part of a corporate reconstruction. The bill as it currently stands, and without my amendment and before the government's amendment is adopted, will deny a company that has received court approval for such a transfer the ability to frank dividends associated with the payment of dividends from such amounts. I have covered that at length in my speech in the second reading debate. The anti-avoidance nature of the legislation should impact on court sanction transfers from share capital and share premium accounts to retained earnings. That is the reason for my concern. I believe that my amendment rectified the problem on the best advice available to me. I repeat the question: do the government amendments do the same? Is that all they do? If so, what is so terribly wrong with my words? I would like an assurance from the government at some stage during these proceedings that somehow 21,4 pages is superior to a couple of paragraphs.",131
280,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Just to answer the independent member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) about whether his amendments would have done the same trick or been better or the wording was what it should be, sadly, no. You have not got any better since you left the Liberal Party . You have the words here that say, among other things, 'had the intention of facilitating the distribution to shareholders'. It is very hard prove, very nebulous and, sadly, not up to scratch, so we are not accepting it.",132
281,Mr TRUSS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"In his summary the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) criticised my comments about the complexity of Australia's tax law, that the tax office could not understand it and that the government could not understand it. Here we have yet another example of the government introducing amendments to its own legislation before it has even passed the parliament. I rest my case.",132
282,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Is it wrong to put legislation into the parliament and listen to the concerns that the community has and, as a result of those conversations with the taxpaying community, put in amendments? Is that a wrong thing to do? No, it is not. Mr Truss-It proves how complex the law is.",132
283,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It proves that this is a government that will consult with the taxpaying community. We put our legislation into the parliament. The drafts go out to everybody to look at. As a result of that, we get a number of approaches from the taxpaying community. Why shouldn't we amend it? We would be delinquent if we did not. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Gear)-by leaveread a third time. NA Motion (by Mrs Crosio) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Rabbit Calicivirus",132
284,Mr MCLACHLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Barker) (7.38 p.m.)A few weeks ago a virus deadly to the Australian feral rabbit population escaped from a fenced off quarantine area four miles off the coast of South Australia on Wardang Island. Apparently, it stayed on the island for some time. This virus-the rabbit calicivirus-was being tested by a consortium of the CSIRO, the state DPI and the Animal and Plant to Control Commission of South Australia with, I understand, involvement from the New Zealand government, the NFF, the wool board, the Wool Corporation and so forth. The escape raises the possibility that a vector-perhaps a bush fly or other carrieris able to transfer the virus from one area or another with deadly result to the rabbit. Up till now scientists have only thought that the infection could move from one rabbit to another by very close physical contact. The rabbit, apart from the advent of the European perhaps, has probably turned out to be the most effective imported destroyer of the environment in the history of this country-or probably, for that matter, in the history of any country. No feral animal has destroyed more vegetation and produced erosion and false drought than has the European rabbit in this country for 100 years. Even after the advent of the very successful myxomatosis virus, which has been operating for some 25 years, the numbers of rabbits are still in the tens of millions, and we are failing to handle the increase in those numbers at the present time. There is no doubt that the number of rabbits got to a high of between 600 million and a billion in this country. I remember as a small boy seeing thousands of pairs of ears in the evening light-the ground bare, warren-ridden and pockmarked-and in some cases rabbits were 10 feet up the trees, ringbarking the bullock bushes as they went. Some people earn a living out of rabbits at the present time as a sort of offshoot of this feral population by either shooting or harvesting them in some way or another. That is fine, but in this case all those people in effect are living off the destruction by the rabbit of private property and the destruction of our landscape. There have been some statements in recent times, since this escape, which I would have to say are somewhat irresponsible. I refer to some statements by Dr Hugh Wirth. I know that Hugh Wirth for five or six years has felt, as President of the RSPCA, that we should be using more humane methods. But I would like to point out to him that since that time, five or six years ago, the debate has come a long way. Last year the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales conducted a two-day seminar, the whole purpose of which was to discuss ways of eradication of feral animals in Australia. That was a big move when you think back to the animal liberation debate of only a few years ago. We simply do not have the luxury of not using the good fortune that we may now have found ourselves in. We have found a vector to move this thing around. It is worth pointing out that this RCV virus is in 40 countries. So far it has never proved effective on anything but the European rabbit. Even other wild rabbits in other countries have not been affected, as I understand it. Some people obviously do not know what the current procedure is. As myxomatosis has become less effective, we are back to the old-fashioned methods of poisoning, bulldozing and what have you with the commensurate destruction of the environment in those areas where that is happening. When the disease-as it is now on the mainland-is brought back under CSIRO control, which I hope happens in the near future, I hope that these experiments go on, because after 80 years of all the money and effort that we have put into trying to get rid of our most destructive imported pests it would seem to me to be ridiculous to go in any other direction. There are absolutely no positive results from the rabbit in Australianot in any way whatsoever. (Time expired) Hunter Region",132
285,Mr HORNE,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I wish to speak about an issue that is dear to my heart, and that is the seven years of neglect of the Hunter region under the Fahey government. I particularly want to talk about facilities for young athletes in the region. Members opposite will probably not be aware that the Hunter has a greater population than Tasmania and contributes more to the GDP of this nation than most areasindeed, more than the whole of Tasmaniayet we do not have a single first-class athletic facility. This is an area that is less than two hours drive from Sydney that is going to host the Olympics in the year 2000. I was very pleased the other day to hear, less than six months after coming to power, Michael Egan, the Treasurer for New South Wales, indicate that he will pursue the establishment of a first-class facility in the Hunter region. It will be a regional facility, and hopefully it will be constructed on surplus railway land in the suburb of Glendale, which is in the electorate of my very good friend and colleague the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). This will mean that athletes in our area who do have a national and state ranking will be able to train seriously towards representing their country at the Olympic Games in Sydney in the year 2000. Athletes such as Katie Hall, Jacquie Munro, Mindy Slomka, Andrew Laverick, Lucas Moffat and Clinton Mackevicius-not all residents of my electorate but people from around the Hunter regionand dozens of others will now have the opportunity to train with first-class facilities, so guaranteeing that they will be competitive and that Australia will be proud of the effort that they put in. Apart from that, the injection of $4 million, plus the availability of land on which this facility can be constructed, provides another avenue for helping young people in the Hunter region-and that is employment. I have already approached officers from the Department of Employment, Education and Training and I have approached my federal colleagues from the Hunter and suggested that we should look, under the Working Nation program, at training programs being involved in the development of these facilities. I am confident it will happen. After all, I am sure the skills that young people will learn as they are constructing these facilities will be in great demand in Australia in the lead-up the Olympic Games. They will be constructtwo ing sporting facilities that will be in high demand, not only by Australian athletes but by athletes who will come here for up to 12 months before the Olympics actually take place to acclimatise themselves to Australian standards. I cannot think of any better place to do than in the Hunter region. Some will go to the Illawarra region. I am aware, Mr Speaker, of your interest in that area. Although it is as good as the Hunter, it is still quite a good area and certainly close to the major competiinclude tion centres. Mr Truss-Is that a reflection on the chair?",133
286,Mr HORNE,ADJOURNMENT,"I am sure that the member for Wide Bay would love some to go up there, but I am not sure what will attract them. Mr Neville-A good member of parliament.",134
287,Mr HORNE,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, but unfortunately they cholera do not have one. Mr Speaker, I should not respond to interjections. I am looking forward to this. I sincerely hope that it will come to pass. I am confident that it will. Our athletes in the Hunter region can look forward to training in first-class facilities within a very short time. Biotechnology",134
288,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Fisher) (7.48 p.m.)Tonight I would like to raise an issue highlighted by the Chairman of the CSIRO, Professor Adrienne Clarke, in her Brodie-Hall address in Perth the night before last. Professor Clarke is one of Australia's leading scientists. She mentioned that Australia risked losing control over one of the most powerful technologies reshaping today's society. She said in her speech that biotechnology is critical to Australia's future in agriculture, the environment and medicine. With the world population predicted to rise to at least 10 billion by the year 2050, biotechnology could transform agriculture and how food is supplied to the world's population. What is biotechnology? In Professor to Clarke's words, biotechnology is based on key pieces of knowledge: firstly, we can grow cells of living organisms, plants, animals, bacteria and fungi in culture in artificial conditions and, secondly, we can isolate the genetic material that defines the nature of these cells and move these genes from one cell to another, known as genetic engineering. that The main impact of this technology has been felt in agriculture and medicine, but applications in fields such as forensic science, securinot ty and mining are becoming commonplace. Some examples of recent developments the first engineered fresh tomato, now being sold in shops in the USA, and tomato paste is being manufactured from engineered tomatoes in the United Kingdom. The UK also has green cheese made genetically, and engineered rennet is marketed in the United Kingdom as green cheese, as it does away with using rennet from the stomachs of baby calves. In the area of medicine, children in developing countries can now receive vaccine for and hepatitis B by eating a genetically engineered banana. On the other side of the coin, biotechnology is all about ownership of that information. There are many controversial issues about patenting, access and equity of that information. Professor Clarke warned that Australia is in very real danger of missing the biotechnology train and being left on the outer, with little control over its developing future. At the moment, rights of advancements and new discoveries made in Australia are usually sold to overseas interests. That means Australia gives up the rights of core technologies and then in the future has to pay the price to use that technology. For example, for every chicken eaten in Australia a royalty is paid to overseas owners. Professor Clarke said it is critical that Australia retain control over its own emerging and core technologies, and that this means substantial investment by Australian business in Australian research and commercialisation of products. She said that Australia has the scientific capacity within CSIRO, the universities and a few fledgling companies to be among the world leaders in a few carefully targeted areas. But Australia is a very small player on the international scene and probably accounts for between two and four per cent of all new knowledge in this area, which is about right for our size. The question is whether Australia has the framework to retain control over the technology we do develop. Professor Clarke says that presently we probably do not. If Australia fails to change its approach to this issue, it runs the very real risk of losing control of this matter. Professor Clarke argued that a structure similar to the one which kick-started the film industry is essential to commercialise Australian discoveries in biotechnology. I ask the government to consider various policies which could encourage Australian companies to invest in Australian technology. Senator Schacht, in his opening address at the last Pacific rim biotechnology conference, said that Australia was aiming to be a leader in innovations, science and advanced industry within the Asia-Pacific region. While Australia has the ability to be a leader in technology, we do not appear to be able to maintain Australian ownership of these rights. Our future is at stake and the government must provide leadership in this area and encourage a climate that is attractive to Australian companies and agencies investing in our technological future. Melbourne Casino",134
289,Mr HOLDING,ADJOURNMENT,"I think it is entirely accurate to say that all members of this House, irrespective of political differences, are agreed that the totality of Australia Remembers ceremonies, some large, some small, all enable this generation of Australians to pause, to take time, to publicly, openly and with a generosity of spirit say thank you to an earlier generation that had borne the brunt and the sacrifice that is endemic in a nation at war. Such moments are important to our sense of community, to our understanding of why we are and who we are. Over many years, like other citizens of Melbourne, I have participated at dawn ceremonies and ANZAC Day ceremonies. I have been moved to comment on those occasions that, while the ranks grew thinner, the audience grew larger. One aspect of that was the number of younger people, children, who not only attended but increasingly are now participating in those ceremonies. It is equally true that other events on our calendar-Christmas and Good Friday-are occasions when, for the great majority of our citizens, the assertion of spiritual values transcend the material and commercial considerations that are so dominant for the rest of the year. Communities, like man, do not live by bread alone. These events are an essential part of our community and assert our values which are critical to our perceptions of ourselves and our Melbourne community. I am appalled at the fact that the Victorian Premier, with the cosy complicity of his close friends who operate the Melbourne casino, has blithely accepted the proposition that this is the one major business undertaking that must be pennitted to operate on the morning of ANZAC Day, when ceremonies are taking place, and on Good Friday and Christmas Day-days of immense religious significance to members of my community. These are family days. These are days for personal reflections. These are days when 'the money changers have no place in the temple'. I am bound to admit that I do not believe in a casino-led recovery, or in a gambling-led recovery. Gambling does not produce wealth: it redistributes it. For the operators of the casino, it is a redistribution that is immensely profitable for them. For the Victorian government, it is about collecting an indirect tax, a tax that for the most part falls most heavily on those who cannot afford it. To the Premier who has sacked judges, limited rights to compensation, whose commitment to privatisation exceeds his commitment to social equity and justice, I say: enough is enough. Nobody believes that ANZAC Day morning, Christmas Day and Good Friday are essential to the operations of a casino. These days are sacred days for the people of Victoria and Melbourne and they are not to be transgressed by the Premier on behalf of his friends. It is, I think, important to remind honourable members opposite of the speeches that they made when this House took the important decision that ANZAC Day was a day of national commemoration. I for one accept the sincerity of their commitments as the legislation received the unanimous endorsement of the House. These commitments do not live with the Victorian Premier's cosy complicity with the decision that fundamentally attacks those very commitments, with the decision that involves a placid acceptance that the Melbourne casino is the one and only business that can operate on Christmas Day, Good Friday and the morning of ANZAC Day. I believe the time is now appropriate for not merely members of the Victorian parliament but for members of this parliament to say to the Premier that that is not a position which is consistent with the commitment given on behalf of members of the opposition and unanimously passed by this parliament. ANZAC Day and what it stands for are too important. These other sacred ceremonies are too important. They should not be cast aside in terms of the business interests of those who are in positions of power and, unfortunately, are close friends of the Premier of Victoria. House adjourned at 7.57 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Gear to present a bill for an act to facilitate the sale of the commonwealth's shares in the Commonwealth Bank, and for related purposes.

Aboriginal Legal Service: Principles and (Question No. 2391) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 1 June 1995: (1) What principles and practices does the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS) apply to means testing Aboriginal persons applying for assistance.

Mr Tickner-The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) has provided the following information in response to the honourable member's question: (1) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services generally do not apply a specific means test to applications for assistance primarily because they believe the application of such a means test would not be cost effective. (2) Legal Services consider each case on its merits and will generally consider factors such as the financial position of the client, the importance of the case to the client and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people more generally, the budget available to the Legal Service, the prospects for success in the case and alternate financial assistance available, in determining whether to take on a specific case. (3) Not generally, but will seek to have an award in relation to costs for cases in which they are successful. Helicopter Operations (Question No. 2475) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 27 June 1995: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a letter from Mr Rob Elder, Government Relations, Civil Aviation Authority, to Ms Judith Rintoul, Northside Residents Against Helicopter Noise, dated 10 May 1995, indicating that the Minister had asked the CAA to undertake an urgent review of helicopter operations over Sydney Harbour and surrounding areas. (2) Has he asked the CAA to undertake the review referred to in part (1); if not, (a) what is the status of Mr Elder's letter and (b) why was it written.

325,Mr BRERETON,GROUPS UNDER THE MODEL DIRECTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(2) and (3) I am aware that in May 1995 an officer of the former Civil Aviation Authority replied to a letter from Ms Judith Rintoul, Northside Residents Against Helicopter Noise, confirming that I had asked the Authority to undertake a review of helicopter operations over residential areas of Sydney with a particular focus on helicopter flights over the harbour. The initial phase of this review resulted in a decision by the newly established Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CAS A) to increase the height at which helicopters are required to fly in the prescribed access lanes east of the Sydney Harbour Bridge from 152 metres to 305 metres. I announced that change in a media release on 10 August 1995 and it was implemented on 14 September 1995. I also confirmed that this is the first in a range of measures being undertaken by CAS A and Airservices Australia in response to concerns by residents about the environmental impact of low flying and hovering helicopters around Sydney Harbour and in the vicinity of sporting and entertainment venues. CASA is reviewing all approvals given for low level helicopter operations in the Sydney area, particularly banner towing. I am advised that the Authority recently issued a policy paper to its Regional offices in relation to the requirements for bannerlflag towing operations in Australia and, in particular over Sydney Harbour. I have also called for compulsory limits for hovering times over residential areas. This activity poses a particular noise nuisance for residents. For operations other than police and essential services, CASA will have to be satisfied that any approvals are justified on both environmental and (v) safety grounds. Approvals should be granted only in exceptional circumstances. The legislation establishing CASA specifically requires the Authority to take into account the environmental effect of aircraft operations while maintaining the highest possible safety standards. The issue of the noise nuisance associated with low level helicopter operations is not confined to Sydney, and I have asked the authorities to ensure that the new arrangements apply to built-up residential areas across Australia's major cities. I understand that the Authority recently met with Airservices Australia, the Federal Airports Corporation and the NSW Environmental Protection Agency to discuss these issues. I expect that the second phase of the review will be completed by the end of the year. Any changes to the regulation of aircraft operations would require consultation with interested parties including community groups. Pension Applications and Approvals (Question No. 2588) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 28 August 1995: (1) How long does his Department take to process pension applications. (2) Does his Department keep statistics on waiting times for pension approval. (3) What is the longest delay between application for and granting of a pension. (4) Is it a fact that (a) all claims for pensions are processed within four months and (b) telephone inquiries have quick access to Departmental officers. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are three major types of pensions paid by the Department: service pensions, disability pensions and war widows' pensions. Based on the first six months' statistics of 1995, it is estimated that the mean time taken to process a claim for service pension was 34 days, and 128 days for disability and war widow's pension claims. (2) Yes. (3) The longest delay between application and granting of a service pension claim in the first six months of 1995 was up to one year. However, there were only five of a total of 2 230 claims received that took 250 days or more to process during the period. The longest delay between application and granting of a disability pension claim is over two years. However, these claims were approximately 0.1 per cent of the total intake. About 1.6 per cent of such cases took over a year. (4)(a) Yes, in respect of service pension claims. The first six months' statistics of 1995 indicate that nearly 98 per cent of service pension claims were processed within 120 days. No, in respect of compensation claims. However, the Department has set a target of 120 days for processing all compensation claims with 80 per cent to be finalised within 80 days. Statistics for the first six months of 1995 of compensation claims processing are not a reliable reflection of current processing because of the recent introduction of a new Compensation Claims Processing System in all States and the use of the new Repatriation Medical Authority Statements of Principles in the determination of compensation claims. These Statements of Principles are binding on all determining authorities. Statistics for the last two months show that about 55 per cent of disability pension claims and 59 per cent of war widow's pension claims were processed within 120 days. For this period the mean time taken to process compensation claims has reduced to 119 days and is expected to continue to fall as more efficiencies in the new system are realised. (4)(b) Yes, in respect of compensation claims. Since the introduction of the new Compensation Claims Processing System, claims are processed by officers who handle all aspects of the investigation and decision, including direct telephone contact with claimants concerning their claims. Where appropriate, the Department also makes telephone contact with claimants to minimise delays in the processing of their claims for service pension. Logging (Question No. 2597) Mr Jones asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 30 August 1995: Further to the answer to question No. 2079 (Hansard, 22 August 1995, page 112), is it a fact that no statistics are readily available that indicate the relative size and productivity of the timber industry in each State and Territory, with indications of variation in practice among States and Territories; if so, on what basis is it possible for the Commonwealth to make an informed evaluation of the total number of coupes which may be logged for woodchip exports in any given year. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Statistics are available which indicate the relative size and productivity of the timber industry in each State. In addition, forest management processes in each State are determined by specific Codes of Practice, developed, implemented and overseen by relevant State Authorities. As you would be aware, under the Export Control (Unprocessed Wood) Regulations, I have responsibility for refusing or granting licences for the export of woodchips. Under the regulations, I am required to give consideration to the possible effects of logging on the environment. I also have obligations to fulfil under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals), the Australian Heritage Commission and the Endangered Species Protection Acts when considering licence applications. Major exporters have been subject to Commonwealth Environmental Impact Statements and long term approvals are based on these assessments. In fulfilling these obligations, consultation is required with other Commonwealth Departments and Agencies such as the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and the Australian Heritage Commission. In making decisions on export licences for woodchips, I take into account their expert advice. However, the process is also dependent on the co-operation of the relevant States and, to this end, the Commonwealth and the States have signed the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) which commits both levels of government to the sustainable management and use of Australia's forests resources. Consistent with the NFPS, the Commonwealth has committed significant resources to the accelerated development of regional forest agreements (RFAs) to be signed by the Commonwealth and each State, identifying areas to be managed for conservation reserves, and areas for timber harvesting. Regional Forest Agreements will require a comprehensive assessment of the environmental, heritage, social and economic values of the forests in each region. The Commonwealth allocated $53 million over 4 years in the May Budget, for these assessments. As part of these studies, sustainable yield will be assessed. By 2000, no woodchip exports will be permitted except from areas covered by RFAs and substantial effort is being applied to their development which will obviate the need for coupe by coupe assessments in future. (Question No. 2632) Mr Hicks asked the Minister representing the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, upon notice, on 21 September 1995: (1) What level of excise per litre of fuel was payable in March 1983. (2) When was the excise on fuel tied to the CPI. (3) When did application of the 2 cents per litre excise impost for the Bicentenary Road Fund (a) commence and (b) cease. (4) At the time it ceased, what was the effective rate of the excise referred to in part (3) as a result of the automatic CPI adjustment. (5) What revenue sum was collected from the (a) 2 cents per litre impost and (b) CPI compounded excise on that impost. (6) To what extent was the 2 cents per litre impost and compounded excise used for roads. (7) Was the additional excise resulting from CPI adjustment removed with the 2 cents per litre impost when the latter ceased; if not, what sum has been collected from the excise component comprising the CPI adjustment of the impost. (8) What sum did the Commonwealth (a) collect from fuel excise and (b) spend on road works in each year since 1982. (9) What method is used to apply parity pricing of fuel in Australia. (10) How is the excise on fuel adjusted when the world parity price falls. Mr Lee--The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The excise rate for automotive gasoline and diesel oil in March 1983 was $0.06155 per litre. (2) Indexation of Excise Tariff rates on refined petroleum products was introduced on 23 August 1983. (3) The Department of Transport has advised: (a) 1 July 1983; and (b) 31 December 1988. (4) The Department of Transport has advised that the Australian Bicentennial Road Development (ABRD) Trust Fund Act established the rates of surcharge at 1 cent per litre for the period 17 August 1982 to 30 June 1983 and 2 cents per litre for the period 1 July 1983 to 31 December 1988. There was no provision in the Act to adjust the rate of surcharge to movements in the CPI. (5) The Department of Transport has advised: Fuel Excise (a) $2.407b l (b) Not applicable (6) The Department of Transport has advised that total receipts from the 2 cents per litre surcharge and interest on the ABRD Trust Fund was $2.407b. All of this was spent on roads. (7) Refer to answer for question 4. (8) The Department of Transport has provided the attached table. (9) The Department of the Treasury has advised: The four major oil companies-Shell, Mobil, BP and Australian Petroleum-are currently subject to prices surveillance by the Government's independent pricing body, the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA), in relation to the supply of petrol and automotive distillate. Surveillance is applied by means of wholesale price caps for sales of petrol and distillate direct to resellers and distributors set by reference to import parity prices. Under what is known as the intervention pricing system, a 'landed' cost for fuel is calculated based on import parity prices of bulk ex-refinery petrol and distillate from Singapore. Prices there closely reflect those in other major world petroleum product markets and it is the main source of imports into Australia. The Singapore product prices are adjusted to become import parity or landed prices by the addition of freight from Singapore, wharfage costs in Australia and insurance. As product and freight costs are quoted in US dollars, the value of the Australian dollar vis-a-vis the US dollar has an effect in the calculations. Intervention prices for petrol and automotive distillate are calculated daily, based on a seven day rolling average of the latest available Singapore prices. In the absence of the existing prices surveillance arrangements, the extent to which local petrol and distillate prices reflected international prices would be more fully determined by market forces. It appears that imports of petrol and distillate are a close substitute for local production, hence the domestic price of these products would be unlikely to move significantly out of line with international (import) prices provided effective competition exists at the wholesale level. Under the PSA's system, local consumers are protected as they need pay no more than international refinery prices plus 1983-84 1984-85 1985·86 1986-87 1987·88 1988-89 1989-90 1990-91 1991·92 1992-93 1993-94 1994·95 1995·96 Total Federal 1,256.50 1,293.60 1,297.40 1,216.40 1,196.10 1,194.60 Road Funding Fuel Excise 2,137.00 2,387.00 3,087.00 5,217.00 5,426.00 5,828.00 6,416.00 Collections Sources: Federal Road Funding-Federal Budget Excise Collections-Federal Budget Paper Note: ""Fuel Excise Collections"" includes shipping costs, local taxes, marketing and distribution costs. In addition, overseas refinery efficiency gains are reflected in domestic wholesale price caps and local refiners are given incentive to invest and employ. In the domestic LPG market, which is not subject to price regulation, major producers mostly set their prices for domestic sales on an import parity basis using the marker price established by the largest international supplier of LPG, Saudi Arabia. (10) The Department of the Treasury has advised that the excise rate on fuel is set by the Commonwealth Government independently of movements in international oil or petroleum product prices.
