2,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth and Minister for Sport will be absent from question time this week as she is in South Africa promoting Australia's FIFA World Cup bid. The Deputy Prime Minister will answer questions in relation to early childhood education, child care and youth and the Minister for Health and Ageing will answer questions in relation to sport on her behalf. NA Sapper Jacob Daniel Moerland Sapper Darren James Smith",17
3,Mr RUDD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House record its deep sorrow at the deaths of Sapper Jacob Daniel Moerland and Sapper Darren James Smith on 7 June 2010, while on combat operations in Afghanistan and place on record its greatest appreciation of their service to our country and tender its profound sympathy to their families in their bereavement. I wish to express heartfelt condolences to Sapper Moerland's parents, Sandra and Robert, his sisters Bethany and Laura, and his fiancee, Kezia. I also wish to express heartfelt condolences to Sapper Smith's wife, Angela, and his 2½-year-old son, Mason, and his parents, Graham and Amanda. I wish to express my deepest sympathy to both Sapper Moerland's and Sapper Smith's extended families and their friends, including their fellow service men and women of the Australian Defence Force with whom they served with pride and with honour, in particular the men and women of the 1st Mentoring Task Force at Tarin Kowt in Afghanistan who this day continue to serve our country with distinction. On Monday, 7 June, Australia lost two of its bravest sons. Sapper Moerland and Sapper Smith were both outstanding soldiers and valued members of the Brisbane based 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment. They were heirs to a great military tradition, that of the combat engineer-that group of soldiers who accept great personal danger to protect their fellow soldiers. They were also heirs to the great tradition of ANZAC. Sapper Moerland and Sapper Smith had both shown strong commitment and professionalism throughout their military careers. Sapper Jacob Moerland was a loving son and brother who was engaged to be married. Sapper Moerland was proud to serve his country. His family has said: Jacob died doing the job he loved and he went to Afghanistan not because he had to, but he thought it was a valuable job to do to help the people in Afghanistan. Sapper Darren Smith was a loving husband and father. His wife, Angela, has said: He was very passionate about his job and understood the risks involved but he was the sort of man who always put others first and did his best for them whether it was his mates in the army or at home with his family and his friends. Darren also loved his explosives detection dog, Herbie, who was also, sadly, killed in this incident. These dogs also do a great job for Australia, and all animal lovers will be saddened by that dog's loss. On the day that this occurred I spoke with these soldiers' commanding officers in Tarin Kowt to express to them and to all our soldiers in the field the solidarity and support of the Australian people. Those who feel and experience this loss upfront and first are their comrades in arms who are with them and who bring their broken bodies back to the base at Tarin Kowt. Our soldiers are taking this well. They are strong and they are resolute. They also mourn the loss of comrades. As I have done in the past, I have also spoken individually to members of these two soldiers' families, to their parents and ners. Nothing can compare with the grief which is experienced by a mother and a father, a wife, a partner, when the news comes. This is a terrible job to perform for the tralian Defence Force. They do it with dignity and they do it with distinction. When they arrive at a person's house to tell them this news it is the most sobering moment for them. It is a terrible moment for the families. As we stand here and reflect today on the grief which the nation feels and the grief which the members of the Australian Defence Force feel, there is nothing comparable with the grief which these soldiers' families and loved ones feel now and into the future. The one thing which, in my experience in speaking to these families, gives hope and consolation is this: the mission in which they are engaged is an important one. It is one which has value in it. It is not simply a miliFrance, tary operation here or a military operation there. It is actually doing something real on behalf of a core set of Australian and human values. And what is that? It is making sure that the country of Afghanistan does not return to the clutch of terrorists. Terrorists trained in the main part in Afghanistan over the last decade have been responsible for the murder in cold blood of about 100 Australians. The resolve of our men and women in uniform is not to allow that country to become that sort of training base again in the future. Those are the core values which they were serving on our collective behalf, and those are the values which we salute in the loss of these brave soldiers today. On behalf of the Australian government and all members of this House, we offer our prayers and our support to Sapper Moerland's family, to Sapper Smith's family, to their friends and their fellow soldiers, at this extraordinarily difficult and sad time.",17
4,Mr ABBOTT,CONDOLENCES,"I join with the Prime Minister in expressing deep sorrow at the deaths on active service in Afghanistan of Sappers Darren James Smith and Jacob Aus- Daniel Moerland. I understand that the members for Paterson and Fadden recently met with our combat engineers in Oruzgan province, including Sapper Smith, and can attest to their professionalism and the pride they take in serving our country in this way. We place our soldiers on a pedestal of respect precisely because of the risks they run on our behalf. Certainly our soldiers understand the consequences for the world and for Australia should Afghanistan once more become a safe haven for terrorists. As these deaths demonstrate, no-one should underestimate the dangers faced by Australian and allied soldiers in Afghanistan. Service personnel from the United States, Britain and as well as from Australia, have been killed in action in the last week and this is a sad reminder of the price paid for freedom. On behalf of the coalition members of this parliament, I too offer heartfelt condolences to the families and to the loved ones of Sapper Smith and Sapper Moerland.",18

7,Mr ALBANESE,CANLEY VALE AIR CRASH,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (2.10 pm)-On indulgence, I wish to advise the House that earlier this morning there was a fatal light aircraft accident at Canley Vale Heights near Bankstown Airport. I am advised that that police have confirmed that the two people on board the aircraft have both died. This is a tragic accident. My condolences-and, I am sure, the condolences of all in the House-go out to the families and friends of those affected by this tragedy. An investigation team from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has just arrived at the accident site. It is not appropriate to speculate on the causes of this accident at this early stage, before safety authorities have been given the opportunity to undertake their investigations. As the ATSB's investigation continues and more information becomes available, the ATSB will report on the progress of their investigation, which will include a preliminary factual report in 30 days and updates on their website. I thank the House.",19
8,Mr TRUSS,CANLEY VALE AIR CRASH,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker, let me associate myself with the comments made by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. It is always a tragedy when an aircraft accident takes the lives of Australian pilots and passengers. Our aviation industry is a very safe one and we can be proud of that. It is important that the causes of the accident be properly investigated. Whilst little information is available of yet in relation to the details of the people who have lost their lives, I extend the sympathies of the opposition to their families and friends. NA Budget",19
9,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Trade. I refer the minister to his criticism of the government's lack of consultation with the mining industry prior to its decision to impose a great big new tax on mining. As the Minister for Trade and a former minister for resources, was he consulted by the ‘gang of four' before they made their mining tax decision?",19
10,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Wonders never cease! It has taken three years to get a question on trade and what do we get? We get a question on consultation. It matters to have a decent memory in this place. I remember back in 1999, as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, when there was supposed consultation between the then government and us in relation to new taxes. The Labor Party of the day gave its full support to a revenue-neutral outcome in terms of taxation, a letter and an agreement that was signed off by the Treasurer of the day, Peter Costello-and an agreement that was never honoured. So do not come in here and talk to us about consultation. The key question for you is: do you honour your commitments?",19
11,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,19
12,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! To shorten proceedings, I indicate to the minister that that was a lengthy preamble and he should go to the question.",19
13,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It has taken three years to get a question. I am entitled to give it a preamble.,20
14,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister should contain his enthusiasm.,20
15,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am enthusiastic about trade but they are not, Mr Speaker. They never ask a question about it. If they are terested in the impact of trade in relation to this tax, I can tell them the conversations I have had in Japan and China recently are ones that are very supportive of the direction of this tax because it will increase the side of the equation, get a better match between the demand for our resources and our ability to more efficiently produce it. What we are doing is introducing a tax that takes out the disincentives that currently existdisincentives that relate to the requirement pay royalties before any profit is turned. This tax that we are introducing will effectively eliminate those royalties upfront. Mr Randall-Were you consulted?",20
16,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As for consultation, of course I was consulted. We operate as an effective cabinet, not a rabble like you are over there. The only person in this parliament it would seem who does not believe we need reform in the mining industry is that person sitting over there, the Leader of the Opposition. For him there would be no change; for us, we want to make this industry more efficient, more competitive, and the proposals that we have put forward are going to do that. Not only will we continue to have those discussions amongst ourselves; we will continue to have them with the industry to achieve a sensible outcome for the future of this country. The sooner you get on board and support that direction, the better for country.",20
17,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not that I am overly sensitive, but the minister should address his remarks through the chair. Economy",20
18,Mr TREVOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the strength of Australia's economy and the importance of reform for the future?,20
19,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is good to hear the Minisin- ter for Trade in fine form today. The member for Flynn asks a question concerning the importance of dealing with economic reform and the importance of its impact on the region that he represents. The government is supply committed to keeping the economy strong and to delivering a fairer share for all working families. That is why, when the nation was threatened with the global financial crisis, we did what we had to do to keep Australia out of recession. That is why we are to committed to bringing the budget back to surplus in three years time, three years ahead of time. That is why, as of 1 July, the government will deliver its third set of tax cuts for working families. For someone who is on about $50,000 a year, that represents a tax cut of nearly 20 per cent. Keeping the economy strong has also enabled us to increase our investment in the hospital system of Australia by 50 per cent and to increase our investment in infrastructure, including the installation of a national broadband network. Also, on this day and in this sitting fortnight the government, as a result of keeping the economy strong, will deliver Australia's first paid parental leave scheme-an important reform for the nation. So we have 12 years of inaction on the part of those opposite, and the scheme is brought in by this government in its first term in office. The government has continued to do the this job that we began to keep the economy strong and to deliver a fairer share for working families. That is reflected in what we saw in the labour force data which came out only last week. This is worth emphasising. Unemployment in this country is 5.2 per cent. Furthermore, employment has grown by 2.6 per cent through the year to May 2010. This is the ninth consecutive rise in the number of people engaged in full-time employment. If we compare that with the unemployment data we have seen from around the world, it is galvanising. There is 5.2 per cent unemployment in Australia. In the United States it is now up to 9.9 per cent; France, 9.9 per cent; Canada, 8.1 per cent; and the UK, eight per cent. But actually look at the numbers of people who are losing jobs and gaining employment. In the US, nearly six million people have lost their jobs. In Canada, nearly 100,000 people have lost their jobs. In the UK, more than half a million people have lost their jobs. In the euro area, 3½ million people have lost their jobs. In Australia, we have added 255,000 more jobs during the period of this crisis. Part of keeping the economy strong means also delivering on long-term economic reform. That is where tax reform comes in as well-boosting Australia's global competitiveness by ensuring that we are bringing our company tax rate down; boosting also Australia's level of national savings by some $85 billion over the decade ahead, an important buffer for the future against future external shocks; boosting also superannuation for working families, and for a 30-year-old now there is a $108,000 difference for the future; and boosting also investment in infrastructure, funding the rail, road and ports needed by our resource sector and those communities that support it. It is interesting to see where this tax reform debate has got to. We on this side of the House support tax reform in the mining industry and for the country at large. We support it, but also the principle tax reform based on profits as opposed to production is now embraced by the government, by the Minerals Council of Australia and by most of the major miners-they believe that reform is necessary for the sector. There is just one person who opposes that, and that is the Leader of the Opposition, who says that no reform is necessary, that a production based tax through royalties should be retained and that the mining companies are paying too much tax. The whole country says we need reform for the mining industry tax arrangements based on profit, not on production. The Leader of the Opposition says no. This brings me to the electorate of Flynn and the impact of what we are proposing for future infrastructure investments. Each time. I have been to the honourable member's electorate I have been presented with one request after another by the Gladstone Regional Council of their needs. Those opposite, if they have been to Gladstone, would have noticed one thing: you see an array of ships out there waiting to be loaded at harbour. I notice that those opposite raise questions about this and they find it amusing. When you look at export dollars for Australia being lost from a failure to invest in infrastructure, that is no laughing matter. It means we have to make a difference. When I was in Gladstone most recently with the member for Flynn, the Gladstone Regional Council then were embracing the needs of the region and discussing how to support the future housing requirements, transport needs and roads construction for the big expansion of its local population coming off the back of the mining sector and that broader community. The bottom line is this: the region in Central Queensland faces a desperate need for infrastructure and it therefore needs greater investment in infrastructure. That is why the government has brought forward a regional infrastructure fund which is designed to deof liver better infrastructure for the people of Gladstone, for the people of Mackay, for the people of Karratha, for the people of Kalgoorlie and for those communities which support our mining industries. That is what the regions of Australia are crying out for. There has been a lot of speculation over the processes concerning tax reform. I wish to inform the House that, as of the week that has just gone past, consultation and negotiation continue with our major mining companies. Some of those companies are a long way down the path towards agreement; others are still some distance away. This is a tough debate from which the government does not retreat because it is a necessary part of long-term economic reform. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I refer to page 554 of the House of Representatives Practice where it does indicate that the Speaker has no specific power to order someone to sit down with length of answer but often persuasion is exercised. I would ask you to exercise your persuasion.",20
20,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is responding to the question. The Prime Minister has the call.,22
21,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is pretty interesting when you think about the needs for infrastructure, because the good old Leader of the National Party was out there the other day on this question as well. When fronted on it in Wide Bay, he had this to say: A great deal of our nation's wealth that's helped see us through the global economic downturn has actually come from the regions and I think there ought to be a compact with the regions under which the government guarantees a fair return, a fair share of our nation's growth and prosperity in the wealth of the regions so that we can provide proper services and facilities. Does it sound familiar? Does it sound familiar to those who have been observing this debate? Of course our regions need greater investment. We on this side of the House have provided a basis by which that investment can be undertaken for the future. The bottom line is this: if you are going to keep our economy strong for the future, you have got to prosecute continued economic reform. If you are going to deliver a fairer share for working families, better super, tax cuts and tax breaks also for small business, you have got to get on with the business of economic reform. That is what the government is determined to do. We have a plan for reform to keep our economy strong and to deliver a fairer share for working families. I do not see any form of alternative. Budget",22
22,Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy. At what stage were you consulted about the government's decision to impose a great big new tax? Was it before the decision was taken by the ‘gang of four'?,22
23,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Higgins for the question. I start by saying that thinking about a profits based tax is not new to this government. I remind the member for Higgins it is something the industry has desired for a long time. It is something that her previous employer, the then Treasurer and her predecessor the former member for Higgins, failed to front up to. I say that because tax reform has never come to Australia. Government's capacity to deliver on tax reform requires strength of leadership. It is in that context I also remind the House that the findings and recommendations of the Henry tax review were not thought about in terms of the public debate. The consultation process, including with individual companies and the Minerals Council of Australia, went on for almost two years. I am sure the member for Higgins, like me, also read the musings of the Secretary of Treasury in a number of speeches he made about the potential concepts that might be embraced and the development of a minerals tax proposal with respect to putting in place a profits based tax system in Australia, something that industry long campaigned for. I simply say that these issues were also raised with me on a number of occasions by industry in the lead-up to the Henry tax review. My problem was that given my knowledge",22
24,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,23
25,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will resume his seat. Mr Melham interjecting,23
26,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Banks is warned. Ms O'Dwyer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: I specifically asked the minister when he was consulted.",23
27,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question went on to other matters as well. The minister has call.,23
28,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it is very broad ranging. It is about tax reform and the capacity of the opposition to actually deliver any decent policy outcome. I remind the House that we will deliver a profits tax system in Australia, something that the minerals industry accepts. I also remind the House that the minerals industry basically accepts that it should be paying more taxation in Australia. I simply say, from the government's point of view, that I was involved in cabinet processes, as I should be, and in doing so I was not in a position prior to the release of the Henry tax report to have serious consultations and discussions about the content-not until it was publicly released and not until after the government brought forward its response to the report. So, having talked about the concepts with industry prior to its release, I simply say: I am now involved in detailed consultations about its implementation. Infrastructure",23
29,Mr BIDGOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Why is the resource super profits tax important to ensuring Australia has the infrastructure capacity that it needs to grow, and is the minister aware of any comments about the need to secure a fairer funding share for regional communities?",23
30,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dawson for his question. Indeed, the Regional Infrastructure Fund, which has been announced as part of the government's tax reform proposals, will ensure that the government can deliver the infrastructure that Australia needs. Without this investment in the infrastructure, we know that the constraints will continue. We know that there were major constraints on our export capacity during the previous mining boom. We know because the Reserve Bank warned on 20 separate occasions about skills and infrastructure conbased straining growth in our economy. The Regional Infrastructure Fund is aimed at promoting development and jobs in mining communities, supporting our resource and export capacity, and tackling those capacity constraints. Importantly, this fund will also ensure that communities, such as those based around Mackay, get a fair share. We know that, at the moment, if anything symbolises the failure of the connection between infrastructure and our resource growth, it is the fact that many working Australians travel over 4,000 kilometres to get to work. If people think that that is good economically, if people think that that is good in terms of efficiency or, more importantly perhaps, if people think that that has good social outcomes, then they indeed have rocks in their head that should be mined! Because we know that these constraints are simply unacceptable. And you do not have to take the government's position on that; the Minerals Council warned that the private sector cannot invest and grow when they said: … too often governments in the past have abrogated their responsibility to local communities and thus constrained the investment that private sector has wanted to make. They used one example, that of the Hunter Valley. The Minerals Council have calculated that Australia lost some $2 billion in revenue due to the failure to have the appropriate rail and port infrastructure in place-$2 billion over just a five-year period. Some, of course, do not agree with the Minerals Council, and one of those is the Leader of the Opposition, who last week, in response to the announcement about the Regional Infrastructure Fund, stated that it was the job of the private sector to do this infrastructure development. Of course, much of this infrastructure development does not relate directly to the profits of individual panies, and there are constraints and impacts on communities as a result of that. A good example is Mackay-and I am amazed that the Leader of the Opposition did not take a good look at the CBD of Mackay when he visited the electorate of Dawson just last week. If he had, he would know that there are significant problems with B-doubles going on roads that are also used by the communities who live in Mackay. There is a real issue with the ring-road in Mackay. It is the sort of project which could be eligible for funding under the Regional Infrastructure Fund. Those opposite are all over the shop, because, whilst the Leader of the Opposition is stating that he opposes this, just yesterday the Leader of the Nationals said, ‘Much of our nation's wealth is produced in the regions; we want a fair share of that to return to the regions,' and in April Senator Barnaby Joyce said, ‘We have to acknowledge that infrastructure spending has to occur in the regions.' They have been out there in individual electorates calling for infrastructure spending in our regions-and yet, when there is a precise, clear proposal to deliver just that, they are against it. They are also against the boost to superannuation and they are of course against the cut in company tax. We have a clear position, which is that infrastructure development cannot be left behind like it was during the first mining boom, because not only is it a constraint on our economic growth but it also has a devastating impact on the communities where that growth is occurring. Budget",23
31,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. What advice did the minister seek from her department regarding the impact on jobs of the government's great big com- new tax on mining before the gang of four's decision to impose the tax?,24
32,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for his question. I draw to the member's attention-and I am sure he would have noted this-that the unemployment statistic came out last Thursday at the rate of 5.2 per cent. On the question of jobs: I know that members on this side of the House are very interested in how many Australians are unemployed and to see falling unemployment5.2 per centMr Hockey-You inherited four per cent.,24
33,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow Treasurer for his interjection and remind him, in case he missed it, of the global financial crisis and the global recession. He may choose to do some reading on that at some point, particularly as he is seeking to present himself as the man who has the ability to run Australia's macro-economy. He might want to catch up with that little bit of news, which has obviously entirely missed his attention. On the question I have been asked: for the resource super profits tax there is Treasury modelling about the impact on the industry, including the impact on employment. The modelling shows that the industry would continue to grow and consequently job opportunities would continue to grow. I understand that the opposition are involved in a fear campaign here, because that is what the opposition do. They are long on complaint and short on solution. I say to members opposite: let us look at the entirety of the package. There is the resource super profits tax, the company tax reduction, tax breaks for small businesses, superannuation and the regional infrastructure that my colleagues have talked about today. If you take the package as a whole, we are obviously talking about a net positive benefit to the economy, including job opportunities. If the member wants to be honest about the question of employment, step 1 is to be honest about the figures last week, step 2 is to be honest about the impact of economic stimulus on those figures-the economic stimulus that of course you opposed-and step 3 is to be honest about this package. It would be a change.  of order. I ask the Deputy Prime Minister to table the Treasury modelling on employment that she referred to in her answer.",24
34,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!  made that up.,25
35,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business is warned! Budget,25
36,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. What are respected community groups saying about the government's tax plans and what is at stake for lowand middle-income earners in this key economic reform?,25
37,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for that very important question, because there are a lot of very loud, wellfunded voices being heard in this debate. Certainly the voices from the mining companies that are very well funded and the funders of those opposite",25
38,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,25
39,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat. Now there is quiet, I call the Treasurer.",25
40,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is very important in this debate to acknowledge that there are lots of people in this country, particularly on low and modest incomes, who have a very big stake in its outcome. I think that is understood fairly and squarely on this side of the House, but is certainly not understood by those on that side of the House, who somehow believe that the mining community is paying too much tax. That is what the Leader of the Opposition has said. The Leader of the Opposition is advocating a cut in tax to the mining industry whilst on the other hand wanting to increase rates of company tax. Get that? What sort of twisted priority could get the opposition to the point where they think there should be a tax cut for very profitable miners and on the other hand want to increase tax for corporate Australia? What sort of twisted economic logic could lead to that position? It is refreshing to hear from those people in the community who are represented by organisations such as ACOSS, the ACTU and the Consumers Federation.",25
41,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,25
42,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can hear and see the contempt that those opposite have for people on modest incomes who are represented by organisations that have had their say in the last 24 hours. You can understand why they stand for the implementation of Work Choices in full, because they do not understand the importance of these measures to the living standards of people in this country who are on low and modest incomes. They most particularly do not understand the importance of the support for superannuation, particularly for people on modest incomes. These are very vital economic reforms which will lift the living standards of millions of workers in this country, and those opposite have nothing but contempt for those people and the organisations that represent them. It is good to hear from ACOSS. It is good to hear from the ACTU. It is good to hear from the Conservation Foundation. It is good to hear from the Consumers Federation. I know those opposite do not want to hear it, but let us go through what they have had to say. The Consumers Federation said: The RSPT is good policy-a tax on resources should be part of a sound tax base-and it comes with … off-sets in other parts of the tax-base, so it has the added virtue of rebalancing a base out of kilter. Unlike many other products, the resources aren't mobile-they are in the ground. Australian ground. All Australians should benefit from this luck of geography, not just a well-heeled few. Nothing could summarise the situation better than that. We do have to face up to the need for fundamental economic reform to lift our national savings to support Australian workers on low incomes. We also have to face up to the need to invest in infrastructure, particularly in mining areas. Of course, some in the National Party, but apparently not in this parliament, understand the need to do that. We understand the need to invest in capacity in the mining regions. Those opposite do not. We also understand the needs of 3.5 million Australians who will benefit from what we are doing immediately in superannuation, the 8.4 million workers who will benefit from the 12 per cent guarantee or the 2.4 million small businesses which will benefit from the tax write-off of up to $5,000. This is what economic reform is all about, and that is what is not understood by those opposite. We saw the shadow Treasurer say last week that the stimulus had nothing to do with keeping Australia out of recession. They simply do not understand it. They get all the big economic calls wrong and they have got this economic call wrong. We on this side of the House understand the importance of economic reform to lift living standards and to put in place a modern tax system. Budget",25
43,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to various public statements concerning the timing of a resolution to the mining tax issue. Last Friday, the Prime Minister said there were weeks and probably months of consultation to go. On the same day, the Treasurer said the government would soon move to the third phase of finalising the design. Yesterday, Senator Mark Bishop said that it needs to be addressed and resolved urgently. This morning, the finance minister said that you cannot put a timeslot on it, while the member for Brand said that the debate should be settled in the next few weeks, and then subsequently said it should be settled by August. My question to the Prime Minister is: when will he finally end this amateur hour experimentation with Australia's economic future and dump this bad tax?",26
44,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It took three questions from those opposite to build up to the crescendo of the Leader of the Opposition's first question.,26
45,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,26
46,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked.,26
47,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice his question is about the detail of consultation and the detail of negotiation. If the Leader of the Opposition had any experience on questions of the economy he would understand that, when you bring about fundamental tax reform, it involves complex consultations with companies and it involves complex negotiations with companies. That is what the government is engaged in. That is what any government engaged in the business of fundamental tax reform would be doing, and that is what we are doing. He raises more broadly the question of consultation. Can I simply draw his attention to the fact that-whether or not he or his colleagues have been asleep for the last two years-this entire debate has been out there through public documents released by the Treasury on where the overall direction of tax reform was going. First and foremost, on 2 May 2008, the government announced that we would be having the review into the tax system. On 6 August 2008, a discussion paper was released on the tax review entitled Architecture of Australia's tax and transfer system. That document, that discussion paper, raised the inefficiencies of royalties and pointed to a profits based tax. If you go to that paper it said: These royalties can discourage high risk investments (for example, in the case of an ad valorem royalty, revenue can be collected even when net losses are being made). It went on to say-if the Leader of the Opposition had any interest in the tax arrangements for the resource sector of the economy at large-back in August 2008: A resource rent tax does not apply until a firm earned above normal profits. Once this occurs, the combined tax rate on the total return increases as the resource price increases. Back in August 2008, the government called for further public submissions. In December 2008, the government released a further, more detailed, consultation paper which went down to the definition of what constituted supernormal profits. It also went on to make reference to calculation bases which were linked to the long-term government bond rate. Through until May of 2009, there have been 1,300 submissions from the mining industry including from the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies and the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and including recommendations from the MCA on the question of adopting a profits based tax system for the future. Then between June and November of 2009, industry, professional and community groups further consulted on the question of broader tax reform including that for the industry. So, for those opposite to infer that this is somehow some bolt from the blue on consultation concerning the future reform of tax arrangements for the mining industry and, more broadly, for the economy, this process has been under way for two years-had the Leader of the Opposition any interest in any matter concerning economic policy and tax policy. The government is now in the business of consultation with the mining industry. The government is now in the business of negotiation with the mining industry and the government is now engaged in detailed negotiations on details of implementation and generous transition arrangements. That is the normal way in which you engage in a process of tax reform. The government believes that this reform is delivering better super for working families, better tax arrangements for the rest of has the economy and is boosting our level of national saving and, critically, is investing in regional infrastructure of the type called for by the Leader of the National Party when he was in regional Queensland the other day hoping that no-one would listen to what he was saying. Frankly, these are the factors at stake in fundamental tax reform. We are engaged in consultation, we are engaged in negotiation and we will prosecute that to the extent that it is necessary to reach an appropriate settlement for the national economic interest for the future of the mining companies in this country and for a fairer share working families across the Australian community.

50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Bowman, on behalf of others, will leave the chamber for one hour under the provisions of standing order 94(a), and two of his colleagues further down the bench know that they are very lucky. The member for Bowman then left the chamber.",28
51,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dobell for his question. It goes to the task of putting in place what the leum and minerals industry has long argued for in Australia-a profits based tax system-because they think that is in their long term best interests. I remind the House that, when we announced our response to the Henry tax review committee report on 2 May, the government established a highlevel tax consultation committee. That committee delivered its first report to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer just over a week and a half ago. On the basis of that report, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and I have been deeply involved in discussions with industry about the nature of that report. I express the government's appreciation to those companies, both big and small, who have seriously engaged in discussions with the tax consultation committee and with the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and me over for the last week and a half. Right across my portfolio, be they in mining, petroleum, coal seam methane or oil and gas, those companies have acknowledged that this is a serious and genuine process of consultation. That was evidenced today by the meeting between the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and me and the CEO of British Gas. She acknowledged the productive nature of these discussions. Her sector, I might say, was the first in the door on 3 May after the government's announcements of 2 May. I understand the importance of this sector, because what we are talking about is a new industry. That Queensland project alone represents a potential investment of $12 billion to $15 billion-and the opposition dare to raise the question of employment. This is about major employment opportunities in Australia. I know how disheartened the opposition were last week when they saw the good employment results-a terrific employment result for Australia following the petroimpact of the global financial crisis. If you have any doubts about the importance of those discussions, I simply say that these discussions with British Gas are not new to the government. The delivery of this project started with detailed meetings with that company early in 2008. That led to an announcement on 24 March this year of the world's first LNG contract signed between Australia, British Gas and CNOOC. As the Minister for Trade acknowledges, we are talking about a deal potentially worth 3.6 million tonnes of LNG per annum to the Chinese national oil corporation. In volume terms, this is the single biggest company-tocompany LNG contract in Australia's history, totalling 72 million tonnes over 20 years. For those reasons, companies such as British Gas and others right across my portfolio have approached discussions to better inform outcomes in a productive and constructive way. And so they should, because they themselves argued long and hard that we should put this type of tax reform in place in Australia. They do not like the royalties based system because, when times are bad, they are still required to pay tax. They actually believe that, over time, this will be a far better tax system for them and a far better tax system for Australia. That is what this debate is about. In that context can I sayMr Ian Macfarlane interjecting",28
52,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Groom asks whom I am speaking to. I am talking to people who have skin in the game-people who invest in Australia and who employ people in Australia. That would be a new thing for the Leader of the Opposition, because he has no practical understanding of the importance of investment and business activities in Australia-because he finds economics boring. On that note, I simply say that we as a government are making progress and we will continue to have these discussions, because it is about getting the balance right. This is the balance that is required. Unlike the opposition, we accept that the Australian community is entitled to a fair return for the opportunity to develop its natural resources-100 per cent owned by the Australian community. We also have a strong view, as does the Australian community, that we are entitled to a fairer share from business for the opportunity of developing those natural resources. This debate is not just about the question of a profits based tax system in Australia but about fundamental change to the taxation system in Australia, including a significant reduction in company taxation. This is of major significance to me as the Minister for Tourism, because tourism is an industry principally made up of smalland medium-sized business opportunities, quite often in regional Australia. The government will continue to engage in these constructive and productive processes. We are about putting in place an appropriate outcome. I assure the Australian community that there will be a profits based system in Australia that is accepted by industry. And so it should be, because that is what they have argued for, long and hard. When it is all over, we will end up with a system that is fairer for Australia and balanced for industry. The only people that will stand in opposition will be the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition party room-just like they opposed our activities during the global financial crisis to maintain the strength of the Australian economy and minimise the impact on families through maintaining the best possible employment opportunities for the Australian community. We will continue, despite the endeavours of the coalition to run a fear campaign, to have these constructive discussions because this is about the long term best interests of Australia. That is what governs the Australian government, unlike the self-interest which governs the other side of the House. Budget",29
53,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the recent report on Nine News of his great big new tax on mining and its impact on the Queensland towns on Wandoan and Miles. I refer specifically to Rachel Kerwick of the Miles and District Chamber of Commerce who, in reference to the Xstrata development, said: We've been waiting for this for years. It's finally here, everyone's excited. We don't need the mining tax to ruin it. Prime Minister, how will these towns survive when these projects do not go ahead because of the government's bungled big new tax on mining?",29
54,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for North Sydney for his question. I am advised that, on 3 June, Xstrata said that it would suspend exploration at Wandoan coalmine and said it would jeopardise jobs in construction and operations over the next five years. The Financial Review, I noticed, reported on 11 June that Xstrata's executive general manager for the Wandoan coal project, Steve Bridger, said the company would continue to pursue the approval of a mining lease from the state government and would continue buying up land in the 32,000-hectare exploration area. This brings me to the broader question of the integrity of various claims that have been made concerning the proposed impact of this taxation regime and the fear campaign which those opposite are engaged in. Let me go through some of these in sequence, having dealt with the Wandoan matter. Let us not forget the claim made on 4 May that Cape Lambert announced that the RSPT would jeopardise its future operations in Australia. That was just five days before the chief executive of Cape Lambert proceeded to buy a million dollars worth of Cape Lambert shares. That is the first one. We then had the Liberals saying that BHP was cancelling its Olympic Dam project. That is the second one. The opposition said the new tax was already threatening multibillion dollar investments, most of all the $22 billion expansion of Olympic Dam in South Australia. The shadow finance minister said that Olympic Dam would be put off for 10 to 20 years. However, we then had BHP CEO Marius Kloppers say on 26 May: … it is not frozen. We are carrying on. We are spending money, there are 200 engineers working on it. Otherwise we would have made a statement to the contrary. The third example goes to Xstrata, which I referred to before. Then of course we had a splash, I understand, in the Australian newspaper on 6 May, which stated: … Rio Tinto has shelved plans to spend $11 billion expanding its … iron ore operations in Western Australia … Three hours after that and after a two percentage point fall in share prices, Rio submitted a notice to the ASX market which included the following statement: Rio Tinto today confirmed that no decision has been made to shelve any projects in Australia … Then we go on to various statements which have been made one after the other by other mining companies. I go also to a report in the Financial Review on 9 June which said that the Chinalco bauxite development in Aurukun would join the eight projects worth $55 billion that had been put on hold due to the government's resources tax. At 2.18 pm that day Reuters reported that Chinalco denied dropping the Queensland project. It reported that Chinalco had said that it had no internal discussions on pulling out of its $3.04 billion Aurukun bauxite project and that it was carrying out feasibility studies and comparing proposals. Furthermore, quoting Mr Lu Youqing Chinalco: We do not have the consideration of withdrawingfrom this project. It is one example after the other of exaggeration and overclaim (a) by various companies from time to time but (b) being harnessed by those opposite to prosecute a fear campaign. What this says is that the member for North Sydney does not do his homework. It says that the member for North Sydney picks up a clipping from a newspaper and equates that with fundamental, deep research. We expect higher standards from the member for North Sydney in this debate in this chamber. I would suggest if those opposite are running fear campaigns, the first and foremost requirement is to get your facts straight.",30
55,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, will you advise the House of steps taken by the Australian government to enforce new United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iran. What other measures is Australia taking?",31
56,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question, dealing as it does with potentially the most difficult international peace and security issue that the international community will be confronted with over the next 12 to 18 months. On 9 June the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 1929 imposing new sanctions against Iran. Australia welcomed that resolution, which reflected the international community's continuing concern about Iran's nuclear program and its ongoing failure to be in compliance with its international obligations. Australia together with the international community has repeatedly called on Iran to conduct itself in accordance with International Atomic Energy Agency resolutions and to comply with Security Council resolutions. Indeed, the International Atomic Energy Agency's two most recent reports in February and May this year both found that Iran continues to enrich uranium in breach of its international obligations and that it has not provided either the necessary evidence or the necessary cooperation to persuade the IAEA that its program is exclusively for peaceful purposes. Australia also shares the Security Council's desire for a negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, which of course requires Iran to change its policy. We continue to urge Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment programs. Despite these overtures, we are disappointed that Iran has not reversed its path. Indeed, very many people analyse that as a path of confrontation with the international community. Iran Security Council resolution 1929 strengthens obligations on nation states to prevent the supply to Iran of goods and services that could contribute to Iran's nuclear industry-a proliferation sensitive nuclear industry-and also to its missile delivery technology and programs. As well, it imposes a heavy obligation on the part of nation states to prevent the supply of military equipment and related services to Iran. The resolution also targets Iran's transport and financial sectors as well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in response to the corps' role in Iran's nuclear activities and the development of a weapons system. The resolution includes new financial sanctions against 41 individuals and entities in Iran. Australia's United Nations enforcement sanctions law will see that those financial sanctions have immediate effect and Australia will implement the other aspects of the resolution as expeditiously as possible. To reinforce those measures, earlier today I announced that Australia will impose additional autonomous sanctions against one individual and two organisations that assist Iran in its violation of its obligations under Security Council resolutions. Australia has imposed autonomous sanctions against Iran since October 2008 and today's announcement will now bring to a total of 21 individuals and 20 organisations subject to Australia's autonomous sanctions. Those additional organisations are Bank Mellat and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines. The individual is General Rostam Qasemi, the commander of Khatem ol-Anbiya Construction Organisation, a company owned by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is expressly referred to in resolution 1929 and already covered by our autonomous sanctions. We are taking these additional measures to ensure that Australia is at the forefront of those countries seeking to put pressure on Iran to change its policy in this area. These additional autonomous sanctions combined with our already rigorous implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, including our proposed implementation of resolution 1929, will continue to ensure that our concern is backed up by action and that our concern matches that of the international community. As I said in my opening remarks, this is potentially the single, biggest peace and security challenge which the international community faces. Australia again calls on Iran to conduct itself in accordance with its international legal obligations and seek to resolve this matter through a change of policy as quickly as possible. Budget",31
57,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Min in north-west Queensland. As a result of the great big new tax on mining, two of his three drilling rigs are now idle, current contracts have been halved, two new projects worth up to $250,000 have disappeared and four workers are about to be laid off. My question to the Prime Minister is: why won'the visit Cloncurry to explain to Mr Kelly that there is no problem really, that he does not have anything to worry about and that, in fact, the great big new tax on mining will be good for jobs and investment-or does he think that Mr Kelly is just part of a scare campaign conspiracy too?",32
58,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I am unaware of the circumstances surrounding Mr Kelly's business, but we will now investigate the circumstances surrounding his business. I would also say in response to the Leader of the Opposition that, if he consulted the documents attached with the Treasury's tax reform package released on 2 May, he would see that they go to the future modelling impact on the mining industry as a whole: first of all, the increase in overall investment in the mining industry by between 4.5 and 5.5 per cent; and, secondly, the overall increase in employment in the mining industry by seven per cent. I therefore am always reluctant to simply take anything which is said across the dispatch box by those opposite, particularly given the question asked just before by the member for Sydney-which went so well!-without actually further testing the facts. I also note that, if the question asked was to about developments in the state of Queensland, I should raise our good friend Mr Clive Palmer again as well. Remember, on the question of impact on projects, Clive, the patron saint of the Liberal-National Partyat least the funder-in-chief of the Liberal National PartyMr Martin Ferguson-And campaign director.",32
59,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and campaign director of the Liberal-National Party-told South Australians he was cancelling projects in their state. We have been at work on this now for about two or three weeks. We cannot find those projects. Nobody can find those projects. Frankly, we are of the view that those projects may never have existed. So, when it comes to scare campaigns about individual projects, we are more than interested in separating fact from fear from fiction, which is important in this debate. What we do know is that actions always speak louder than words on this matter of the negative impact of the government's tax reform proposal for the mining industry on the interests of the economy at large and investors et cetera.

Secondly, for the small businesses in Cloncurry, they would all obtain a tax break in terms of $5,000 worth of assets purchased in a given year. On top of that again",33

72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,34
73,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The employment impact in regions of north-west Queensland would be the aggregate effect of what we are doing in terms of (1) the tax systems applied to the mining industry, both for the exploration and for the extraction side of the industry, (2) the tax reform for other businesses operating in the industry or outside the industry, which is a two percentage point reduction in the company tax rate and (3) all the small businesses in Cloncurry to which he refers, who will benefit if they are incorporated by the two percentage point reduction in the company tax and also, significantly, in terms of the $5,000 asset tax break as well. Taking these things together, the overall impact nationwide is a positive impact on employment in the economy and a positive impact on employment within the mining industry by 7.7 per cent. But the critical thing which I think the House would like to know is the impact of this tax overall. I am advised just now by others, by the way, that Australian mining stocks are now performing better relative to those in Canada. I would just ask people to consider that as a mere matter of fact which the member for North Sydney is not engaged in. Critically, in terms of the member for Dickson, the BHP share price is up 1.5 per cent over the last week. Onya, Pete! You have done the right thing.

Will the Deputy Prime Minister please update the House on the government's record investment in our schools and are there any threats to this funding, particularly for the communities of northern New South Wales?",34
77,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Page for her question. I know that she is deeply concerned about investing in schools in her community so that every child can get a great education and investing to support jobs, particularly during these difficult days of the global financial crisis and global recession. On this side of the House, we stand for delivering a strong economy so people can get jobs and for investing in the services that families need, making sure families get their fair share, and there is nothing more important than the quality of the local school to which their child goes. Last week we saw some of the results of our investment in jobs with a 5.2 per cent unemployment rate. This rate has been achieved because, when faced with the global financial crisis, we did what had to be done to keep Australia working. If we had listened to the Leader of the Opposition, we would not have provided economic stimulus. We would be in recession now and hundreds of thousands of more Australians would be unemployed. Let us look at the statistics. Building the Education Revolution itself was responsible for 32 per cent of the value of non-residential building approvals over the year to April 2010-that is, a third of non-residential economic activity was from Building the Education Revolution. If the Leader of the Opposition had his way, this would be brought to a shuddering halt-a third of economic activity in that sector, a third of jobs under threat from the Leader of the Opposition. It is about jobs, but it is also about invest300,000 ing in schools. If we look at what has been funded up to the end of April 2010, Building the Education Revolution has funded 3,052 new classrooms, 3,017 libraries, 2,822 multipurpose halls, 289 science centres, 179 language centres and 78 dual-purpose centres. In northern New South Wales, about which I am asked, in the electorate of Cowper Building the Education Revolution has funded 23 libraries, 30 new classrooms, 17 multipurpose halls, four language centres and five science centres. All of this is under threat from the Leader of the Opposition. When he was asked whether, as Prime Minister, he would guarantee the same quantum of funding for Building the Education Revolution he said, in the language of the Leader of the Opposition-you can tell that-‘Well, look, um, ah, I'm not going to give you that absolute commitment.' That is the gospel truth for, ‘There will be cutbacks and these projects will not be delivered.' Mr Secker- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this goes to House of Representatives Practice on page 490 where it is considered very bad behaviour by parliamentarians to mimic other MPs.",34

80,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thanks to the member for Barker for that critique of my skills-that was very impressive. Beyond these threats to projects under Building the Education Revolution, there is a threat to computers in schools. We as a government have delivered more computers, and had them installed, during the 2½ years of the life of this government than kids in years 9 to 12 had at the end of 12 years of the Howard governmentinstalled, 210,000 at the end of 12 years of government. What this means in the electorate of Cowper is that we funded 5,241 new computers and delivered 3,972 of them. If the Leader of the Opposition has his way, there will be no more computers for kids in that area. Then when it comes to trade training centres, of course we have been benefiting schools around the country-230 projects benefiting 732 schools. But if the Leader of the Opposition has his way then 1,800 schools will not be able to benefit from our Trade Training Centres in Schools Program, getting real skills for real jobs. What that means in Cowper is that, if the Leader of the Opposition had his way, the $4.5 million project benefiting Macksville High School and the trade training centre there, which is being participated in by Bowraville Central and Nambucca Heads high schools, would not go ahead. The $1.5 million project for Bellingen High School's trade training centre would not go ahead-real kids losing out on real opportunities because of the conduct of the Leader of the Opposition. This is extreme policy making aimed at education, aimed at kids. I am still looking for a member of the opposition who will stand up for their local community and tell the Leader of the Opposition he is wrong. The member for Cowper most certainly is not one.

81,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the Deloitte WA share index, underpinned by Western Australian mining companies, which fell 12.6 per cent in May, significantly more than any other major international share index. Does the Prime Minister accept that he was wrong when he claimed the supertax on mining had no impact on the share values of mining companies and on the retirement incomes of millions of Australians?",35
82,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Curtin for her question and I inform the House that I am advised that since the end of April the US market has fallen by eight per cent, the UK market by 6 per cent, the euro markets by five per cent, Hong Kong by five per cent, Japan by nearly 11 per cent, and Australia has been down by just over six per cent. That is the first point. Can I also go to the second point, which I partly referred to before: Australia's resources stocks have been down over the same period by about five per cent. That is less than the overall ASX. Let's just be very clear about that. Furthermore-and I draw this to the honourable member's attention, because facts are a problem when you are running a fear campaign-over the same period of time the Canadian resource stocks have been down by about six per cent and Australian stocks by five per cent. Can I just say to those opposite: I do not think there is a debate in Canada at the moment about tax reform in the mining industry. I would suggest to her that she actually pay attention to factual analysis of what is happening around the world. The member for North Sydney sought before, frankly, to mislead the House in terms of key facts concerning projects.

Secondly, in terms of our mining stocks, they have performed better than the Brazilian company Vale that I just referred to as well as the Canadian exchange, and I referred to those figures before. It was very good to see the member for Curtin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, out there engaged in her protest activities the other day in Perth. It was a bit a like protest by Prada I thought. You had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition out there campaigning hard in a designer type demonstration. It was good. It was effective. The message was heard clearly.

91,Mr HALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Why is it critical that the government's welfare reforms commence as early as possible?",37
92,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for his question. As he knows, the government are determined to make sure we provide welfare responsibly and we are determined to also make sure that welfare encourages personal responsibility and supAnd ports people to do the right thing, especially by their children. That is why our major welfare reforms, commencing in the Northern Territory, are critical. Income management will be used to fight passive welfare and also to increase personal responsibility. What we want to see is people making sure that their children go to school, and we want to see young people getting into work and training. We intend to do everything we possibly can to fight passive welfare and to link income support to school attendance and to study and work. These requirements are not in place at the current time. Our reforms that are currently before the Senate extend the benefits of income management to both Indigenous and nonIndigenous people who are in need of financial protection and better financial structure in their lives. The reforms that we intend to put in place are non-discriminatory. They will apply across the Northern Territory, in the towns-places like Tennant Creek and Katherine-as well as in the suburbs of Darwin and Alice Springs. From our point of view, income management is a very useful and important tool for protecting vulnerable people, particularly for protecting children. It makes sure that welfare payments are spent on the essentials of life-things like food, clothing and rentand not on alcohol and drugs. I am certainly very aware that there are very strong views held on welfare reform, but where is the dignity of a life spent on welfare? Where is the dignity for children in not being properly fed or clothed? And I have to say there is no dignity at all in teaching the next generation that a welfare cheque is the best that they can expect from their lives. So, from our point of view, income management is a vital measure to protect the basic rights and to make sure the most vulnerable in our community are protected so that they can have the same sorts of aspirations that other Australians aspire to: a decent job, a decent home, a safe and healthy life. We do have a number of people calling for this legislation to get through the Senate as quickly as possible. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Mick Gooda and the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance in the Northern Territory are just two calling for the passage of these reforms in the coming fortnight. The legislation in the Senate at the moment also reinstates the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act in the Northern Territory. So it would be completely irresponsible to delay these reforms, which are designed to protect and assist vulnerable people. We want to see this legislation debated and agreed to in the Senate in the next fortnight so that vulnerable people in the Northern Territory are able to get the help that they need and that they have been waiting for for too long. Medicare",37
93,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, more than 30,000 Australians who had Medicare claims for cataract surgery between 1 November last year and 1 February this year are hundreds of dollars out of pocket due to the repeated failure of this place and the Senate to pass proposed changes to the Medicare rebate. Prime Minister, will you review the case of 72-year-old Port Macquarie pensioner Patricia Parker, who through no fault of her own is $758 out of pocket after falling victim to this political episode, with your consideration of compensation for out-of-pocket expenses for her and the 30,000 other Australians unfairly affected?",38
94,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyne for his question. On the question of the constituent to which he refers, can I say that we will obviously examine the circumstances surrounding that constituent. I am advised on my way to the dispatch box by the health minister that there is some gap between one set of arrangements and another, and this may well have affected an individual concerned.

97,Mr SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister update the House on the rollout of the government's GP superclinics to improve primary care services? What risks are there to these initiatives, particularly for the communities in the north of Brisbane?",38
98,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Longman for his question. It is a very good question across the country, not just in the northern suburbs of Brisbane. But, of course, one of the biggest risks does currently live in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, although he is trying to get a seat somewhere else, and that is the member for Dickson. He, as the shadow health spokesperson, and the Leader of the Opposition of course do not support GP superclinics. He has not bothered to turn up and see that the improved share of services being provided to his community in Strathpine is actually something that has been welcomed with open arms. But let me go back a few steps, because there is some other good news about the superclinics program across the country which I think members would be interested in. I know the member for Gilmore, who does not appear to be in the House at the moment, would be interested to know that the new electorate of Gilmore but the current electorate of Throsby is soon to benefit from the Shell Cove superclinic. I was there today with the member for Throsby and the member for Cunningham to turn the first sod for this superclinic. Before those opposite interject, I would like to ask whether anyone in this House, other than, of course, the two members who were with me, know how many doctors there currently are in Shell Cove, Shellharbour Village and Flinders. When this superclinic is open early next year, it will provide GP services, nursing services and allied health services, and currently in all of the three rounding suburbs there is not a single doctor. This is the legacy that was left to us by the previous government. This has been turned around by our investments in superclinics, but unfortunately it is slated by the opposition to be closed. So future clinics that will be invested in, that were announced in the budget, have already been put on the Leader of the Opposition's cutting list, which we know is something that the Leader of the Opposition has such a bad reputation for. But it is not just the Shell Cove superclinic. The Parliamentary Secretary for Health and the member for Kingston last week inspected the start of work at the $25 million Noarlunga GP Plus Superclinic, which will be offering multidisciplinary care with extended operating hours. Last Wednesday I was pleased to inspect, with the member for Hasluck, the plans for the $10 million Midland GP superclinic. I inform those opposite that there was a very enthusiastic",38

101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Dickson is warned!,39
102,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Dickson is not keen for me to finish this sentence because he is aware that the state Liberal MP for the area, Frank Alban, was there with the member for Hasluck and me to inspect the plans, because of course this is a joint project between the Western Australian Liberal government and our government. In fact, Mr Frank Alban, the local member, threatenedand I will quote his somewhat colourful language-quite serious bodily harm to any Liberal who dared to question the future of the clinic. This Midland superclinic is going surto be in the old railway yards, and he said that any Liberal who wanted to oppose the clinic would be ‘hanging from the rafters of the railway yards'. I would not like to go that far, but I do think that he is clearly making a point that people who understand the services that are being provided in the community support them. Unfortunately, those opposite do not. Now I want to talk little bit more about the Strathpine superclinic, which is of course part of the question asked of me by the member for Longman. Since January, when this clinic was opened, to 26 May-the latest data that we have-there have been more than 17,000 presentations at this clinic: 11,300 GP consultations, 1,800 pathology consultations and 3,900 allied and nursing consultations. You have to wonder, given these extraordinary numbers, how it is that the member for Dickson, on a margin of just 217 votes, does not think it a good idea to provide thousands of services to his constituents in Strathpine. There are not only six new GPs at the clinics; there is a new female GPMr Dutton interjecting",39
103,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Dickson will resume his seat.

The minister has the call.",39
104,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker, I think that is a question that is being asked in the electorate of Dickson.",40
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will resume her seat. I am in danger of giving one of my lectures that people get upset about. I do not believe that this is a debating time, but I think that if people were to observe the amount of debate that I allow in questions from those on my left they would know that it is to balance the amount of debate that has always been contained in answers-always-and some of those with ministerial experience on the front bench on my left know that full well. The minister has the call and those members on my left know that the type of question contained by way of debate in an answer can in no way be responded to within the standing orders.",40
106,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, there is a reason that the opposition are so touchy about this: they have slated GP superclinics for their health cuts. The Leader of the Opposition has a record for pulling a billion dollars out of our hospitals. He already has on his list of the next cuts GP superclinics, investments in primary care infrastructure, e-health, and now also diabetes. The member for Dickson has not had the decency to turn up at the superclinic in his electorate to see what services they are operating. The question that the member for Dickson and the Liberal Party have to confront next is: when we open applications for GP clinics across the country to be able to apply to expand their facilities-and in the seat of Dickson there are 145 doctors who will be able to apply for grants of up to half a million dollars-will the member for Dickson be writing to those GPs informing them of this great program available to assist in the expansion of their services that can support their constituents, or will he be writing perhaps more honestly to them and telling them",40
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will bring her answer to a conclusion.,40
108,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that this support is not provided? It is important because I was asked about the support for primary care services in the northern suburbs of Brisbane. There are doctors in the northern suburbs of Brisbane who want to expand their practices, who want to be able to employ nurses and allied health professionals, and our government is making a program available where up to half a million dollars is available for those practices. The Liberal Party oppose it and the member for Dickson needs to spend a little bit more time concentrating on getting a fair share for his constituents rather than just worrying about his own shares",40
109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will conclude her answer.,40
110,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,and that would be a better investment of his time here in this House. Education Funding,40
111,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education. Is the minister aware that the Brungle Primary School in my electorate was allocated $250,000 under her school hall stimulus program? Is the minister also aware that the school obtained an independent quote to build a new library for $75,000? Instead, they have been told they must use a state-appointed contractor to build a library which is smaller and costs $250,000. Does the minister agree that this bungle in Brungle could have been avoided had the school self-managed their project?",40
112,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question and her very clever alliteration. That is an innovation for question time. I am aware that these claims have been raised about Brungle. I am aware that they received some publicity. I am also aware that there is a question about the quotes as opposed to the actual costs involved for Brungle. What I would say to the member is: yes, I am aware that an investigation has been conducted into the claims about the quotes versus the actualities, and I am very happy to provide the member with details should she want further information. The school, as I understand it, is in the electorate of Eden-Monaro, so obviously the member for that electorate in this place will be very well aware of the matter. I can also say to her that, should she or any member of the school community believe that further work needs to be done on this question, they can refer the matter to the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce, which has been set up with the purpose of looking at these questions. It is led by a leading Australian businessperson who is of course travelling to schools as we speak and dealing with any questions schools may have. I remind the member-and she knows this from her own local school community; I am very well aware that she does-that, if we look across the Building the Education Revolution program, we see it has involved 9,500 schools and 24,000 projects. There are many, many school communities, including in the member's own electorate, who are delighted with their project, delighted with the investment and delighted with the support that it has provided to local jobs, to the extent that there are concerns that there be a clear process for addressing these issues through the implementation task force. I also remind the member that, if we had determined to go the way that she indicated with her vote in this House and that the Leader of the Opposition indicated with his vote in this House and not provided economic stimulus, we would see a couple of hundred thousand more Australians unemployed and we would not see one dollar spent on the schools in her electorate. I know the member who has asked this question reasonably well, and I do not genuinely believe that she wanted to see zero invested in her local schools. Workplace Relations",40
113,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the minister outline to the House the impact of workplace relations policies on workers in female dominated industries like the retail and hospitality sectors?",41
114,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. I know that she is deeply concerned with fairness in Australian workplaces, particularly for Australian women. She has asked me about how workplace relations systems can support fairness for working women. Of course you can support fairness for working women if you have a decent safety net that cannot be stripped away, if you have a proper pay equity principle that allows equal pay cases to be taken and appropriately prosecuted, if you have a low-paid bargaining stream which enables predominantly female dominated industries to enjoy the benefits of collective bargaining, and if you have an independent umpire and a regular minimum wages case which means that minimum wages are fairly adjusted, as we have recently seen from Fair Work Australia. You can support working women if you allow appropriate flexibilities at work, underpinned by the safety net; you can support working women if you protect good working women, women who have proved to be hard workers, from unfair dismissal. Of course the Fair Work system does all of that. Australians remember very vividly Work Choices-a system of workplace relations supported by those opposite that did not give any of these protections to working women, that enabled the pay of working Australians to be cut back with no compensation. Let us quickly go through the statistics. Under the Australian workplace agreements that the Liberal Party used to rejoice in, we recall statistics that 63 per cent saw their penalty rates cut, 52 per cent saw shift work cut, 51 per cent saw overtime loadings cut, 46 per cent saw public holiday pay cut and 22 per cent were provided with no pay rise over the life of the agreement, some for up to five years. This was bad for working people but it was particularly bad for working women. Let us look at the statistics in female dominated industries. Research in 2007 found in retail, obviously female dominated, that casual and part-time sales assistants working a 12-hour week lost on average 12 per cent of their earnings if they were on an Australian workplace agreement-a truly amazing statistic. Permanent part-time retail workers on the same hours lost 18 per cent of their earnings on Australian workplace agreements. In hospitality, once again a female dominated industry, it was the same story. Workers on Australian workplace agreements suffered losses of between six and 12 per cent of their income-rip-off after rip-off, particularly for working women. Research on Victorian workers under Work Choices found that if you were a median worker on an Australian Workplace Agreement you earned 16.3 per cent less compared to the median worker on a collective agreement. If you were a woman, you earned 18.7 per cent less than a woman on a collective agreement. For the most disadvantaged groups, female labourers and related workers, AWA workers were paid a whopping 26 per cent less than similar women on collective agreements. These are stunning statistics about the rip-off that Work Choices was for working women. What that rip-off means is that women went to work and could not complain because of the threat of unfair dismissal; they had absolutely no right to take an unfair dismissal claim in almost all Australian businesses-you just had to cop it, even though that pay reduction might the mean that you could no longer pay your mortgage, even though that pay reduction might mean that meeting the ordinary household bills to put food on the table was really putting stress and strain on you. Many Australians might believe that these are the horror stories of the Work Choices past but we need to remind ourselves these could be the contemporary stories of the future if the Leader of the Opposition has his way. He is lock, stock and barrel committed to Work Choices. He is turning his head because he does not want Australians to know the truth. He is on the record, time after time, as a devotee of Work Choices. Even in his budget reply speech he endorsed the central elements that made Work Choices the rip-off that it was. The message for working women is very clear. When they look at the Leader of the Opposition they see a man with a track record of statements that would concern women, including working women, and they see a man committed to industrial relations extremism and committed to the return of Work Choices.

116,Mr GARRETT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts) (3.54 pm)-by leaveNext week, I shall attend the 62nd annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission, the IWC, a meeting that is shaping up to be a watershed in the conservation of whales in the 21st century. This meeting will consider a proposal to sanction commercial whaling-a proposal which Australia believes is deeply defective. As I have said previously, the government has carefully considered this proposal and has concluded that it falls well short of anything Australia could support. We strongly support efforts to find a negotiated solution to differences over whaling. The process has yielded some good results, and there are some features in the proposal which has been put forward by the Chair and Co-chair of the IWC which are worthy of discussion. We commend the chairs for their efforts. Those who would support the chairs' proposal have emphasised that all sides must compromise if agreement is to be reached. But this is no compromise-the current proposal is patently unbalanced in favour of whaling nations. And the critical question is: if the proposal is passed as it stands what will the IWC have agreed? The answer is it will have agreed to legitimise commercial whaling for 10 years at quotas which will sanction the killing of almost 13,000 whales. It will have agreed to hunting on vulnerable endangered whale species and on humpbacks in the Northern Hemisphere. It will have sanctioned the killing of whales in the Southern Ocean-an IWC-agreed sanctuary. It will have set whaling quotas using ad hoc measures rather than IWC-agreed scientific procedures. And it will have put off, to yet another working group, efforts to definitively address issues of critical importance to Australia, including so-called ‘scientific' whaling. If such a deal were to go through, Australians would need to resign themselves to watching the slaughter of whales in the Southern Ocean, year after year, over the next decade. We may protest, but the IWC would have made it so. The proponents of the compromise argue that this will be a transitional arrangement, a truce between whaling and antiwhaling countries, that will hopefully lead to a permanent settlement of the contentious issues. Australia also seeks a resolution of differences on whaling, and would support reform that enabled the commission to achieve substantial progress through consensus and cooperation. But a bad deal, particularly if driven through the commission on a split vote, is unlikely to achieve the reconciliation we all desire. The proponents claim that only an agreement allowing a return to commercial whaling will save the IWC. But their characterisation of the organisation as a dysfunctional body powerless to control whaling is an overly negative view of the IWC which ignores the organisation's considerable strengths. The IWC remains in need of reform, but there is a bright future for the body if it can move further in the direction of a modern conservation oriented organisation. Characterising the IWC as dysfunctional ignores the IWC's recent initiatives such as collaborative non-lethal whale research, progress in developing conservation management plans, efforts to address whale entanglement and ship strikes, and the promotion of sustainable whale-watching industries. Australia is proud to be playing a strong role in these initiatives. Most importantly, the IWC is the custodian of the global moratorium on commercial whaling, which remains the single most important contributing factor to improved whale conservation in the world today. Many would argue that the IWC chairs' proposal would be preferable to the status quo. Unfortunately, this proposal would in fact wind back much of the progress we have made since the implementation of the moratorium. It would see a return to block whaling quotas, which were effectively abandoned by the IWC as a failed management tool decades ago. It would undo much of the hard work undertaken over many years in the commission to embed rigorous science as the basis for IWC management decisions. It also does not do enough to move towards an end to commercial whaling. Even if one just looks at numbers, the improvement on the status quo would be unimpressive, merely a reduction of only 175 whales killed globally in each of the first five years of 10-year agreement, and 380 a year thereafter. Three thousand whales would still be killed in the Southern Ocean sanctuary. Sadly, there is no guarantee that after the proposed 10year agreement expires, the number of whales hunted would not return to existing levels or even higher than the status quo. As a country which seeks the eventual elimination of all commercial whaling, including so called ‘scientific' whaling, this would be unacceptable to Australia. Critically, the proposal is mute as to what happens after 10 years. There are no commitments that any conservation gains will be maintained, no commitment that the loopholes in the convention will be addressed, no commitment that the proposed South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary will continue and no commitment that additional species of whales will not be targeted for hunting. Commercial whaling under the moratorium is considered by many analysts to be a dying industry. Consumer demand is very low and whaling in most cases is propped up by government subsidies. Annual whale kill quotas set by the three whaling nations are rarely met, and there is little market for the whales that are caught. Much of the meat sits unsold in warehouses. International trade in whale meat is banned. Left to its own, it is an industry that should and would die a natural death. Given this state of affairs, it is obvious that for the IWC to authorise large-scale whaling in the Southern Ocean and whaling on endangered species would not amount to any improvement on the status quo and may, indeed, entrench whaling for years to come. I will not, however, be travelling to Morocco as a defender of the status quo. Australia will attend the meeting with clear goals to achieve further conservation oriented reform. In Australia's view the role of science is paramount for the IWC to be an effective 21st century organisation. Consistent with the the government's objectives of ending unilateral scientific whaling and bringing scientific research under the auspices of a reformed commission, on 6 December 2008, I announced that the Australian government will invest a total of $32 million over six years in non-lethal research and other initiatives to combat so-called ‘scientific' whaling. This investment includes: i. $14 million working with nations around the world in the Southern Ocean Research Partnership-the largest of its kind in the world-supporting a series of innovative surveys in the Southern Ocean using aircraft and ships to deploy the latest nonlethal research techniques, as well as tracking whales along Australian coasts; and I recently announced more than $668,000 of non-lethal whale and dolphin research funding. ii. $14.6 million for the Australian Marine Mammal Centre, co-located at Hobart's Australian Antarctic Division, to provide competitive grants for applied, strategic, non-lethal research and related activities. The Southern Ocean Research Partnership, backed by the Australian Marine Mammal Centre, will deliver valuable, nonlethal research on an international scale and confirm once again that whales do not need to be killed in the name of science. Australia has adopted a positive approach in IWC negotiations. We have not simply sat back and criticised the ideas of others. We have been constructive. We have argued for and delivered increased provisions on conservation and the protection of whales from new threats like climate change and ocean pollution. Ahead of the IWC annual meeting, we also developed a strong Australian proposal for the future of the IWC. Australia's nine-point proposal, which I released on 25 February this year, seeks robust conservation measures including the complete phasing-out of whaling in the Southern Ocean within five years, an end to whaling in all sanctuaries, and an immediate reduction to zero in the take of vulnerable and endangered species and populations. We are heartened by the number of conservation-minded countries, who, on the eve of this crucial IWC conference, are declaring themselves forcefully for whale conservation and against such practices as whaling in the Southern Ocean sanctuary and whaling on vulnerable and threatened species. I particularly want to applaud the efforts of the Latin American countries, including Brazil and Mexico, and many European countries, particularly the United Kingdom and Germany-and there are others-to ensure the outcome from this crucial meeting of the International Whaling Commission does not undo all the conservation gains of the past two decades. We will keep working with these and other countries to promote genuine IWC reform and improved protection for whales globally. Perhaps the whaling countries will be receptive to this. But, unfortunately, this is expressed as our hope rather than our expectation. The fact is that to date, the response of the whaling countries has not been positive. Recent statements by whaling countries in the commission have provided Australia with little cause for hope that our serious commitment to conservation of the world's whales will be reflected in any IWC compromise agreement. In particular there seems to be little chance that whaling in the Southern Ocean will be brought to an end or that the misuse of the article VIII scientific whaling provision of the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling will be definitively addressed. The government has always said if we could not find a diplomatic resolution to differences over ‘scientific' whaling, we would pursue legal action. For this reason, Australia has initiated legal action in the International Court of Justice in The Hague against Japanese ‘scientific' whaling in the Southern Ocean. Australia has been involved in the discussions on the future of the IWC because we believe the commission has a robust future as a conservation focused organisation. We do not subscribe to the view that the only way to ensure the organisation's future is for it to return to its past, policing the development of a heavily subsidised whaling industry. The Rudd government believes that in the 21st century the commission must move forward to embrace a contemporary approach to the conservation of living resources; one that acknowledges the dramatic increase in whale watching as an economic activity which now dwarfs whaling as a source of income for a growing number of countries around the world; one that recognises that you do not need to kill whales to learn about them; and one that acknowledges the extraordinary level of public concern about our treatment of the world's whales. Australia will continue to play an active and committed role in the forthcoming IWC discussions. We will continue to engage with the other 87 IWC member nations, including many former whaling nations like Australia, to convince the final three remaining whaling nations that whale watching, not whale hunting, is the way of the future. We are in the final days before the next commission meeting. I note the multiple different positions that those opposite have on this issue-particularly confusing, given the recent comment by the member for Flinders, who described the commission as ‘corrupt'. The government calls on those opposite to support our actions at next week's IWC meeting. Australia is a global leader when it comes to the conservation and protection of whales around the world. This government has done more on this issue than has ever been the case in the past. We remain resolutely opposed to commercial and so-called scientific whaling. With our conservation-minded colleagues both in Latin America and in key European nations we have been leading the fight in the commission to prevent the legitimisation of commercial whaling and the undermining of the moratorium, and we will continue that fight next week at the IWC meeting in Agadir in Morocco.

117,Ms MACKLIN,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE SCHEME,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (4.08 pm)-by leave-I thank the member for Flinders for allowing this short interruption. For the information of honourable members, I present a petition on paid parental leave entitled ‘Time to deliver'. This morning the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Status of Women and I received this petition from 25,000 Australians calling on all members of parliament to support a paid parental leave scheme operational from 1 January next year. This petition has been coordinated by the ACTU and is a rollcall of all those Australians who have been waiting decades for a national paid parental leave scheme. Some 25,000 Australians have signed the petition and have signed up to the scheme that we have designed. Retail workhad ers; nurses; teachers; university students; electricians; construction workers; workers in hospitality, finance, forestry, local government and the airlines; workers on the waterfront; rail, tram and bus drivers; schoolkids; mums; dads; and grandparentsthe list goes on-are calling on their members of parliament to give Australian working families access to a fair national paid parental leave scheme. The trade union movement in Australia has been at the forefront of the battle for paid parental leave for a long time. All of it is in the best interests of babies and their parents. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Sharan Burrow, the ACTU President, for her determination and leadership. We expect we are now days away from achieving a very significant step forward for Australian working families-a national government funded paid parental leave scheme that will give thousands of Australian families more time with their babies, a scheme that is fair to families and fair to businesses, a scheme that, as this petition shows, Australian families want. It is a great privilege to have been able to table this petition with the support of the member for Sydney, the Minister for the Status of Women. We know that this is in the best interests of Australian working families and their children.",46

Question agreed to.",47
120,Mr HUNT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The coalition support clearly, simply, absolutely a total ban on scientific whaling wherever it may occur. We support a total ban on commercial whaling wherever it may occur. There is no justification for scientific or commercial whaling in the 21st century. That relic of history has passed. That moment in time has gone. We now seek to ensure a global regime for protecting these great and majestic marine mammals, whether they are humpbacks, minkes or other whales, that find themselves threatened not just by current practices but by at this moment the potential resumption of commercial whaling. It is a trend, a movement and a proposal which we will oppose clearly and absolutely. The coalition also support and propose international legal action against scientific whaling. We want to make sure, of course, that it is appropriate and effective, but our support is clear on this issue. We know that the International Whaling Commission is subject to corrupt practices and there has been a blind eye turned abroad and domestically to those acts and practices of corruption which go to the heart of the way the International Whaling Commission operates. I am sad to report that fact, but it is critical that we do so. I want to set out three propositions today. Whaling Firstly, the International Whaling Commission in its current form is corrupt in its constitution and unacceptable in its practices. Secondly, we support international legal action, of course, on the basis that it is appropriate and effective. Thirdly, we have a very clear, strong and proud history, having set up the ban in 1980 on whaling in Australian for a waters and the Australian Antarctic Whale Sanctuary in 2000 under different coalition governments. That is our position. Our pledge is to fight consistently and persistently against commercial and scientific whaling in any form in any place and in every form in every place. Let me make these points: there are elements of bipartisanship about the means and the objectives but there are points of disagreement about the effectiveness and the intent in the way in which this campaign has been carried on over the last 2½ years. First, it is absolutely clear that the Australian government has turned a blind eye over the last 2½ years to the corruption which has addled the heart of the International Whaling Commission. Let it be known that four years ago, as it became increasingly clear that the processes and practices of the IWC had been distorted and were no longer acceptable, the then coalition minister for the environment, Senator Ian Campbell, said on 22 June 2006 that there was corruption in the IWC practices and that there was clear evidence of vote buying. I do not know whether he was the first such minister around the world to make those allegations but I do know that he made them loudly, clearly and courageously. In fact he has gone on in his post-parliamentary career to be committed to the practice of eradicating scientific and commercial whaling from the world in the 21st century. I quote his words because they were made four years ago: “I think that some of the practices within the over many years could be called corrupt,” he “It's been happening in the last couple of years, these sorts of practices have been going on for many years.” What we see here is, very clearly, a strong and courageous statement that what was occurring in the IWC had to be exposed. Instead over the last 2½ years this body, which has been addled to its heart, has been used as a diversion from the fact that the government was in prolonged breach of its multiple pre-election promises to take Japanese whaling to the international court. We have seen the IWC used as a cover to imply action when in fact there has been inaction. Worse than that, there has been a blind eye turned to the practices which have so addled this international body. We have seen that Australia has been a handmaiden to what is increasingly emerging as a shabby deal. The minister and I are in agreement that what is on the table now will see 13,000 whales slaughtered, will put humpbacks at risk, will see the risk of commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean and will see the continuation of scientific whaling. And Australia was at the table as the deal was being crafted. It was only after reports revealed that Australia was part of the negotiations which ultimately led to this deal that the government was forced to back away from it. They were part and parcel of an approach which would have allowed commercial whaling. We now see that the Australian government was caught out. They were handmaidens to a shabby deal and they made Australia complicit in developing a shabby and unacceptable deal for Australians of good faith everywhere. What is about to occur in Morocco is a critical moment. We face a terrible risk that the more than two decades of international moratorium will be overturned and that IWC commercial whaling will find approval. Aussaid. tralia must be successful in opposing this shabby deal. I am hopeful that that will be the case and I hope, sincerely, that we are not being softened-up for a defeat. I can only believe that there are enough countries of good faith to defeat what must surely be deemed as a retrograde step with regard to whaling. How have we come to this position? The second point in relation to the International Court of Justice case is that there were five years of promises from the Australian Labor Party and from the minister in question. Going back to 20 May 2005, the then shadow foreign affairs spokesperson and now Prime Minister promised that they would take action, promised that there should be immediate action, promised on multiple occasions that on coming to government a Labor Party would take immediate action. What we now know of course is that there was no immediate action. We saw a series of different breaches. The Oceanic Viking, which had been promised, was delayed and delayed before making a brief tour to the south. The flights, which were to oversee the Japanese whaling ship, never materialised until the last moment. At that point there was no direct contact with any of the active whaling fleet and they were simply spotters. In other words the promises were never delivered. Most significantly this year, as the government's promise was postponed in February by the Prime Minister until after the next election, they came under increasing public pressure to finally live up to their promises and to live up to that which they had told the Australian people was a sacred duty. Firstly, on 16 March 2010 the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Julie Bishop, wrote to the foreign affairs minister and made it clear that the coalition saw no impediment to immediate action and that we need not wait until after the election. As long as the advice showed a reasonable chance of success the coalition would support immediate action. It was this pressure which was fundamental in causing the government to walk away from its decision to put the promise for whaling action back until after the next election. Secondly, we know that on 22 May the bell tolled. It was made clear in media reports that the government had not provisioned a single dollar, whether through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Attorney-General's Department or the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, for an international legal case on whaling. The government was caught out. It was that measure, along with the desire six days later on 28 May to cover up the $38 million mining ad campaign, which finally led to the recognition that there would be a case against Japanese whaling. But on 28 May this announcement about court action was made within eight minutes, I am advised, of the revelation of a $38 million mining tax campaign-$38 million for a mining tax advertising campaign in direct breach of a pre-election promise. It was made within eight minutes, so I am advised, of the announcement of this court case. It has every appearance of being a diversion. Can the government advise why they have ignored the advice of Professor Don Rothwell and chosen the ICJ route rather than the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea? We are open-minded on that question. We seek genuine advice on that. We have asked for briefings. I know that in January the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wrote to the then Acting Prime Minister seeking briefings. We await those briefings and we await a briefing on why the ICJ was chosen over the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. I conclude with the coalition's history and position. Our history is very clear. It was a coalition government which in 1980 brought the Whale Protection Act into force, ending the practice of whaling in Australian waters. It was a coalition government under John Howard that implemented the Australian Antarctic Whale Sanctuary, which took form and place and existence on 16 July 2000. A future coalition government has a very simple five-point plan on whaling. Firstly, we will pursue a total ban on commercial and scientific whaling. Secondly, we will pursue, and we support, international legal action to ensure that scientific whaling is eradicated. Thirdly, we support and will pursue a global whale sanctuary. Fourthly, we will implement a whale recovery program-and we will have further details on that as we approach the election. Finally, we will prosecute through diplomatic action an effective case for ending whaling at the grassroots level in Japan, something which has been ignored by this government. Those are the things we will do. For those reasons, we believe Australia must be at the forefront of fighting against commercial whaling and scientific whaling, wherever it occurs. We believe that the government turned a blind eye to the corruption which has addled the heart of the International Whaling Commission. We urge them to fight against every element of the proposed shabby deal in Morocco. We will stand against whaling wherever it occurs, whenever it occurs. NA Rudd Government: Immigration and Border Protection Policies",47
121,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Cook proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The rising cost of the Government's failed immigration and border protection policies. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",50
122,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Cook) (4.26 pm)Today's editorial in the Sydney Daily Telegraph highlights the matter of public importance before the House today. It says: The constant arrival of claimed asylum seekers off Australia's northern coastline comes with a dreadful toll. More than 150 men, women and children, lured by the promises of peoplesmugglers and a belief that Australia offers easy sanctuary, have drowned at sea since 2008. This is a cost rarely mentioned in considering the ongoing issue of asylum seekers. And then there is the financial cost which, while of concern, is now becoming outrageous. It goes on to say: … the Rudd Government seems unable or unwilling to take serious action to stop it. Inaction is driving the various costs involved in this higher by the day. There is nothing humane about policies that encourage people to risk their lives in the hands of people smugglers. People die on boats. This is the inconvenient truth of the asylum seekers debate and the reality for at least hundreds who have perished at sea. People smugglers are not the modern-day equivalent of Oscar Schindler, as some in the public debate romantically suggest. Today's people smugglers are criminal syndicates. They put others' lives at risk for their own profit. If the Prime Minister spent as much time and energy in this House trying to destroy the profits of people smugglers as he does trying to tax the profits of our minerals sector, then perhaps things would be different. But they are not different today. Today we have boats arriving at a rate on average of three per week. This compares to an average of just three per year over the last six years of the Howard government. More people have arrived this month than arrived in total during the last six years of the Howard government once our full suite of measures was in place. In fact, we have had more people arrive illegally by boat in the first five months of this year than in the 13 years following the end of the Vietnam War. Contrary to popular myth, large numbers of people and boats did not arrive on our shores following the Vietnam War. The boats and their passengers were diverted to offshore processing centres, in places like Galang in Indonesia, as part of a plan supported by the Fraser government. During this genuine regional crisis, Indochinese asylum seekers were processed offshore lesser and resettled in the same way as they were processed at Nauru and Manus Island and resettled under the policies of the Howard government. In this context, Malcolm Fraser was indeed a pioneer of offshore processing. Whatever our critics might argue, the Australian public know that John Howard and his government stopped the flow of boats. They have now returned, under this government's failed policies, at an unprecedented rate of arrival. Under the Howard government's policies, people were no longer risking their lives on boats, as they had previously. People smugglers were no longer earning the superprofits they are today. In fact, they were not earning superprofits or profits at all at that time. Our courts were longer jammed with endless appeals from those seeking to have the rejection of their asylum claims overturned and to have their stay extended. Our detention population had fallen by the time we left office to just 449 people, of whom only four had arrived by boat, and just 21 children were being detained. Detention centres such as Curtin and Baxter were closed. New state-of-the-art facilities were built on Christmas Island to cope with the modest arrivals anticipated under the coalition government's policies-not the policy failures of this government. tion introduced reforms to remove children from formal detention and to process health, identity and security checks in parallel with refugee status determination. Those reforms made detention more humane and significantly improved processing efficiency to reduce the time people spent in detention. Those reforms remain coalition policy. The Howard government was confronted with a problem and it delivered a solution. This was done in the face of global asylum applications which at that time were more than 50 per cent higher than they are today. Sadly, the number of refugees and people seeking asylum around the world remains high today. Of the 10½ million people around the world who are refugees-or the 10.4 million, I should say, having just seen the latest report for 2009, which is slightly less-less than one per cent will receive a resettlement in a third country such as Australia. This is a genuinely unique and very precious opportunity that is on offer to a small number of people. Throughout the coalition's time in government, we maintained a strong resettlement program and we remain committed to this program today. We are still the most generous country per capita in terms of resettling refugees around the world and we no boast, as we have for many years, of one of the best resettlement programs anywhere in the world. But, in contrast to the coalition's policy, the Prime Minister's policy serves to provide these places to those who seek to gain places by an illegal mode of entry, displacing those who have come by legal means and who have sought their asylum from offshore places in refugee camps. Those who have come by an illegal method have effectively taken the place of those who would have come by another method and who would have been given the support which is so precious and which is so given by a genThe coali- erous Australian community. But what about those who come to this country by plane, as is often said? Those who arrive by air typically have a valid visa for entry and only a small minority arrive illegally without documentation. I am yet to learn of an asylum seeker who has perished on a 747 heading for Australia. That said, the coalition's temporary protection visa policy will apply equally to those arriving illegally by air or those who have overstayed their visas and have sought asylum as it will to those who arrive illegally by boat. The natural consequence of the Rudd government's failed border protection policies is that our detention centres today are full again and the costs are spiralling out of control. There are now more than 3,600 people in detention. Since the abolition of temporary protection visas, the number of children being detained has grown to 452. There were, as I said earlier, 21 children being detained when the coalition left office. Under this very government's policies, there are now 452 children being detained. So do not be deluded: when boats are arriving at the rate under this government, there are always going to be children coming on boats, but if no boats are coming then there will be no children coming on boats. Under this government, people are being detained in tents, in overcrowded facilities and in remote areas, including the Curtin detention centre closed by the Howard government and reopened by the Rudd government. This year's budget outlines a budget blowout of more than $1 billion on offshore asylum processing costs. Yet these estimates mask an even bigger blow-out. The Rudd government is predicting just 2,000 arrivals in 2010-11 and in the following year 1,260. In this year's budget they assume 4,500 people will be coming to Australia-having forecast in the budget a year ago that only 200 people would come. So far this year 5,352 people have come and the year is not out yet. This means that the government is forecasting a drop in illegal boat arrivals more than 60 per cent in 2010-11. According to the budget presented in the House by this government a month ago, in just a few weeks time we are going to have a 60 per cent decline in the number of people coming illegally by boat to this country. It is no wonder that in estimates Senator Evans, the minister responsible, said, ‘I am not very confident that we can with any surety say that the 2,000 figure that is used for the accounting purpose in that budget paper can be supported.' He does not believe it. He does not believe his own budget papers. The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, has lost control of our borders and of his own budget. The government's immigration budget is a work of fiction. It assumes boats will just stop coming in two weeks time, without it taking any of the hard decisions needed to deliver that outcome. Perhaps the Prime Minister believes that he can just spin these boats away like he does with all the other problems he has generated for himself. He thinks he can just spin them away out there in the 24-hour news cycle. Perhaps he thinks he is Obi-Wan Kenobi and that he can perform the Jedi mind trick on the boats. He can say, ‘This is not the country you were looking for,' and somehow they will just go away. Maybe that is the policy, because when Senator Evans was asked in estimates about whether there was any change of policy to back up a 60 per cent fall in illegal boat arrivals, his answer was: ‘No. There's no change of policy. We just think it's going to happen.' There is no need to make hard decisions, no need to do anything of a policy nature and no need to have any resolve. You put it in the budget and then the boats just go away. If only it were that easy. This side of the House knows from when we were in government how difficult these things are to achieve and what is necessary to achieve them. Not even Minister Evans believes his of own budget. If boats continue to arrive at their current rate of three per week, carrying more than 600 people per month, Labor's projected surplus will vanish, along with whatever is left of their budget credibility. Included in these cost blow-outs is the cost of the charters. That was revealed today in the Daily Telegraph and other News Limited papers, reporting on Senate estimates. In the 10 months to January the department chartered 62 flights to and from Christmas island, at an average cost of $134,000 per flight-an increase of more than 240 per cent on the previous year. They expect to expend a further $8.1 million next year. This means ‘Air Kevin' from Christmas Island will be going more than twice weekly under the Rudd government's failed border protection policies. That will be an increase in their business. This brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ‘Kevin 747'. Of those two groups transferred to Villawood in late March and early April, the Prime Minister said in his big statement: Our view as a Government is that when it comes to asylum seekers, if they do not pass the test being legitimate asylum seekers, then they are sent home. That is what has happened with the decision made about this group of 90 or 100 asylum seekers, and that is why they are currently being processed for return back home. That was reported in the Australian on 29 March. They are still there. They are seeking appeals and those who have finished their appeals are now joining a High Court action. So it is back to the bad old days of asylum seekers lining up in our courts to extend their stays. The coalition policy of offshore processing in a third country ended those types of claims. Under this Prime Minister, the government can refuse to assess a person's asylum claim purely on the basis of their nationality. Those on the other side of the House might want to run and hide on this issue and pretend this is not a big deal. But they know that that decision on 9 April was absolutely and utterly discriminatory, and they should be ashamed of it. What they have said is: ‘If you're an Afghan or you're a Sri Lankan and you want to claim asylum in Australia then we're not even going to assess your claim, not because of your circumstances; it is because you are an Afghan or a Sri Lankan.' The members opposite know that the convention is very clear on the point that you cannot discriminate on the basis of someone's nationality. They should be ashamed of that policy. Since they announced that policy, at least 30 boats, carrying over 1,000 asylum seekers, have come to Australia. The policy has proved to be as discriminatory as it is ineffective. Is it any wonder that those running these boats to Australia are in no doubt about the resolve of this Prime Minister? He simply has no resolve. No-one knows where the Prime Minister stands on this issue. One day he is freezing asylum claims and the next day he is pretending to be Mother Teresa on of these issues. You cannot work out where this guy stands on the issue of asylum seekers. On this issue, he has walked both sides of the street-and taken a good stroll on the nature strips as well. Whether it is his abandonment of the policies that worked or his abandonment of his resolve when he rolled over on the Oceanic Viking, the people-smugglers have his measure. No wonder Sajjad Hussain Noor, a people-smuggler in Indonesia, told SBS: … the door is open, if a door is open anyone can come in … people think its easier in Australia … you can become an Australian citizen straight away. I do not doubt that the one-third of Australians who do not support the coalition's strong border protection policies are motivated by a genuine sense of compassion. What I am disappointed about is that those opposite and others in this debate cannot acknowledge that pursuing policies that stop boats saves lives, stops putting people at risk and opens up opportunities for people in camps all around the world to have their chance of resettlement in this country. This government is denying them that chance because they simply cannot work out who they are and cannot pursue a coordinated or consistent policy on this matter. The coalition has the support of the Australian people on this issue because they know where we stand. By contrast, the Rudd government's policies have failed and they know it. (Time expired)",50
123,Mr MCCLELLAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The shadow minister's thesis was based on a desire to save lives, and I take him at face value-I know him and I know he is genuine in saying that-but I point out that the central theme of the opposition's policy is the reintroduction of temporary protection visas and the Pacific solution. In respect of the temporary protection visas, I ask members to reflect back to October 2001. On 18 October 2001, a vessel left a port in Indonesia carrying a bit over 400 people. The following day, that vessel sunk on the high seas in international waters. Upon that vessel there were women, children and some men. The women had one thing in common, aside from losing their lives. The women were coming to Australia to make contact, to resume their relationships, with male partners in Australia on temporary protection visas. The children were on that vessel because they were seeking to be reunited with their fathers in Australia on temporary protection visas. On the night of 19 October 2001, 146 children lost their lives, 142 women lost their lives and 62 men lost their wives. The number of women and children on that vessel was significantly greater because of the then government's temporary protection visa policy. There is absolutely no doubt about that, and I think that has been recognised by a number of members on the other side. Those events, more than anything, should cause the opposition to review their policies. From analysing the issues, I can say that dealing with those seeking asylum internationally is a complex global challenge. From 2009 figures, in the order of 36 million people are of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and in the order of 983,000 people are seeking asylum. It is a massive and complex international problem that is confronting the rest of the world. The United States takes by far the greatest number of asylum seekers-in the order of 50,000-and Canada takes 30,000. The European Union countries take 250,000 and eight of those countries received in excess of 10,000 asylum seekers in 2009France, 40,000; the United Kingdom 30,000; Germany, 30,000. Australia received 6,000 people seeking asylum in 2009. That puts the issue in context. This issue requires perspective, balance and a proportionate response, not a response based on emotion, fear and rhetoric and, in particular, not a response that involves adopting policies that are draconian in their application and not based on the evidence. The Australian government have some of the toughest border protection policies of any country in the world. We have excision of the offshore islands; we have offshore processing; we have mandatory detention for the purpose of conducting health, identity and security assessments; and, we have compulsory return of persons found to be not genuinely in need of asylum in our country. Indeed, in recent months there has been a rejection rate in the order of 50 per cent of those seeking asylum on the basis of information from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and in-country information. As a result of that updated information and the need to obtain additional information, the government made a decision in April of this year to suspend processing claims for asylum for people from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Both the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and the Prime Minister indicated that, on resumption of processing and being in receipt of that updated information from the UNHCR and incountry information, it is likely that the rate of rejection will increase. I note the text of the MPI criticises the government's actions. This government has, more than any other peacetime government, devoted more to border protection in terms of interdiction capability, intelligence gathering capabilities and capacity building, working in cooperation with regional countries, introducing laws into Australia to introduce serious penalties for providing material support to a people-smuggling operation and giving the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation the ability to assist law enforcement agencies in fighting people smuggling. These are very significant steps that the government has taken and with quite some results. Domestically there have been 149 arrests, 45 convictions and 102 prosecutions. I note the shadow minister indicated the importance of working with and having good relations with our neighbours. As a result of significant international cooperation with neighbours, Indonesia has undertaken 158 disruptions involving 3,810 people and has made 92 arrests; Malaysia has undertaken 28 disruptions involving 873 people and has made 12 arrests; Sri Lanka has had 16 disruptions with 275 people involved and 55 arrests. You have to ask yourself-and I do ask-what would be the consequence and the attitude of those countries if we effectively thumbed our noses at them in terms of working for a regional approach to this issue? In that context I note the one issue the honourable member did not mention in his presentation was the policy of turning boats back. I again ask the question: what would have been the consequence of turning back SIEVX or suspect illegal vessel 10, which was the vessel on which the women and children perished on 19 October 2001? What would be the consequence of asking our servicemen and servicewomen to turn a boat such as that around? In reality the argument is a sham. Out of 242 boats involving 14,000 people, there were only ever seven boats turned around by the opposition. Again, I suggest it is all talk. What the honourable member did not refer to in his speech is the evidence base that is required before draconian actions against people are introduced as a policy commitment. What are the facts? I note in his op-ed today the shadow minister referred to around 2001 when he put forward that, as a result of the then coalition's policies, there was a dramatic decline in people seeking asylum in Australia. I think he acknowledged that between 1999 and 2001 there were some 12,000 people seeking asylum in Australia. That happened incidentally after the temporary protection visas were introduced in 1999. But what he does not advise the Australian people is that internationally there our was a dramatic decline in the number of people seeking asylum between 2001 and 2003. In terms of Iraqis, there was a 50 per cent reduction from 50,400 to 25,300; Afghans, a 73 per cent drop from 52,900 to 14,216; and, Sri Lankans went from 14,500 to 5,600, a 61 per cent drop. In fact, 2001 and 2002 saw the largest scale returns in the 59-year history of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. Those figures have not been disclosed by the opposition but they coincide with the reduction that the opposition is claiming to have occurred after 2001. If I can bring that forward to the current situation to indicate that desperation is the motivator of people seeking asylum in Australia, between 2005 and 2008 the number of Afghans seeking asylum internationally went up 139 per cent from 7,700 to 18,400, the number of Sri Lankans went up 72 per cent from 5,600 to 9,600, and indeed the figures in respect of Afghans last year went up a further 34 per cent from 18,452 to 24,657. These numbers indicate the subsidence in those seeking asylum in 2001 and the reemergence of those seeking asylum after those years to which I referred. They are the facts. Temporary protection visas did not work. They were introduced in 1999 and we saw the biggest influx under the former government during that period. I question whether Australians want to go back to the Pacific solution. If you look at the facts-and they are considered by the Australian people-I do not think they will. There were 1,637 people on Nauru and Manus Island. Seventy per cent of those people were resettled and 95 per cent of them were resettled in Australia. Ninety-five per cent were recognised as refugees. The so-called Pacific solution-that is, using these third countries-cost $314 million, whereas the amount spent by the government on surveillance during that period was only $264 million. So more was spent by the government in that offshore solution, in the words of Paul Kelly, ‘cajoling' governments to accept these people. In addition, if we think of the former government's motives, their whole policy framework was based on treating people in the harsh and draconian manner that I have referred to for the purpose of creating a disincentive. That was the approach they previously adopted and I would remind the Australian people, and indeed members of the House, how children were treated under the period of the former government. In 19992000, there were 976 children in detention. In 2000-01, there were 1,923 children in detention. In 2001-02, there were 1,696 children detained behind razor wire. The concerning thing is not only the numbers but the length of time that children were detained. The average time was one year eight months and 11 days in 2003 and, as at 1 October 2003, more than 50 per cent of children had spent greater than two years in detention. This is a serious issue. It is an issue of concern to the Australian people. The government is taking serious and very strident measures-indeed, some of the toughest policies in the world. But Australians do not want to see women and children drowning on the high seas trying to make contact with their partners who are here because family reunions have been precluded under temporary protection visas. They do not want to see 50 per cent of children being detained for in excess of two years on Nauru, Manus Island or some other third country. Australians are fair. They are decent people. They are prepared to make reasonable, proportionate decisions based on the facts. The opposition in their policy development have ignored those facts and I call on them to revise their views. (Time expired)",53
124,Mr KEENAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I want to respond to what the Attorney General was just saying because I think this is very important. He said that the policy of temporary protection visas, which was successful in putting people smugglers out of business and which we intend to be successful again when we get back into government, has been responsible for people undertaking the dangerous journey to Australia illegally. I would say to him that the situation is exactly the opposite of that. It is the government's weakness and lack of resolve on this issue that is encouraging people to undertake this dangerous journey. That is why we are now hearing anecdotal and media reports of boats that have left Indonesia and never been seen or heard from again. Presumably the people who were on those boats were lost, as he indicated at the start of his speech. We all know the Attorney-General is an honourable man; no-one on this side of the House would dispute that. But what he was saying is the exact opposite of what is actually occurring. What is occurring is that, because of the government's lack of resolve and because of the government's weakness, people smugglers have been encouraged to go back into that evil trade and subsequently people are again being lost while making the dangerous and hazardous journey to Australia. In the 2½ years of the Rudd government there have been an astonishing number of failures-pink batts, the bloated school hall program, outrageous wasted spending and latterly this new mining tax that is going to drive a stake through the heart of Australia's prosperity-but their failure to protect Australia's borders is perhaps the worse. When Labor came to office, they inherited a situation where this problem had been solved. All they needed to do was just leave well enough alone. If they had come to office and done what they said they were going to do prior to the last election-that is, continue with the tough border protection policies of the Howard government-Australia would not have had this problem re-emerge where we find a tsunami of illegal arrivals coming down to Australia, the greatest rate of illegal arrivals that we have seen in our history. The empirical evidence on this just does not lie. It is so easy to understand what is happening here. The problem of illegal arrivals has occurred for a long period of time. In the 1990s it started to significantly deteriorate. By the mid-1990s we were experiencing up to 21 illegal boat arrivals a year. That started to increase towards the end of the 1990s. In the financial year 1989-90, we had 42 illegal boat arrivals carrying almost a thousand people. In the year 1999-2000, we had 54 illegal boat arrivals. By the year 2000 the Howard government understood that if they were not going to do anything, if they were just going to sit back and allow this problem to snowball, it would get worse and worse because, of course, the more people who arrive here successfully, the more often that occurs, the more encouragement that gives to people to undertake this journey. The Howard government decided that we were not going accept this, so we instituted a series of measures that sent the message to the people smugglers that we were no longer going to be a soft touch for them to smuggle people into Australia illegally. Those measures are well documented, so I do not need to go through them all now, and they had an instantaneous effect of making sure that people smugglers could no longer go out and sell their product of gaining people entry illegally into Australia. Once we took those tough measures, this problem essentially evaporated. In the six years from the end of 2002 we had 18 illegal boat arrivals. So, on average, we had three illegal boat arrivals a year. That is just a weekend of illegal arrivals under this government. As I said, this problem had essentially evaporated because the people smugglers could not go out and sell a product when the message had gone out loud and clear to the international community that Australia was no longer a soft touch on our borders. Then Kevin Rudd came to office. Just prior to the last election he said that he would happily turn the boats around. Like so many of the promises that he made, this one proved to be hollow. In August 2008 he decided that to make himself a hero to the left wing of his own party he was going to weaken the robust system of border protection that was put in place by the previous government. He did that by abolishing temporary protection visas and replacing them with permanent protection, by closing the offshore processing that had been successful in Nauru and Manus Island, by reneging on the promise to turn boats back when the circumstances allowed and, most shamefully, by making a special deal to process 78 passengers on board the Oceanic Viking-certainly one of the low points in Australia's immigration history. When Kevin Rudd came to office he inherited a situation where there were eight people in detention on Christmas Islandthere are now about 2½ thousand, and every week there are charter flights taking people from Christmas Island to the mainland-but he could not just leave it alone. As a result of the weakening of Australia's border protection system, the people smugglers were encouraged back into business. Again you can look at it empirically, it is just so clear: within months of Kevin Rudd making the announcement that he was going soft on our borders, the people smugglers went back into business. In 2008-09 we had 24 illegal arrivals. In this last financial year we have now had 112 illegal boat arrivals in Australian waters. It is the worse year on record, and those boats have brought over 4½ thousand people illegally to Australia. Just so everyone understands, I will explain the way this evil trade works, because think that is very important. I have had the opportunity to go out with the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and with the Navy and also to visit Christmas Island within recent months. What is happening is that people smugglers are incredibly sophisticated organised criminal networks and there is a lot of money involved. People can pay up to US$15,000 a head to be smuggled illegally into Australia. If you think about that, an illegal boat arrival of 60 ple could mean up to three-quarters of a million Australian dollars for the criminal networks that have facilitated it. So this is business and significant organised crime, yet these are the people who are now in control of part of Australia's humanitarian immigration program. What happens is that you get to Indonesia or Malaysia and you contact a people smuggler. Those networks are very well established. You make arrangements for them to smuggle you into Australia. You embark usually at one of two points within Indonesiaone in Java and one in West Timor. If you are leaving from West Timor you head directly south to the Ashmore islands; if you are leavof ing from Java you head directly south to Christmas Island. Contrary to popular opinion you are not trying to avoid the Australian authorities. The whole trade is actually about running into the Australian authorities. The most sophisticated networks will equip these boats with positioning systems and satellite phones so you can identify that you are in Australian waters. You will then contact the Australian government-sometimes the Western Australian police, sometimes the Australian Maritime Safety Authority-and there have been reports of contacting people overseas who have then contacted Australian authorities. The Australian authorities will come and collect you and transfer you to Christmas Island. When you are on ChristI mas Island you will be processed within, on average, 104 days and then your chance of coming to Australia permanently is in the high 90s. What a great product for people smugglers to sell! You pay them up to US$15,000, they will get you into Australian waters, the Australian authorities will come and collect you and transfer you to Christmas Island and, within a couple of months of being on Christmas Island, your chances of coming to peoAustralia permanently are incredibly high. Whilst that continues to be the situation, people smugglers will be able to sell that big product, as they are doing, in increasing numbers. That is why this problem continues to snowball, why the rate of illegal arrivals continues to increase over time. The consequences are that Labor has broken its promise not to process people on the mainland Australia and that the Australian taxpayer has had to shell out another $1 billion because of the budget blow-out. That is an astonishing figure. It comprises $770 million to increase the offshore asylum seeker management program and $236 million to be spent on capital items, including the upgrade the facility on Christmas Island, the reopening of the Curtin detention facility and the upgrades to other centres around Australia. And just today we have heard more information about the expensive charter flights which have now blown out to cost the Australian taxpayer $8.2 million. All this because Kevin Rudd just could not leave the policy alone when he came to government. Only the coalition have the resolve to actually do something to address this issue. The Prime Minister has effectively said that Labor will not do anything more. They just accept that this is now the situation, that people smugglers will control part of Australia's immigration system. The coalition have a plan to put those people smugglers out of business. We will commence discussions to find a place to process people offshore, a policy that has been successful in the past. We will reintroduce temporary protection visas, a vital part of the program to discourage people smugglers from their trade. We will also turn the boats back when circumstances allow.

125,Mr DREYFUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Liberal Party is long on fear but very short on solutions and very, very short on facts. The two speeches that we have just heard on this matter of public importance, from the member for Cook and member for Stirling, are yet a further representation of just how long on fear and short on facts the opposition actually is: ‘Never let the facts get in the way of a good scare campaign.' There is nothing but fear from the Liberal Party-fear and a refusal to consider the context in which people come from all over the world to Australia as unauthorised boat arrivals. This is a fear campaign which, first, is based on ignoring the very small numbers of unauthorised arrivals by boat in Australia and, indeed, the very small numbers of refugee claims. We have had it again from the member for Stirling, who referred ridiculously to the ‘tsunami' of arrivals. That kind of language is completely unhelpful in considering the real issues that are involved. a very small number of unauthorised arrivals and a small number of refugees and refugee claims. The number of displaced persons is small by comparison to the total number of displaced persons worldwide. The number of unauthorised arrivals is small by comparison to the total number of unauthorised arrivals in other countries. The number of asylum claims is small in relation to asylum claims in other countries. Let us take the experience in Europe, for example. Compared to the very small numbers in Australia, in Europe there were 286,700 asylum claims in 2009, 283,700 in 2008 and 249,600 in 2007. The United States, with the largest number of claims of any of the industrialised countries, had nearly 50,000 claims in 2009, closely followed by France with 42,000 and Canada with 33,000 claims for asylum. A relatively small number-6,500 claims in total-were lodged in Australia and New Zealand combined in 2009. That is to give proper context, to look at the smallness of the actual numbers involved, which is where this debate should be positioned. The numbers are small in relation to the total immigration to Australia, small in comparison to the number of unauthorised arrivals or visa overstayers who come by air, and small compared to Australia's population of around 22.3 million and growing. This is a disgraceful fear campaign which demonises people in need and diminishes the humanity of every Australian. It is a fear campaign which ignores the long history of resettlement of refugees in this country, a history of which all Australians can be very proud. Since the Second World War over 700,000 refugees and displaced persons have settled in Australia. Australia played a large part in the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, and article 14 of that universal declaration declares the It is rights of everyone anywhere in the world to seek asylum. The 1951 refugee convention, which Australia is a party to and played a large part in the creation of, prohibits states from imposing penalties on those who arrive without authorisation coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom is threatened. People seeking asylum are not illegal, and the member for Cook and the member for Stirling should stop misleading this House by suggesting that they are. It is very important that it is understood clearly just what the status is of unauthorised arrivals by boat. Part of the fear campaign is carried out by misrepresentation of the firm approach that the Rudd government has taken to unauthorised arrivals. We have more assets patrolling our borders than any Australian government in the past. We have spent more on international cooperation to counter people smuggling than any other government. One hundred and thirty-nine arrests and 45 convictions of people smugglers have taken place in Australia since September 2008. There are currently 92 people being prosecuted in Australian courts for people smuggling. The government recently introduced further measures into the parliament to strengthen Australia's anti-people-smuggling laws, and of course we work cooperatively with our regional partners to combat people smuggling. We take a responsible approach to genuine asylum seekers and protecting our national security, including offshore processing, mandatory detention and stringent health, identity and ASIO security checks. We act consistently with our international obligations, which is a very different position from that presently being adopted by those opposite, who are simply playing politics. Their fear campaign rests on the false assertion that global factors are irrelevant. In that regard, it is worth remembering what the former immigration minister of the former government, the member for Berowra, said in 1999 at the time of large increases in unauthorised arrivals. He said: It is timely to remember that the use of people smugglers to get around a country's rules about who can come and who can stay is a world-wide problem. Australia is not alone. We are also seeing large numbers of people seeking asylum in developed countries-people from the same groups as we are seeing in Australia. For example, Iraqi asylum-seekers are registered in 77 countries and last year there were over 34,000 applications for asylum lodged by Iraqis in 19 European countries. Exactly the same position as obtained in 1999 is still the case today. Australia is not alone in seeing increases in claims from people from Afghanistan. In 2008 and 2009 there were increases in unauthorised arrivals from Afghanistan experienced in several other countries around the world, including the US, Canada, Germany, France and Norway. We saw in this country in 2008 and 2009-reflecting dreadful circumstances in Sri Lanka-an increase in asylum claims from Sri Lanka, and there has been a corresponding increase in asylum claims from people from Sri Lanka in France, in Switzerland, in New Zealand, in Japan and in Germany. We have even seen asylum seekers from Sri Lanka arriving on the west coast of Canada. This is a phenomenon that is worldwide. It was properly recognised by the former immigration minister, the member for Berowra, and those opposite should recognise it now rather than conducting the kind of fear campaign that they are conducting. They would rather continue with their pretence that the barbarous and inhumane methods which they wish to return to-including the appalling suggestion that there should be a turning back of boats-are effective. These sorts of methods diminish us all, and it is a pretence to suggest that they are effective. Part of the fear campaign-and that is the supposed topic of the matter of public importance today-is the use of language like ‘budget blow-out' which, again, is seeking to entirely ignore the context in which this problem arises. It pretends that the Howard government did not equally spend vast amounts of money on its regrettably partially failed solution, and those vast amounts of money included some $1.5 billion spent on processing unauthorised maritime arrivals, coping with just the three-year surge that was experienced from 1999 to 2001. During the time of the Howard government there were some 244 boats carrying 13,659 asylum seekers and, unsurprisingly, there was an increase in Commonwealth expenditure to deal with that surge in unauthorised arrivals. During that surge in 1999, 2000 and 2001 when over 12,000 people arrived, the Liberals under former Prime Minister John Howard did exactly what the government is now doing-they increased our country's detention capacity and increased the resources that were directed to it. It was of course the Howard government that built the Christmas Island detention centre, at a cost of almost $400 million. It was announced originally in the 2002 budget at a cost of $153.7 million for construction costs and $34.4 million in commissioning, but it blew out to almost $400 million. It is about time that those opposite tried return debate on this subject to something approaching a humane basis, to something approaching a rational basis, and not persist with their fear campaign.

126,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise this afternoon to speak on this very important matter of public importance to do with this government's failed immigration and border protection policies. I do so in the context of what happened in my own electorate last Friday. Last Friday I learned from a leak from the media that the department of immigration was looking at placing illegal arrivals in an unused mining campalthough there are still 30 people in it-at Dalby. This is because of the overflow from Christmas Island. There was no consultation with me or the community. There had been some very scant contact with the mayor, who I understand this afternoon is meeting with the department of immigration here in Canberra. I think he has been told that at this stage they do not have plans prepared to put people into Dalby. I emphasise ‘at this stage'. I suggest the minister will have the final say. While the Dalby community was reacting to this news late last week, two more illegal boats arrived in our waters, which takes the total to 136 boats. The Rudd government's policy on border protection has been a clear failure. Since this government changed the legislation in 2008 and softened Australia's border protection, some 6,389 people have risked their lives to travel here in 136 dodgy boats. This year alone, 2010, some 3,354 people have arrived in some 68 leaky boats. Late last year, tragically, a boat disappeared with at least 100 people reportedly having died. And this is just one of the incidents that gets reported-what happens to the others who have taken this treacherous trip but have not made it? They have been utilising people-smuggling rackets in an effort to come to to our shores because of the soft approach that this government has taken to protecting Australia's borders. Quite clearly, when the Rudd government softened its policies it sent a message to the people smugglers of the world, and they are making money out of human misery. That is the problem with this policy. Under the Howard government, the illegal, insidious trade of people smuggling was brought to a grinding halt. In November 2007, there were just two detainees on Christmas Island. The population now is at least 2,500. Look at the Howard government's record. According to the World Refugee Survey conducted by the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, the Rudd government resettled 25 per cent fewer refugees in 2009, some 8,742, than under the Howard government in 2007, which settled 12,133. So we clearly had a policy of showing compassion and playing our part, taking a humanitarian approach, in dealing with people who are in refugee camps around the world. I have been to some of these refugee camps, and your heart goes out to those people who are trying to find a country they can go to to get a better chance in life. I have seen them first hand. People on the weekend were making comments that Dalby is a racist and xenophobic community. I reject that absolutely. Many 457 visa workers have come to my electorate. I want to read into the record in the limited time available some information from Diesel Electrics, a small business in Dalby. They have two 457 employees, and until two weeks ago one man had not seen his wife and seven-year-old son for nearly two years. They have come to this country legally. They are educated and hard working, and have also come from very desperate circumstances. They get no support and have to pay over $400 a month in private health insurance just to be here and to have access to medical facilities such as the Dalby hospital. The 457 visa approach has been working, and the current situation just does not seem fair to this person or to many other people my community of Dalby. (Time expired)",61
127,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. Let's call a spade a spade. The low-grade politics pursued by the opposition dates back to their loss in the 1993 election. After loss, bipartisanship on immigration was destroyed in their pursuit to win the tion. You can also date the breaking up of bipartisanship on Indigenous issues to the loss of the 1993 election. The member for Goldstein, Mr Robb, who is in the chamber, understands what I am saying. What we have here is dog whistling going out to the prejudiced and ignorant in the community who are frightened when it comes to immigration and who are frightened when it comes to Aboriginal affairs, when senior figures go out and spread fear and misrepresent the situation. I am not going to have it said that our policy is an inhumane policy or that the policies of the Howard government on detention were more humane, because that is a rewriting of history by the member for Cook. As a result of the Palmer and Comrie reports that were tabled in 2005, there was a change in the detention regimes. There have been two changes to detention providers since that time. Members of the then backbench-the member for Kooyong, Mr Georgiou; the member for MCMillan, Mr Broadbent; the member for Pearce, Judi Moylan; the former member for Cook, Bruce Baird; and the member for Hughes, Danna Vale-all railed against the inhumane detention policy. There was no time limit on the detention of women and children. There was no time limit on the processing of applications. We, as part of our policy prior to the last election, said we would get rid of TPVs. We also put time lines on the processing of applications. At the moment, we have suspended for three months and six months two classes of in visa. That does not breach the Racial Discrimination Act or the convention. It is merely to have a look at the current situation in those countries to see whether the situation has changed and whether people still have a well-founded fear of persecution. that Reasonable lawyers will tell you that. We have a humane policy. We are not pariahs in 1996 electhe international community. The Howard government, in response to Tampa, ambushed the then opposition with less than an hour's notice on legislation-not because it was humane, not because it was good policy but because they were languishing in the polls and it was a political solution. It was a successful political solution. But where are the Tampa asylum seekers now? Most of them were successfully processed as refugees and relocated. In our current policy, we have wound back the harsher elements of the Howard regime and we do not apologise. We conform to our international obligations and have put more resources towards that. The worse part of all this is the signal that is going out to the community. The two areas where there should be bipartisan support and where both sides should sit down and talk to one another are Aboriginal issues and immigration. This country was founded on migration. We have taken in refugees and we should be proud of it. These people are now being demonised. They are called illegal when they are not. The term is ‘asylum seekers'. If they are not genuine refugees, they are sent back home. An alternative government continuing to do this is a disgrace. It is done for one reason only-not because they are more humane or compassionate or because their policy will work; it is a sleazy grab for votes from those sections of the community that respond to this button when it is pushed. We should be trying to educate the community. When I look at the figures going back 20 years or so there is not much variation. I was a member of the Keating government when we introduced mandatory detention. I stood up and said it was the right policy at the time because you should not release people into the community unless they have had health and security checks and unless they have passed the threshold test of whether they are genuine asylum seekers, genuine refugees. This debate by the opposition is a disgrace. They have taken the low road and it is all about votes.",62

130,Mr ROBB,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The four electoral amendment bills before the House today, theElectoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010, theElectoral and Referendum Amendment (Pre-poll Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2010, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010 and theElectoral and Referendum Amendment (How-to-Vote Cards and Other Measures) Bill 2010, represent a mix. They are mostly good measures but they do include some very bad measures. The coalition welcomes the decision of the government to not proceed with its original Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill 2010. It was disappointing to see that the government had broken with tradition and had included both controversial and non-controversial amendments in the same bill. Under the previous government there were always two bills which came out of the JSCEM report into the previous election-a non-controversial one for machinery provisions and a controversial one for policy changes. I am happy to see that the government now, albeit tacitly, admits its original error and we will now be dealing with these matters as has been done in the past. I will go first to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010. This bill represents schedules 1 and 2 of the original close of rolls bill. The coalition will be posing this new bill. I do not wish to dwell too long on this bill, as the reasons for our opposition to these measures have been laid out previously, both by speakers in this House at the time of the consideration of the original bill as well as in the coalition bers' dissenting report on the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. On the close of rolls, the fundamental point is this: the closure of the rolls seven days after the issue of a writ is a significant threat to the integrity of the electoral roll. The previous coalition government, in line with long standing policy, moved to protect the integrity of the roll and prevent fraudulent enrolments by reducing the time period between the calling of an election and the close of the rolls. Closing the roll at 8 pm on the day the writs for the election are issuedwhich is usually three or four days after the election is called-for people enrolling for the first time and people re-enrolling after being removed from the roll currently gives the Electoral Commission an extra seven days to verify new enrolments and an extra four days to verify changes of address. At a time when the Electoral Commission is processing a large number of enrolments, hundreds of thousands in some cases, these changes have greatly assisted the commission in identifying and discounting fraudulent enrolments. Under the old scheme, to which Labor want to return, more than 520,000 changes to enrolment or new enrolments were submitted to the Australian Electoral Commission in the seven-day period before the close of rolls during the 2004 federal election. Bear in mind that it was after the 2004 election but before the 2007 election that the previous government made this fundamental change-that the roll close on the day the writs for the election are issued-because of op- these 520,000 changes to enrolment or new enrolments being submitted to the Electoral Commission, giving them very little time to deal with them. The proposed time frame of seven days will again make it virtually impossible to exclude fraudulent votes from the mem- count. The commission simply does not have the resources, whether people or time, to go through such large numbers. Furthermore, official AEC figures show that under the coalition's rules the number of people missing the close of rolls deadline in 2007 was 100,370, compared to 168,394 in 2004. In short, our scheme, the scheme of the previous government, was 40 per cent more effective than the scheme Labor is now trying to reimpose on the roll. The combination of a very effective campaign run by the Australian Electoral Commission before the 2007 election to encourage enrolment, combined with the fact that failure to enrol prior to the election being called would result in not being able to vote, had a very positive effect on encouraging enrolment. Despite that difference in outcomes between 2004, under the system that the Labor Party is now seeking to reimpose, and 2007, we are now going back to a system which will be unable to be properly monitored and processed by the Electoral Commission, open up opportunities for fraudulent activity and work against the interests of democracy and the interests that all of us in this House should be aiming for. The 2007 outcome highlighted the virtue of an enforcement incentive over the liberalised approach that we are seeing in this bill. The coalition consider that the existing arrangements ensure that the electoral roll contains a high degree of accuracy and integrity, and we are concerned that the extra time period allows for a return to a system which permits calculated, fraudulent enrolments to take place. The coalition also believe that a return to the previous system of seven days will serve to discourage citizens from making or maintaining their enrolment in the ordinary course of the year, as they will have the opportunity to delay such action until an election is called. The numbers support this: as I said, in 2007, 100,000 people had to be processed; in 2004, under the system that the Labor Party is seeking to re-impose, it was 168,000-a level which the commission would be unable to process, given the sheer weight of numbers and the resources that the commission has at its disposal. On the question of production of proof of identity for provisional voters, the previous government, in line with long standing policy, moved to prevent fraudulent voting by people impersonating other voters, by requiring that people who claim a provisional vote at an election produce evidence of their true identity and their enrolled address, either on polling day or in the week following polling day. It is simply a common-sense and sensible measure and not an unduly difficult requirement to place on people. The coalition is opposed to any weakening of the proof of identity provisions in relation to provisional voting on the grounds that it removes an important deterrent to citizens seeking to engage in multiple voting. According to the Electoral Commission, approximately 75 per cent of provisional voters showed evidence of identity when voting. Of the 33,900 provisional voters who failed to provide such identification on polling day, only one in five subsequently provided proof of identity by the cut-off date-that is, the close of business on the following Friday. The government has argued, without any supporting evidence, that the attrition rate is a result of voter apathy as a result of the election result being known. This conclusion is difficult to reconcile with the fact that in the electorates of Swan and MCEwen, for example, there were 260 and 188 provisional voters respectively who failed to provide their proof of identity in the week following the poll and each seat, as we all know, hung in the balance throughout the following week and well beyond. So here we have across two seats that went to the wire nearly 400 voters who the Labor Party asserts were just apathetic or knew the result of the election so did not turn up and provide proof of their identity. The argument is made that the validity of these voters can be determined by comparing signatures; however, such a process would fail to provide any deterrent or consequence for voters who fail to meet their obligations to maintain their enrolment under the act. Such failures should trigger a requirement for a more stringent process. Any proposal to weaken the rules in relation to proof of identity for provisional votes should be opposed because it makes voting fraud easier. The provisions that are in place now and are being removed are not punitive or unduly difficult for people to comply with. It is a reasonable request. It is common sense. You have to ask why the Labor Party are doing what they are doing on these two essentially common-sense provisions. It will certainly make it more difficult for the Electoral Commission. We had a better result under the previous government's provisions in the 2007 election. It makes no sense that the government would move to make these changes other than to provide opportunities for people to run fast and loose with our electoral system. For these reasons, the coalimanage tion cannot support these two measures and will be opposing the close of rolls bill. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Pre-poll Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2010 will be supported by the coalition. At the current time pre-poll votes are treated as declaration votes and must go through an administrative checking procedure in the week following polling day. This creates a significant and unnecessary administrative burden on the Electoral Commission. The government's proposal seeks to treat these votes as ordinary votes, although electors who wish to cast them will still be required to fill out and sign a declaration asserting their need to cast such a vote. The benefit will be that these pre-poll votes will now be able to be counted on the night, leading to an earlier and more accurate result. This is a sensible and significant provision, given that I have observed over the last few elections a very significant increase in pre-poll votes. I know in my seat that the combined pre-poll and postal votes went from around 14 per cent in 2004 to 20 per cent in 2007. I think that is probably true across many electorates too. If these votes are treated as ordinary votes-and they can be; there is no threat to the integrity of the system-we will get a far clearer idea in many seats on election night because they can be counted on election night. There is an administrative amendment that allows the Electoral Commission to transfer workload relating to the processing of enrolments between different divisional returning offices. There are strong efficiency arguments to be made in allowing divisional returning offices to farm out work to other offices, particularly when there are high levels of demand or if sickness or leave requirements make a divisional returning office short-staffed for a period and unable to their expected workload. We support this measure. The coalition supports the change to electronic updating of voter records. Increasingly, transactions are being done online for the sake of convenience and speed. By allowing individuals already on the roll to maintain their own records, you effectively cut out the double or triple handling of enrolment forms. The coalition note there is no provision for new enrolments to be lodged electronically. We support this restriction and reconfirm our strong view that all first-time enrolments should be done in hard copy. On the question of single party nomination per seat: the coalition can see no reason for a party to run multiple candidates in a single seat other than as a campaigning tactic to try to push up the informal vote. As such, we support this measure. Prior to the 2007 election the coalition moved to give blind and vision impaired people the opportunity for the first time in their lives to cast a secret ballot. Labor discontinued this on the basis that it was too expensive. This returned blind and vision impaired people back to the unhappy situation of having to cast a non-secret vote. The coalition supports this measure on the understanding that this is only an interim arrangement ahead of further consultations which will be held with various community organisations. As such, I can advise the House that the coalition will be supporting this bill without amendment. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (How-to-Vote Cards and Other Measures) Bill 2010 will be supported by the coalition, but we are concerned that the response does not match the crime. We are reviewing provisions in that regard. It is notable that this bill arises because of a deliberate scam by the ALP in the 2010 South Australian state election. The South Australian ALP handed out how-to-vote cards that appeared to be official Family First how-to-vote cards, but the preferencing order favoured the ALP candidates. Labor operatives were brought in, some even from interstate, to wear Tshirts that appeared to indicate that they were Family First booth workers and to hand out the bogus how-to-vote cards. This is not a one-off, sadly. It is a deliberelection ate scam that the ALP have used before, both in New South Wales and Queensland, which was legitimised by the infamous cases of Webster v Deahm in 1993 and in Carroll v Electoral Commission of Queensland in 1998. It is nice to see that after only some 17 years Labor have now admitted that the decisions in those cases were morally wrong and that they are now seeking to correct the judicial errors. Of course it has taken the shame and the disgust of the community over the actions in the Adelaide election for Labor to move on this matter. This bill would require all how-to-vote cards to place, in a prominent size, the name and party of the authoriser or face a fine of $1,100. A false authorisation would incur a similar fine. Given the hullabaloo which the Labor members on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters made about the unauthorised pamphlets, it seems a rather light penalty, and an insipid penalty if you like, for such a serious offence against the Electoral Act. There is no doubt that many operatives in the Labor Party would be willing to forgo $1,000 to ensure the victory of the local ALP candidate through false preferencing arrangements. After that election in South Australia the veteran Flinders University political scientist, Professor Dean Jaensch, said it was: … the worse example of its kind I've seen in a 40year career … He went on to say: It is deceitful, deliberately designed to mislead voters … No doubt at all. On the primaries and two-party preferred, more people voted Liberal than Labor in that election, but Labor won more than the 50 per cent of seats they needed to form government through the vagaries of electoral boundaries and by using trickery and fraud. Three key marginals were so tight in that that Labor needed them all. The material was deceptive and misleading and plainly showed nothing but contempt for the political process. It is not drawing a long bow to suggest that the current government in South Australia is illegitimate because of the way in which this fraudulent activity influenced votes across three or four marginal seats. The government has been elected on a fraud. This was the case of an election that was rorted. It is the shameless thieving of an election result. You would think-on the basis of such a consequence of the democratic process being so compromised and being put under attack in this way-that the government, who have run 100 miles from this action but have condoned it not only in South Australia but in other elections in other places, would see the need for a penalty which met the crime. As I said earlier we will be looking to see what we can do to address that matter and we would hope to get the cooperation of those opposite. The penalty of 50 or more units might be far more appropriate especially in the instance of deliberate false authorisation details. The coalition strongly supports the principle of the how-to-vote bill. We have not engaged in such activities but we have overwhelmingly been the victims of such underhand tactics by the ALP. We support the government's belated attempt to place a legislative prohibition on its own party's rorting. I will seek at a later stage to introduce some amendments which look at the severity of the penalty that will be imposed for any return of such action by any party. Finally the fourth bill, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010, purports to be a series of uncontroversial minor amendments arising out of the unanimous recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry into the 2007 federal election. In the main this bill is acceptable but there are some significant problems which need to be addressed. The first measure moves the Australian Electoral Commission towards a more digital system of records management. We will be supporting this measure. The second measure changes the evidence of identity rules for enrolments. It removes the mandatory need for a witness to attest to the identity of son and reduces the acceptable identity documentation to a smaller field of items. We will be supporting this measure. The third measure allows for provisional enrolment at age 16 as opposed to the current age of 17. We support this move by the Australian Electoral Commission to get a more accurate electoral roll and, as a consequence, we will support this measure. The fourth measure moves the Australian Electoral Commission towards a more digital system of electoral roll management, distribution and use on polling day. It also allows for a more flexible production of ballot papers with appropriate security devices on polling day. We will be supporting this measure. The fifth measure, standardised mobile polling booth practices, is a sensible and welcome measure and we will be supporting it. The sixth measure has both controversial and non-controversial aspects to it. The noncontroversial aspects include the removal of the need for a witness in a request for a postal vote and allow the signature date as opposed to the postmark date on the postal vote to be accepted. The first point makes it easier for single people to request a postal vote. The second point goes a long way to addressing the very legitimate concerns that postal voters in rural and regional Australia have had given that they do not have everyday postal services. Of course we will be supporting these sensible measures. However, Labor has added two controversial aspects. The aspects were not considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and we are disappointed that Labor has attempted to sneak these provisions through in an otherwise noncontroversial bill. One proposal is that postal vote applications could only be returned directly to the AEC and the other is that there would be a prohibition on the attachment of a perextra material to a postal vote application form. The coalition can see no valid reason for the introduction of these measures by the government and strongly suspects that this has been done in a cynical attempt to undermine the extremely successful postal voting processes of the coalition parties. Even a simple reading of the voter returns shows that the coalition consistently polls higher with postal votes than with any other type of declaration vote. The Labor government is seeking to make substantial changes to a system of voting where the coalition does well, despite there being absolutely no evidence to support any need for such a change. There has been no argument which supports the move by the Labor Party. This is a totally cynical move and the motives of the Labor Party on these aspects of the bills need to be very seriously questioned. We will be strongly opposing those parts of the PVA measures which appear to have no merit other than that of being an attack on the coalition. This bill is not intended to be a bill used for the purposes improving the electoral prospects of either side of the House. This bill is intended to improve the democratic process, yet it is very clear that without any arguments, good or bad, being advanced in support of it, the Labor government has sought to sneak this measure in without putting it before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It is a pathetic attempt to overcome an advantage. This process works well. People regard highly the opportunity to have their postal vote application assisted by this process. Both parties inform their electorates about positions of the party and the process that people need to go through. It has been a very satisfactory measure. There has been no community discontent with this measure. There have been no arguments advanced. It is a purely cynical measure by the ALP to remove a practice which we exercise more effectively than the Labor Party. The seventh measure modernises the provisions for homeless voters. In principle, the measures were supported by the coalition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. However, the coalition has identified concerns about item 9. Item 9 seeks to repeal section 96(9)(a) of the act. This section states: (9) A person ceases to be entitled to be treated as an itinerant elector under this section if: (a) while the person is being so treated, a general election is held at which the person neither votes nor applies for a postal vote … The implication that flows from such an amendment is that there is no practical provision to ever remove an itinerant elector from the roll. It is axiomatic that you cannot do a habitation review on a homeless person. Unless the itinerant elector is unusually diligent in keeping their enrolment details up to of date, the only way to determine if they have left the electorate or died is if they do not show up on polling day. This proposed amendment from Labor is an open invitation to abuse the integrity of the electoral roll. Once a person gets on the roll as an itinerant elector in a particular division, they will never leave the roll for that particular division, irrespective of their true place of residence. The opportunity for organising a campaign of fraudulent voting is obvious and the Australian Electoral Commission could never check the bona fides of any potential roll rorter. Thus the proposed repeal of 96(9)(a) is bad policy because it fundamentally weakens the integrity of the electoral roll. Again, under several provisions in this series of bills, we see the integrity of the electoral roll being fundamentally weakened. It is unacceptable and the government has provided no alternative mechanism for roll-cleansing of itinerant voters. I foreshadow moving amendments to schedules 6 and 7 in the detailed debate. The eighth measure broadens and standardises the reasons for claiming a prepoll vote. In many ways this legitimises what has been existing practice in many DROs. It is well-known both to officers and prepoll booth workers that many people come into prepoll because they will be out of the electorate or otherwise engaged on polling day. This measure is a sensible change to make voting easier for those who simply prefer to lodge an early ballot and we will be supporting this measure. The ninth measure is simply a series of minor technical amendments. These do not change policy in any way and, despite not having gone through the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, will have the support of the coalition. In summary, we welcome the majority of the measures in this bill, but we will being to make a number of important amendments to address changes which would eat at the heart of the integrity of our electoral process. We are concerned that a series of important bills, which should have the mutual support of both sides of the House, now present three changes which will fundamentally attack the integrity of the electoral process and one change which is simply a change out of spite-a change to remove a process which the coalition is currently more effective at using. It is quite unfortunate, but we will be seeking to make changes to some of these bills. The remaining measures will be supported, as I have indicated throughout my address.",63
131,Mr SULLIVAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I am very pleased to speak on this suite of four bills, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010, Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Pre-poll Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2010, Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010 and Electoral and Referendum Amendment (How-to-Vote Cards and Other Measures) Bill 2010, amending the electoral and referendum processes in this country. I say at the outset that I have some experience in elections. I believe I have now participated in 27 in total, seven as a campaign director and five as a candidate, with my sixth as a candidate coming up. I strongly support the electoral system that we have in Australia and I have been pleased to be able to do that as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We probably have the best electoral system in the world, and no lesser authority than a former US Secretary of State said so recently. We have a representative democracy. We have adult suffrage. We have equal suffrage. We also have compulsory voting, which is often a point of contention with seek- some but I would contend that compulsory voting compels the government to give every citizen an opportunity to vote. Some of the amendments in this suite of bills actually go toward giving people the opportunity to vote, whereas obstacles have been put in the way of people doing that in the past. We also have-I am not sure that it is unique anymore-a wonderful system for the distribution of preferences. Elsewhere in the world this system is called the ‘Australian ballot', because we invented it here. We can, if we will, also call it preferential voting, but the rest of the world calls it the Australian ballot-except in the United Kingdom, which is about to have a referendum on adopting the Australian system. They are calling it the ‘single transferable vote' because, heaven forbid, that Westminster, which gave the world democracy, should import something from one of the colonies. I wish them well with that, and maybe they can pick up a few more of our advancements such as voting on the weekend so that workers do not have to get their boss's permission to go out to vote. Ours is, without question, one of the best participatory democracies of a representative nature in the world. There are a number of things that I would like to see happen in the future, some of which are non-controversial and others controversial, as the member for Goldstein would say. I am more than anxious to see a great deal more of our transactions, as voters, with the Australian Electoral Commission conducted online. It is quite clear now that most of us in this place, I am sure, would be using online banking. It is very difficult sometimes to get to a bank with our schedules, but we can do that with great safety and great security these days by banking online. I am sure a bank-like system could be adopted by the Australian Electoral Commission to enable voters to interact with the commission online. I also dream of a day in the future when Indigenous Australians are able to participate in our electoral system in a manner similar to that enjoyed by Maori people in New Zealand. They are provided a separate Maori roll and people identifying as Maori are able to be on that roll or the general roll. There is quota for Maori members elected to the New Zealand parliament. I think there are five Maori seats covering the whole country. This, of course, gives the indigenous people of New Zealand the enormous benefit of having seats at the table where the main decisions are made. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010 attracted the most opposition from the member for Goldstein in his presentation when he spoke before me on the suite of bills. In Australia today, we have an enormously mobile population. In my area, the population is mobile within the electorate as well as across electorates. In the Australian context, we do not have a 19-day campaign with a fixed election date, such as they have in New South Wales where the rolls are closed on the day that the writs are issued. We have an expectation, certainly amongst the community, that an election will be held this year but there is no certainty of that curring because the election does not have to be held until 16 April 2011.",70
132,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,Are you telling us something?,71
133,Mr SULLIVAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I am not telling you anything, member for Fisher. The idea that the rolls should close when the writs are issued has an interesting side to it. The member for Goldstein said that this is a bad measure. If it is such a measure why did the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, wait five or six days after telling everyone when the election was going to be before issuing the writs? He did not announce the election and issue the writs immediately. He waited for a period of time. Any future government or future Prime Minister would also have the same facility available to them. Whether or not seven days is written into law, a simple administrative act by the government of the day a can ensure that what is regarded as fair is put into place. So I question the suggestion by the member for Goldstein that the opposition's proposals were 40 per cent more effective. I do not think he can draw that from the evidence that was given to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It is not my recollection of the evidence given by the AEC that they believed that this measure provided an opportunity for identity fraud. In the past, people have had a week to correct their enrolment details. I doubt that that has acted as a discouragement in any way to people wanting to update their enrolments. In fact, it is more likely that in order to change the simplest detail, people have had to fill out the entire enrolment form again. This issue is being addressed in the bills before us. The member for Goldstein was also very critical of the idea of people turning up to cast a provisional vote without having to provide proof of identity. We say that the ocAEC ought to be able to revert to the old system of checking the signature of a person casting a provisional vote against their previously held signatures. Whether or not we are fans of the genre, the forensic police prothroughout grams that we view on television show us just how quickly material of that nature can be checked and sorted. The main point I want to make about this is that of course nobody attends a polling booth to make a provisional vote; they attend a polling booth to make an ordinary vote. They cannot make an ordinary vote when, for one reason or another, their enrolment details are not held and, hence, they need to make a provisional vote. I support-and I am not necessarily alone in this, but I have not had a great deal of support-each and every Australian voter being given a voter card, an electronic swipe card. Let us move towards using the technology. Every person's right to vote would be directed by that card. However, that seems to be a little beyond what the people of Australia are looking for at the moment. The evidence of identity for provisional voting and close of roll provisions in this legislation are going to be opposed by the coalition. The coalition will thereby be keeping in place barriers against people voting. One of the hallmarks of our voting system should be that people are able to vote with great ease. I note with a degree of pleasure that the majority of the measures in the modernisation bill are to be supported by the coalition. I think it is important, at a time when there are so many debates about the voting age, that we not lose sight of the issue at hand. People being able to place their name on the electoral roll at the age of 16 and vote in elections that occur no less than two years after they turn 16 will hopefully ensure that many more young people take an interest in the national affairs of the country. The reduction in the material required as evidence of identity upon enrolment and upon change of name is a sensible move. People's identities have to be proven in the first instance anyway, and I can think of no reason why people should have to continue, their lives, to prove that they are who they say they are time and time again. I am very pleased by the changes in the legislation to the postal voting system. I know, from the hearings of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters, that the member for Maranoa was very keen to see some serious changes there-particularly because of the remoteness of a number of his constituents. I note that a number of members of my extended family are constituents in electorates just like Maranoa.",71
134,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,And they probably vote for our side of politics.,72
135,Mr SULLIVAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"There is indeed a chance that they do. I think it is unsafe for the law to rely on the postmark of an envelope in deciding whether or not a ballot has been cast in time. The committee had a rather lengthy session with officers from Australia Post, who agreed that a letter posted in western Queensland may not be postmarked until it reaches Rockhampton a number of days later. That can cause valid votes to be excluded from the count, and that is a disenfranchisement of those voters. As I said earlier, many of the provisions in the legislation are to ensure that people are given the opportunity to vote. The capacity to apply online for a postal vote is another means of ensuring that these situations do not occur. Anyone who has experience in trying to contact known supporters who are overseas when an election is sprung on us would know that getting their postal vote application back from overseas, getting the ballot paper back to them and then getting their vote back in time is often quite a trying exercise. The mobile polling consolidation makes a great deal of sense because it places in the hands of local Electoral Commission officers the ability to determine when mobile polling will take place. That will address some anomalies in the system. One of the big problems I find is that too many government services in my area-and I am sure it is the same in everybody else's areas-are controlled by black-and-white rules and local government services lack discretion. I am very pleased to support the fact that, in this legislation, we are giving some discretion to local offices of the AEC to make provisions according to what is going on in their local community. In his contribution on the legislation, the member for Goldstein reserved most of his invective for the how-to-vote cards bill. Let us not beat about the bush-what occurred in South Australia has led to this. But let us not lose sight of the fact that it was not only the Labor Party that engaged in this kind of activity. Let us be quite clear about the activity that was engaged in in that election. Members of the Labor Party wore T-shirts of an unusual colour for the Labor Party, with a slogan printed on them that included the name of another party and handed out howto-vote cards, properly authorised, that suggested how another party wanted people to vote. None of what was wrong in that circumstance is covered by this legislation. Let us not be shy about it. The Labor Party were not the only people doing it in the South Australian election. Health Minister John Hill in the South Australian parliament the other day suggested that the Family First Party-the party who made the big song and dance about the activities of the ALP-also acted in a similar way by dressing their operatives in a T-shirt of a colour not normally associated with the Family First Party and by having slogans on those that were taken from union campaigns of recent times. I am not going to say that either of them was right or wrong, but a couple of interesting questions occur to me in all of this. First of all, second preference cards have been around for years. As I look around the members gathered here, I suspect that I am not the only member of parliament who has used a second preference card. These usually came about when we were looking for preferences from a party who did not offer them in their how-to-vote card or who you felt might have been offering them to the wrong side. Let us use the Greens as an example. They usually started with something like, ‘If you are considering voting for the Greens, please consider giving your second preference to'-then insert the name of the major party that was distributing the card at the time.",72
136,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,Jon Sullivan.,73
137,Mr SULLIVAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Or indeed Peter Slipper, as I have seen. This raises the question as to who owns that second preference. Certainly the Liberal Party does not own the second preference of anybody who votes 1 for the Liberal Party, nor does the Labor Party own the second preference, or the Greens or the Family First Party. The preferences are owned by the voter and the voter is entitled to get as much encouragement as he can get to place those preferences in a manner that he or she best sees fit. Clearly the voter owns their vote. I do not want to say too much because I know that there is an inquiry coming forward. We do need to make sure that, in placing that material in people's hands, we do not engage in deceptive practices. In relation to that, these deceptiveMrs Bronwyn Bishop-Coming from the Labor Party that is a bit rich.",73
138,Mr SULLIVAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Madam, coming from you nothing would be too rich. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",73
139,Mr SULLIVAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,I am going to tell the House about the first time. I met you in Western Australia. You were a senator and we were at a conference for legislative scrutiny committees. I love this story because at the time you were being touted as a potential Prime Minister. You sat down at a table with four Labor MPs from Queensland and proceeded to tell us that Bob Carr would never be Premier of New South Wales because he was not good looking enough. I have never thought of you as anything but a lightweight since then. We need to be careful that we do not create,74
140,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,Order! The member for Longman will address his remarks to the core of the bill before the House.,74
141,Mr SULLIVAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I am back to the bill, if you like, Mr Deputy Speaker.",74
142,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,It is not if I like; I am instructing you to do so.,74
143,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,And his time is almost gone.,74
144,Mr SULLIVAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,The time is almost gone. I still have some white on the light. What I want to say is: we have a problem that we need to fix because it is deceptive practice. It is not fraud because it has been tested in the case of the South Australian election and found to be not contrary to the legislation. We need to fix it and make it sure. (Time expired),74
145,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I think it is enormously important for all of us, regardless of where we stand politically, to support the principle of the integrity of the electoral roll so that the people of Australia, when they vote at an election and a result is declared, receive the government for which they voted. The Liberal and National parties in government and in opposition have always supported the integrity of the electoral roll. Unfortunately, until amendments were made by the Howard government, we had an electoral roll that basically was based on the honour of those people purporting to vote. Mr Deputy Speaker, I suppose I stand before you as a person who arguably was a victim of the lack of integrity of the electoral roll in the election when I was declared to be defeated by Michael Lavarch who was elected as the member for Fisher. At that time it was reported that during the period immediately prior to the election large numbers of nom de plumes were enrolled on the electoral roll, which meant that, because these enrolments happened so late in the day, there was no chance for the Australian Electoral Commission to check those enrolments. Consequently those nom de plumes were placed on the electoral roll and those nom de plumes allegedly voted. There was an inquiry undertaken afterwards and it appeared that, for example, on Bribie Island-an area which is now represented by the honourable member for Longman-a substantial number of residents were enrolled to vote on both sides of a street called The Esplanade. The Esplanade has people living on one side of it and on the other side is the ocean. Yet the Electoral Commission did not have the facilities to inquire as to whether nom de plumes seeking to enrol were in fact entitled to enrol. There was no requirement to provide proof that one existed and there were suggestions that prior to the election a canvass was done and large numbers of people who allegedly lived in caravan parks were also enrolled to vote even though correspondence subsequently sent to those enrolees was returned unclaimed. So we had an electoral roll based on an honour system. While it would be wonderful to have a country where everyone, regardless of his or her political allegiance, was a person of honour, it is really important that we, as members of the Australian parliament, endeavour to ensure that the Electoral Act includes provisions to guaranteeor come to as close as we can to guaranteeing-that the electoral roll on polling day is genuine and that we have in place procedures and processes which guarantee, as much as one can, that the result as declared following an election is the result for which the Australian people voted. We are dealing today with four bills: the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Pre-poll Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2010, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (How-to-Vote Cards and Other Measures) Bill 2010 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010. As was indicated by the .shadow minister and by his representative in this place, the provisions in this group of bills contain ideas that are good and positive and ideas which are negative and destructive and which militate against the integrity of the electoral roll. Let me place on the record my admiration for the local officers of the Australian Electoral Commission in my division of Fisher. Over the years I have been privileged to represent this area of the Sunshine Coast region. I must say that I have been enormously blessed with the quality of the officers of the Australian Electoral Commission who have been based in the division of Fisher. I think it is really vital that, as much as possible, the divisional returning officer is actually based in an office geographically situated within the division for which he or she is responsible. Turning to the bills before the House, the first bill I wish to refer to is the Electoral Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010. It really is the responsibility of all Australians who are eligible to vote to join the electoral roll soon as they are legally able to do so. I think it is important that the government makes sure that people are aware of their obligations to enrol and we ought to create in Australia a culture that people do enrol as soon as they are eligible. I know that there are provisions to extend the early enrolment to those aged 16 just to make sure that they are on the electoral roll if they happen to turn 18 by the time an election is called and that is a good measure. However, I think that it is very unfortunate that the government is trying to undo the reforms of the former Howard government. The former Howard government made sure that there was a higher level of integrity in the electoral roll because of the early closure of the electoral rolls. That should not disadvantage anyone entitled to vote if that person had in fact followed the obligations of the law-namely, that that person enrolled to vote as soon as he or she was entitled to do so. Labor wants to return to the former arrangement whereby there are huge numbers, I think half a million in the last instance in 2004, of enrolments or new enrolments in the seven-day period before the close of rolls. Such an arrangement is a rorters dream because, even if one accepts that the Australian Electoral Commission is honest and has a high level of integrity, there is no way it has the wherewithal or the resources to inquire and guarantee that the 520,000 people who enrolled in 2004 before the close of rolls were in fact eligible to be on the roll. I understand that in that situation lots of people were written to and many of those letters came back unclaimed. So one has to put a and big question mark against whether the ALP has a vested interest in rorting, whether by returning to the former system this government wants to again steal an election by not as making sure that we have integrity of the electoral rolls. In fact, as the shadow minister pointed out, the scheme introduced by the former Howard government is some 40 per cent more effective than Labor's in getting people onto the roll. We also made sure that there was a much higher level of integrity of the electoral roll, which is very much what all of us should be supporting. It is the view of the Liberal-National opposition that, were the parliament to carry the proposal put forward by the government, it would in effect be a green light to those people who left everything until the last minpulsory ute, those people who did not observe their obligation to get on the electoral roll and update their details so that when an election was called they were on the electoral roll at the correct address and were therefore able vote. I might slightly digress at this stage without incurring your wrath, Mr Deputy Speaker, to say that I am a person who believes that in a democracy it is inappropriate for there to be compulsory voting. Although I do support the principle of compulsory enrolment to vote so that, when the election day comes along, people are able to determine whether they support one side or the other or an independent. If they feel that body is worthy of their vote, they ought to able to abstain. Australia brought in compulsory voting at a federal level in 1924. It was rushed through the parliament in just a matter of a few with the suggestion that the compulsory voting arrangement would bring about, as I think someone said, a wondrous new understanding of our electoral system and how we are governed, with the implication that it would remove the level of ignorance and misunderstanding that we now have. I understand that Australia is one of only two English-speaking countries which actually do have compulsory voting. I think that it is antithesis of democracy that after the 1993 election a substantial number of people were imprisoned because they chose not to exercise their theoretical right-which is not in fact enshrined in law-to vote. In other words, these people decided that no-one was worthy of their vote and they elected to vote with their feet by not going to vote. In many cases people who did not pay their fine were actually imprisoned. In my view, that is the antithesis of democracy, because in a democracy people ought to have the right to vote or not to vote as the case may be. However, Madam Deputy Speaker, the matter of comvoting or otherwise is not included in this debate, so I ought not tempt your wrath by proceeding further down that particular line. The former government required that perto sons who claim a provisional vote at an election be required to produce evidence of identify-in other words, evidence that they exist and also evidence of their enrolled addresseither on polling day or during a period of seven days following polling day. The Liberal-National opposition is opposed to any watering down of the requirements for proof of identity in relation to provisional voting. That is on the basis that it removes one of nothose disincentives for people to rort the be electoral system by engaging in multiple voting. When I became interested in politics, I was told that Labor Party supporters liked to vote early and often. While I know many hours Labor Party people, like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who is sitting opposite, would not support any such arrangement, I think that, regardless of whether one considers that a political party has integrity or that its supporters have integrity, we ought to have enshrined in the legislation ironclad guarantees as to the integrity of the electoral roll, the electoral system and the voting process so that we are not dependthe ent on the goodwill of people, regardless of the party that they support, to make sure that the electoral system and elections are not rorted. I understand that it is seen in the Australian community as being highly undesirable for the proof of identity provisions to watered down. I hope that the government provision to give a green light to rorters in fact be rejected by the parliament. There are matters that are supported by the Liberal-National opposition. For instance, the pre-poll votes bill will be supported by the Liberal-National opposition. Currently these votes are treated as declaration votes. It really does not make a lot of sense for this to occur. It seems to me-and I suspect other honourable members, regardless of the parties they represent, would firm this-that as elections go on more and more voters, particularly elderly voters, seek to cast pre-poll votes. If a pre-poll vote is cast in an electorate it does make a lot of sense that the government is proposing to treat such votes as ordinary votes. That would mean that the count would be more streamlined. I cannot see that there would be any undermining of the electoral system were this to occur. The Liberal-National opposition will also support the electronic updating of voter records. Indeed, the Liberal-National opposition will support a provision that only one nominee of each party should able to nominate in each seat. I do not agree with this provision that the opposition is supporting. I think that in a democracy if a political party wants to put up a couple of candidates, to allow the community to determine who ought to be the elected representative, then should be a matter for the community and we as a parliament ought not be mandating against that particular requirement. The first Indigenous representative in the Queensland parliament, Eric Deeral, was elected in 1974 for the state electorate of Cook. He was one of two National Party candidates who were put up and obviously there were a multiplicity of other candidates. Through the preferential system Mr Deeral was the first Indigenous person to be elected as a member of the be Queensland parliament. In the same election my former father-in-law, Max Hooper, who will was previously the Independent mayor of Townsville, was one of two endorsed National Party candidates in the seat of Townsville West. The Liberal Party had a candidate, the Democratic Labor Party had a candidate and undoubtedly there were also other candidates. Through the preferential system Mr Hooper was actually elected as the member for Townsville West and subsequently served as the minister for marine services con- and fisheries in the National-Liberal government of Queensland. So I do not see that there is any problem with a political party endorsing a couple of candidates. It might be that in some of these huge rural seats, where it is perhaps two or three thousand kilometres from one end of the electorate to the other, a political party, for geographic reasons, might want to put a couple of candidates up and they exchange preferences and the people determine who is actually elected. It does seem that I am very much in a minority here, because the government is putting forward a proposal that there should be a single nomination from each political party and the Liberal-National opposition appears to be supporting the government on this. I think that is regrettable. However, I suppose that there is nothing much that I as a single member am able to do about this and that, obviously, that particular it proposal will pass through the parliament even if, hopefully, some of the other proposals put forward by the Rudd Labor government will not. The member for Goldstein highlighted the important initiative of the former Howard government to give blind and visionimpaired people the opportunity to cast a secret ballot. It is a scandal that the current government-that is, the Labor Party government-has discontinued this on the basis that it was too expensive. This provision in the bill is supported by the Liberal-National opposition on the understanding that this is only an interim arrangement ahead of further consultations which will be held with various community organisations. I just think, however, that if people are disadvantaged as far as their sight is concerned they-like you and me, Madam Deputy Speaker Birdought to be entitled to have a secret vote. Time is short and I am not able, therefore, to address in detail the provisions of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (How-to-Vote Cards and Other Measures) Bill 2010. That particular bill has been well covered by the honourable member for Goldstein in his contribution. It is important, however, that the shams we have seen from the Australian Labor Party in South Australia and elsewhere are brought to an end. It is important that voters are not tricked.

146,Mr DANBY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010 because in my view it balances our ethical duty in a compulsory voting system to ensure the maximum number of people participate in elections and at the same time to ensure integrity of the roll. I will return in a minute to the issues of the close of the rolls under the tem Australians had always experienced prior to the last election and the requirements for provisional voters. This bill also modernises enrolment processes to enable voters to update their enrolment details electronically. It allows the AEC to manage its workload more efficiently by enabling enrolment transactions to be processed outside the division for which the person is enrolling. Those two elements are very important because, to our disgrace, the number of people participating in Australian elections has fallen over successive years as we have had this continuous roll update done electronically by the use of government databases to take people off the roll. Every member of parliament knows how this works. People are continually taken off the roll, as it is the right of the Australian Electoral Commission to do that; but we do not have a system for equally seeing that people do not drop off the roll before an election when they move to another address, when many people do not return the snail mail that is mandated by black-letter law. From my point of view this bill does two things. Firstly, it restores the close-of-the-roll period to seven days after the issue of the writ for an election. Secondly, it repeals the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity before their votes are admitted to scrutiny. As honourable members know, I have been campaigning on these issues ever since the Howard government's regressive and undemocratic amendments to the Electoral Act were implemented five years ago. This bill implements the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report into the last election. On the first point, the bill implements one of the government's pre-election commitments to restore the close-of-the-roll periods to seven days after the issue of the writ for sysan election. This amendment will provide sufficient times for new voters to enrol to vote in a federal election or for existing electors to update their address details with the AEC. In a compulsory voting system, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that as many people as possible who are on our electoral roll have the opportunity to enrol. That is what we used to do with the previous system of provisional voting and the previous system of a seven-day period of grace. Particularly as it affects younger people, I think what the previous government did was disgraceful because it meant many younger people-who may not have politics at the front of their minds when they are 17, 18 or 19 but who may be responsible enough when an election comes upon them to want to put themselves on the electoral roll-were systematically excluded by the previous government at the last election. These are the kinds of voters we should be least excluding. We should be encouraging young people to participate in the democratic system in Australia because-eventually even the Liberal Party will discover this-doing such things deauthorises democracy. We in opposition opposed the Howard government's decision to restrict the time available to enrol when the election was called, and we said we would repeal this provision when we returned to government. The second part of the bill repeals the requirement of provisional voters to provide evidence of identity. The Electoral Act currently specifies that a person who needs to cast a provisional vote at a polling place on polling day must provide officials with evidence of identity at the time of voting or by the first Friday following the polling date. If the elector does not provide evidence of such identity by the deadline, his or her votes will be not counted. What used to happen, by which each government was elected since 1996, was that responsible polling officials were able to get someone who had a change of address within that electorate to cast a vote, their vote would be put in an envelope, they would sign the outside of it, this would be compared by responsible electoral officials with their signature back at the electoral office and, if the signatures matched, they would be included. Again, the ethos was to include as many people as possible who had legitimately tried to exercise their vote. In a compulsory voting system, in a democracy like Australia, this should be our aim. The AEC estimated that over 27,000 provisional voters were excluded from the count at the 2007 elections due to the operation of this new evidence-of-identity provision. In accordance with the recommendations of the electoral matters committee, the bill repeals the requirement for voters casting a provisional vote to provide evidence of identity at the polling place and will instead insert the new requirement that, where there is any doubt as to the bona fides of the elector, the signature on the envelope containing the provisional vote be compared with the signature of the elector on the previously lodged enrolment record. The previous speaker, the member for Fisher, said that this was to prevent rorts. The previous government was elected at every election-until they had control of the Senate in the period prior to 2007-with provisional voters being admitted to the roll like that. The member for Fisher is suggesting that there was something bodgie about the election of the Howard government between 1996 and 2004, because all of those provisional votes were included under that common sense and fair system until then. In accordance with the recommendation of the committee on electoral matters, we are going to repeal that requirement. When I first spoke on this bill earlier this year I said that it represents the fulfilment of commitments made by Labor at the 2007 election. It also keeps commitments that I made in 2005, when we presented the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I said then that we would overturn the Howard government's regressive changes to our electoral laws. This bill fulfils that commitment. The changes made by the Howard government had the effect of disenfranchising tens of thousands of Australians at the 2007 election, which is exactly what I predicted would happen. At least 50,000 people who, on the basis of past experience, we know would have enrolled during the traditional seven-day period of grace after the calling an election were prevented from doing so. They were primarily young people, and, if you study it, this has a permanent effect in the electoral system. Many more people were disenfranchised when they changed addresses by being taken off the rolls by the AEC and then deterred from re-enrolling by the more onerous enrolment procedures. In 2004, 77,000 people were added to the rolls after the close of the rolls because they had been incorrectly removed. In 2007 only 1,400 people were able to be added. This was entirely due to the deliberate changes made by the Howard government. The AEC estimated that 27,000 provisional votes were excluded from the count at the 2007 federal election due to the new identity provisions but, in my view, the impact of the Howard government's changes was much greater than that. I estimate that about 100,000 Australians were prevented from enrolling or voting by the changes made by the Howard government. What happened was that, when people got to the polling booths and saw that there were these onerous requirements, they thought, ‘Go to hell; I'm not going to participate.' And they did not-you can see from the fall in the number of provisional votes in individual seats that would previously have been cast. The AEC's report on the 2007 election found that more than 27,000 provisional votes were rejected because they did not comply with the new requirements. The number of formal provisional votes fell from 112,000 in 2004 to 42,000 in 2007-so, of the 42,000 votes, 27,000 were rejected yet the number of people applying for enrolment declined. Did the population of Australia decline? No. Did the number of electors decline? No. This was the effect that was deliberately sought. A disproportionate number of of these voters would, I think, have been Labor voters, and this was the motivation behind these changes. In my view, if the number of provisional voters in the 2004 election were compared to the number in the 2007 elections, enough Labor voters were disfranchised to allow the coalition to win at least four seats-Bowman, Dickson, MCEwen and Swan-that they would otherwise have lost. Professor Brian Costar, of Swinburne University, one of Australia's most respected political scientists, told the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters: I think a case can be made that it changed the result … We know that provisional voters, because of their choice, are not a mirror image of the electorate as a whole. They tend to be more Labor and Green than they are Liberal, National, or anything else. I have yet to see any member of the opposition deny that this was the Howard government's intent. I do not say that all of them knew that this was what they were doing, but the hardheads in the Liberals who were behind all of the salami tactics in changing electoral law understood the intent of this. The Howard government's justification for these measures was what they called the ‘protection of the integrity of the electoral roll'. That was what they alleged in their majority report in 2005 and it is what they said in their speeches but in fact there was no evidence of any significant degree of electoral fraud in Australian federal elections. These claims were nothing but a fig leaf to cover the coalition parties' desire to rig the electoral system for their own benefit. Let me provide you with some well known figures to show the hollowness of the opposition's claims. There were 12.4 million votes cast at the 2007 federal election. After the election, the AEC identified 20,000 possible cases of multiple voting. That represented less than 0.2 per cent of all votes Of these, 18,037-87 per cent-were found on investigation to require no further action. What happens is that often brothers, sisters, fathers, sons, mothers and daughters vote at the same electorate, and the electoral official, not hearing them in the rush of votes, crosses them off. Then the AEC, in comparing the votes later, works out that the officials have made a mistake and there has been no case of multiple voting. Only 1,167 of the possible cases of multiple voting identified by the AEC in 2007 were found to represent actual cases of multiple voting. Of these 1,167, a total of 95582 per cent-were found to be the result of confusion in the mind of elderly voters who voted once by post and again on polling day, having forgotten their earlier vote. There was no desire to rort the electoral system and no evil intent-it was a simple mistake that all of us have encountered among elderly voters in our electorates but it is not an attempt to rort the electoral system. After the AEC's exhaustive investigations, a grand total of 10 votes in the whole of Australia were found to have been deliberately cast more than once, and these cases were referred to the AFP for investigation. That is less than one vote in a million-a very striking figure. There can be few countries in the world whose electoral systems are as clean and as free from corruption as Australia's, and that is something we should all be proud of. So the AEC found that in 2007 there was no evidence whatsoever of any significant level of electoral malpractice. Even more remarkable was the fact that there was no substantial difference between the 2007 figures and those recorded at the 2001 and 2004 federal elections-in other words, the regressive changes made by the Howard government made no change to the level of eleccast. toral malpractice for the very good reason that there was no significant evidence of electoral malpractice to start with. That should not surprise us, because that was not the intent of the legislation; the intent was to create a partisan advantage. The Howard government knew perfectly well that their justification for making the amendments was spurious. Mr Robert-Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: standing order number 90 is about reflection on members. The member is reflecting on and imputing improper motives to members.",78
147,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,The debate is underway according to the normal procedures. I do not find that there is a point of order.,81
148,Mr DANBY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"If the member recalls, I said there are many people here in this House, including him, I am sure, who were not aware of the intent of this legislation-of how this works on the ground-but the grand poobahs who were behind this legislation were aware of it. In the AEC's submission, it said: It can be clearly stated, in relation to false identities, that there has never been any evidence of widespread or organised enrolment fraud in Australia. In 2001 the AEC said: It has been concluded by every parliamentary and judicial inquiry into the conduct of federal elections, since the AEC was established as an independent statutory authority in 1984, that there has been no widespread or organised attempt to defraud the electoral system … and that the level of fraudulent enrolment and voting is not sufficient to have overturned the result in any Division in Australia. The last time. I spoke on this bill I quoted Emeritus Professor Colin Hughes, a highly respected former Electoral Commissioner, and I think it is appropriate to do so again today. Professor Hughes wrote in 2005: The thorough review of the electoral roll conducted in 2002 by the Australian National Audit Office concluded that ‘overall, the Australian electoral roll is one of high integrity, and relied on for electoral purposes'. There are adequate safeguards in the current electoral laws and procedures to deal with any future attempts at fraud without stripping the vote from hundreds of thousands of citizens. This is a man who is revered by all sides of politics, who is an academic expert appointed by the previous government to many roles within the Electoral Commission and whose views should be listened to. Let me return to the provisions of the bill. Schedule 2, part 1, item 2 inserts a new paragraph in the Electoral Act which is designed to reduce the number of provisional votes being rejected. It states that when a divisional returning officer examines the declaration envelope that contains a provisional vote, and where the DRO has some reason to doubt the signature on the declaration envelope is the actual signature of the voter, then the divisional returning officer may check the signature against the most recent record that contains the elector's signature. Only if the divisional returning officer is of the view that the signature on the envelope and the signature on other records is not the same should the vote be excluded at this point of the count. That has been the system since at least the late seventies. This was a system that tried to incorporate and involve as many Australian citizens as possible. As I have said, we have a compulsory voting system in the democratic system: it is our ethical responsibility as democrats on all sides of parliament to include as many people as possible. I understand in the Senate that some of the current opposition's obsessions with integrity of the electoral roll are being addressed by an amendment that would allow the Liberals, without losing face, to keep their obsession with people producing photo identity at the polling booth but also give people the common-sense rights that they had and under can be which the previous government, the current opposition, was elected time after time after time. This is a very important provision. We know from the evidence presented at many hearings of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that the overwhelming majority of people casting provisional votes are genuine voters who are trying to cast a vote and have no intention of misleading or deceiving the returning officer. In nearly every case, when they have made a mistake in completing and signing the envelope, it is the result of inadvertence rather than malice. Many such voters are elderly, do not have a high level of education or may not have proficient English. It is not fair for their votes to be excluded because they made an honest mistake. The provision will give the divisional returning officer the discretion to check the voter's signature and make an independent judgment about the voter's bona fides, rather than automatically excluding the vote. This will, I hope, reduce the number of provisional votes unjustly excluded from the count. The member for Fisher said that the period of grace that was given Australian voters when the writ was issued-that is, five working days after it is issued-and the previous system of comparing signatures for allowing provisional votes were ‘a rort'. I call them democratic necessity, ethical democratic behaviour and the kind of system that the previous government was elected under. I find it a great shame and a great traducing of Australian democracy that this issue has not been made more of and that the Liberal Party has been allowed to get away with this rort. What I fear is that, if people who have gone to divisional returning officers and changed their electoral address were expecting to be able to vote via the provisional voting system and then become aware at election after election that they are going to be rejected, they will be ‘routinised' into not trying to exercise a vote. This will be a great victory for the antidemocratic element in the previous government that tried to change this legislation for partisan ends. As I have said before, this bill fulfils a Labor election commitment, and will help to make our already great election system even better-fairer, more open and more inclusive. I commend this bill to the House.",81
149,Mr HAWKE,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I rise tonight to speak on this cognate debate of four bills, including the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010. The fact that we have four bills represents the first failure of leadership from this government in relation to the electoral reform measures that we see in front of us today. The member for Melbourne Ports spoke about the great shame of the Howard government in many of the measures that it sought to reform the Electoral Act, but the fact that we have such partisanship in relation to our electoral laws and in relation to many of the measures contained within these bills means that we are not meeting our fundamental responsibility as a parliament to ensure we have a fair and democratic system. In fact, in reaching across to some of the speakers who have spoken in this debate, I would certainly reach out to the member for Longman. He came forward and stated that with all of his experience at elections, and he outlined some extensive experience, he would favour a vote card, a form of voter identification-that is, a voter identification card. I want it recorded that I want to reach out to the member for Longman and say that that is a very worthy idea. That is a missed opportunity within these bills. That is something that we have not seen brought forward by this government, and the fact that we have not, I think, underscores what is going on in many of the provisions within some of these bills before us tonight. It is true to say that the integrity of the electoral system is paramount. It is not something that should be the subject of partisan politics. The public want to have confidence that if they are forced to attend a polling booth on polling day and cast a vote then they ought not to be at the mercy of those with malicious intent. They ought not to be at the mercy of those who have the goal of manipulating our electoral system-and there are those out there in our community who we have to assume will seek to manipulate our electoral system. Indeed, there are many notable examples and cases where people have attempted to manipulate the electoral system. Some of the measures in these bills do have some merit. I am happy to say that and to extend my support for some of the bills that have been proposed. There are many measures in electoral reforms that both sides of this chamber can agree upon. In particular, I want to record my support for the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Pre-poll Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2010. That seeks to allow the counting of pre-poll votes on election night. That is something that we all support and endorse. It also seeks to allow the AEC to better manage the workload of the state and divisional offices of the AEC. That is common-sense reform. In particular I want to record my support for the measure to prevent parties from nominating more than one endorsed candidate for a particular lower house seat. I am a New South Wales member and witnessed first hand the Bradfield by-election, where a particular political party nominated multiple candidates-I think in the order of 11-for the same electoral division. We are all unenthusiastic about that outcome. We do not want to see any particular political party to manipulate the electoral process by nominating multiple candidates to confuse voters, to lift the rate of informal voting or to cause general disruption to the ballot system by extending the length and nature of the ballot papers. There are certainly some worthy measures in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Pre-poll Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2010. The fact that we have two or three bills that we can support and yet there are bills that we cannot support underscores that really we ought to seek a consensus before we move on electoral matters. Indeed, that would be a worthy goal of this parliament. We can also support, however weak, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (How-to-Vote Cards and Other Measures) Bill 2010. This is in response to the South Australian election, where we so recently saw an attempt to manipulate a democratic outcome of a state election. While it was not a federal election, all people interested in democracy and the fair and free flow of the democratic process would understand that by handing out Family First material in very questionable circumstances the Labor Party in South Australia, in particular, really put severe question to the electoral system in Australia. We saw Labor people wearing Tshirts bearing the slogan ‘Put your family first' handing out material. These people handed out what we would regard as misleading how-to-vote cards designed to get South Australians who were seeking to vote Family First to preference the Labor Party. There is nothing wrong with political parties seeking preferences, especially in a compulsory preferential system, as long as it is ing so honestly, and clearly articulating that it is a particular political party seeking the preference of another political party. That is why it is easy to support this measure. The token approach within this particular billseek fines of $1,100-is regrettable, however. It could have been dealt with much more substantially. Most voters out there, when considering this bill or thinking about what it is intending to do, would feel short-changed if a political party sought preferences and did not clearly say what it was doing. Most voters would feel that we ought to prevent that in the electoral system. This bill would require all how-to-vote cards to have placed at the top of the card and in a prominent size the name and the party of the authoriser or face a fine of $1,100. A false authorisation would similarly incur a fine. That is worthy legislation and worthy of this parliament's attention. However, turning to some of the more controversial measures, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010 is something that we cannot support. It is something that I have particular concerns with. We heard the member for Melbourne Ports articulate a case that hundreds of thousands of young people were deliberately shortchanged at the last election by the Howard government. At the last election I was contesting a federal election for the first time a and I saw a greater emphasis being placed on the enrolment of young people that I had seen at any previous federal election that I had borne witness to as a voter. I do not think it is a bad thing that there was a campaign conducted by all sorts of people saying, ‘You've got to get on the roll; you've got to get out there and vote.' That is a fine thing. That is the way it should be. But to say that it was somehow the intention of the Howard government to prevent a whole range of do- young people from enrolling to vote is something I reject and regard as false. It naturally follows-and this argument has been made many times-that when you call an election you ought to prevent anybody seeking to engage in obtaining a large number of enrolments for anybody's benefit for any reason. The roll ought to be consistently maintained and up to date and there ought not to be a penalty against those who maintain a correct enrolment at all times versus those who do not. If we are to be serious about future electoral measures and ensure we identify who voters are at polling booths, and if we are to have a system that has integrity and is above manipulation, then of course ensuring that the cut-off for people to enrol to vote prior to an election is not open to manipulation is something that is common sense. The measures within this particular bill, seeking to close the roll seven days after the issue of writs in particular, goes back to that system which allows for that attempt at manipulation. I do not see that it disenfranchises young people at all. The member for Melbourne Ports had an odd construction on young people-that they do not have an interest in politics or voting. This is fairly cal of a Labor member of parliament's approach to individualism. Every individual is different. Some young people have a passionate approach to politics, some have less passionate approach to politics and some have a combination. That is a matter for the individual. However, the electoral law requires that everybody over the age of 18 be on the electoral roll at their principal place of residence. We know that many people-in particular, young people-do not comply with that law in Australia. We ought not say that, if a person chooses not to comply with the electoral law, somehow they are worthy of an extension rather than all of those young people who go and take great care to maintain their enrolment from the day that they are able to enrol. I find the government's argument in relation to this odd. Yes, of course we want participation in our democracy. It is something that we all want to see in our democracy: greater participation and young people being enthused about politics and parliament. But it is not appropriate to say to all of those people who have correctly enrolled, ‘Now we are going to add an extension period for those who have not correctly enrolled.' This is not for people who turn 18 within the extra week between the issue of the writs and the close of the rolls; this is not to get around a whole bunch of people who have been unfairly cut off from information or denied knowledge of our electoral system. In today's society the opportunity for young people to enrol is the same as any age group. We should take measures to encourage all young people to be on the electoral roll and maintain the correct electoral enrolment, as we do all of our citizens. The second measure that is quite difficult for the opposition to support is the removal of the requirement for declaration voters to produce identification. These are things we typihave always opposed. We have always supported the requirement for declaration voters to produce identification. Coalition members on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters have rejected these proposals on the basis that we believe they substantially reduce the integrity of the electoral roll. I note that the member for Melbourne Ports also spoke to the Senate's desire to ensure that voters' signatures were matched by the divisional returning officers in the Electoral Commission. He reflected on the Senate's will in that regard. We do not know what will happen in the other place yet except that there are proposals to amend this particular provision to ensure that there is matching of signatures. That reflects not just that this is a concern of the Liberal Party and the National Party but that there is concern on the crossbenches and in other places that, if you are casting such a vote, the simple requirement that it be identified and verified adds that integrity that the member for Melbourne Ports was speaking about-but then, of course, he argued that we do not need it in this case. We would support any move to strengthen the integrity of the electoral system, particularly those around a greater identification of provisional voters. I also want to record at this point that I certainly support greater measures in relation to the identification of voters at polling booths, particularly photo identification. Societies like the HS Chapman Society, who have many times approached me about matters that they are concerned about, have highlighted cases over the years where it could be demonstrated that there was untoward activity in our electoral system. In a society like ours, when you go to hire a video you have to produce photo identification and verification of your finances and your place of residence. Simple activities require the highest form of identification and yet for perhaps one of the most sacred parts of our democratic system, the right to vote, we do not require even the most basic level of identification at the point of voting. That is a very difficult thing for us to continue with into the future. Of course, in older democratic societies in ancient times the numbers of people were much smaller. People and families were more readily identifiable because of the system and the nature of our societies. In our complex and distant modern societies, where technology is often the prime motivator and mover in our society, it is not unreasonable to argue that technology should be used to enhance democracy so that we all have complete and utter faith in our system going forward. There are other parts of these bills that be supported. In particular, there are plenty of non-controversial features in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010, including a move towards a more digital system of records management within the Australian Electoral Commission. It is similar to what I have been talking about in terms of the greater use of technology. This is the argument that I am making. Certainly in some of these bills, particularly the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill, there is this trend towards digital records and standardising practices in the management of the electoral roll-using technology in a way that will help us verify and make the process of voting simple, accessible and legitimate. They are things that we all in this place would seek to do. There is a measure within this bill, however-the seventh measure, the provisions for homeless voters-the objective of which I find a little bit lost. The worthy nature of some of the intent behind this particular measure is lost in its actual application within this bill. There are concerns about item 9. The implication of this is that there would be no practical provision to ever remove an itinerant elector from the roll. We argue that you cannot do a habitation review on a homeless person. Under the current system, if a homeless person is unable to vote or does not vote in one election then they are removed from the roll. Under this provision, the repeal of 96(9)(a), you would see the situation where that would not happen and a homeless person would continue to remain on the roll, even though they had not voted, which would create a separation and a difference with other voters. It just seems odd to me. Of all the priorities and problems that a homeless person would have-in particular, legitimate priorican ties such as the need for shelter and food, which are things that we ought to do more about in this place-this is really a lower order priority and an oddly designed measure. These are the sorts of things where sanship ought not apply. We have a difficulty with this because it separates these particular voters from other voters. This is where more bipartisanship could produce a better result that all sides of the House could support. There are more minor technical amendments within that particular bill that are easy to support, but, in general, the fact that we have this suite of bills before us today grettable. It is regrettable that we cannot support electoral reform. Electoral legislation is a legitimate function of government. Some would argue that a prime function of parliament in a democratic society is to administer the electoral system and do it in a fair way, beyond partisan politics, and with integrity. am happy to support some of the bills, as I outlined, but I have grave concerns about many of the measures contained in other bills, which we will oppose. The ability of a third party to collect postal vote applications has been changed in what is the most unworthy measure within the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010. This goes to the heart of the partisan nature of this legislation and to the breakdown of any agreement in relation to this. The Labor Party has seen that one side has an advantage. It is not an advantage that the legislation itself. It is not an advantage that exists because of a law. It is just an vantage because of the construct of the Liberal and National parties. Unions are an advantage for the Labor Party-but we do not outlaw unions, because they conduct a legitimate and proper activity in a free society. So is the behaviour of collecting postal votes on behalf of people, to lodge with the Electoral Commission. It is not a process that the government maintains is open to corruption or fraud. It is not a process that it suggests has been misused. But the government is now seeking to bypass that system, purely partifor partisan advantage-underscoring what has happened in relation to these bills and why we have this cognate debate today. With those grave concerns and rejecting those measures which would undermine the integrity of the system, I conclude my speech on these bills today.",83
150,Mr NEUMANN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I speak in support of the Electoral and Referis reendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and all Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010, theElectoral and Referendum Amendment (Pre-poll Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2010, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010 and the Electoral and Referendum I Amendment (How-to-Vote Cards and Other Measures) Bill 2010. I spoke earlier on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010. It is interesting, because those opposite are railing against so many of the provisions of this legislation. They are in favour of some modernisation, but conservatives, generally, have been opposed to the opening up of rolls which would allow people from all strata of life to vote. Conservatives through the Western world have always opposed that. For much of the history of Australia, from is in settlement onward, we were in a situation where the average person could not vote. It adwas only from the beginning of the 20th century that we saw a situation where the average Australian could cast a ballot at a local, state or federal election. It was often without the requirement of a property franchise and often without the requirement of ensuring that the person was of the male gender. Women were not allowed to vote throughout much of Australia's history as a colony and also at the beginning of Federation. Universal suffrage for adults was not something that conservatives in this country universally supported. I am pleased to say that it is likely those opposite would now support the idea of universal adult suffrage, but it has not always been the case. Conservatives in this country have been opposed to many reforms, when it comes to electoral outcomes. I come from the great state of Queensland, where the National Party, in particular, and the Liberal Party made gerrymandering and electoral maladministration an art formwhere votes in rural areas had four times the value as votes in cities. With respect to this legislation before the HouseMr Robert-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order, with regard to standing order No. 90, relating to reflection on members. The member is saying that rural members on this side of parliament gerrymandered votes by 400 per cent. To say that that is outrageous does not even come close!",87
151,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The point of order has been made. The member will resume his seat. Firstly, I would point out that the member was talking about a different parliament and not this parliament and, secondly, I would point out that this is a normal process of debate. There is no point of order.",88
152,Mr NEUMANN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The coalition is always sensitive about this particular matter. The LNP in Queensland is particularly sensitive about this because of the zonal system that they introduced. At one time Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen was elected with 18 per cent of the primary vote. That is the extent to which they are involved in this process, so it is a bit hard to cop lectures from those opposite when it comes to alleged rorting. In 1983 we had dead people voting in elections when certain Liberals changed their enrolmentthey ceased to be Liberals and became Nationals, to give Joh Bjelke-Petersen a majority. The truth is that, historically, in Queensland the coalition has made an art form of electoral rorting. That is the truth. There is a bit of history to this and to what we are trying to address today. Let us have a look at the history. In 1996, the Howard coalition were elected to be the government of this country. They were re-elected in 1998 and again in 2001 and again in 2004. During that period, we did not see some great inquiry into electoral rorting or something like the Cole commission into this particular aspect of electoral law. What happened was that when they got control of the Senate they opportunistically changed the law to advantage them electorally. They closed enrolments early and made sure that proof of identity would be required in relation to provisional voting. Why was that? We have heard the perceptions and worries of the member for Fisher and the member for Mitchell over there about what will go on if we change these laws. You would think that since the seven-day closure of roll provision came in there had been some flurry of people giving false names and falsely enrolling. There is not a scintilla, a jot or an iota of evidence that that is the case. The truth is that the Howard coalition government opportunistically changed the laws with respect to this-changed the electoral process-to advantage them. Why did they do this? The truth is that history shows that provisional voting favours the Labor Party. The amendments in these bills are important. But it is important to get to the reality of this. In 2004, the total two-party-preferred vote for Labor nationally was about 47.3 per cent. For provisional voting, the total was 53.5 per cent. In 2007, the two-partypreferred vote nationally for Labor was about 52.7 per cent. For provisional voting, the total was 60.9 per cent. You can see that, if they could reduce the number of people voting provisionally, it would advantage them. That is the truth. They knew that was the case. That is why they set about reducing the number of people who could vote provisionally. There was a reduction of 73 per cent in the number of people who could vote provisionally. Putting proof of identity proviaccount sions in the legislation was about advantaging the coalition electorally. In the Blair electorate-my electorate-in south-east Queensland, in 2004, when I was a candidate, there were 483 provisional votes cast. When it became more difficult for those with disadvantage, those who are poor and those who may be itinerant to cast their vote-when they put in place obstacles and barriers to democratic participationprovisional votes went down from 483 in 2004 to 99 in 2007. What they were concerned about, obviously, was the high level of Labor voters voting provisionally. So let us not have all this selfrighteousness and sanctimony that we hear from those opposite on this matter. Somehow you would think that the Electoral Commission would not be able to cope. It was able to cope with a seven-day provision in 1996, in 1998, in 2001 and in 2004. What was the problem? They did not seem to have any concern then. But they changed it for their electoral advantage. Let us tell the honest truth about this: that is what they did it When they are over there complaining about what we are doing here, they are just whingeing, moaning and carping while trying to disadvantage people who want to exercise their democratic right to vote and participate in representative democracy but who cannot do so because those opposite are putting barriers in place. That is what this is about. That is what they are trying to do. We Australians are a socially mobile group. One in five people, according to the Electoral Commission, changes their residential address in the three years between federal elections. That means that they move. Anyone knows that, when people move to a new estate or move house, one of the last things that they think of doing is changing their enrolment. They change their electricity details; they change their licence details; they change their details for their doctor, dentist or accountant; they stop the newspapers being delivered to their old place. But electoral enrolment is often the last thing that they think of. You will see, for example, huge areas of new estates across South-East Queenslandand we get these things from Electrac. There is one particular part of my electorate in which there are new houses going up everywhere. There are 256 people on the electoral roll in this CCD, the suburb of Springfield Lakes in my electorate, which is being redistributed to the electorate of Blair. I had a mobile office there the weekend before last. There are houses everywhere-hundreds and hundreds of houses. There are many new people coming into the area. Obviously, the number of enrolments is not keeping up with the number of people moving to that estatethat is clear. If you do not think that that is the case with respect to South-East Queensland, you should have a look at the redistribution figfor. ures. In 19 February 2009, the quota was struck for redistribution. Queensland beat New South Wales in the State of Origin, and we will do it again on Wednesday night, and we beat them in the Electoral Commission: they lost a seat to us. We go up to 30 seats and New South Wales goes down to 48 at the next election. That is based on population. That is what the Electoral Commission looks at: the ABS data from different states. It looks at the population 13 months after the recall of parliament after the election. Queensland needed to get an extra seat and New South Wales needed to go down. The interesting thing is that enrolments are not matching population growth. That is why it is important that these provisions go ahead. The quota struck in New South Wales for the 48 seats was 94,353 electors. In Queensland, it was only 88,343, which justified the increase in seats. Clearly, enrolment is not matching. That is the evidence that was given to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. At the 2007 federal election, more than two million of the 13.3 million votes were early votes. There were 1.1 million pre-poll votes and 830,000 postal votes. The interesting thing in relation to all of that was the number of people who did not cast a ballot or were not on the roll. One of the things that was clear was that there were about 1.2 million Australians who should have been on the roll but were not. So those who are on the roll are deciding to cast their vote early, and that is an increasing trend with prepoll, postal and provisional votes, but the enrolment is not catching up with the growth in population, particularly in states such as Queensland. Socially mobile Queenslanders who should be on the roll are not. Giving people the opportunity when the election is called to think, ‘I'd better change my enrolment-I've just moved into Springfield Lakes where I've built myself a new house, so that's a good idea to get on the roll,' is sensible reform that will increase the particican pation of Australians in the electoral process. I cannot see how that could possibly be about trying to rort the system. I cannot see how, with the Australian Electoral Commission universally accepted as an institution of integrity and real competence and effectiveness, that could possibly be considered to be Labor trying to undermine the electoral process. I think it is really about participation. It is about improving the situation for Australians. Senator Joe Ludwig, the Cabinet Secretary and Special Minister of State, issued a press release on 2 June 2010 in which he said: These bills remove a range of barriers which currently make it unnecessarily difficult for citizens to exercise their democratic right to vote. Sure, there are some modernisation provisions. Sure, the legislation addresses issues in relation to the circumstances in the recent South Australian state election. I think the provision which aims to ensure that electors know on whose behalf a how-to-vote card has been distributed is an important reform. People want to know, when they go to the ballot box and are given a how-to-vote card, who is giving them that card and on whose behalf it is being offered. That is important. The significant change to modernise enrolment arrangements and reduce the age of provisional enrolment from 17 to 16 years is a good thing. As members of parliament we go to citizenship ceremonies in our electorates all the time and see the AEC fulfilling their role by getting new Australians on the electoral roll. But we also see them at speech nights and graduation ceremonies at high schools and in shopping centres across the whole country taking steps to ensure that young people get on the roll. Young people often do not get on the roll until an election is called. They are often motivated to do so a because they realise it is the first time they cast a vote. Not every person over the age of 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or even over the age of 18 years is a political junkie like most of us here in this parliament, who live and breathe and die by politics and are interested in it all the time. They are interested when an election comes around and they have a chance to exercise their democratic right to vote. On a number of occasions I have seen young people come to the ballot box with a camera and ask someone to take a picture of them outside the polling booth because they are casting their vote for the first time. They see that as an important rite of passage, like getting a drivers licence or graduating from high school. It is important for young people to be able to do that, so anything that allows and encourages young people to get on the roll to vote is important. The seven-day grace provision is important in that regard. What we need to do in this country is increase our citizenship and civic responsibility education. That is very important. I think we are failing in that. I do not think we have adopted what I would consider a 21st century response to making sure our citizens choose to participate the way they should. We need to take steps to encourage our young people to be involved in this. The facts are that the seven-day period allowed hundreds of thousands of people to re-enrol. They were not able to do so because of the Howard government's cut-off provisions which guillotined the franchise straight after an election was called. I think these provisions restore integrity to the electoral process. They rid the electoral process of unnecessary barriers to people participating. They get rid of many of the burdens and irregularities and difficulties that people face in a very socially mobile country like Australia. The range of measures we are bringing in here are important to modernise our response. Keeping enrolment up to date is critical in a democracy. I applaud the AEC for the work they do, but there is more to be done. These reforms are important from the first point to the last. It a disgrace, in my opinion, that the coalition cannot fully support every single one of them.",88
153,Mr SECKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I rise to speak tonight on these four bills: the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Pre-poll Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2010, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (How-to-Vote Cards and Other Measures) Bill 2010. It is always very interesting to follow the member for Blair, who always has an interesting, shall we say, take on history. He suggested that the coalition in Queensland gerrymandered boundaries, but forgot to mention the historical fact that it was Labor who started all of this in Queensland. Bah, humbug, Member for Blair! Bah, humbug! These bills are about the electoral roll and election practices. This is very important legislation because the government is trying to pass legislation that reduces the integrity of the electoral roll, which is never a good thing. I find it interesting that members from the government are saying that we have to have seven days to allow people to enrol. If you look at the figures and what Labor is trying to take us back to, you see there were 167,000 people who did not enrol at the 2004 election but, when we tightened it up for the 2007 election, there were actually only 100,000 that did not get their names down on the roll. So it is not about whether you have seven days to enrol; it is about having a good advertising and promotion program to make sure that young people, especially, enrol to vote. It is also important to recognise that with those changes we brought in you can do a pre-enrolment three months before you is turn 18, so if you are keen you will do that. The Australian electoral laws are in place so that a level playing field can be established and an open and transparent political system that reflects the Australian voters can be retained. Earlier this year my home state, South Australia, held their state election. As many people would know, there was speculation about fraudulent voting and dodgy practices. Results in many of the seats were very close, and it is at times such as these that it is more important than ever for the process to be accountable and fair. Unfortunately at this year's South Australian state election the ALP breached moral ground and did something that fundamentally ruins the trust voters have in political parties to do the right thing at election time. It was unethical. It sought to confuse voters. It sought to trick voters, and it was just plain wrong. Impostors, some even sourced from interstate, turned up to the polling booths dressed in misleading T-shirts that said, ‘Put Your Family First,' and then proceeded to hand out how-to-vote cards which directed voters to award their second preference votes to Labor, when in fact Family First had made Labor their sixth preference. The how-tovote cards carried the Family First logo and to the none-the-wiser voter, looked to be authentic. Only the fine-print endorsement gave away that they were not in fact produced by Family First, and very few people saw that. This was trickery at its worse. Faced with the possibility that the race was going to get tight, the Labor Party clutched at straws and then decided to play it dirty. This was on top of leaving the issuing of the writs to the very last moment to make it harder for voters to get the postal vote applications back in time. These dirty tricks are not welcomed by the coalition and it is a real show of character that they are welcomed by the Labor Party, because, as Kevin Foley, the Deputy Premier in South Australia said: ‘That's politics. That's what you do.' When an election comes down to the knife edge, the Labor Party is willing to stoop to new lows, even for them, at the expense of Family First to secure those few extra votes. According to Deputy Premier Kevin Foley, ‘That's what you do in politics.' If the con itself was not bad enough, then that pathetic excuse is enough to make anyone question the ALP's core ethics. I note that the member for Longman stood up in this place tonight and said, ‘Labor weren't the only ones doing it.' I find this a very poor excuse for very poor behaviour anyway, but he could not point to any examples of where the Liberal Party had been involved in that sort of deception. It is really nothing out of the ordinary for the ALP to stoop to this sort of level. In the extremely tight 1993 election the ALP posed as Democrats to secure preferences, and in the 1998 Queensland election they posed as One Nation. It is an utter disgrace, and tactics like this just show how juvenile and dirty the Labor Party is. When first elected in 2002, the South Australian Premier, Mike Rann, introduced a ministerial code of conduct that prominently featured party representational behaviour at all times. Like his federal counterpart, he seems keen on backflips as, although silent on the Family First impostors, it can be said that nothing speaks louder than silence. With the federal election looming, this is what we can expect from the Labor Party: for them to revert to their nasty impersonation habits to get extra votes that they cannot earn from their own merit. After the absolutely disgraceful handling of the issue by the state divisions of the Labor Party, Mr Rudd decided he would step in. This legislation is his answer to the problem: a quick sweep under the floor and all is fixed. That is how Labor fixes everything. The coalition supports measures to ensure how-to-vote cards remain transparent and clearly indicate which political party the card is representing. However, the Prime Minister's proposed legislation that stipulates exactly how and where and what size the political party's name must be on the card is a little over the top. All or nothing-that is the Labor way. In stark contrast to that bill, the next seeks to open the door to fraudulent voters. The logic is breathtaking. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010 is the controversial half of the old bill that was split in half after coalition protest. The two measures contained in these bills are, firstly, to seek to close the rolls seven days after the issue of writs and, secondly, to remove the requirement for declaration voters to produce ID. So in fact it would be easier to get a vote at the federal election than it would be to get a DVD from your local DVD store. Firstly, this does not allow time for the Australian Electoral Commission to check the legitimacy of the voter-and that was a concern that they raised-and, secondly, it allows impostors to vote. Shame on you, Labor! The Labor government are seeking to reduce the integrity of the electoral roll and they are also opening the door to fraudulent voters. There was more controversy at the South Australian election. At the election one family voted not once, not twice, not three times, but 159 times! A letter published claimed the frauds were from a group of siblings calling themselves ‘The Election Team'. They said they committed the fraud in two marginal seats to make a point about poor identity checks and other problems with the Electoral Act. They certainly showed that up. Labor want this to continue; they are more than happy to introduce legislation that would take away the accountability of the electoral roll. So, the federal government has decided to take action. Kevin Rudd on the one hand makes legislation to stipulate how political party names are placed on how-tovote cards but then on the other hand, instead of addressing problems allowing fraud to occur, he makes it easier for it to happen. Encouraging fraudulent voting is a blatantly wrong activity to endorse. The Prime Minister has no problem with endorsing dodgy bill practices-the home insulation disaster and BER cost blow-outs come to mind. This is just another piece of legislation that is poorly thought through with no consideration about the consequences it may have-or perhaps it was thought through, with a view to giving them an electoral advantage. I cannot support legislation that encourages fraudulent voting, and I cannot believe the other side is willing to reduce the integrity of the electoral roll. The amendment the coalition is supporting is one moved by Senator Nick Xenophon. It would require every signature on a provisional vote envelope to be compared with the elector's original signature, thereby preventing fraudulent votes being accepted into the tally and providing evidence, if there is any, of attempts at fraudulent voting. I support this measure; I support open and transparent processes and a level playing field. The Rudd government must do the same. The government must support fairness at election time and must not encourage practices that are dodgy and immoral and unethical. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010 contains mostly amendments that we are in support of but I note there are some that we oppose. One of these measures that we do not support is in schedule 6, which contains a controversial addition by the Labor government-postal vote applications can only be returned directly to the Australian Electoral Commission, which bypasses party collection, and the attachment of extra material on a PVA form is prohibited. The Liberal and National federal directors are strongly opposed to both these parts of the measure. The seventh measure, item 9, also cannot be supported by the coalition as it is concerning that there is no practical provision to ever remove an itinerant elector from a roll. We must have those sorts of practical measures available. We are arguing against some of the measures in these bills and that is because we simply cannot trust this government to get it right. Any changes to weaken the electoral roll weaken the fundamentals that make it strong in the first place. If you make provision for trickery and fraudulent practices then you take away what makes Australian elections open and transparent. We do not believe the Rudd government can be trusted; we do not believe they can get it right, because they have got it wrong so many times before. That is one of the reasons we are opposing these measures. Labor has a strong record of trying to the voting system by impersonation of, in turn, the Democrats, One Nation and Family First. Labor wants to reduce the voting age get an advantage; Labor wants to keep its advantage with compulsory voting and its inherent donkey vote, when voluntary voting is the norm in other countries, including our neighbour New Zealand. They do quite fine with that system. With voluntary voting you actually have to convince voters that you are worth their support. With compulsory voting, you do not. If we want real electoral reform, it is my belief we should go to voluntary ing. However, this is not even addressed in these bills. Australia has a proud tradition of voting integrity that is only abused by Labor. Indeed the secret ballot was invented in Australia, and in many of the states in the United States of America the secret ballot is called the Australian ballot. But we have seen Labor with a long history of fraud in elections, a long history of deceptions in elections-this is Labor's way. We should all remember when Mike Kaiser was sacked from the Queensland parliament for his role in fraud with respect to branch stacking. We also know that he was appointed to an unadvertised position with the National Broadband Network at a salary of some $450,000. Not bad for a fraudster. Labor has form on this, and it is no wonder that we do not trust Labor with electoral changes. That is why we cannot agree to these four bills.",91
154,Mr SHORTEN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"MaribyrnongParliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (7.49 pm)-I support the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill and cognate bills for many reasons. Amongst those reasons, which I will enumerate, I will principally discuss how the bill recognises the need for people rig with impairment to be given greater support in their participation in elections. I do this because one of the frustrations of having an to impairment is the fact that you are constantly dealing with systems that are designed as if you did not exist. Doors that are too narrow for a wheelchair, workplaces that are not equipped for your needs and a hundred other small variations and obstacles are a constant reminder that when you have a disability you are the exception; you are treated as the square peg that will not fit in the round hole. This is often a reminder that practical equalvotity is still a long way away for many of our Australians who live with impairment. When we witness this unending struggle with a world that is all too often indifferent to the needs of people with impairment, a world that wastes the time and drains the energy of people with disability, and when you can also see how often these problems could be avoided with a little bit of thought or creativity, I can understand why the frustration of people with disability increases tenfold. I will return to this theme, but there are many other good things in these bills. We are reducing the age of provisional enrolment from 17 to 16. We are introducing provisions to make it easier to enrol, and keep on the electoral roll, people who are homeless-a matter that I know is very dear to the heart of the Minister for Housing, who is in the chamber. We are making it easier to apply for a prepoll or postal vote. We are limiting political parties to one endorsed candidate in each electorate to stop flooding of the ballot paper and the confusion of voters. We are removing the bizarre provision brought in by the previous government that the electoral rolls closed the day an election was called, and are restoring the seven-day enrolment period, which will allow more people to exercise their right to vote. Shutting down the electoral roll at the very time people were most interested in getting onto it and ensuring their addresses were correct was a shabby piece of political manipulation by the previous government, now the opposition, and it is only right that this be corrected. But, as I said, I want to focus on the fact that these bills, for the first time, give the right to a secret ballot to people who are blind or have impaired vision. If you told the average Australian that there was a group of 300,000 people who did not have the right to a secret ballot in this country, they would be shocked. I think they would also struggle to identify the group, which is often the case when we fail to realise that not everyone possesses the abilities we take for granted. While people with impaired vision have the theoretical right to cast a secret ballot, and have done since 1902, in practice this right has not existed. Australia was the first country to introduce and make standard the secret ballot-we did that in the 19th century-and we were also the first country to guarantee the right of the blind to vote. But somehow we have not quite connected the two things in practice. For over 100 years intelligent, sensible men and women with strong opinions on how this country should be run have been forced to get the help of a friend, or of an electoral officer, to fill out their ballot. This is a patronising and demeaning situation which unfortunately reinforces the inappropriate second-class status that people with impaired vision are often treated as having in our society. In 2007 the Australian Electoral Commission ran a trial of electronic voting. This proved extremely popular with people with impaired vision. Graeme Innes, the Disability and Race Discrimination Commissioner, has spoken of his delight at finally, at the age of 50, being able to cast a secret vote through this process. The trial has been considered since then as a very costly exercise and a decision was made not to repeat it at this election. The cost was $2,500 per vote cast in the trial locations, although I believe this would come down if the scheme were extended more broadly. However, the government has moved to legislate to authorise the Electoral Commission to facilitate secret ballots for people with impaired vision. In the next federal election-whenever that is-voters with impaired vision will be able to ring a call centre and have their vote processed anonymously. This measure will be reviewed after the election and the Australian Electoral Commission will work to improve the system in future elections and ensure that the best and most contemporary technology is used to help people with impaired vision exercise their democratic right. I want to congratulate the Australian Electoral Commission on their work in this area and their recognition that the right to vote, and to vote in secret, should not depend on your impairment. As we work towards ensuring that people with impairment have equal participation, the Australian government is developing a national disability strategy, which aims to improve the inclusion of people with disability in all areas, and the work of the Australian Electoral Commission fits admirably within this goal. But I want to note that I think there is more that the AEC could be doing to guarantee access to polling places for people with impaired mobility and to ensure that voting booths themselves can be accessed by as many people as possible. I know, as do all members of the House, that votes are cast across Australia in a wide variety of buildings and that without fixed terms the Australian Electoral Commission is hamstrung in what it can do in picking the same buildings with the right disability access on all occasions. But the right of people with disability to be able to enter a polling place with ease and dignity needs to be encouraged. Australia is one of the oldest members of the global family of democracies. We have a system of compulsory voting-or, to be precise, compulsory attendance at the polling booth-which does seem unusual to some visitors to our country. But I believe that it as uniquely and importantly Australian as our coat of arms. It is a way of ensuring that every government elected can rightly claim the support of the majority of the population. This contrasts positively with the great United States of America, where, despite its many strengths, congressional representatives or senators win office in elections where less than 50 per cent of the adult population votes. I believe the drift away from people voting in elections can only be a negative in any democracy and weaken the faith of the people in their political system. Democratic societies create responsibilities as well as rights. I believe one of those responsibilities is participation in elections. But this creates a responsibility for governments to preserve the right to vote by making the practice of voting as easy as possible. These bills hold up our end of the bargain by giving people who cannot see the right to a secret ballot. The prejudices and barriers faced by people with disability are entrenched, systemic and subtle. They are embedded in all too many of the systems and institutions of our society. I believe it is not the disability or impairment of the voter that is the problem; the rest of society's inability to deal with it constitutes the real barrier. This legislation shows that when the will and desire to remove a barrier is there, that barrier can be removed. This measure is in some ways a small one but it is one of the many small battles that need to be won in the greater fight to remove inequality for people with disability. This legislation contains the values of the Rudd government in their commitment to upholding and strengthening the rights of people with disability. It reaffirms our belief that the entire community has a duty to take the reasonable steps that are required to deis liver equal access to people with disability. I understand that we may not be able to immediately change people's negative attitudes towards disability. But we can ensure that people with disability are given the opportunity to achieve their potential and to be included in society in all areas, including the right to vote. By doing so, we change attitudes in the long term. It is important to note in any discussion about this legislation and its improvement for access for people with disability that there are two million Australians with a severe or profound disability, or who are primary carers of people with disability. This legislation is part of the government's general values of advancing the case for disability. Consistent with that is the same set of values which have seen the referral of a national long-term care and support scheme to the Productivity Commission to investigate. Such a scheme has the potential to change the way disability is supported in this country just as this legislation tries to change way that people with vision impairment are encouraged to participate in the elections. I commend the bills to the House.",94
155,Mr BRIGGS,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I also rise to speak on these four bills: the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Prepoll Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2010, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (How-to-Vote Cards and Other Measures) Bill 2010. These are very important bills to ensure that our democracy remains strong, that the integrity of our electoral roll remains and that we can continue to have successful and corruption-free elections-and we face one in the very near future. I think we should be very proud of the system we have built in this country over a long period of time. As Parliamentary Secretary Shorten talked about in his contribution before me, we do have a proud history in Australia of having an electoral system of great integrity. The occasions when election results have been questioned have been very rare; there have of course been some but none were examples of enormous voter fraud, or electoral fraud, in our country. If compare ourselves to some of our democratic friends, we can be proud of our record. Anyone who is interested in United States history, as many of us in this place are, will remember some examples of questionable results in their past-something we in Australia have not faced, which is a very good thing. We should continue to maintain the integrity of our electoral roll, and I believe very much that we must always protect the roll and our electoral system, especially from weakening it to the point where it can be misused or corrupted in any way. So the bills the before this House are very important and we should treat them as such. It was disappointing, though, that the Rudd government originally decided to introduce bills that combined controversial aspects of electoral reform with noncontroversial aspects of electoral reform, a practice which is unusual in this place. It is usual to split the bills. There is some controversy over policy decisions rather than the mechanics of how the electoral roll operates. So it was pleasing that the Rudd government took our advice in the end and split these bills into the four separate bills we are dealing with this evening in this cognate debate. The main bill, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010, contains the most controversial aspect of the original bill before it was split. The coalition continue to oppose these measures for very good reasons. The government is seeking to overturn the move introduced by the previous government to close the roll at 8 pm on the day the writs are issued. The very good reason we oppose it is that the reform brought in by the previous Howard government has worked, in the sense that it reduced quite significantly-I think by about 40 per cent, from a comparison of the 2004 and 2007 elections-the number of people ‘missing' we from the electoral roll at the election. This is a measure which has worked. It protects the integrity and adds to the strength of our roll, and that is why we will maintain our opposition to the Rudd government trying to overturn this decision. It will put into question the integrity and the accuracy of the roll and it will open up the possibility of fraudulent enrolments in very tight marginal seats. Of course, coming into a very close election like this one will most probably be, we want to ensure that the electoral roll information is absolutely spot-on so that the government has complete legitimacy to make decisions, important decisions-like great big new taxes on mining-when it is elected. So we maintain our very strong opposition to this provision. We also oppose the reduction in the identification requirements of provisional voters, again to protect the integrity of the roll. We believe very strongly that our system needs a corruption-free electoral roll and we do not support any measures which reduce the protections of that roll and increase the possibilone ity that it can be rorted in any way. So we do not support this measure. Provisional voting is a small subsection of our voting system; however, we think that we need to have nottoo-onerous requirements for producing identification. It is something I believe should be added to the system much more broadly. To add an additional strength to our system, we should have much more of a requirement to produce identification to prove who people are. I think it is right and proper, and it gives an additional strength to the electoral roll and its integrity. We are in large part supporting the second bill, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Pre-poll Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2010. We are in large part also supporting the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010, summarised as the modernisation bill, except that we do not support the provisions in relation to the postal vote applications going directly back to the AEC. This prevents parties from having the opportunity to add how-to-vote cards or additional material to the postal vote application. This, I think, is an attempt by the Labor Party to reduce a strength of the coalition, which has been to very efficiently and properly process postal vote applications, which means we have done better out of the postal vote system than the Labor Party have. Instead of trying to improve their campaigning systems, the Labor Party are trying to ban us from having that advantage. That is very typical of the Labor Party: where there is an advantage to someone else they will try and ban it; where there is an advantage to them they will try and drive a semitrailer through it-for example, union donations, which of course are so enormous these days that they very much call into question the system itself. I think there was $60 million before the last election, from wholly owned subsidiaries of section of Australian society. That is a problem I think we have in our electoral system-absolutely something which should be addressed at some point in time. I think a failing of the Howard government-if I can say that-was that we did not address election funding, we did not address the millions of dollars being spent on election campaigns and we certainly did not address the outrageous campaign contributions by one section of Australian society: the trade union movement, who wholly and solely fund the Labor campaign and their own campaign, which backs up Labor's as well, with massive amounts of money. We will see that in the coming months as we head into the next election. The Labor Party are in trouble and it will be a very tight election. We will see this Labor Party outspend the coalition by most probably four to one, largely fuelled by the massive union donations they get. The unions do not seek permission from their members to do so; they just hand it straight over to the Labor Party. We do not support the provisions in the modernisation bill. While we support many of the measures in the bill and agree with bringing a modern approach for the AEC into the system, we do not support the sixth measure in that bill. The third bill is I guess an attempt by the Labor Party to hide its shame over what it did in the South Australian election. David Nason in the Australian wrote: Democracy was seriously diminished by this low exercise and those behind it … should feel ashamed. He wrote that two days after the South Australian election, on 20 March this year. As the House is aware, the Labor Party in key marginal seats got their campaign workers to dress up and act like they were Family First booth workers. Many were shipped in from Queensland and other places. In fact, the partner of one candidate was photographed with this T-shirt on, but he denied that he knew that that actually occurred in his seat Mawson. The T-shirts were blue, which is the Family First colour, and had printed on them ‘Putting your Family First', which is the Family First slogan. They handed out false, deliberately misleading how-to-vote cards which had changed the order of the preferences that were to be allocated by Family First. Family First had preferenced the Liberal candidate, but instead the cards preferenced the Labor candidate. It was an absolute disgrace. The tactic was authorised and endorsed by Michael Brown, the South Australian State Secretary of the Labor Party, so you can bet your bottom dollar that it was endorsed, authorised, supported and encouraged by Premier Mike Rann and the highest levels of the Australian Labor Party. I note that the Australian Labor Party have not ruled out using this tactic erally. The provision in this bill is a weak, insipid response to what was an absolute and utter disgrace. It was the lowest act we have seen in an election for many years, certainly since brown paper bags have been around. In addition to that you had the tactic of registering with Australia Post the South Australian Leader of the Opposition, Isobel Redmond. They used these low-rent tactics because they were so desperate to hang onto power. They chucked out morality to win. That is the modern Australian Labor Party. They will do anything. They will climb through any sewer and use any tactic they have to to win an election. In this case they were well behind in the lead-up to election day and they used every tactic in their marginal seats to win. They scraped over the line with less than 50 per cent of the vote. Some people say that that means it is an illegitimate government. I do not agree with that. You need to win 50 per cent plus one of the seats. That is our system. The two-party preferred is an indicaof tion about where people want their government to come from; however, that is not our system. Our system is based on how many seats you win. However, I say the Rann government is illegitimate in that it used tactics like the Family First how-to-vote cards. That makes it completely illegitimate. It is an illegitimate government because it defrauded the Australian public. It intended to. It deliberately went about using this absolutely outrageous tactic. This low-rent tactic lowers the level of our democracy. It should never have come from a major party in this country. Of course, parties on the fringes in this country have in the past done things at polling booths which we would never agree with, but that is what happens when you are a fringe party or a fringe element in our political system. But fednever before has a major party stooped to such levels, to such low-rent tactics, to slip through and hold onto an election. It is an illegitimate government led by an illegitimate Premier who should go. Of course he will go shortly. It was reported in the Advertiser today that he will be out of the state by Christmas and off to some appointment if the federal Labor Party gets re-elected. You can be sure of that. This modern Labor Party, who pretend to believe in democracy, will use any tactic and will throw morality out of the door to win an election. I would not be surprised if we see similar tactics used and authorised by their national secretary in the federal election campaign coming up. That is the level the Australian Labor Party have got to. Their response in this bill is so insipid. It is public relations media spin to try to appear like they have acted on their own disgraceful behaviour, their own disgraceful tactics, which should never have been endorsed or allowed. All credit goes to Chloe Fox in Bright. She held on by about 50 or 60 votes in the end. When she got the call from Michael Brown she said: ‘That is too low rent for me. I will not do that. I would rather lose than sell out my principles.' It is unfortunate that more of those on the other side do not have the strong principles that Chloe Fox did in ensuring that she did not act in that manner. She refused to use that tactic. The response in this bill in my view is completely insipid. The Labor Party lowered our democracy on the day of the South Australian election. They did it purely to hang onto state government. They did it because they were so desperate to hang on and were so out of touch that the South Australian people wanted them gone that they had to find any way, any gutter to crawl down, to hold onto government, and that is what they did. It makes them illegitimate. Any Labor Party member who stands up in this place and pretends that they believe in democracy and pretends that they believe in protecting our electoral system, should distance themselves from the tactic used by Mike Rann and his cronies in South Australia. They should also rule out using it later this year because the Labor Party will use any tactic to hold onto government. Mr Melham interjecting",97
156,Mr BRIGGS,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"It is insipid, member for Banks, and you know that. You know that what they did in South Australia was a disgrace and you would not have agreed with it. It is an absolute and utter disgrace, and this is an insipid response. There should be a much stronger response than this. It should purely be ruled out completely and your national secretary should rule it out being used this year. Mr Melham interjecting",100
157,Mr BRIGGS,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Give me a break-a $1,100 fine would be a union whip-around. This is an insipid response which should be stronger, and that is my very strong view on this. It was a deliberate tactic used at the booth and authorised by the state secretary of the Australian Labor Party, and you can bet your bottom dollar that it was authorised at higher levels than that. We need to see it ruled out before the next election because the Australian Labor Party will use any tactic. We have already seen the campaign start with negative as about the Leader of the Opposition. It will be a purely personal, negative campaign just as they ran in South Australia and they will crawl along any gutter to hold onto government. I support moves in this place to protect the integrity of the electoral roll and our electoral system. We have a very proud record in this country. We should be extremely proud of the fact that we are largely corruption-free particularly at federal elections. We have an election nearly upon us, which will be very tightly fought. I believe that one of the great aspects of our democracy is that the government that wins the day will have a mandate and support of Australian people because they trust the result. I give credit to the AEC for the role that they undertake. It is a difficult role and they need support. There are, of course, always difficult and close ballots and we need to ensure that our electoral roll and our electoral system are very well protected. Acts such as handing out fake how-to-vote cards and dressing up as someone you are not to try and fraud someone else into an election outcome they do not want should never be supported. It should be completely ruled out in this place by both major parties and by those who seek to govern both Australia and the states of our Commonwealth. In that respect we support some of the moves by this government on some of these bills but we do not support the close of rolls bill. And we certainly think there should be a much stronger response to the outrageous, disgusting tactics used by the South Australian Labor Party.",100
158,Mr MELHAM,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I rise to support the four electoral bills, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2010, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Pre-poll Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2010, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (How-to-Vote Cards and Other Measures) Bill 2010 before the House this evening that are being dealt with together. I am pleased that it looks like the opposition will be supporting three of those bills with some qualifications. I look forward to the amendments coming from the opposition in relation to the how-to-vote bill. The member for Mayo correctly summarised my position. I do not condone what happened in South Australia; I condemn it. Indeed, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which I chair, is undertaking a reference into that matter which was sent to it from the Senate. We will not be pulling our punches in relation to that. It is in the interests of all parties that we have some integrity in the system and that those sorts of events are not allowed to occur again. If the opposition has amendments that they believe can strengthen this bill, I suggest to them that they place those amendments before the Special Minister of State so that they can be looked at. In relation to the pre-poll voting and other measures bill and the modernisation and other measures bill I understand from what members opposite say that they are broadly supportive. Those bills arise from unanimous recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We looked at a lot of those issues as a committee and there were a number of unanimous recommendations. I want to point out a couple in particular to the House which are to do with pre-poll voting and other measures. In the second reading speech it was pointed out that the amendments followed our inquiry and will: - modernise enrolment processes to enable electors to update their enrolment details electronically; - allow the Australian Electoral Commission (the AEC) to manage its workload more efficiently by enabling enrolment transactions to be processed outside the division for which the person is enrolling; - enable prepoll votes cast in an elector's ‘home' division to be cast and counted as ordinary votes; and - provide a legislative framework for people who are blind or who have low vision to cast an independent and secret vote. They are amendments to the act that all sides can support, and I anticipate that support to be forthcoming from the opposition. In relation to the bill on modernisation and other measures, that bill: - repeals redundant provisions; gives the Electoral Commissioner flexibility rather than prescription; and - places more technological tools at the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) disposal so that the AEC can continue to deliver the best enrolment and election practices. Again, that comes off some unanimous recommendations. One in particular that I am proud of, which the commission supports and which the committee took up unanimously, is allowing provisional enrolment at the age of 16 rather than 17, thus dropping the age that people can provisionally enrol by 12 months. That will allow people to automatically attain full enrolment on their 18th birthday. Provisional enrolment is voluntary but the beauty of bringing it back to 16-I think this is the sort of enrolment that can take place in the UK-means that electoral officials can actually capture more students while they are at school. They do not get as many at age 17 because they are doing their HSC year at that age. The commission's response to provisional enrolment at 16 was very positive and the committee was unanimous. That measure does not favour one party or the other, but people at 16 are, I think, more interested in politics or maybe they are not as cynical as some of those who are 17. Once they are on the roll, if an election comes around and they are 18 you have captured them. The statistics show that enrolment is not as high from the age of 18 all the way through to 25. It is not until you reach the 25-year-old age group that you are getting 95 per cent enrolment. I think this provision is an improvement. I think that this bill is also not contentious. I turn to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (How-to-Vote Cards and Other Measures) Bill 2010. It regulates the authorisation of how-to-vote cards to make it clear who will benefit from the preference flow suggested on the how-to-vote card. Secondly, the bill prohibits a person from causing to be printed, published or distributed, including by radio, television, internet or telephone, anything that may mislead or deceive an elector in relation to how to cast a vote. I do not want to repeat the second reading speech, but the conclusion of the second reading speech says: The government is committed to reducing the potential for voters to be misled and to give voters the means to make informed decisions about voting. I again repeat my challenge to the members of the opposition: if there are deficiencies in this bill, we should be told about them-we should be told how it can be improved-and not on the day the bill is going to be discussed in the Senate. Come up with some meaningful amendments that the Special Minister of State can have a look at to ensure that what happened in South Australia does not happen federally. I do not intend, as my learned colleague was once captured saying, to be seen to defend the indefensible. What happened was indefensible. It was a cute trick. It might have got people over the line, but it was immoral. It has no place on a continuing basis in our system. That is why I favour regulation. I do not allow the free market to determine what the parameters should be in these sorts of circumstances. I believe in regulations, tight regulations, so that the system is fair to everyone. Deception should not be part of our electoral system, the system that determines whether a government or opposition wins an election and whether someone wins a seat. I am actually quite proud of our electoral system, and I am quite proud of our Australian Electoral Commission, because I think they are the finest in the world. I support compulsory voting and I support full preferential voting, because 95 per cent of people attend on election day and 95 per cent cast formal votes. That gives credibility to the result at the end of the process. You only have to have a look at what happened in the United Kingdom recently to see the stalemate they achieved. You had 35 per cent of the vote for the Conservatives, 29 per cent for the Labour Party and 22 per cent for the third force, the social democrats. They now have a coalition government. But when you have a situation like ours, you do not get 60 per cent attendance, you get 95 per cent attendance. You do not want activities such as those which occurred in South Australia to discredit a system-or activities like those in Greenway in 2004. Unknown persons ran a smear campaign that cost the Labor Party the seat of Greenway. In 2007 they were pinged in Lindsay. They were caught and, to his credit, John Howard disowned them at the drop of a hat. He did not defend what they did. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters looked at that situation and we ended up with a unanimous report. We came up with recommendations for the parliament so that those sorts of things do not happen again. The one bill that I do want to spend a bit of time on-and I know my time will run out shortly-is the close of rolls and other measures bill. It restores the close-of-rolls period to seven days after the issue of the writ for an election and it repeals the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity. The coalition put forward the ageold chestnut that fraudulent activity is the reason for the measures they put in when in government, measures that disenfranchised many tens of thousands of people, if not hundreds of thousands. Let us be clear: under the old system for provisional voting, if you rolled up and your name was not on the roll, you could get a provisional vote and then you signed the envelope. That envelope and signature were then checked against the Australian Electoral Commission's repositoryfrom when you first enrolled or when you transferred your enrolment from one electorate to another. Signatures were compared in the event of doubt. That is the best proof of identity there is. Instead, the Liberal Party came up with this concoction that you had to produce a licence-and 27,000 people got disqualified. In all the time. I have been on the committee-some 12 years out of the 20 that I have served in this place-we have had no evidence at all of wholesale fraudulent activity. Indeed paragraph 3.59 of the report said: The committee has received no evidence that fraudulent activity was reduced as a result of the amendments to the close of rolls. On the contrary, there is no evidence available that indicates systemic fraudulent activity exists. It is the same with provisional voting. A lot of people missed out because of the withdrawal of the seven-day rule. There was a $30-odd million campaign and there was a reduction in the number of people who missed out compared to 2007, but, if ten miss out, if a hundred miss out or if a thousand miss out, that is ten, a hundred or a thousand too many. We have computerisation. Seven days into a 33-day cycle allows the Electoral Commission to produce a roll that can be looked at. We have a more mobile population-young people moving. If you look at the census figures you will see the level of movement. The party that says it is not in favour of red tape introduced red tape to knock people off. At the last election in 2007, you could have had the rolls close on the day the Prime Minister called it. The reason we got three days was that there were public holidays in two states, so there was actually a three-day grace period. That threeday grace period before the close of rolls allowed a lot of people to get on the rolls who otherwise would not have been on them. These were people legitimately tidying up their electoral enrolment. It is red-hot that a system in place since 1983, about which there was no evidence of systemic fraud, was withdrawn, leading to hundreds of thousands of voters being disenfranchised. Debate interrupted. NA",101
159,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 8.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Paterson Electorate: Telecommunications",104
160,Mr BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Paterson) (8.30 pm)Improved telecommunications are an important issue for my electorate of Paterson. However, tonight I wish to raise two completely separate issues that have been brought to my attention recently involving installation of Optus mobile telephone towers at sites in my electorate of Paterson. On 28 April, I was contacted by Paul Le Motte on behalf of Jackie and Tony Richardson of 2 Mooghin Road, Seaham. In a letter Jackie Richardson said: Just two weeks ago one of my neighbours was informed by Optus workers that a large phone tower was to be erected on the immediate adjoining property to us just 17 metres from our property boundary and only 40 metres from our family home. We have not and neither have any of our other neighbours been notified of this intention. We know as a home owner in the shire that we need approval to erect any structure on our land and that our neighbours would be notified and asked to lodge objections or concerns with council. On 5 June, at a public meeting at the Mooghin Road site, which was organised by Mrs Richardson and attended by a large group of concerned residents, it was clear that this tower would impose and impact on these poor people. It is absolutely ridiculous and defies common sense that a tower is proposed to be sited so close to a house when there are plenty of suitable acreage sites around the area that would not impact on the community adversely. Optus has advised me that the Seaham site is still only in a test phase. Optus has not yet presented a DA to council. However, I understand the 2B Mooghin Road site is Optus's preferred site. At the meeting on 5 June, I was approached by Elisa Fitzpatrick of Martins Creek Road, Paterson. This site issue is somewhat different from Seaham one as the Paterson tower has already been approved by Dungog Shire Council. In a letter dated 8 June 2010, Elisa Fitzpatrick said: We moved to Martins Creek Road, Paterson one and a half years ago after a battle with Maitland Council over the now erected mobile phone tower at the Morpeth Bowling Club. Our home was close, and our children are young, and after standing before the Council voicing Morpeth community's objection to the tower and being ignored, we decided to take the tree change to Paterson. Now we face another tower. The Paterson site is only 100 meters from our home and therefore our children, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day will be subjected to radiation whose health effects are by no means completely understood. Properties are 5-160 acres in this area and so 100m is relatively immediate. It appears that although Council policy states that there are exceptional circumstances when other properties are required to be notified prior to the DA going through Council, it was decided that we were not worthy of that exception. We received a radiation report from Optus, which states that the radiation will peak at 97.3meters from the tower and we are approximately 100meters from the tower. How is it we receive the highest quantity of radiation from this tower and yet have known NOTHING until a bucket truck arrived on our fenceline a few weeks ago? If this tower goes ahead, we will move. It will break my family's heart, as we love so dearly our home. We have established an orchard, the children have chickens and donkeys, a tree house and a large vegetable patch. This was our dream and now, if we sell, we will lose money on this property, no one will want to live so close to a tower out here in the country. We will lose money that is largely borrowed. Construction of the tower has not yet begun. There must be alternatives out here with so large properties and mountainous country. In conclusion, I acknowledge that Optus has followed all the guidelines, and legislation does not require that it consult nearby neighbours. However, it is abundantly clear to all that telecommunications companies need to be held more accountable for community consultation. At the moment, their legal requirements to the community are inadequate and need to be addressed. Is it not ironic that a tower cannot be built within 200 metres of a school, preschool or elderly home, yet it can be built as close as 40 metres from a family home? Had more consultation taken place, I am sure a compromise could have been struck so that all those involved would have been satisfied with the tower location. There is plenty of open space in both Paterson and Seaham. I have advised Optus of a number of options and I am working towards an acceptable solution with them. I am looking for alternative sites in Seaham. I urge Optus to reconsider the approved Paterson site. I also urge meaningful consultation and a fair result for everyone. After all, Optus will be after their business, carrying their mobile phone signal. Makin Electorate: Para Hills",104
161,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT,"This year the suburb of Para Hills in the Makin electorate and City of Salisbury celebrated its 50th anniversary. On 8 May 2010 a day of community events were held to celebrate this milestone. I attended the day's events where I was able to touch base with existing and former local residents, many of whom had been pioneers in the early development of the suburb. I was able to catch up with many of the people I have built a personal friendship with over the years. There is indeed much to celebrate about Para Hills. It is now very much an established community and at times it is even demany scribed as an aging community. However, 50 years ago it was all farmland and some considerable distance from any of the surrounding townships. As a child, I grew up in the neighbouring community of Pooraka and can well remember the growth and emergence of Para Hills. The early settlers of the new township of Para Hills can truly be referred to as pioneers. They pioneered a 430 acre residential development that was ahead of its time and, because of their efforts, continues to serve the community very well today and will continue to do so into the future. My understanding is that Para Hills was the first complete township developed by a private developer in metropolitan Adelaide. The original Para Hills estate cost around £6 million and was the initiative of Reid Murray Developments Pty Ltd, led by its Managing Director, Max Liberman. It was an innovative residential development-it was a complete home package scheme. Land and house, with an automatic washing machine, a refrigerator and a 23 inch TV could be purchased at that time for around £4,500. Within the estate, a large nursery was established and each resident was given six plantings for their new home. Each home, which had three bedrooms, was on an allotment of approximately 700 square metres or larger. Another distinguishing feature of Para Hills is that few residential estates or suburbs can boast the range of community facilities that exist today in Para Hills. Within a decade or so of the suburb being established, community facilities included a diversity of churches; a primary and secondary school, and the primary school's numbers reached something like 1,100 within a few years of its establishment; a post office; a council-provided library; a senior citizens centre; a police station; a hotel; a swimming centre; a secure dog park; Salisbury council's first purpose-built multiuse community centre; and a resident built and owned licensed community club, built largely from the fundraising efforts of the locals at the time. The multitude of sports facilities included Para Hills Soccer Club, home of the Knights; a junior soccer club; an Aussie Rules football club; a tennis club; a netball club; a dance group; a gymnastics club; and the Para Hills Bowling Club. More recently, the Para Hills Amateur Boxing Club, which was in existence from day one, was provided with new facilities. Today it boasts probably the best boxing club facilities in Adelaide. In addition, a country fire service, a scout group, a Lions club, a Country Women's Association branch, a progress association and the Para Hills Brass Band were formed. Each of these organisations has its own success stories to tell, but time does not peris, mit me to elaborate on those tonight. Perhaps the most noticeable and visionary achievement of the local community has been the preservation of some 50 hectares of land, now known as ‘the paddocks', for community recreation, open space and wetlands development. Salisbury council's first internationally recognised water-harvesting and recycling scheme was established at the paddocks. Securing the 50 hectares of paddocks land for recreation and open space was itself an epic battle for the local community at the time. Agreement was ultimately reached with the Dunstan government of the day and ‘the paddocks' public open space was secured. There are so many people that deserve credit for all that has been achieved in Para Hills over the years. Time does not allow me to name them, and I would always risk omitting some if I tried to. A number of them went on to serve on Salisbury council, and I had the privilege of working alongside them. They were people like David Plumridge, Declan Moore, Eric Gardner, Patsy Nias, Ann Irving and Shiralee Reardon. In celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, Para Hills has much to be proud of. The hard work, the vision and the determination of the early settlers is being built on by equally motivated local residents today. Many of the original residents continue to live in Para Hills-a little older, but no less passionate about their community. Only last week at a public forum, Bob Giles-one of the first Para Hills settlers and one of the key drivers in those early years-as sharp and articulate as ever, stood up for his community. To all of the people who have, over the past 50 years, contributed to the Para Hills community, and to all those who continue to work for that community-and they know who they are-I say: thank you for your efforts and for making Para Hills the suburb it a suburb worth celebrating. (Time expired) Farrer Electorate: Cancer Services",105
162,Ms LEY,ADJOURNMENT,"Tomorrow, a busload of cancer patients, cancer carers and allied cancer workers from southern New South Wales and north-east Victoria will travel to Canberra to present a petition of about 17,000 signatures-17,000 signatures from people who were extremely disappointed that Albury-Wodonga was excluded from the centres provided with the funding under the rural and regional cancer centre program which Minister Roxon announced earlier this year. These signatures are from people who are personally affected by this decision. They have mothers, fathers, children or friends who have been impacted by cancer. In fact, it is impossible in Albury-Wodonga not to know someone who is having, or has had, some form of treatment for cancer-or someone who has passed away from cancer. I know many, and, unfortunately, so do my children. I do not remember knowing anyone with cancer when I was their age. Times have changed, and now we do have a better rate of success in diagnosing and treating disease, but we must change our thinking to ensure that rural and regional areas are known for providing first-class, accessible health services. This program seemed to present us with an opportunity to provide those first-class services in the way that local cancer professionals considered the most appropriate. We have the people willing to work with the government to provide the services, but at this stage we have no commitment from Mr Rudd, Minister Roxon or anyone in the Rudd government to support them in return. There is no support either from the New South Wales or Victorian state governments. In fact, they cannot seem to work out who should be looking after the health of those on the border. New South Wales did not provide funding in the budget because they said it was Victoria's responsibility. The Victorian Premier, John Brumby, is now encouraging people to move to regional Victoria, but the state government did not support the funding for the infrastructure to care for those people-how ironic is that? I am told that in the Albury-Wodonga region about 1,400 new cases of cancer are diagnosed each year. Many of those people have to travel hundreds of kilometres for surgery, diagnosis and follow-up treatment. We are lucky to have private radiography facilities and also a private, and a very tightly-stretched public, chemotherapy service. But this is certainly not enough. I will do my best to draw you a picture of what a cancer sufferer in Albury-Wodonga goes through. Imagine, if you can, that you are the mother of two young children. You have not been able to work for a while because you have not felt well, but everyone has told you it is stress related. Imagine how you feel when, after presenting yourself to the emergency department and being admitthis ted to hospital, they tell you they found a brain tumour and you have to immediately fly hundreds of kilometres to a hospital in Melbourne because that is the only place that has the technology and the personnel to accurately locate and diagnose your tumour. Then, there you are in Melbourne, hundreds of kilometres away from your primaryschool-aged children, your husband, your parents and your friends. You are in a large public hospital with overworked staff, and you are told you should get your affairs in order prior to going into surgery. You cannot have surgery close to home, because there is no facility. Your husband cannot leave the children and you have no-one to talk to, other than the patient in the bed next door, who tells you they have just had their second similar operation and the prognosis was poor. Luckily, you come out of surgery and then, after very little time, the hospital deems you well enough to go home. They do this quickly because they need the bed. After you are deemed well enough to leave hospital, you have to drive the hundreds of kilometres back to your home. No-one from the hospital in that strange city will drive you home. You certainly cannot afford a taxi, and you cannot fly after the operation. Your parents are too old to drive to Melbourne and back, and you are too embarrassed to ask your friends to come all that way. You have to either get a train or drive home-hours away. You have no hair; it has not grown back after the operation. You are obviously still not back to precancer fitness and probably never will be. You do not feel up to driving, but there is no other way. It is a four-hour trip. But it does not stop when you get home. You have to have regular blood tests, chemotherapy and radiation, and doctor's visits-some in Albury, some in Wodonga and some in Melbourne, but all in different locations. You are not supposed to drive but you have to drive to those appointments because there is no or very little public transport. That is just one person-hundreds of people from our region go through similar circumstances every year. We must do what we can to make their lives easier. They deserve it, and our region deserves to be able to progling vide these people with the best care and support it can. We have the professionals, we have the commitment, we have the community and we definitely have the need. We are vibrant and self-sufficient, and we really for very little from the government. Minister Roxon gave away funding to an area which did not even meet the criteria of rural or regional hospital when she approved funding for Gosford-Wyong. She bent the rules. She moved the goalposts. She treated people in real regional areas with real need for this funding with contempt when she made the decision to travel up and down the country announcing funding in marginal areas, even when they were not regional. In the manner which has, unfortunately, been typical of this government, they made the rules up as they went along. They promised regional Australia help and they did not come up with the goods. Kingston Electorate: Water",106
163,Ms RISHWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak about the important investment this government has made in water infrastructure. I was very pleased last week to be with Senator Penny Wong, Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, to announce some significant funding for South Australia as part of the National Water Security Plan for Cities and Towns program. South Australia shared in $19.2 million of federal government funding to implement a variety of projects to re-use waste water and perhaps to collect storm water. Statewide there are 29 subprojects that will help 18 South Australian councils diversify their future water supplies and improve their capacity to better manage current water resources. We in South Australia know how precious water is. We are seeing some significant continuing water shortages where we are strugto meet our critical water needs as well as irrigation and water for the environment. Being downstream of the Murray we know only too well what climate change in combination with over-allocation is doing to our ask water supplies. The community in Adelaide and South Australia has very much welcomed the significant investment that this a government has made in water infrastructure so that Adelaide can reduce its reliance on the Murray-Darling system and make sure that we are conserving water as best as is possible. I was very pleased that, as part of this announcement last week, the City of Onkaparinga in my local electorate received money for their subproject worth $52,000. This included a project for the MCLaren Vale Information Centre that would reduce the use of potable water by using recycled water, which is very important. This visitor centre has many people come through its doors. The vineyard opposite is receiving recycled water from another government project. The other project is that at MCLaren Flat Recreation Ground. This important community hub will now use stormwater and rainwater capture from roofs of the facility to put on the grounds. This will benefit the football club, the tennis club and the community centre. This set of infrastructure projects is not the first that my local electorate has received. After 12 years of neglect by the previous government when it came to conserving water, we have seen this government invest in water infrastructure. It started when I was elected and was delivering on my election commitment to provide $3.5 million to the area of MCLaren Vale and to the irrigators to get them off mains water and onto recycled water. That was a really important investment to conserve water. In addition, this government funded the Onkaparinga City Council to the tune of $34.45 million for waterproofing south stage 1 and has now followed up with another $14.97 million to undertake waterproofing south stage 2. This is an innovative project to capture and harvest stormwater and then put it into wetlands and re-use it watering parks and gardens and other council facilities. This is looking at harvesting over 1,300 million litres of water, a significant amount that will go into the community. In addition, my electorate and the City of Onkaparinga have also received a $750,000 investment to help the council construct the Woodcroft Green Precinct designed for the library and the neighbourhood centre as a demonstration site to show community members how to use the most efficient lighting but also how they might re-use water, how they can use solar panels and a whole range of things. (Time expired) Boothby Electorate: Vandalism",108
164,Dr SOUTHCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to put on the record a major issue of concern for many residents in my electorate. The community of Boothby has recently seen an escalation of vandalism and antisocial behaviour, damaging the premises of local businesses and causing substantial cost to the livelihoods of owners. Petty crime, the defacement of personal property and violence have become prevalent in pockets of my electorate, in particular in the area of Blackwood. Recently there was a brazen attack by vandals where a suburban train which was stationary while collecting passengers was graffitied within a minute. This was captured on CCTV camera. Blackwood by day is a picturesque community in the Adelaide Hills. However, by night it is an unsafe, sometimes frightening place to be. Deliberately lit fires, graffiti, destruction of shopfronts and assaults are standard for a Friday or Saturday night. On Saturday 3 April this year, four fires were started in the space of two hours near Main Road, the business precinct of Blackwood. The blaze which enveloped the premises of Jacob's Tyres was reported to have caused for $250,000 damage and led to a significant loss of earnings for the shop owner, Grant Jacobs. Despite the supposed increase in police presence on weekends, Sturt Police Superintendent Graham Goodwin has confirmed there has been a proliferation of crime in the area of Blackwood. In March alone 18 graffiti reports were received, a 100 per cent increase in the monthly average. In just two months businesses reported 14 incidents of windows being smashed. So it is fair to say that the community, business owners, the local council and I are very disappointed that little action has been taken on local crime prevention. At a recent gathering of small businesses through the Blackwood Business Network, I heard from many small businesses of the problems of local crime and petty crime and what they intended to do about it. Frustrated with the lack of government assistance, local business owners have taken this issue upon themselves and employed a security guard to patrol the streets on Friday and Saturday nights in an effort to discourage vandals. However, this is not nearly enough. Private citizens should not be expected to manage the safety of their local neighbourhoods. That is why I believe the government needs to act to increase safety on the streets of our local communities. Small business owners are lobbying for a 24-hour surveillance camera to combat the vandalism and violence that is plaguing the streets of Blackwood after dark. Closed circuit television systems have a twofold purpose-they not only assist the law enforcement agencies in identifying and apprehending criminals but also act as deterrents for those who are considering partaking in such unlawful behaviour. Under the Howard government, the Community Crime Prevention Program was introduced in an effort to provide funding for such community based, security related infrastructure projects. This program was fundamental in promoting community safety and ensuring the bad guys were caught. However, it is disappointing to see that these local issues are simply not being addressed and are instead being neglected under the current government, with the Rudd Labor government not continuing with this program. Although petty crime, vandalism and graffiti are ostensibly local and state government issues, they are still important and should still be a priority at a federal level. The coalition recognises this and considers local crime prevention and community safety a legitimate concern. It is my very strong view that more needs to be done to maintain the partnership between the local community and the federal government. As a matter of community safety, it is important that all levels of ernment contribute to the public discourse on law and order. Local communities such as Blackwood need to be heard. They need to receive more support and more funding to better combat the criminal activities plaguing their neighbourhoods. I stand with the residents of Blackwood on this issue and urge the federal government to take greater responsibility for local crime prevention. Lindsay Electorate: Education Funding",109
165,Mr BRADBURY,ADJOURNMENT,"Lindsay) (8.54 pm)Over the last 2½ years schools right around this country have been undergoing a revolution, but it appears as though the counterrevolution has begun. The Liberal-National Party have announced that they will take an axe to many of the very successful programs and the investments in education and training that this government has commenced. This is a grave threat and a grave risk to the educational opportunities of students right around this country, but in particular it is a threat in electorates like mine and other electorates in Western Sydney. I will mention a few of the programs that are to be cut or slashed under the coalition if they were to be elected to office. They will be scrapping the funding for the computers in schools program, which is a very successful program. It is so successful a program that even the shadow Minister for Finance is claiming credit for having delivered computers into schools in his community on his own website under the heading of ‘What we have achieved for our community.' He achieved nothing. He was part of a government that did not deliver any of that money. He was then part of an opposition that opposed that expenditure. He is now not only a member of an opposition that wants to rip that funding away but also the chief architect, the one who has the plan, of ripping that funding away. Yet he has the temerity to tell govpeople on his website that that is what he is delivering for his community. We have the scrapping of the computers in schools program. We have the discontinuation of round 3 of Building the Education Revolution. We have the scrapping of funding for trades training centres. We also have this proposal to rip away the funding that has been allocated to improve teacher quality in our schools. The impact of these cuts would be devastating and it would be felt in those communities that are at the front line of trying to use education as a tool for overcoming socio-economic disadvantage. My electorate and others in Western Sydney would be hardest hit. Recently I visited Cranebrook High School with the Deputy Prime Minister to hand over the 300,000th computer under the Digital Education Revolution program. We witnessed a music class and an agricultural class that were using these technologies to teach students in a way that previous generations never had the opportunity to experience. Make no mistake about it, if these programs are cut, there will be many schools in our country that will continue to have the resources to teach students with those new technologies, but there will be many schools in communities like mine that will miss out. Under this program, Cranebrook High School has already received 204 computers. If the coalition were to be elected, they stand to lose the remaining 64 computers they would expect to receive under this program. But there are many more schools in my community that would suffer as a result of these cuts. In my community alone another 1,013 computers would be stripped away. But let's look at some of the neighbouring electorates-for example, 990 computers in Macarthur, 795 computers in Macquarie and 733 computers in Greenway would be ripped away. I heard the member for Greenway in the Main Committee earlier today complaining about Building the Education Revolution. She has a lot of explaining to do because she is not only the member for Greenway but also the candidate for Macquarie, so she should take ownership of the cuts that her opposition want to inflict in both of these electorates if they are elected to government. We are talking about 1,528 computers in total from those two electorates. She should hang her head in shame. In addition to that, if we look at Building the Education Revolution we see that in my electorate $27.6 million worth of projects would be cut away. We see in Macarthur it would be $24.2 million. In Macquarie it would be $72.7 million. If we add to that the $21.9 million in Greenway, the member for Greenway has to account for why she wants to allow her party to rip away $94.6 million worth of school building projects in the electorates that she either represents or wants to represent. We will not stand for it. They want to rip away money from trade training centres and rip money away from teacher training. The counterrevolution is under way. They will not rest until they take away every opportunity that this government has presented students in regions like mine as far as educational opportunities are concerned.
