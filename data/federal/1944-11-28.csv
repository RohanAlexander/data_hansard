0,NA,Unknown,"House of Representatives. Tuesday, 28 November, 19U4Mr SJ>EAKKU (Hon. J. S. Eosevear) took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. HOUR OF MEETING. Motion (by Mr Forde) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn morrow, at 10.30 a.m. PRICE OF BEER.",4
1,Mr FRASER,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister, as Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, to state whether or not, as the result of a High Court judgment given earlier this year, there is doubt as to the legal power to enforce on hotel keepers the obligation to sell beer by schooner measure during prescribed hours? If so, will the right honourable gentleman examine the position with a view to amending the law so as to ensure that the Commonwealth price fixing authority shall have the legal power to prosecute successfully for breaches of this requirement? Further, is it a fact that country hotel keepers in New South Wales who overcharge for liquor cannot bo successfully prosecuted unless the prosecution can establish what were the actual prices charged by the hotel keeper concerned on the 12th April, 1943? In view of the practical impossibility of doing this, will the Government fix, by order, specific prices for liquor in country areas of New South Wales, as, I understand, already has been done in Queensland ?",4
2,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The position will be examined, and the honourable gentleman wil] be advised of the result. MINISTER FOR INFORMATION.",4
3,Mr GUY,Unknown,"-Did . the Minister for In formation read the leading article published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 25th November on the subject of censorship, in which the honourable gentleman was described as ""maliciously and corruptly dishonest "" and as "" a dishonest, calculating liar"", and in which also he was invited to take legal action against that newspaper? Does the honourable gentleman, as a Minister of the Crown who thus has been branded publicly as a liar, propose to take any action in the courts against the-newspaper concerned? Did the honourable gentleman also read the statement published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph that that newspaper had not published anything which the censor had asked it not to publish, but had submitted its copy in the ordinary way and had completely obeyed the into tostructions of the censor? Does the honourable gentleman agree that the newspaper in question did act in such a way?",4
4,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"The subject-matter of the leading article in the SydneyDa <7?/ Telegraph of Friday last is in thehands of my iegal advisers. The othermatters mentioned by the honourable; member were the subject of a debate on< Friday afternoon last, during which I said all that I have to say regarding the allegations of the honourable member for Barker and others on the exercise of censorship powers. It needs no reiteration now. NA INTERNEES .",4
5,Mr CONELAN,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,-Is the Acting Prime Minister able to make a statement clarifying the position regarding the release of prisoners of war from overseas and internees in this country?,4
6,Mr FORDE,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,I shall be pleased to make a statement on the subject during the week. BANKING .,4
7,Mr RYAN,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"As a result of the Government's statement last week that it proposed to take over the interstate airlines of Australia, the public mind is very anxious regarding the future of the banks. During the week-end this matter was brought to my notice by numerous questions addressed to me, one being whether, in my opinion, it would be wise for depositors to withdraw their funds from the banks. Has the Acting Prime Minister considered the request made by me and other honourable members that he should make a statement of Government policy on this matter so that the peo.pitr might, know the best or the worse?",4
8,Mr FORDE,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"The Government has expended over £4,000,000 on aerodromes and navigational aids and now proposes to take over the existing interstate airlines of Australia. As has already been pointed out it is true that the air companies own some twenty odd aeroplanes, that they collect the fares, and have administrative offices and workshops, but the great bulk of the expenditure has been incurred by the Commonwealth Government on behalf of the public. The airlines represent a great public utility, which is interwoven with defence and other national activities, and it should, therefore, be owned and controlled by the Commonwealth Government. As for the other matter raised by the honourable member, I remind him that it is not usual to announce Government policy in reply to questions, but I can say this: When the Government does make a decision in regard to the amendment of the banking law, the public will find that there is absolutely no ground whatever for the wild and frenzied propaganda disseminated by the private banking institutions in their efforts to induce the public to withdraw their support from this Government, which has a very creditable record.",5
9,Mr HARRISON,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"Is the Acting Prime Minister aware of the statement made at a meeting during the week-end by the Minister for Information (Mr. Calwell), that it is the intention of the Government to nationalize the banks, and any other industry that may compete with the Government? Was the Minister authoritatively voicing the policy of the Government, or can the people assume that he was merely reliably informed ?",5
10,Mr FORDE,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,The Minister for In formation declares that he did not make any such statement. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is descending to petty personalities against a member of the Government. Evidently he believes everything that he reads in a section of the press.,5
11,Mr MENZIES,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"Will the Acting Prime Minister prepare and lay on the table of the House a statement showing how much of the amounts mentioned by him last week as payments to the airline companies was, in fact, payment for services, including the carriage of mails.",5
12,Mr FORDE,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,Yes : the information will be furnished. SOIL EROSION.,5
13,Mr WILSON,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"In view of the rapidly increasing menace to the fertile mallee lands, and other light soil lands of Australia from wind and other forms of erosion, is the Acting Prime Minister prepared to take immediate steps to appoint a commision of inquiry and to provide a substantial sum of money to deal effectively with this rapidly developing national tragedy?",5
14,Mr FORDE,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,The honourable member's suggestion is sound. The subject of his question was discussed at the last conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers and it will be discussed by the Australian Agricultural Council early in January. The Commonwealth Government will fully co-operate with the State Governments in the appointment of any committee necessary to carry out any further research work in connection with this most important matter. NEWSPAPER DISPUTE.,5
15,Mr HAYLEN,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"Is the Attorney General aware that, since the recent dispute in the newspaper industry in Sydney, three journalists have been dismissed by the Daily Telegraph, two others have been continually provoked, and one has been transferred suddenly and without warning from his usual employment? Can this be regarded as a breach of the employer's pledge that, there would be no victimization ?",5
16,Dr EVATT,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"I am not aware of the facts to which the honourable member refers. If there has been any breach of the terms of settlement, I suppose the remedy will lie with the organization of the men concerned. It can take the matter to court. If the honourable member will supply me with the particulars. I shall look into the matter. PETROL RATIONING. PROSECUTION OF DAIRYMEN.",5
17,Mr BERNARD CORSER,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"Las t week I complained that a young dairyman had been fined for having used some of the petrol for his cream separator in his truck in order to take his pigs to market. H.e had not had an opportunity to draw the ration coupons for petrol for his truck. Will the Attorney-General sympathetically consider action to quash the conviction and remit the fines and <-<> amounting to £3 Ss., imposed on this young man? Frequently dairymen and othersaway from the city are compelled to adopt similar measures. As the regulations under which this man was prosecuted are ridiculous, I ask that the Attorney-General take action to have them amended so that they shall be more practical.",5
18,Dr EVATT,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"I heard the honourable member mention this case last week. If an application is made in connection with the matter, I shall have inquiries made and give sympathetic consideration to his request. BAI L TRAVEL PRIORITIES. UNIVERSITY STUDENTS: TRANSPORT TO WESTERN AUSTRALIA - JUNIORSWIM MING CHAMPIONSHIPS.",6
19,Mr BURKE,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"Honourable members from Western Australian constituencies have been approached by the parents of students studying at universities in eastern States subjects not taught at the University of Western Australia, in the hope that they will be able to assist them to get transport to their homes in Western Australia for the'Christmas vacation. It was reported that they would be provided with the necessary transport, but now the Western Australian daily newspapers point out that the priority they have been given is so low that they will not be able to obtain seats. Will the Minister for Transport take steps to ensure the provision of the necessary transport?",6
20,Mr WARD,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"The difficulty regarding rail transport to Western Australia is the limited capacity of the service. It is true that permits to travel are issued to the students mentioned by the honourable member, but whether the priority is sufficiently high to ensure them travel in a particular period is a matter which we have no power to guarantee. The latest report which I have received regarding the position indicates that sufficient accommodation w i ll be available on the trains to carry all those who, to date, have applied for permits to travel.",6
21,Mr CONELAN,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,Will the Minister for Transport give favourable consideration to the granting of priorities to competitors in the Australian junior swimming championships?,6
22,Mr WARD,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"All applications are determined on their merits. The Government is sympathetically disposed towards all such activities, and, if it is possible to meet the honourable member's wishes, it will be done. COAL-MINING INDUSTR Y. SHORTAGE OF STOCKS-HIG H COURT PROCEEDINGS: PAYMENT OF COSTS"" SYDNEY MORNINGHERALD "" ARTICLE .",6
23,Mr HARRISON,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that the reserves of coal held by the New South Wales railways are sufficient to meet require- ments for less than three weeks, that those held by the Australian Gaslight Company will last for less than two weeks, and that those of the Sydney County Council in connection with its electricity undertaking have reached the lowest ebb in the history of the council? In view of the estimated loss of 1,300,000 tons of coal this year, will the right honourable gentleman now consider honouring the statement made by the Prime Minister in this House that no further concessions would be granted to the coal-miners until the requisite quantity of coal had been won? Will the right honourable gentleman also consider the cancellation of the holidays already agreed to on behalf of those miners?",6
24,Mr FORDE,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,The reserve stocks of coal are not so high as I should like them to be. We all deplore the fact that they are not greater.,6
25,Mr HARRISON,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,What does the right honourable gentleman intend to do?,6
26,Mr SPEAKER,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"Order ! The honourable gentleman has asked a question, and it is now being answered.",6
27,Mr HARRISON,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,I do not want platitudes.,7
28,Mr FORDE,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,The present Government has secured a greater production of coal in the last three years than its predecessors secured in a similar period.,7
29,Mr HOLT,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"I ask the Attorney General whether it is a. fact, as reported in the Sydney press, that the Commonwealth Government has agreed to pay the legal costs incurred by the miners' federation in litigation in which it was recently involved in the High Court of Australia against the colliery proprietors? Tf the right honourable gentleman's answer is in the affirmative, will he indicate the ii mount that will bo involved?",7
30,Dr EVATT,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"As the honourable gentleman knows, the proceedings in the High ('ourt took place because of an order made by a Commonwealth Industrial Officer, Mr Connell. I do not know the actual amount of the costs; but the Government is now considering the matter, and in the next couple of days I may be able to give to the honourable member a full answer to his question.",7
31,Mr DALY,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"1 direct the attention of the Minister for Information to an article which appeared in today's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald entitled "" Coal Crisis-The Call for Popular Action "". That article states, inter aliaIt is the.duty of every Australian to or telegraph to his member, care of Parliaagainst ment House, Canberra, urging him to bring strongest pressure upon the Governinent it is too I ii tc. T.t is the duty of persons with the welfare of their country at heart organize themselves into groups, to hold ings-to do everything in their the Government that the conscience of the nation is roused.",7
32,Mr HARRISON,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"Hear , hear! What is the honourable member frightened of?",7
33,Mr SPEAKER,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,Order ! I ask the honourable member for Wentworth to refrain from interjecting.,7
34,Mr DALY,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"Will the Minister for Information inform mo whether journalism of this type indicates "" New Guard"" tendency, a policy with which the honourable member for Wentworth was so strongly associated in the past? Does it not show a Fascist tendency, and does not the Minister consider that action should be taken to prevent a repetition of such an article, because it may destroy national unity?",7
35,Mr HARRISON,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"That is right, stifle the press! Air. SPEAKER - Order ! If the honourable member does not refrain from interjecting, I shall be obliged to stifle him.",7
36,Mr CALWELL,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"This is a newspaper "" stunt"" for the purpose of trying to discredit this Government, but it is more likely to provoke industrial trouble on the coal-fields than to assist coal production. I have made inquiries regarding the effect of this newspaper article. Over 300,000 copies of the Sydney Morning Eerald were sold today, and the newspaper was read by probably 500,000 people in New South Wales. To this moment -3.1 S p.m - in . spite of the high-powered propaganda and wide dissemination of that view among so many people, only five telegrams have been received by the whole of the members on the Government side of this chamber.",7
37,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"I ask the Attorney-General whether, in the event of the Government deciding to pay the costs of the miners' federation in the recent proceedings before the High Court, it. will also meet the costsof other 1 write litigants who may appeal successfully the operation of Commonwealth the regulations? Alternatively, would the before Government regard such a decision as to an open invitation to the trade unions meetto fight the Government in the High power to show Court free of expense?",7
38,Dr EVATT,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"I cannot have made the position clear to the honourable member. The High Court proceedings took place solely in consequence of an order made by a Commonwealth official. I believe that in some analogous cases the costs of persons involved have been met by the Commonwealth. I am looking into the matter and shall give fuller information later. In this case there are circumstances which would justify the Commonwealth in meeting the costs incurred by the miners' federation. The costs of the owners will, of course, be met for the court ordered that they be paid. HOUSING. IJUTLDING PROGRAMME-MILITAR Y MENTS, NEWCASTLE.",7
39,Mr FRANCIS,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he will indicate any action which the Government proposes to take, either by itself or in cooperation with State governments, to relieve the acute shortage of housing in Australia? Has any proposal been considered with the object of making materials available for home bulding?",8
40,Mr FORDE,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"The subject of housing has been considered at recent conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers. Unfortunately the war is still proceeding. Because of the all-in war effort in which Australia is engaged, and of the need for building materials for war purposes, it is not practicable to divert large quantities of building materials to private uses at present. Tho Government is watching the situation closely, and, as soon sible, materials for home construction will be released. The paramount consideration however, is the defeat of the enemy. Unless that can be achieved we shall not. be able to provide homes.",8
41,Mr WATKINS,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"Some days ago, I asked the Acting Prime Minister to inquire as to the possibility of making available for civil occupation by people who cannot obtain homes, hutments on a military establishment in the Newcastle district which arc not at present being used by the military authorities. Although I advised the right honourable gentleman that the matter was urgent, 1I have not since received any advice from him. The matter is still urgent. Will he state when I am likely to receive notification of a decision?",8
42,Mr FORDE,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,I hope to be able to announce a definite decision within the next couple of days. WAR DISPOSALS COMMISSION. MOTOR VEHICLES.,8
43,Mr CONELAN,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping whether the War Disposals Commission has yet made any recommendation to the Government regarding the disposal of cars and trucks in Australia? I should like to know how many are to be disposed of, where they are, and whether they will be dealt with in the HUT- States where they are located. Will they be disposed of through ordinary business channels, and will unserviceable vehicles be made available to dealers in second hand vehicles and spare parts? I also desire to know the commission basis on which these transactions will be undertaken.",8
44,Dr EVATT,PRISONERS OF WAR AND,I shall make inquiries and give to the honourable member the information that he is seeking. NA IN PAPUA.,8
45,Mr WHITE,CIVIL ADMINISTRATION,"Will the Minister for External Territories state the terms of reference to Mr J. V. Barry, K . C , who is to make an inquiry in connection with the suspension of civil administration in Papua ?",8
46,Mr WARD,CIVIL ADMINISTRATION,I shall make the inforas posmation available to the honourable member. AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS.,8
47,Mr WHITE,CIVIL ADMINISTRATION,"Has the Minister for Transport seen the challenge issued by the Airlines Secretariat to the statement made in this Parliament by the honourable gentleman that certain aircraft have crashed, causing casualties, because they were overloaded in some instances and were short of petrol in other instances? Has the honourable gentleman had an opportunity to check the accuracy of his statement, by reference to the reports in connection with every accident that has occurred in Australia since 1920, with a view to determining whether he had stated facts or only that he had been credibly informed? Does he intend to accept the challenge to repeat his statement outside this Parliament, and thus give to the airline companies concerned an opportunity to take legal action against him?",8
48,Mr WARD,CIVIL ADMINISTRATION,"I have not seen this challenge. I receive many challenges from all sorts of queer people who are associated with the Opposition parties, and I do not regard them seriously. I have made a definite statement in this House. Since the publication of the challenge; which I have not seen but which has been brought to my notice; I have received from men who arc actively associated with flying operations in the various services, communications which substantiate what I said. At the appropriate time, after I have had an opportunity to examine the records, I shall probably have a little more to say. When an aircraft is lost, the evidence of the cause of the loss generally accompanies it, just as some evidence of the misdeeds of the Opposition have disappeared from the official files from time to time. AUSTRALIAN ARMY. CASE OF PRIVATE J . WILSON.",8
49,Mr DALY,CIVIL ADMINISTRATION,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether or not Mr Justice J. Reed, of the Supreme Court of South Australia, is at present in Canberra to conduct an inquiry into the case of P r i vate Wilson? If so, will the right honourable gentleman make arrangements for the inquiry to be conducted in Sydney, to which city Private Wilson has been transferred for the purpose of being present at it?",9
50,Mr FORDE,CIVIL ADMINISTRATION,"I am not aware that Mr Justice Reed has arrived in Canberra, but I know that he was appointed to conduct an investigation of the case of Private Wilson. The venue of the inquiry was left to the discretion of Mr Justice Reed, and I Assume that it. will be Sydney. WHEAT INDUSTRY. Mr LANGTR l - Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture consider the advisability of lift in g all restrictions on wheat-growing in the coming season, with a view to relieving the acuteness of the position in the industry?",9
51,Mr SCULLY,CIVIL ADMINISTRATION,"The whole matter has been considered. The honourable member need have no fear in regard to the future of wheat-growing in Australia. limited supplies of superphosphate are an outstanding factor in wheat production; even with an increase of almost 50 per cent, compared with last year, there will not be nearly sufficient to meet the requirements of all the licensed areas in Australia. Flippant references to an increase of wheat production disregard this factor entirely. The decision conveyed to the wheat-growers of Australia through the Stabilization Board under the regulations, will an all-time record planting for the forthcoming season. NA REGULATIONS.",9
52,Mr HOLT,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T,"On the motion for the adjournment of the House last Friday, I referred in some detail to anomalies that exist under the landlord and tenant regulations, and to the delay in implementing the promise of the Minister for Trade and Customs to give effect to at least six suggested amendments. The Attorney-General, who was present at the time, said that he would bring the matter to the notice of the Acting Prime Minister, and promised that a statement would be made before the termination of the present sittings. Has the Acting Prime Minister had a discussion with his colleague, and will he be in a position to make the promised statement?",9
53,Mr FORDE,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T,"The speech which the honourable member made on Friday afternoon will be perused, and action will be taken as soon as is practicable. MOTION OF CENSURE.",9
54,Mr MENZIES,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T," I give notice that tomorrow I shall move That this House places on record its belief that(1) by its public a;ttn«k (made through a Minister speaking from his place in the House) upon the integrity of r Justices of the High Court; (2) by its attempt (made through Ministers who still retain office) to intimidate a public officer in respect of court proceedings to which the Minister for the Interior was a party; (3) by its attempt to put the coal tribunals beyond the control of the High Court; (4) by its interference with the discretion reposed in the Maritime Industry Commission, presided over by a judge: and The (o) by its feeble failure to enforce the laws against war-time strikers; the Government is undermining the authority of the courts and of the law nnd is thereby injuring the basic structure of the Australian democracy, and is therefore deserving of the censure of this House. Motion (by Mr Forde) proposed - That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith the motion of want of confidence of which he has given notice for the next sitting, and that such motion take precedence of all other business ensure until disposed of. Sir. MENZIES - I am greatly in debted to the Acting Prime Minister (Mr . Forde); but I have given notice that tomorrow I shall submit a certain motion, and tomorrow I shall do so. Question put.

The order of the day for the motion of censure having heen called on,",9
55,Mr MENZIES,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T,"I rise to a point of order. I gave notice earlier today that tomorrow I would submit a certain motion. I maintain that by no form of the House can that process be accelerated. The House may, by suspending the Standing Orders, permit me to submit the motion today; it cannot compel me to do so. Further, I wish to draw attention to the terms of the resolution which has just heen carried. It is as follows:That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith the motion .. 43 of want of confidence of which he has given .. 18 notice for the next sitting, 25 Therefore, I am at liberty to move today if I so desire. The resolution continuesATES. and that such motion take precedence oveT all other business until disposed of. I am still at liberty to submit tomorrow the motion of which notice was given, and u n t i l that motion is disposed of, no other business is to be done in this House.",10
56,Mr MAKIN,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T,"The House is competent to determine what shall be done with business requiring determination. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) gave notice of a certain motion. The House, possibly recognizing the reasons actuating the right honourable gentleman, signified its desire that that matter be resolved immediately. The resolution for the suspension of so much of the Standing Orders as would prevent the matter from being dealt with without delay, moved by the Acting Prime NOES. Minister, is an intimation that the debate on the right honourable gentleman's proposed; motion should continue until the matter has been disposed of. I respectf u l ly submit that since the right honourable gentleman has not proceeded with his motion in accordance with the resolution, the resolution lapses and the House may continue with any other matter which the Government desires to bring PAIBS. forward.",10
57,Mr HARRISON,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T,"1 remind you, Mr . Speaker, and the House of the terms of the resolutionThat so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent . . . I stop at the word "" prevent"". The suspension of the Standing Orders only clears the way to enable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) to take certain action if he thinks fit. It does not give to the Prime Minister the right to demand that he shall take such action. Whether that action shall be taken depends on the Leader of the Opposition. I submit that no ruling which you may give, Mr Speaker, can contravene the decision of this House.",10
58,Mr FORDE,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T,"The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) gave notice of motion. In moving that so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent him from proceeding forthwith, I desired to clear the decks in order to enable the right honourable gentleman to proceed immediately with his motion. I am very disappointed that he has failed to take advantage of the courtesy extended to him by the resolution of an overwhelming majority of honourable members that all formalities should be put aside and the right honourable gentleman invited to proceed with his censure motion forthwith. I submit that the portion "" and that such motion shall take precedence"" is contingent on the right honourable gentleman moving forth with, which he has failed to do.",11
59,Mr FADDEN,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T,"If the English language means anything, the position is quite plain. The suspension of the Standing Orders at the instance of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Eorde) does not compel the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) to proceed with his motion forthwith.",11
60,Mr JOHNSON,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T,Does he not want to go on with it?,11
61,Mr FADDEN,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T,"That is not the point. The right honourable gentleman is the notice: best judge of when he should proceed with his motion. He will not be stampeded into going ahead with it straight away by accusations that he is "" not game"". The Acting Prime Minister submits that, as the result of the vote just taken, the Leader of the Opposition is compelled to proceed with his motion.",11
62,Mr FORDE,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T,No . The right gentleman missed my point.,11
63,Mr FADDEN,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T,"The suspension of Standing Orders does not do anything other than enable the Leader of Opposition to go on with his motion forthwith, and it is for him to decide whether he shall do so.",11
64,Mr SPEAKER,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T,"Order ! The Chair is prepared to give a ruling and does not need any more debate on the point. There is no special standing order coveran ing this particular matter. We have to 1939-1940. consider precedents. There are two ways of disposing of a motion such as that of which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Menzies) has given notice. One is to adjourn the House until the next day to consider the motion, and the other is the course taken by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Forde). In either case, the wishes of the House have to be' consulted. If the adjournment of the. House is moved, the House has to be consulted. On this occasion the House, as master of its own business, has determined that the Standing Orders shall be suspended to enable the motion to be taken forthwith. The resolution readsThat so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition from moving his motion. . . . The further portion of the motion unquestionably is dependent upon what the right honourable gentleman determines to do. If he determines to go on, all other business will be stood aside until his motion has been disposed of. Since he has determined not to take advantage of the first portion of the resolution, the second portion does not matter.",11
65,Mr MCEWEN,LANDLOR D AN D TENAN T,"O u a further point of order- I direct the Chair's attention to Standing Order 407, which readslu eases of urgent necessity, any Standing or Sessional Order or Orders of the House may be suspended for the day's sitting, on Motion, duly made and seconded, without Provided that such Motion is carried by an nhsolute majority of the whole number of the Members of the House. I submit that the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders was not seconded and that therefore the House was not competent to vote upon it . Therefore, the division was not in order and should not remain in the honourable records of the House. Mr SPEAKER , - It is well known to the all honourable members who understand the Standing Orders that a ministerial the motion does not need seconding. NA 1944. Motion (by Mr Forde) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a hill for act to amend the Wine Export Bounty Act Bill presented, and read a .first time. ALUMINIUM INDUSTRY BILL has SECOND READING.. Deb-ate resumed from the 2Sth iSeptember (vide page 1706) on motion by Mr. HKASLEVThat the hill the now read a. second time.",11
66,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) |3.55] - This bill, if I may venture to remind the House of its contents, is designed to approve of an investment, of £1,500^000 of Commonwealth money in the establishment of government-controlled works for the production of aluminium ingot in the State of Tasmania. As the result of this bill and the agreement upon which it is founded, Tasmania is also to find £1,500,000. The Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr Beasley), who introduced the bill, made a speech which was, in one respect at any rate, a masterpiece. It occupied a certain amount of time, but it conveyed no information to the House, except two things: First, that the Commonwealth Government was to find £1,500,000, and, secondly, that the State of Tasmania was to find. £1 for £1. But, as we gather that the State of Tasmania is to provide the hydro-electric power necessary for these works, it may be, for all I know, that, the State of Tasmania is to find £3,000,000 in total, and the Commonwealth Government £1,500,000. - Obviously, at this time, with a war in progress, but with, the end of that war, as we all profoundly believe, approaching, this proposal must be regarded as one of first-class importance. The proposal is that we should establish in Australia a new manufacturing industry for the production, of aluminium ingot. On the figures to which I have referred, it involves a, total investment of millions of pounds by the Commonwealth and the State of Tasmania. In those circumstances, one would have expected, even in these more casual legislative days, that the Minister would put before the Parliament, and, through the Parliament, before the people, some material facts that would, enable honourable members to form a judgment on this proposal. But what has he done? He has told us about the amount of money that the Government will provide, and what kind of'commission will control the undertaking. He told us, very optimistically, and with 1944. no fact3 whatever behind the statement, that it is estimated that 6,000 tons of iiLuminium per annum will be used in Australia after the war. That is a very interesting figure, seeing that the quantity of aluminium usedbefore the war warprobably 1,500 or 1,700 tons per annum. Yet the Minister said, ""We think that the consumption will the 6,000 tons "". Not one word has been said by either the Minister or the Government about the anticipated costs of production. We have not been given a solitary figure which would enable us to determine whether it will cost £80 or £800 a i'\n to produce aluminium in Australia. We have been given no information whatever regarding the likelihood of an Australian industry, constituted in the way in which this one will the, keening abreast of scientific development and research in other parts of the world. No information whatever has been given to us regarding the stocks in hand, the world's productive capacity, or the supposed world demand for aluminium.",12
67,Mr BREEN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,.Where would one be likely to get that information?,12
68,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,It would not require very much research by a Commonwealth department to enable it to tell this House how much aluminium the world is now prodwi-ng.,12
69,Mr BREEN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,The Commonwealth would not get the facts from private companies in the United States of America and Canada.,12
70,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"The honourable member overestimates the difficulty of securing such information. Any Minister with a normal clerical staff could find out, without any trouble at all, what the production of aluminium is in the United States of America and Canada. One of my reasons - for saying that is that, with very little trouble, I have found out a little bit about it. But. the Minister for Supply and. Shipping-and perhaps this is what the honourable member for Calare (Mr Breen) did not like me sayinghas not told us anything about that problem. We have not been given any information about world supply or world demand,, or anything that would throw light on the probable world price of aluminium, and, therefore, the cost of all these works. Tliere is complete silence as to what tariff protection will be needed when this industry comes into production. We are left absolutely at large to speculate about it, and, therefore, it is just as likely as anything else that, in due course, when this industry comes' into production and is confronted Iby enormous world supplies, this Parliament will the invited to impose a tariff of something like 200 per - cent, ad valorem in order to keep the industry going. It might be a good thing to impose a tariff of 200 per cent, ad valorem; I do not know yet. I do not know enough about the proposals, because the Minister has not told me the details. But before Ministers in this Government, and honourable members who support them, become too eloquent about the obligations into which we have entered under the lend-lease agreements and the Atlantic Charter, they should realise that this first step which they are taking to establish a large new industry under government control involves an entirely unknown and possibly very high protective tariff. Never before has the Parliament been invited to take such an important step on such little information. For many years, there has been in Australia an admirable practice of referring to the Tariff Board matters that affect secondary industry, so that the Parliament might have before it the report of the board and all the information that a highly trained and authoritative body of men could put before it. With that information at its disposal, the Parliament has determined whether it favoured the proposed industry, and, if so, the duty involved in its establishment. The Tariff Board has done'that time after time, year after year, after having heard evidence from all interested persons.",12
71,Mr FRANCIS,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Evidenc e for against the proposal.,13
72,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"That is so. The purpose was to obtain ultimately a true view of the proposal. On this occasion, the Parliament has not ibeen given that information. I find it extraordinarily difficult to relate this proposal to any general postwar economic policy, although this industry is essentially a post-war proposal. The Minister for Supply and Shipping did not suggest that this industry will come into production during the war. It is not claimed that the reason for its establishment is that, while the war is in progress, Australia shall have aluminium ingot of its own production. Quite plainly, it is to the a post-war proposition; and every post-war proposition involving large sums of money ought to be related at this stage to some general post-war economic policy. If we are to live from hand to mouth in these matters, and if we establish an industry without fitting it into the general conception that we have of our economic design for living, we shall the in no end of trouble. No attempt has been made to do that in this instance. The aluminium capacity of the world, as every one knows, is not only great, but also growing. I have the advantage of looking at a table produced in Iron Age, of the 24th August, 1944, a journal of high authority. This journal reveals the significant fact that the annual capacity of the American aluminium industry is 1,180,000 tons, but at the date of publication of this issue, the stocks of aluminium in the United States of America were so much greater than the demand that the industry had agreed to a voluntary annual reduction of output of 33 per cent, or about 400,000 tons.",13
73,Mr FADDEN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,And that while the big war demand still has to be supplied !,13
74,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"That is so. We know that on account of the need for aluminium for the manufacture of military aircraft the production has gone up to astronomical proportions. Scores of thousands of aircraft have been required by the Allied nations. But what will be the position after the war? One would need to be a raving optimist utterly and detached from the realities of life not to realise that there will be a heavy falling off in the demand for aluminium immediately the war ends. Accordingly, more and more of the productive capacity of the United States of America and Canada will become unused. It is in these circumstances that we are being invited, without a shred of information, to approve of two Australian governments launching out on the expenditure of millions of pounds to establish another aluminium production unit, the effect of which will undoubtedly be to add to the world's productive capacity, and, conand sequently, to the world's glut.",13
75,Dr GAHA,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Is that the position under private enterprise?,14
76,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Does my unsophisgeneral, ticated medical friend from Tasmania suggest that although the demand for aluminium is fallin g in the United States of America and/Canada, where the in dustry is under private control, it w i increase if this industry be established i Australia under government control?",14
77,Dr GAHA,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,The position would probown ably be more accurately gauged.,14
78,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"T w o years ago the honourable member might have been of heard praising God because private enterprise was producing so much aluminium in Allied countries, but what will he and my other socialistic friends opposite say when the world's demand falling? Will they say, "" Let the Governwhat ment control the industry""? Do they imagine that thereby the demand for aluminium will be increased? Perhaps they will arrange for their ballot-papers to be printed on aluminium, and for ment. aluminium to be used in other ways that will prevent a reduction of demand; but I cannot understand such an outlook. Let me remind honourable members the provisions of Article VII . of the Lend-Lease Agreement made between United States of America and the United Kingdom in February, 1942, which has been adopted as the basis of an agreeus ment between the United States of stance, America and Australia, for it sets out one of the international obligations duce entered into by this country, with bell, book and candle, to which many referment ences have been made in the last few days. The article readsIn the final determination of the benefits to be provided to the United States of America by the Government of the United Kingdom in return for aid furnished under the act of Congress of l l t h March, 1941, terms and conditions thereof shall be such as not to burden commerce between the two countries, but to promote mutually 'advantawe geous economic relations between them and the betterment of world-wide economic tions. To that end, they shall include prothat vision for agreed action by the United States of America and the United Kingdom, open to participation by all other countries of mind, directed to the expansion, by approthat priate international and domestic measures. of production, employment, and the exchange consumption of goods, which are the material foundations of the liberty and welfare of all peoples; to the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce, and to the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers; and, into the attainment of all the economic objectives set forth in the Joint Declaration made on 12th August, 1941, by the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; al an early convenient date conversations shall l l be begun between the two governments with n a view to determining in the light of governing economic conditions, the best means of attaining the above-stated objectives by their agreed action and of seeking the agreed, action of other like-minded governments.",14
79,Mr GLARK,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Has the United States America carried out its obligations in respect of wool and cotton?,14
80,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"When we carry oui our obligations it will be time enough for is us to become somewhat inquisitive about other countries are doing. Before we presume to criticize the United States of America in relation to something it is doing or may do, let us first satisfy ourselves that we are taking seriously our obligations under the Lend-Lease AgreeThe first action taken by this Government, which comes within the provisions of the article to which I have referred, is to introduce a proposal for of the establishment of a new industry in Australia which, for years past, has been the peculiarly an industry of the North American continent. The Government, says, in effect, "" It does not matter to what the prospects are in this inor what degree of tariff protection will be needed; we intend to proaluminium, and that is all about it "" . That is a curious attitude for a govern to adopt at the very inception of important post-war negotiations under which it is hoped that a revival of world trade will occur. Of course, it is obvious to all thinking persons that to ensure a revival of world trade the printhe ciple of give and take must be observed. This is not a question as to whether believe in the establishment of seconreladary industries or not. I do not know it has ever been suggested that I am not a friend and supporter of the Auslike tralian protective tariff. The fact is on occasions I have been in trouble with some of my allies on this matter. But surely the time has come when we must realise-and I hope that the general public will realise it-that we shall not be able to solve the problems of international relationships which face us by simply proposing a simple formula or a sweeping theory, and by saying, "" I am a protectionist"". We must deal separately and reasonably with the problems that come to us. The first thing that Parliament should do when a proposal is being advanced for the establishment of a new industry in this country, is to ensure that a complete and objective examination of the whole subject shall be made by an authority separated from politics, and not by individuals who are concerned about some to and f r o between the Commonwealth and Tasmania. The first question to be decided must be: Is this industry sound from the point of view of Australian economics ? If it is, well and good, 'the second question then arises: What tariff protection will be needed in order to establish it? No answer has been given by the Government to either of those questions. I now turn to the bill, for not only does the whole proposal suffer from a lack of information but also the bill contains provisions which to me are distinctly curious, though. I quite understand that what may seem odd to me may seem most even to the honourable member for Denison. Clause 6 of the measure provides for the appointment of a commission which shall consist of(a) two members representative of the - Commonwealth, one of whom shall 'be chairman; and (6) two members representative of the .State of Tasmania, one of whom shall he vice-chairman. The Minister who introduced the bill did not tell us anything about the aluminium industry, but he did tell us the names of the proposed commissioners.",14
81,Mr MCEWEN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,He told us who would get the jobs!,15
82,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"That is so. We were informed that Mr A . V . Smith would be one of the Commonwealth's representatives, and presumably chairman of the commission. Mr Smith is; an experienced and capable publicservant, but to him the. control of this commissionmust inevitably be a sparer timeoccupation, for the work will have to be done in whatever time he can spare from the work of the War Disposals Commission, which was established recently to perform an enormous job, and fro m his other duties as permanent head of the Department of Supply and Shipping.. So we may assume that, so far as he isconcerned, with all his administrativeexperience, he can give only a small fraction, of his time to' the work of this, commission; and, of course, in any event,, he is without, any experience of the kind of business that will be carried on by the commission. Another member is Dr. Wark. He is a. very eminent scientist, a> man of reputation in connection with the work of the Couucil for Scientific and Industrial Research, and a man of experience in research, but, so far as I know, with no experience of business administration. The third member isMr L . R. Benjamin. He has gained considerable experience in the conduct, of newsprint mills in New No r f o l k . He is nn able man, of course; these are all able men; I am not discussing that aspect of the matter. He is the one man of the four with experience of businessadministration; and his business experience, (mark you, does not lie in thedirection of this highly specialized metal production. The fourth member is Mr.. Williams, the Director of Mines in Tasmania. So we have one member with manufacturing and. commercial experience of some kind, and we have not any memher with experience in. the produet-ion or sale of metals. That is the commission. I go furthe r than that. At the beginning of clause 7 of the bill,, there is a very innocent phrase.",15
83,Dr GAHA,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,A Tasmanian phrase.,15
84,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"It is as innocent assome of mv friend'sspeeches, but, I may say, somewhat more deadly.",15
85,Mr CALWELL,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,The speeches of the right honourable gentleman are innocuous.,15
86,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I was speaking to my friend from Denison (Dr Gaha). I am sorry that the Minister for In for m a tionshould, have misunderstood me. Clause 7 readsSubject to the provisions of this act and of"" the - agreement, it shall be the duty of thecommission to do certain things in connection with the productiono f aluminium. If wetur n to the agreement, which is embodied'. in the schedule to the act, we find that the powers of the commission are set out elaborately in clause 4, which beginsSubject to any directions given on behalf of the Commonwealth and the State by the Minister of State for the Commonwealth administering the act, the commission shall do so and so. In other words, every power conferred upon this commission, constituted in the manner I have described, is to be subject to direct political control hy the Commonwealth Minister for Supply and Shipping. So we have here direct political administration of an undertaking which, I believe, has been put forward in the State of Tasmania as an undertaking of great business validity-somethin g which will add a great new industry to the resources of that State; and we find that it is to be run hy a politician, under whom, for mere convenience-becaus e they will he entirely subject to his orders-wil l be four persons, only one of whom is experienced in general business matters, and not one of whom is experienced in the production or sale of metals.",15

It may be said that, notwithstanding siderations of the kind to which I have been referring in this speech, and in of protests and criticism, we succeeded establishing the iron and steel industry Australia. That is very true. But I remind the House that the iron and steel industry of this country was established, not by a public commission under government ownership and political control, but by experienced business men and administrators.",16
92,Mr FKOST,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,They received help from the Commonwealth.,16
93,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Of course they did! In making that statement, the honourable gentleman merely says that they had help by means of the tariff. Of course they had, in certain respects. They also had bounties. They have justified all of that by so applying purely business considerations to the production of their metal that, in this war, they have 'been able to sell it competitively to other countries, in those countries; but here we have a great new theory of business efficiency. The Government sets up an amateur commission, and places it under the direct orders of the Minister for Supply and Shipping. The Minister, in turn, is under file direct orders of his party. It then says, ""You are equipped. We provide you with £1,500,000 of Commonwealth money and £1,500,000 of Tasmanian money "" - if there be such a thing- "" and if there should be losses ""-as , of course, there will be- "" the taxpayer will provide "". I said just now, "" £1,500,000 of Tasmanian money-if there be such a thing"". I confess that I have a little whether doubt on that subject.",16

95,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I did not believe for a moment that the honourable gentleman would know the answer. I am wondering where the State of Tasmania is to get its for this purpose, plus its other £1,500,000 to establish the hydro-electric works. Are we to understand that this is to be included in the next claim by Tasmania for Commonwealth assistance?",16

I suppose it is quite on the cards that eventually most of this money spite will be provided by the Commonwealth; in and of course, if that happens, particuin larly in the next couple of years, it will be provided out of loan funds. I suppose that a "" slab"" will be attached to a victory loan for the establishment of an Industry on which we have been given singularly little information. The last thing I want to say about the matter is this: The whole proposal, which cries aloud for investigation by the Tariff Board and ought to be referred to that body for investigation, is, after all, heavily tainted by politics.",16
98,Mr CALWELL,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"It passed the Legislative Council of Tasmania, in which there are only four Labour members.",17

106,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"That was a compenhas sation for the 73 whom the honourable gentleman addressed during the referenpaign dum campaign. My friend from Denison remembers that as vividly as I do. Let go back to the election of 1943. It was then that the Minister for Supply and Shipping announced in the Hobart Town Hall-it was a winner, honourable memmerely bers will observe-that the aluminium industry was 'to be set up in Tasmania, and that the Commonwealth Government had set aside £3,000,000 for the project. Then there was a lull, one of those periods of inactivity that occur even with a magnificent and stimulating government like this one. Nothing more occurred until last April. This Parliament had dealt with the Constitution Alteration Bill. On the 31st March this House adjourned in order that honourable members might take part in the referendum campaign. Early in April the Attorney-General went to Tasmania on a holy mission, to convert, not the heathen, but the members of the Legislative Council of that State, a body of which the honourable member for Denison was at one time a distinguished member. The result, apparently, was that, on the 18th April, while there, he signed the present agreement. That was the next thing that we heard. Curious, was it not? In the 1 last election campaign, in the Hobart Town Hall, a scheme was announced wonder under which the Commonwealth was to two provide £3,000,000. In the referendum campaign, with a reluctant Legislative Council which had to be persuaded, this agreement was produced, and, I believe, was signed with great pomp and ceremony, with moving picture cameras and flashlights; so much so that I really believe ought to go down in history as the Australia-Tasmania pact.",17
107,Mr ANTHONY,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Was it signed on a,17
108,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"The table used by camQueen Victoria was not produced, but I no doubt that a suitable table was very used. The agreement was signed.",17
109,Dr GAHA,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,It will be a great event,17
110,Mr MENZIES,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"That puts the position perfectly. One might speak for an and fail to improve upon that condemnation of the whole proposal. This been a political exercise: The oddity is, that whereas during an election camthe amount to be provided by the Commonwealth was £3,000,000, when the us referendum campaign arrived the price had dropped to £1,500,000, with Tasmania to find the balance. If this be not something that has been brought forward for political reasons, if it be a seriously intended productive business enterprise which this country proposes to establish, how is it that the responsible Minister has not been able to inform us of one of the facts which any ordinary investor would insist upon knowing before putting £10 into such a proposal ? Is the answer to all these things to await an inquiry ? If so, Tasmania apparently will wait for a long time for the establishment of this industry. If they are to be inquired into, why should not the inquiry be made by persons who stand in a position of independence, like the members of the Tariff Board, whose opinion carries weight in Australia? It may be that the Tariff Board will be able to put before the House information to enable it to say with confidence that this proposal is sound. The House is unable to come to such a conclusion in the entire absence of information which has characterized the presentation of this bill.",17
111,Dr GAHA,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Denison) [4.31] - I listened with great interest to the eloquent speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), and the doubts which he expressed were similar to those which have been raised regarding every secondary industry started in Australia. More than 30 years ago I heard exactly the same kind of story when it was first proposed to manufacture cloth in Australia. We were told that it would be impossible to make a yard of cloth in Australia, and similar objections were raised, in regard to all other secondary industries. I , in common with all other honourable members, am very interested in the establishment of the aluminium industry. The situation abroad in regard to this industry is very different from that in Australia. [ am informed that overseas the bauxite, which is the raw material of production, is obtained at a great distance from where the manufacturng plant is located. Actually, there are three stages in the production of aluminium goods. First, there is the mining of bauxite, which is converted by a chemical process into alumina. The second stage is the conversion of the alumina into aluminium ingots, and the third process is the fabrication of aluminium articles from the ingots. In America the bauxite has to be transported for thousands of miles over land and sea to where electric power is available for the process of manufacture, and that is necessarily a costly business. Tasmania has been selected for the manufacturing stage because of its cheap and abundant electric power. It will be for the commission to decide where the manufacturing processes shall be located. If the commission decdes that Tasmanian bauxite is to be used, transport costs will be greatly reduced, and there are extensive deposits of bauxite in Tasmania adjacent to the site where the electrolytic process for the manufacture of ingots is to be performed. The Tasmanian deposits are not so rich, J understand, as those of Victoria, but they have the advantage of being on the spot. It will be seen, therefore, that Australia has certain natural advantages which should enable it to compete economically with other parts of the world. In Tasmania, there is cheap and plentiful electric power, bauxite deposits are on the spot, and labour costs are no higher than in the United States of America. Moreover, there is ample water on the proposed site, and there are waste land? in the vicinity such as are necessary for the first chemical process. The Leader of the Opposition laid great emphasis on the Australian iron and steel industry. There must have been certain advantageous factors to enable us to do what we have done in the development of that industry here, and, I suggest that similar factors exist in respect of the aluminium industry. Thus, we have here everything necessary to enable us to produce aluminium, not necessarily in competition with the world, but for the purposes which we have in mind. Early in the war there were many rumours circulating regarding the establishment of the aluminium industry in Australia. Honourable members have surely learned one thing from this war-the defence of Australia transcends every other consideration. For that reason alone the aluminium industry should rank with other defence industries. If should be placed in the same category as the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, for instance. No one would say that the small arms factory should be a paying proposition. The Leader of the Opposition argued that we should not seek to manufacture aluminium here because it can be produced more cheaply in the United States of America. To be logical he should apply the same test to every other commodity produced in Australia. For instance, so that the people may have cheap butter-and not so cheap at that the Australian taxpayers are paying £9,000,000 a year. Would the Leader of the Opposition argue that because we might be able to buy cheaper butter abroad we should let the dairying industry in Australia go out of existence?",18
112,Mr BOWDEN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,The industry could not carry on in peace-time without assistance.,19
113,Dr GAHA,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"That is true. It was necessary to subsidize the industry m peace-time, so that there is no that the subsidy will ever be withdrawn. If the industry has to be assisted to the amount of £9,000,000 during the period of war-time prosperity, what wil] be the cost in peace-time to keep it going? However, because the dairying industry is vital to the welfare of Australia, we are subsidizing it. The same argument should, I submit, be applied to aluminium. Why was the industry never established in Australia? Because it was never considered to be a commercial proposition, but it is rubbish to say that industry, which is vital to the safety of the country, should not be started simply because it cannot be made to pay. I hope that no honourable member of this House will look upon the aluminium industry in Australia as anything other than a war industry which is being continued into the post-war period. Moreover, aluminium is not the only light metal which will be required for defence purposes. Probably others also will be needed for the manufacture of aircraft, and who is to say that, in the future, aluminium will not be used for other purposes than those with which we are familiar? I have been told that it is proposed to build bridges of aluminium, and even railway rolling stock, so as to reduce weight. But for the time being let us continue to regard aluminium production as a war industry. Even if we did not learn anything from the lastwar, let us learn something from this one-namely , that those goods which are necessary for the security of the country must be produced here, whatever the cost.",19
114,Mr CALWELL,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Honourable members opposite are not interested in the prosperity of Tasmania.,19
115,Dr GAHA,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I do not want to discuss the matter on that plane, but I know that other States aiso are interested. Evidently, the proposal smells when it is suggested that the industry shall go to Tasmania, but it would be sweet enough if it were to go to one of the other States. Other secondary industries have had their birth-pangs, and I have no doubt that this one also will have them. Powerful interests .abroad do not want us to start an aluminium industry here, but siirely we have not reached the stage when our fiscal policy must be moulded by what likelihood other countries think. The commission will have to decide, as I have said, where the bauxite is to be obtained. Although the Victorian deposits are richer, those in Tasmania have the advantage of being on the spot, and there is less overburden to be removed. Moreover, they are only 50 miles from the coast. As for the third stage of manufacture, that of fabrication, I understand that a Victorian firm is prepared to undertake the work. If the an industry does not succeed, I have no doubt that it will be pointed to as a great national failure. However, at the beginning of the war, when it was necessary for us to obtain aluminium from abroad, it was touch and go whether we would be able to get any at all. The war situation would not have needed to be much worse in Europe or New Guinea for us to be completely isolated. Therefore, I submit that this industry will be of great advantage to the Australian people. The Leader of the Opposition indicated the possibility of a great financial loss to the community, but I remind him that many munitions factories, deliberately created to help defend this country against the aggressor, may yet have to be the subject of rigorous examination and probably will be disposed of by this Government.",19
116,Mr MAKIN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,A writing-off!,19
117,Dr GAHA,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Yes , a complete writingoff. Ifthat can be done we can think, of the aluminium industry on the same* basis. The primary industries of this. country, the very basis of our life, are subsidized to an amount of more than £20,000,000 a year. The dairying industry alone receives about £9,000,000. It is no argument whatever to say that because an article can be produced more cheaply - somewhere else we should not produce it iin our own country. We have the cheap power, bauxite, labour and the need. The - aluminium industry is fundamental to - our defence.",19
118,Mr RYAN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Flinders) [4.47] - The proposal of the Government for the establishment of the aluminium industry is shrouded in mystery, so far as the relevant facts are concerned. An individual who wants to start a new business asks three questions: What will be the cost? What is the possibility of markets? What competition am I likely to meet? The Government should do the same. Two questions which must be answered, one or the other in the affirmative, before any secondary industry is set up, are whether it is economically sound and whether it is necessary for defence. I shall show that in this instance the answer to both is in the negative. There are other considerations. The first is the political consideration, to which attention was drawn by the Leader of the 'Oppositon (Mr Menzies), with whose .arguments I thoroughly agree. There is also the sentimental consideration. This proposal will mainly benefit Tasmania, the Cinderella State almost since the inception of federation. During the war, - the five other States have waxed fat and become prosperous, whereas Tasmania .has remained in its condition of ten, fifteen or twenty years ago. Whilst I believe that everything possible should be done to make Tasmania an industrial -'State, as I believe it will one day be, I feel certain that the Prince to raise it to prosperity will not come in the form of .aluminium ingots. In fact, Tasmania will not benefit to any great degree from this bill, which proposes to allocate - establishment of the industry £3,000,000, of which £1,500,000 will be provided by the Commonwealth Government and £1,500,000 by the Government of Tasmania, with more to come, presumably, for the provision of hydro-electric power, and the mining of bauxite and limestone, - together with transport facilities. So, what we shall have to expend on this industry will be far more than the modest £3,000,000 proposed for our acceptance. The Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr Beasley), in one of his few definite statements, when moving the second reading, referred to the prospective post-war market for .the proposed industry, and forecast that the local consumption of aluminium would be 6,000 tons a year. The Leader of the Opposition said that the pre-war consumption was from 1,500 to 1,700 tons a year. It will he most surprising, on the information I have been able to get, if our post-war consumption is anything like 6,000 tons. It is much more likely to be about 2,000 tons, little more than our annual pre-war consumption. We have two aluminium processing factories, one privately owned at Granville, New South Wales, and the other, set up by the Government, at, Wangaratta, and there is not sufficient demand to keen more than the one ar Granville in production. What hope have we, therefore, that in the immediatefuture, or even within a reasonable number of years, there will be work for both factories? We are over-supplied with manufactured aluminium. The Minister for Supply and Shipping said that he believed that there would be an extended use of aluminium in the post-war period. He instanced the replacement of steel by aluminium girders on one of the main bridges in Pittsburgh, United States of America, and mentioned experiments in that country with a view to replacing steel girders in other bridges with aluminium girders. I remind the House, however, that not only is aluminium competing with steel, but also that other light metals and materials are competing with aluminium; one of them is magnesium. The consumption of magnesium in the United States of America has risen from about 6,000 tons a year before the war to more than 220,000 tons, and it is estifor the mated that the post-war consumption will be about 102,000 tons. Magnesium has replaced aluminium very largely in the transport field-equipment of motor care, aeroplanes and rolling stock-as well as in a number of other ways. Both these metals are being challenged by plastics and laminated woods. It is doubtful whether aluminium will ever be used so extensively for the manufacture of aeroplanes, because plastics and laminated woods are already being used in the construction of aircraft. The outlook for the extended use of aluminium is, therefore, by no means so rosy as the Minister for Supply and Shipping would have us believe. I come to the question of cost of production about, which the Minister was silent, not even replying to interjections. He said nothing about what the cost of production was likely to be, but the point is most important, as the House will realise. Producers in this country have too long been saddled with costs of materials out of all proportion to the costs in other parts of the world, and we do not want to add to their already heavy burdens. Mr ""WATKINS - That is not so with iron and steel.",20
119,Mr RYAN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"The honourable member is right, but the costs of other materials required in manufacture are excessive. The pre-war cost of aluminium in Australia was £110 a ton. It is held by those best qualified to judge that the post-war price in Canada and England will not reach £100 a ton. In the United States of America the price today is 15 cents per lb., or about £100 a ton. Canadian producers state that they can make primary aluminium ingots at a cost to enable aluminium to be sold in the United Kingdom after the war for £55 or £60 a ton. - fudging by all normal standards, and in view of the enormously increased productive capacity of the world, I am of the opinion that we should be able to import aluminium from either Canada or the United States of America for about £75 a ton after the war. The lowest figure I have been able to arrive at as own cost of production is £200 a ton, which is nearly 300 per cent, higher than the cost of the imported metal. The Government may hold more optimistic views; if so, no doubt it bases them on the fact that our costs of production of base metals during the war have been low. The prices of zinc and lead, for instance, have been reasonable, and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited turns out the cheapest and probably the best steel in the world. It must be remembered, however, that those organizations have been operating for many years, have had great experience, and are fully developed.",21
120,Dame ENID LYONS,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,On what figures does the honourable member base his calculations ?,21
121,Mr RYAN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"On the costs of production, labour, transport and various other charges, particularly overhead. Those other operations were fully developed before the war broke out, and the concerns involved have always enjoyed active and ample markets, but the aluminium project will be set up at a time when costs are at their wartime peak, and it will have a local market for only a minor part of its production, with no hope of disposing of the surplus anywhere. There is no doubt as to the truth of the latter part of that statement. The world has produced more than its needs of aluminium. Canadian figures are not published, but it has been announced that the Arvida and Shipshaw plants produce 350,000 tons a year, about 50 per cent, of the entire aluminium needs of the United Nations. In 1939, in the United States of America, production waf 175,000 tons. The peak production reached in 1943 was just over 100,000 tons. To-day production is far outrunning consumption, the over-production being estimated at 350,000 tons a year. Eor the information of honourable members, I shall read the following extract from a New York journal, Biismesi Week, of the 9th September last:We are making the most and the ibiggest .planes in the world, but we can't chew up all the aluminium which military authorities, back in 1942, thought they were going to need. Result is that the latest in a string of cutbacks will pull output of virgin ingot down, our late in September or early in Ootober, to about 90,000,000 lb. (about 40,000 long tons) a'month-abou t half the 1943 - peak. Meanwhile, there has been a steady increase in the amount of scrap aluminium. If the rate of scrap recovery were to hold at its present level, this source of metal shortly would amount to nearly 4.0 per cent, of the total supply. The cut-lbacks in p r o d u c t i on mentioned include the following p l a n t s : Spokane - Originall y six pot lines: now four in operation. Los Angeles - projec t called for five pot lines, tout two never went into productionplant now closed. Troutdale (Tortlaud) - Fou r Hues, one closed in July, another now closed. Jones Mills, Arkansas - Pou r lines capacity - on e ordered closed. American Metal Market, of the 2nd June last, said: that the last four pot lines of the government-owned aluminium reduction plant at Queens, New York, would be closed. The capacity of the plant was 130,000 long tons of virgin metal yearly, and a pot line would produce approximately 14,000 tons a year. The same article in Business Week referred to an announcement hy the War Production Board that Canadian exports of aluminium: to the United States of America were being sharply reduced, and that the delivery of 100,000 tons of Canadian metal had been postponed indefinitely. It also declared, that the American national stock-pile of aluminium, exceeded 156,000 long tons. American Metal Market, of the ISth April, stated that secondary, or scrap, aluminium in the United States totalled 95,000 tons in 1941, 180,000 tons in 1942 and 230,000 tons in 1943. I have no doubt that some Ministers are saying to themselves, ""Even if Australia does not export its surplus aluminium to the Western world, we shall be able to find markets in South-East Asia, India and the Netherlands East Indies "". If they entertain that hope, I shall quickly disillusion them, because I have information that rhe Dutch Government has evolved a plan to manufacture aluminium in Sumatra. An. amount equivalent to EA.5,000,000 was ear-marked to develop the manufacture of aluminium by using the extremely rich bauxite deposit on Bintang Island, situated in the vicinity of Singapore. The past-<war plan of the Billiton Company, a semi-governmental concern, is that large aluminium works mall be erected in. Sumatra. Sumatra was chosen as the site for this enterprise - so as. to take advantage of the tremendous potential hydro-electric power which can be generated from the overflow of the Toba Lake, situated in the mountains about 3,000 feet above sea level. It is almost twice as large as Lake Geneva and considerably larger than the Dead Sea. More than 50 miles long and about 3 to 5 miles wide, Toba Lake is in places 1,350 feet deep. The Dutch engineers estimate that the water from this lake, which slowly flows to the Wilhelmina Falls, has a capacity of over 900,000* horse-power. The bauxite itself can be cheaply transported' by lighter in a few hours from Bintang Island, and the Billiton Company is confident that whateverthe future price of aluminium may be, there will be no place in the world where it can be produced at a moreeconomical rate. 'This project is so far advanced that, after the war, production, is expected to commence within two years. The Dutch confidently believethese works will .become one of the greatest industries in the entire Indies,. and will form the background of a speeded-u.p industrialization of theNetherlands East Indies.",21
122,Mr FROST,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,The honourable memiberalways has an inferiority complex regarding Australian industries.,22
123,Mr RYAN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"That is not correct; but I have said sufficient to show that the Government's proposition to manufacturealuminium inTasmania is not economically sound. Our ability to compete with other countries in the production of aluminium presents a gloomy picture,, and the possible high cost of production, will burden unnecessarily our other secondary industries.",22
124,Dr EVATT,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Will the honourable member tell me his authority for the statement regarding what the Dutch propose to do when Sumatra has been reoccupied ?*,22
125,Mr EYAN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I prefer not to make theinforniation public, but I obtained it from a reliable source. Australia's requirements of aluminium are small. Indeed-, the local demand will not besuflicient to absorb the output from theTasmanian works. I see no necessity for embarking upon this venture. Admittedly,, aluminium is essential for the manufacture of aircraft and military equipment. But would not it be less costly, instead of expending huge sums of money upon an uneconomic proposition, to import the metal and put it into a stock pile? If we estimate that our consumption will be 6,000 tons per annum,, let us accumulate reserves for five yearsfor defence purposes. If that were done,, the cost of creating those reserves, would bp considerably less than the amount of"" money that will be required, to establish the aluminium industry in Tasmania.. Aluminium does not deteriorate, and substantial reserve of the metal, if lished, would be available for defence purposes whenever an emergency arose. I regret to pour cold water on a proposal, which I know will benefit 'Tasmania economically for the time being. My .attitude is not prompted by any dislike of an extension of Austhe tralian secondary industries. If tralia is to carry a substantially increased population, it must expand its secondary industries. Rural industries will absorb appreciable numbers of new popuJf'linderis lation. Therefore, we desire to see the ""establishment and extension of secondary industries without delay. But to that I want to sec industries established is not to assert that I believe in launching of uneconomic industries. - Government's'proposal, if proceeded with, will ultimately be an incubus not - on Tasmania, but also on Australia whole. I should like to know whether Ministers firmly believe in. the.Atlantic -(""barter, to which Australia's signature was appended not long ago. If they do, 1 remind them that one of the first principles of the Atlantic Charter 'Freedom of trade. The aluminium indusfully investigated. try, which will prove to lie economically unsound, will require to be bolstered :H high tariff, and that will be contrary to the principles of the Atlantic Charter. If the industry is obliged to face comthe petition from other countries, it will Tuined, and the money spent on it be wasted. The honourable member for Denison (Dr Gaha) pointed out that factories established for war-time duction will be disposed of at a loss after the conclusion of hostilities; using that as an argument, he declared that he saw no justification for criticism of the proposed aluminium industry. The .t!wo things spring, from entirely different bases. The establishment of war-time factories was forced upon by the exigencies of war. But in the establishment 6f the aluminium industry we are embarking of our own free will upon an uneconomic proposition. Let not make the mistake of launching this dustry before we are sure that it will - success, and a value to Australia - whole. Before proceeding with the bill, Mr Ryan. a the Government should adopt the suggesestabtion of the Leader of the Opposition. Time is not an urgent factor in the .establishment of the industry. Production will not be commenced next month or even within a year. During that period, the Tariff Board should inquire into every aspect of the proposal for purpose of seeing whether the indusAustry will be of value to the country.",22
126,Mr MAKIN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Hindmarsh-Minister for the Navy andi Minister for Munitions) never [5.10] - The honourable member for (Mr Ryan) declared that time is not an urgent factor in the establishment of the aluminium industry. I say remind the honourable gentleman that there was a period when aluminium was the urgently required for the defence of The Australia, and our continued existence as a free people almost depended upon it. only We must not allow our country to be as a imperilled by a repetition of those circumstances. I listened Will interest to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), who opposed the Government's proposal. Mr Hoi/r - The Leader of the Opposition did not say that he was opposed to is the proposal, but he asked that it be",23
127,Mr MAKIN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"The attitude of the by right honourable gentleman showed clearly that he was opposed to the proposal, and that opposition was only consistent with political record of honourable memlbers be opposite, who have always desired to will delay the development of industries essential to our national security.",23
128,Mr WHITE,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,That statement is nonprosense. Is there any reason why the Tariff Board should not investigate the and proposed industry?,23
129,Mr MAKIN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"The circumstances will prove the accuracy of my contention. Honourable members opposite consider that the Government should not proceed with this proposal, and they have raised us all manner of objections to it. One objection was that the commission lacked a proper business foundation, and, for that reason, it would not be able successus fully to direct the industry. I have no indoubt that many business men in Tasbe a mania are associated with the State Paras a liament, and particularly with the Legislative Council. Before members of the Legislative Council would approve this agreement, involving the State in an expenditure of £1,500,000,I am confident that they fully investigated every business aspect of the proposal. Australia is rich in mineral resources. If we fail to take advantage of them, we prove ourselves unworthy of that inheritance. I cannot understand why any objection should be taken to our utilizing these resources to the best advantage. Honourable members of the Australian Country party have frequently dilated at length on the value of our bauxite deposits which, they have said., are equal to any in the world. It seems a little odd, therefore, that they should object to the proposal now under consideration. Why should we delay the development of our resources seeing that the supply of ingot aluminium is so necessary to our defence ? A definite obligation rests upon the Parliament to develop this industry. All honourable members are well a ware that our need of aluminium became so desperate two or three years ago that we appealed to our people to make available fo us every scrap of this material which they could find. At the time when Japan struck at Pear] Harbour we had only 70 tons of aluminium in the country. There was a time when we had only three weeks' supply of this essential commodity for aircraft and all other work. If a consignment that was on the high seas at that time had not reached us we should have been in dire distress.",23
130,Mr GUY,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,What are Australia's requirements at present?,24
131,Mr MAKIN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Eve n the Leader of the Opposition admitted that we needed 1,700 ions of aluminium per annum. The Goingot vernment's estimate is that in the post-war period we shall require 6,000 tons annum.",24
132,Mr GUY,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"The Minister said a few moments ago that at one stage we had in the country only 70 tons, which was three weeks' supply. Mr MAKIN' - Evidentl y the honorvital able member for Bass did not understand my remark. I said that when Japan struck at Pearl Harbour we had only tons of aluminium in Australia.",24
133,Mr GUY,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,The Minister also said it was only three weeks' supply.,24
134,Mr MAKIN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I said that at one stage, when a consignment of aluminium was ou the high seas on the way to Australia, we had only three weeks' supply. If that shipment had failed to arrive we should have been in a desperate plight. The Government desires to avoid any such possibility in the future.",24
135,Mr HAHMSON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,What about the Atlantic Charter?,24
136,Mr MAKIN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"No provision of the Atlantic Charter or of the Lend-Lease agreement would prevent Australia or any other country from making proper provision for its own defence. .Surely all honourable members must realise that whatever money has been expended in this country in the past in the development of our iron, steel and copper industries has proved a worth-while investment. The Government is of the opinion that the investment of money in the aluminium ingot industry will also be a first-class investment. Both air and sea power will require to be developed and maintained for the future defence of Australia. I cannot understand any honourable member offering objection to a proposal to establish an industry which will make practicable the strengthening of our aircraft manufacturing industry. Honourable gentlemen opposite who oppose the establishment of this industry reveal them«elves as little Australians, and they do the country a serious disservice by their attitude. A country which fails to learn the lessons of its own history does not deserve to continue to be a force among the nations. The establishment of the aluminium industry is absolutely essential to the security of the Commonwealth. per The Leader of the Opposition stated that we had been living from hand to mouth. That is quite true, and it is one of the reasons why the Government is taking this step to establish an industry which will ensure to Australia adequate supplies of a metal which has become for defence purposes. We have found it extremely difficult to secure supplies of aluminium. Certain quantities of alu70 minium which were considered to be necessary for essential purposes of this that country were on order for almost two years, but the delay in delivery was soprotracted, and the likelihood of obtaining supplies from that source became so slender, that the Government took steps to cancel certain of the orders; it was not able to do so.",24
137,Mr WHITE,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Where was that order placed ?,25
138,Mr MARIN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I do not propose to - divulge that information. It is sufficient to say that delivery was likely to be so belated that the Government considered it necessary to cancel the order. However, that was not permitted, and supplies came to hand ultimately, which is one of the reasons why a certain factory in the electorate of the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) has not been working at full capacity. In view - of the geographical isolation of Australia, it is essential for us to make this country as self-contained and self-reliant as possible, especially in respect of defence vices. We have the raw material, as well as electric power which can be provided - cheaply by the waterways of one of our ""best States. Honourable members opposite would deny to the nation the opportunity to provide for its own security and well-being. The establishment of this industry would place us beyond the risk of being denied an essential commodity in a time of extremity. The project should commend itself as one of 'the most important that cuuld be undertaken for the defence of this country ",25
139,Mr MCEWEN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Giv e us facts. want statistics.,25
140,Mr MAKIN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Whateve r facts I I might produce, the honourable gentleman would not be convinced of the soundness - of the ideas we are propounding. A fundamental feature of the proposal is that this project is to be sponsored by t w 0 governments. Had the matter been left to the great combine which deals in this metal, I have no doubt that there would have been little or ao complaint from honourable members opposite. They decry this industry, which is essential to our defence, because the nation seeks to establish it. They wish ;a profit to be made by private enterprise - even out of the necessities of the country in time of war, and to enrich the speculator, rather than serve the public interest by making whatever contribution might be possible to the security of our country. They are rarely willing to keep abreast of the times in which they live, or to move in ways that would proclaim their mental advancement and their determination to provide for the development of this country. This industry not only will provide for essential defence needs, but, in addition, has almost unlimited possibilities in other directions. The Government has given proof of its desire to consider first the well-being of Australia and the provision of its essential needs so that we shall not, in future, require to face a perilous situation such as confronted us in the early days of the war.",25
141,Mr FADDEN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party) [5.34] - The Minister for Munitions (Mr Makin) has certainly enlightened the House on the sentimental aspect, but ser- he has not enabled it to decide calmly and coolly whether or not it would be wise to invest £3,000,000 of public money in this undertaking in the existing circumstances. It is all very well to say to the House and the people thai it is necessary to establish in Australia as many industries as possible, and to utilize our metals and other resources to achieve that purpose. No one is more desirous than are the members of the Australian Country party of having established in Australia as many industries as possible, and of making the country We self-contained; but when it is proposed that £3,000,000 of the taxpayers' money shall be invested in a. time of war, we have the responsibility of seeing thai there shall first be a most minute investigation of both present and future economic aspects. So far, the House ha? not been given sufficient detail to enable .it to arrive at a sound conclusion along the lines I have indicated. We have - been told that this industry is essential. Nobody was more conscious of the need for it than was the Government with which I was associated. Honourable members opposite have attempted to discredit us by making allegations of all sorts against us, but they cannot deny that we were responsible for a subcommittee being appointed for the thorough investigation of the light metal industries of Australia. It was our Government which appointed the bauxite committee to investigate matters in connection with that essential raw material of the great aluminium industry. The establishment of the industry in Tasmania would be a natural step to take, because that State has cheap hydroelectric politer which should be harnessed and utilized to the full. But having regard to the meagre data available to us, this House should be more fully informed before authorizing the Government to provide £1,500,000 towards the cost of establishing the industry, the balance of the £3,000,000 to be provided by the State of Tasmania. From the information available to me, it would appear that an expenditure of £3,000,000 would provide a capacity far in excess of the requirements of Australia. This afternoon, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) gave figures which have not been disputed, in regard to productive capacity. He stated that, according to the latest available figures, the capacity in the United States of America alone is 1,180,000 tons a year, and that the demand for aluminium has declined by 33-J per cent. Any one who considers the economics of the matter must realise that both production and demand reached their peak when war necessities were satisfied. It is obvious that the present demand will not be maintained, and that consequently the existing productive capacity will not be needed. Such factors should be taken into consideration, and this House should be enlightened upon them before agreeing to a Commonwealth investment of £1,500,000 in the enterprise. There is not sufficient information before the House to enable it to dischargeits responsibility as the custodian, of the public purse. Taxation has reached saturation point, and the Government is finding it increasingly difficult to raise money by means of voluntary loans. The only other element in public finance is the expanding and dangerous one known as bank credit. Were we to agree to an expenditure of £1,500,000 on this undertaking, we should totally disregard the responsibility and duty which our trusteeship involves. I am not condemning the establishment of the industry. I consider that it should and must be established, on such a scale that it [80] will be able to meet present and future demands so far as they can be determined. I am informed that the argument that aluminium cannot be produced in Australia at a fraction of the cost of its production elsewhere cannot be substantiated. I understand that the cost in Australia would be at least comparable with the cost overseas. Also, I do not hold a pessimistic view in regard to the establishment of the industry. We can recall the opposition that was encountered when it was proposed that the iron and steel industry should be established in this country. Every honourable member, and every sensible Australian, must thank God for the establishment of that industry at Newcastle. The state of our defences would have been very poor, in fact, we would have been non-existent today except as the serfs and slaves of others, had it not been for the successful establishment and expansion of that great undertaking, which has been so developed that today it compares more than favourably with similar undertakings in any other country. I remind honourable members that that service has been given - wholly by private enterprise.",25

The Tariff Board exists for the purpose of investigating such projects, and the Government should avail itself of the knowledge and experience of that body. I move That all the words after "" That"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:- "" the bill be withdrawn for the purpose of referring the matter to the Tariff Board for investigation and report"".",26

147,Dr EVATT,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Barton-Attorney-Genera l and Minister for External Affairs) [8.0] - The Government is fulfilling a duty to the nation in establishing the aluminium ingot industry in Australia. First, it is of vital importance, that theie should be a local source of aluminium to provide for our future defence requirements, and to ensure that Australia shall not again have to he precariously dependent, as it has been during this war, on supplies from overseas. This industry is essential for our air defence and for .ancillary industries, for which aluminium forms a basic or important material. Reasonable aircraft production after the war will entail the use of a considerable quantity of high-strength alloys. In addition, these alloys will be in demand for a wide range of munitions, and for other urgent government requirements. Secondly, by establishing the project in Tasmania, the Commonwealth Government is incidentally providing one of the smaller, less industrially developed States with a sound and important manufacturing industry, and is giving practical effect to its policy of decentralization of industry. However, the selection of Tasmania is solely due to the fact that expansion of the Tasmanian Government's hydro-electric scheme will ensure that the necessary power will be available.",26
148,Mr HARRISON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Is that why the promise was made during the last election campaign, and repeated during the referendum campaign?",27
149,Dr EVATT,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"If t h honourable member will listen for a few minutes 1 think he will withdraw any objection he has to the bill. Nowhere else in Australia is there cient power available for the aluminium industry. Electric power up to 40,000 horse-power, for the production of 10,000 tons of ingot a year, will be provided by the Tasmanian Government, which is extending its hydro-electric power scheme to ensure that the required power will be available at reasonable cost. The price per unit is comparable with that which applies at the large aluminium smelteries in other parts of the world, and should enable Australia to produce aluminium at a satisfactory price. The effect which the price of electricity has upon the economics of the industry will be gathered from the fact that each .Id. a unit means an addition of approximately £10 a ton to the cost of the metal. The Government has confidence in the success of the industry. The Aluminium-. Production Commission to be set up under this bill will take action, immediately the bill has received assent, to accelerate the procurement, delivery and installation of plant, so that the industry can ba brought into production. The technical and commercial management of the enterprise will be in the hands of the commission. It may be possible to obtain some plant in Australia. Preliminary inquiries have been made overseas, however, and it may he that the complete plant will be obtainable from the United Kingdom within a reasonable time. Inquiries through the British Ministry of Supply indicate that there are prospects of obtaining either a. 5,000-ton or a 10,000-ton plant, both of which have recently been in operation in that country. It has yet to be decided whether we shall have a 5,000-ton or a 10,000-ton plant. Despite continuous efforts and widespread inquiries in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom it has been impossible up till now, because of war demands, to obtain plant and equipment. It is true, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Harrison) pointed out, that reference was made to this matter in Tasmania, before the last general election. That is only another way of saying that the Government put its plans before the people. e It has, therefore, a mandate to establish this defence industry.",27
150,Mr HARRISON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,It was a good time to suffido it-jus t on the eve of an election.,27
151,Dr EVATT,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Promise s are often made on the ove of an election, but in this case the promise is being fulfilled. The Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr. Beasley) announced in Hobart in August, 1943, that the Curtin Government had decided to establish an aluminium ingot smeltery in Tasmania. He indicated then that Australia had fabrication facilities, but lacked the vital raw material. Sir Ronald Charles, a British expert, was asked by the Commonwealth Government, during a visit here, to report on the establishment of the aluminium production industry in Australia. He submitted estimates for a plant to produce 5,000 tons of aluminium per annum, and these estimates have been taken carefully into consideration by the Department of Supply. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) claims that there should be an inquiry by the Tariff Board. He completely overlooks the history of this matter. In May, 1941, during the term of office of the Menzies Government, this very distinguished expert, Sir Ronald Charles, made a special report to the Government on the production of aluminium ingot in Australia. I understand that he pointed out in his report that, in providing a smelter, the essential condition was an assured and uninterrupted, supply of electric power at the rate of about 20,000 horse-power per annum, and at a cost per unit which would enable the metal to be produced economically. It was and is plain that these essential conditions could be fulfilled only in the State of Tasmania. There, alone, sufficiently cheap hydroelectric generation is or can be made possible.",27
152,Mr FADDEN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,That report was presented three years ago. There has been much development since then.,28
153,Mr WHITE,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Has it been circulated?,28
154,Dr EVATT,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"-No . I have not the report with me. and I am reading from the notes prepared by the Department of Supply and Shipping. Finally, the Menzies Government decided, during Senator MCBride's administration of the Department of Supply, that for the very purpose of obtaining independence from overseas sources of supply, and as a matter of government policy, the manufacture of ingot aluminium in Australia should be proceeded with, preferably from Australian bauxite. The Menzies Government even went so far as to import 25,000 tons of bauxite from the Netherlands East Indies. The landed cost was approximately £4 10s. a ton. The Leader of the Australian Country party says that all this took three years ago, and so it did. That 25,000 tons of bauxite was brought to Australia, and the stuff is now stored at Unanderra in New South Wales. The Commonwealth Government paid to the New South Wales Department of Railways £3,000 for the construction of a railway siding at this place, and r Bill 1944. 2227 since the arrival of the metal there the Government has been paying rent to a local landholder for the right to store it on his property. Thus, it was not merely that the Menzies Government made a decision regarding the matter. Bauxite was actually imported for the inauguration of the aluminium industry in Australia. In his report to the Menzies Government, the British expert, Sir Ronald Charles, pointed out that power could be obtained only in Tasmania. He concluded by recommending that, in view of the many uncertainties, the Government should restrict itself, in the first place, to the erection of a smelter, and should rely upon imported alumina for the production of aluminium.",28
155,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"The right honourable gentleman should be fair enough to give the reason why the purchase was made. When I speak, I shall give a list of other purchases made at about the same time. The purchases were not made by me.",28
156,Dr EVATT,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"The honourable member may not have been a party to the decision to purchase the bauxite, but that was what was done.",28
157,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,But the right honourable gentleman knows the reason for it.,28
158,Dr EVATT,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I do not know the reason. All I know is that there.was an inquiry by an expert. The Government reached a decision and followed it up by importing 25,000 tons of bauxite from the Netherlands East Indies. It has since been proved that Australia itself has adequate supplies of bauxite of suitable quality, and it is estimated that by open cut mining the cost of production will be less than £1 a ton. As the Minister for Supply and Shipping announced in his second-reading speech, the estimated cost of establishing the industry for the production of 10,000 tons place of aluminium a year is £3,000,000, of which £1,500,000 is to be provided by the Commonwealth and a similar amount by the Tasmanian Government. This computation is based on estimates made available in answer to official inquiries overseas covering the capital cost of a plant of 10,000 tons capacity. There are some unpredictable factors, however, and it is possible that the original estimate may be substantially exceeded. The £3,000,000 is made up as follows:Alumina factory .. 750,000 Smeltery .. . . 1.500,000 Operating capital .. 350,000 Stores and spare parts . . 200,000 General equipment .. 50,000 Contingencies .. .. 150,000 Aluminium ingot is produced in the smeltery from alumina, which, in turn, obtained from alumina-bearing materials, the chief of which is bauxite. The location of the factory for obtaining the alumina from bauxite has not been decided, and there is no commitment to Tasmanian or any other government on the alumina factory. A decision on the site for this factory will not be made until the commission has carefully examined the merits of the alumina production and the economic factors involved. The Government has undertaken to conThis sider the production of alumina in the States which have good bauxite deposits. Most States have these deposits, but as is known those in Victoria are of the best quality. Consideration will be given to the possibility of using alumina from Western Australia if it can be produced satisfactorily from alunite as a by-product from the potash industry. Experiments are being carried out by the Western tralian Government at Lake Campion. As the processes for the production of both alumina from bauxite and the ingot from alumina are highly technical and requirements. complicated, the commission will obtain expert assistance from overseas as well as in Australia. Already, preliminary inquiries have been made overseas in respect. It is estimated that approximately men will be required for the purposes operating the industry, and approximately the same number for constructional purdian poses. This is on the basis of a 10,000-ton plant. The capacity of the plant to installed will be a matter for consideration by the commission after weighing all factors involved. When Sir Ronald Charles made his investigation into the possibility of beginning aluminium production in Ausincrease tralia it was recommended that the alumina be imported, because it was thought then that Australia did not Dr Evatt. possess satisfactory bauxite deposits. The Curtin Government was not satisfied that Australia did not have bauxite, and instituted a comprehensive survey of the bauxite deposits of Australia by the Copper and Bauxite Committee. The committee established that throughout Australia there were appreciable deposits of bauxite of suitable quality. It has been proved that if bauxite is chosen as the is source for aluminium the supplies in Australia will be sufficient for many years. The commission has made preliminary inquiries into the matter of land, buildings, plant and equipment, and into the the engagement of experts and other officers and staff. Already it has collected valuable data. A detailed survey has been made of Australian post-war requirements of ingot aluminium. This survey discloses that the possible immediate requirements approximate 6,000 tons a year. figure was reached after full allowance had been made for the competition which aluminium might be expected to so far meet from plastic materials. It is recognized that unpredictable factors may mean that, the 6,000 tons will not be realized. On the other hand, wider use of light metals, particularly in any expansion of the aircraft industry, may mean that the Australian consumption will be Ausgreater than 6,000 tons a year. This survey of probable post-war requirements of aluminium covered defence needs, and other essential and urgent governmental Investigations indicate that the price of the aluminium which will be produced in Tasmania in an efficient 10,000-ton or this 5,000-ton plant should be comparable locally with that of aluminium imported 800 from overseas. Many factors will operate of in our favour. Australian bauxite deposits are readily accessible. The Canaand American interests are mainly dependent on bauxite imported from be British and Dutch Guiana, involving several thousand miles of haulage and the transhipment. Estimates already made indicate that Australian labour costs will compare favourably with those overseas, and the unfavorable exchange rate will the Australian price of imported metal 'by at least 25 per cent. The supply of electricity for our project in Tasmania will be available at such a reasonable cost that this also w i l pare favourably with overseas prices power charges despite the size of overwere seas installations. No one who imparprises tially assesses the achievements of tralia in other industries would challenge its ability to conduct alumina and aluminium plants efficiently. A reasonoccur able post-war aircraft production A i r Force will require a considerable quantity of high-strength alloys. I addition, these alloys will be in for munitions and other urgent governmental requirements. The Government is convinced that Australia must not - without its own source of aluminium if predecessors. we are to ensure our future defence, particularly our air defence, which will be vital to our safety. In addition, the production of ingot aluminium tralia will enable us to make an important contribution towards Pacific defence generally. Finally, why is this to be run as a governmental enterprise? Perhaps that is the objection. I do not know. The previous Government decided to establish of those affected. the aluminium industry, but the question now is-Why should this industry be as a governmental enterprise? already endeavoured to state my general try? approach to these questions. Some enterprises governments are quite unfitted operate. iSome public utilities, however, knows. are peculiarly fitted for government operation. An excellent example of is the interstate aviation industry, bein Australia. cause of its very intimate relationship to the air defence of Australian and decided. neighbouring Pacific territories. The same principle applies to the aluminium bill does. industry. Upon the establishment of that industry may well depend the future of the aircraft production industry of this country. Although, economic considerations are not to be neglected, the air defence of this country is of supreme importance, and it is only proper that the aluminium ingot industry should controlled and operated as a result co-operation between the Commonwealth and the State of Tasmania. The bill provides in clause 9 that the undertaking shall not be without the consent of both Houses of the Australian Parliament. This is to prevent the executive government l comselling this enterprise without parliafor mentary approval. In the past, there a number of successful State enterwhich were sold-ofte n at a Ausridiculously low price-befor e Parliament had been consulted, still less had approved,. Under this bill, that cannot in relation to this joint Commonand wealth-Tasmanian undertaking.

170,Mr ANTHONY,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,The Government has changed its opinions about manufacturing power .alcohol from wheat.,30

172,Mr ANTHONY,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,The Government is done not manufacturing power alcohol from from wheat to any extent.,30
173,Dr EVATT,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I do not see what lation that has to this matter, but the reason why the power alcohol distilleries are not making .power alcohol from wheat is that the Australian Wheat Board will not make wheat available. That is owing t'j the drought.",31
174,Mr ANTHONY,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Yes . The circumstances have changed, as the circumstances in relation to this may change.",31
175,Dr EVATT,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"The drought'has caused temporary suspension of the manufacture of power alcohol from wheat. The two things are quite independent. I do not say that a government is not entitled to change its mind about an industry, but it is a sufficient answer to those who say that we should have an inquiry to point out how dependent we were and probably shall 'he again on aluminium for our air defence. This is a defence enterprise and it is proper that the Government of Australia should conduct it. If , incidentally to that defence purpose, an industry of value be established in Tasmania, which has peculiar facilities for the establishment of the industry, I do not think any one elsewhere in Australia will begrudge Tasmania that great benefit.",31
176,Mr WHITE,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Balaclava) [8.21] - I was hopeful that the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) would advance some good reasons for the proposed establishment of the aluminium industry. I say that ""seriously, not flippantly. I do not intend to talk on a party level. If the right honourable gentleman could prove that for u very good reason this industry should be established in Australia, I should support it. We have the bauxite, the necessary fluxes and the electric power. He endeavoured, however, to build his case on the fact that a report was made some years ago that the industry should be established. I have not seen that . report. I was not in Australia when it was made.",31
177,Mr FADDEN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,The circumstances were entirelv different.,31
178,Mr WHITE,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"S OI understand. The only other report was on bauxite, a mere clay abundant in Australia. The right honourable gentleman then cited the interstate airways as a reason for making aluminium, under State socialism. The interstate airways have not yet been acquired by the Commonwealth. A statement has been made in Parliament, with a regood deal of unfavorable reaction, that they will be taken over. The airways are highly efficient and were pioneered by men who understood what they were doing.",31
179,Mr CALWELL,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,And this is a highly efficient Government.,31
180,Mr WHITE,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"The government - spokesman says that the Government is highly efficient- I doubtit-bu t there is no evidence that it can run a metal industry, and the proposal before Parliament is that the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Tasmania should subscribe £1,500,000 each in order to enter into business as manufacturers of ingot aluminium. Where will the money come from ? The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) has pointed to the fact that Tasmania has no surplus money and the Commonwealth can only find it by taxation, credit expansion, or loans. The £3,000,000 needed to finance this industry will almost certainly come from loan money. Is it fair that money subscribed by the .people for war purposes should go into such a hazardous enterprise? We have a long history of State enterprise. The Government of Queensland has had costly experiences. It tried everything, from butchers' shops to cattle stations, under government management. In theory, we all can - be socialists, but the present Government believes in the modern propaganda, "" Socialize everything and we shall have a new breed of men and a new kind of State"". The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Fraser), a recent recruit to the House, is prolific in print about this "" brave new world "", but I tell the honourable gentleman that we live in a democracy wherein common sense ought to prevail. If something can be done more efficiently by the Government, it should be done, but there should not be the nonsensical belief that everything that the Government wishes to run can be done much better, and that under government control men have a change of heart and that perfection is achieved.",31
181,Mr LAZZARINI,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,That is going from the sublime to the ridiculous.,31
182,Mr WHITE,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I am glad that the Minister for Home Security (Mr. Lazzarini) admits that. That is what I have been trying to teach for a long time. If the Government wishes to make aluminium, why not plastics and plywoods? In Great Britain, plastics and plywoods are playing a prominent part in aircraft manufacture. The Mosquito aircraft, our best intruder aircraft, and both a fighter and a bomber, is made of plywood. To-morrow, the Government may decide to go into the manufacture of three-ply and plastics.",31
183,Mr MAKIN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,It may.,32
184,Mr WHITE,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I am glad to extract that admission from the Minister for the Navy (Mr Makin). He was very war-like before the dinner adjournment nnd declared feelingly that only 70 tons of aluminium stood between us and the Japanese, or something of that sort. The honourable gentleman was not so war-like when he was the Speaker, for he even had the M!ace removed from the chamber as a relic of barbarous war. There is joy over one sinner that repenteth, and I am glad that the honourable gentleman now stands for defence. In his change of heart, however, he must not let sentiment run away with him.",32
185,Mr FKOST,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"The Government of which the honourable member was a supporter talked about defence, but we did something.",32
186,Mr WHITE,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I practised what I preached about defence. The Minister for the Navy said that at one period we had only 70 tons of aluminium. That may have been so, but today the Royal Australian Air Force itself holds a quantity of ingot aluminium reclaimed from crashed aircraft. For weeks, I have had on the notice-paper a question as to what quantity of aluminium ingot is held by the Royal Australian Air Force. I have not received an answer yet, but I believe that it is approximately 3,000 to 4,000 tons. Therefore, the position to which the honourable member referred does not exist today. Every one will agree that before embarking on an enterprise of this kind any government, or an individual, should have the fullest information. What information have we? We have not had a copy of a report or a memorandum giving the facts. The Attorney-General read a statement handed to him by a departmental officer, and based his view that the Government could conduct the aluminium industry on the fact that itintends to run an air service, although it has not yet run one. The only sound procedure is to ask the Tariff Board to inquire into this industry. That is the purpose of the amendment. I put to honourable gentlemen, especially newcomers on the other side, who do not know the history of the workings of the Tariff Board, that it has been of very great value to the Commonwealth. I say that advisedly, having referred some hundreds of matters to it for investigation. Our basic industries, such as cotton and woollen goods, and iron and steel, are some that have been investigated by the board, and governments have been largely guided by its recommendations. The especial merit of the board is that it conducts an open inquiry which any honourable member, or member of the public, may attend. Equally with supporters of the Government, I am against monopolies. Nor do I want to see a government monopoly or a trade union monopoly, and the Government will have political power over this industry when it is set up. I do not want to see any cartel controlling the production of aluminium in Australia, either. Ultimately, this industry may fall fretn the Government's palsied hands into the control of some international cartel. It is almost sure to go the way of so many other industries which were uneconomic and which were finally sold at knockdown prices.",32
187,Mr FULLER,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Sol d by whom?,32
188,Mr WHITE,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I remind the honourable member that. recently a munitions establishment at Wagga in his electorate was handed over to private enterprise. Perhaps the honourable member would like to inquire into that matter. Earlier in my speech, I mentioned that Government industries in Queensland had made colossal losses. The Minister for Repatriation (Mr Frost) has the stock sneer that when we do not support the establishment of an industry in Australia, it is a sign of smallmindedness. There is nothing more fatal than to have a one-track mind, and believe old shibboleths like that. It is ridiculous to think that simply by creating a government monopoly, piling on protective duties with a spade or giving a substantial bounty, prosperity can be assured. Those honourable members opposite who were members of the Scullin Government will recall that, when the economic blizzard struck the world, their endeavours to rectify the position of Australia were beset with many difficulties. We on this side of the chamber gave them our sympathy and a good deal of support in adjusting the trade balance. But they will recollect that many colossal duties were imposed on imported goods for the purpose of fostering Australian industries. So far from making our industries prosperous, those duties increased the cost of production in other industries and made conditions more difficult for the primary producer. Consequently, the increase of trade, which had been expected, did not eventuate. I had the unpleasant task of revising the tariff in 1933, removing some of the duties and imposing others. It is fatal to believe that the indiscriminate imposition of duties will bring prosperity, because unexpected repercussions will occur. Every industry should, therefore, be investigated separately. Great Britain, because of its war effort, which is above all praise, whether on the field of battle or in the manufacture of aircraft and munitions, has lost 70 per cent, of its pre-war export trade. As honourable members are aware Great Britain has a large population who live on a small island, and they depended before the war on overseas countries for 70 per cent, of their food requirements, and large quantities of raw materials for manufacture. By its sheer excellence in production and wonderful enterprise, Great Britain has been able to pay its way at .all times. Honourable members who listened to the broadcast by Mr Bankes-Amery on Sunday morning will remember that he said that Great Britain, heavily rationed, undernourished and under fire for five years, will take all the food that Australia can produce during the next four years. Are we blind to the fact that trade has to be reciprocal ? It behoves us to .study the goods which we are making. Many articles have to be manufactured in Australia during the war, but in peace-time we could with advantage divert our man-power in some cases to more useful and more economic Mr White. work. We must - help Great Britain to recover its trade; otherwise, how can that country establish the credits with which to buy the food which we produce? I do not assert that Great Britain can export aluminium to Australia; actually, it is a buyer of aluminium from the United States of America and Canada. In fact, Great Britain buys about 100,000 tons of aluminium a year. Any honourable member who blindly supports this bill on the meagre information given to us rather cavalierly by several Ministers, and without studying the economics of the proposal, will render a grave disservice to Australia. It should not be thought that honourable members on this side of the chamber do not believe in measures to secure the adequate defence of this country. For years the Lyons Government did a great deal in that direction by setting up the aircraft industry and helping factories that were engaged on defence work. That was always taken into account in the economic policy of the United Australia party when it was in office. Does the present Government now intend to make a wide departure from that policy by embarking upon a Socialist plan? It proposes to nationalize interstate civil aviation, and the venture will probably succeed, not because of any action of the Government, but because of the high standard of the personnel. To acquire the assets of the civil aviation companies, the Government proposes to expend £3,000,000 from money that was raised for the conduct of the war. In the same way, the sum of £1,500,000, which the Commonwealth will invest in the aluminium industry, was raised for war purposes. No urgent need exists today for the establishment of this industry, because the Commonwealth Government can obtain from abroad all the aluminium that it requires. Allied countries have a surplus of aluminium at the present time. All that we require is a pilot plant that can be operated in an emergency. The Minister for Munitions (Mr Makin) stated that the security of Australia was imperilled in 1942 because of the lack of supplies of aluminium here. But a firm in Australia could have produced all the aluminium required here. I shall tell the Minister the name ot that firm later. ""With its small plant it could not have gone into quantity production immediately, but within a period of six months it could have supplied to the Government all the aluminium that it required.. To embark so lightly upon this proposal, ignoring the thousands of tons of aluminium in stock and scrap ingot from crashed aircraft and the like, is most unwise. Are honourable members opposite prepared to overlook the economics of the proposal? The Government is the custodian of the public purse. Ministers charge honourable members on this side of the chamber with being the champions of capitalism and private enterprise. We do believe that if private enterprise is capable of conducting an industry economically, it should be given an opportunity to do so, but private enterprise risks its own money and not the public's moneys. The Minister for Munitions declared that after the war government munitions establishments, in which £100,000,000 has been invested, will produce goods for peace-time needs. That policy will accelerate the decline of this country. Internally, we are not in a happy position today. Whilst no one can criticize the splendid efforts of our fighting services, there has been a sag in national character in many ways. In Parliament we must carefully examine every proposal of the Government, and not be lavish with the public purse. Taxation has reached its peak and will remain there for some time if the Commonwealth Government expends £3,000,000 in acquiring civil airlines, and. £1,500,000 in the aluminium industry, and follows other such wasteful ways - I exhort Ministers to allow the Tariff Board: to inquire into this proposal and hear both sides of the case. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Keane) has only to ask the Tariff Board to inquire into and report on proposals for the establishment of the aluminium industry in Australia and to accelerate the inquiry, if necessary. No honourable member can reasonably oppose that suggestion. On many occasions the Tariff Board has been invited to advise the Government upon similar proposals, and its reports have enabled honourable members to form judgments. The Leader of the Opposition pointed out that even the commission which has been selected to control the aluminium ingot industry, though consisting of men of much technical knowledge, has not a complete knowledge of the industry itself. The Tariff Board, by public advertisement, invites any person to come forward and express his views upon the proposal under consideration. The board is tolerant of everyone. If the Government accepts the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition, any one who believes that a cartel or monopoly may gain control of the industry, or any one who opposes State socialism, will have an opportunity to voice his opinions and the Tariff Board will submit a worthwhile report. The Government does not necessarily follow slavishly the report of the Tariff Board.",32
189,Mr BARNARD,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"In some instances, governments have ignored the reports of the Tariff Board.",34
190,Mr WHITE,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I cannot recall any particular instance, but I know that for six years during my period at the Department of Trade and Customs every report of the Tariff Board making a favourable recommendation on trade with Great Britain was approved. But we ignored some reports which recommended the lowering of the foreign tariff, and the wisdom of that policy has since been evident. The Government is acting very unwisely in not seeking a report upon this proposal. No honourable member has been able to study the economics of the proposition because we all have to rely for information on the statements of Ministers. Therefore, I have the greatest pleasure in supporting the amendment.",34
191,Mr FROST,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Franklin-Minister for Repatriation and Minister in charge of War .Service Homes) [S.40] - I regret that the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr Beasley), who introduced the bill, is not in the chamber this evening, because I know the great work that he put into this measure, and that he intends to fulfil the assurances that he gave. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) declared that no urgency exists to pass the bill, and that Australia at present has plentiful stocks of aluminium. Earlier the Minister for Munitions (Mr Makin) informed the House that the security of Australia had been, imperilled in 1942 as the result of lack of supplies of aluminium.",34
192,Mr WHITE,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,But the supplies plentiful today.,35
193,Mr FROST,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,The reason for that is easily understood. It is known that the Commonwealth Government intends to establish the aluminium ingot industry. Certain overseas interests will try to ensure plentiful supplies of aluminium to Australia hoping that the Tasmanian project will be knocked on the head.,35
194,Mr HOLT,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Is there not a glut of aluminium in the world today?,35
195,Mr FROST,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"We are told that there is. I recall that at the termination of the last war, a carbide industry was established in Tasmania. The price of carbide was £80 or £90 a ton. As soon as that industry commenced, ships brought foreign carbide to Tasmania at a cheaper rate than the price at which it was available elsewhere.",35
196,Mr ABBOTT,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Was the carbide factory established by the Government or by private enterprise ?,35
197,Mr FROST,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"The factory was originally established by private enterprise, but the Government took control when the company was unable to continue operations. Later, another company acquired the factory from the Government. After the last war, we heard that large quantities of carbide would not be required, because electricity supplanted carbide for lighting purposes in many towns. Since this war began, we have been able to supply the whole of the requirements of Australia. Even before the war commenced we exported thousands of tons of carbide to the Middle East and .Singapore. I am glad that this new industry is to be established in Tasmania. Several new Australian industries have been located in that State and not one of them has failed. The newsprint industry was established there just as the war started and if it had not been for the production of newsprint in Tasmania the Australian press would not be in its present position.",35
198,Mr WHITE,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Private capital was used.,35
199,Mr FROST,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"That is so, but the Government of Tasmania invested a large sum of money in the project. Zinc smelters were also established in Tasmania, and they require about 70,000 horse-power continuously from the Tasare manian hydroelectric scheme. The fact that cheap hydro-electric power is available in Tasmania is of great importance in connection with the establishment of the aluminium ingot industry there. Tasmania also has adequate waterside facilities for this industry. I understand that Tasmanian bauxite will not necessarily be used exclusively. If it becomes necessary to import bauxite from other States that will be done. Substantial deposits of bauxite are to be found in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia as well as in several parts of Tasmania. The previous Government imported 25,000 tons of bauxite from Malaya.",35
200,Mr FADDEN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,And so prevented the Japanese from getting it !,35
201,Mr FROST,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"But only 25,000 tons of it ! The previous Government, was also prepared to dispose of the Yampi iron ore deposits to Japan. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Eyan) argued that because it was proposed to establish aluminium smelting works in Sumatra we should not establish similar works in Tasmania. I have no sympathy with an inferiority complex of that description. The proposal to manufacture aluminium ingots in Tasmania should be implemented as quickly as possible. The Minister for Munitions (Mr Makin) stated this afternoon that not long ago we had to appeal to householders to make available to the Government all the aluminium that they could spare, and some householders made great sacrifices in that way. Surely we do not desire ever to repeat such an appeal. The purpose of the amendment of the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) is to defeat the bill. There is no need to wait for a Tariff Board report on this project because we know how vital aluminium is to Australia for defence purposes. The honourable member for Flinders remarked that we could not compete with the cheap labour of other countries, but that is an old story. At one time we were told that it would be impossible to produce sugar in Australia by white labour, but, today. the Queensland sugar industry is well established and of immense value to Australia. If Queensland sugar had not been available during the war period a great deal of our f r u it would have been wasted. The Tasmanian Government has already done a great deal to make practicable the establishment of this industry in Tasmania. I congratulate the Premier of Tasmania on his fine work in this connection. The Butler's Gorge hydroelectric scheme which will be capable of generating sufficient power for the aluminium and other industries to be established is nearing completion in spite of all the difficulties associated with the provision of plant and man-power during the war. We should not lightly assume that the war w i ll be over at an early date. It may last for a long time, in which case we shall need aluminium for defence purposes. I am glad that the Government is proceeding with this measure, and I hope that it will result in the establishment of a new industry in Tasmania which will be of immense value not only to that State but to the whole of the southern hemisphere.",35
202,Mr BOWDEN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Gippsland) [ 8 . 5 4 ] agree that aluminium ingots should be manufactured in Australia. I do not agree with the argument that because other countries are establishing the in dustry, we should forgo our rights on the ground that our industry may be uneconomic. Let us make it uneconomic for some other country to establish the industry. The bill has been introduced to ""give effect to an agreement made between the Commonwealth and the State of .Tasmania with respect to the production, for the purposes of defence, of ingot aluminium and for other purposes "". I have no doubt that when this measure was drafted the defence aspect loomed largely in the minds of members of the Government, aud had a great deal more significance than it has today. It is easy to understand .the need for establishing, in association with the production of ingots, an industry for the fabrication of aluminium. That would be necessary to ensure continuity of supply if Australia were deprived of supplies from other sources. At one stage war needs might have justified the immediate establishment of this industry under National Security Begulatiohs, but war needs cannot be regarded as an overriding consideration today. We should therefore consider this proposal now from the point of view of its value in. peace-time. It calls for the same searching investigation and criticism as any other peace-time government enterprise. My inain criticism will be centered on paragraphs j and le of clause 3 of the agreement which appears in the schedule to the bill. These read(j) Ihe commission shall not enter into or be in any way concerned in or a party to or act in concert with any commercial trust or combine but shall always be and remain an independent Australian undertaking; and (k) Other things being equal the commission - shall give preference to goods manufactured in the Commonwealth or its territories when purchasing machinery plant and supplies. i very much doubt whether those conditions wil] be observed in connection with the establishment of this industry, and I base my view on statements made by the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr Beasley) in introducing the bill. - I The honourable gentleman saidBefore embarking upon this project the Commonwealth had the benefit of the advice of leading Australian technicians, who carried out extensive investigations of the production of aluminium in North America and the United Kingdom. Later he addedBoth the Australian Minister in Washington aiid the High Commissioner in London have been asked to make inquiries. The High Commissioner has been in touch with Sir Stafford Cripps, Minister for Aircraft Production in the United Kingdom, with regard to obtaining plant and the services of technical experts. These inquiries are proceeding. I direct attention also to the following statement made by the Premier of Tasmania in reply to observations by Sir Walter LeeThe fixing of the amount of capital had not been quite "" slapdash "". The amount had been recommended by Mr W. S. Robinson, one of the outstanding financial figures of the Commonwealth and adviser to the Government. Mr W . _ S. Robinson is, no doubt, an outstanding authority on finance, but it is significant that neither he nor the technical experts to whom the Minister for Supply and Shipping made reference examined this proposal from the point of view of Australian production and processes, and I have formed the opinion that in their remarks they gave no attention to provisions such as those of paragraphs and k of the agreement, which I have already cited. I read a newspaper report recently to the effect that the Labour party caucus had decided upon two important steps. It gave approval to the proposal to manufacture ingot aluminium in Tasmania, and it then decided that a committee-should be appointed in connection with the matter. I am in agreement with both decisions, but the investigation by a committee of experts should precede the appointment of a commission to establish the industry. In view of those caucus decisions, I was surprised to learn that the Government intended to ask Parliament to pass this bill without delay. One aspect of this matter is of greater national significance than the wording of the bill would lead the public to realise. I do not pretend to be an expert, but I have been able to glean sufficient information to express certain hopes and fears in a manner that can be understood. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) made a slightly different approach to the subject, and cast doubts in another direction. was interested in his referenceto our obligations under the Atlantic Charter. ""We agree that we have certain obligations under that charter, the idea of which is that, as we shall win the war as an association of nations, we can win the peace by a similar association. In certain respects, international co-operation is advantageous. But that applies more to the nations that are fully developed. I apprehend danger in too many international undertakings with nations that are in the process of development, because we might find our internal economy dictated by international boards, which, while understanding our problems, could have only an academic interest in their solution. I wish to address myself to this project purely from the Australian viewpoint. Jealousy between the States in regard to it does not exist. I believe that the logic of the argument in support of cheap power has been recognized. I would merely add that whilst cheap power may be an exception today, it probably will Mr Boirden. be the rule before this industry is out of its swaddling clothes. Therefore, the argument that the industry should be placed in a certain location because of the existence there of cheap power will lose much of its emphasis. We are prone to consider the present too much and the future not enough. I do not disguise the fact that my electorate is vitally concerned in this industry. Nevertheless, I believe that it is willing to approach the matter from an Australian rather than a parochial viewpoint. Its position i« so strong, that it is entitled to demand that the future of the industry shall not be jeopardized by the Government entering into commitments which may prove not only embarrassing but also, probably, stultifying. When dealing with matters of national importance, I do not indulge in what are known as "" wisecracks"". But I say with all respect that this bill, not because of what is in it but because of what has heen left to the imagination, is visible evidence of the fact that, "" The mountain has laboured and brought forth a mouse""; in many respects, an anaemic specimen of mouse; If it be intended as a milestone in Australian development, we must be sure I that it shall not become a milestone on the road to disillusionment. The industry must be established on a purely Australian basis. In order that honourable members may appreciate the difficulties that lie ahead, I shall read a paragraph from a statement relating to the Canadian set-up. It is thisAt Arvida they are already planning for the post-war, for a (production programme that will swamp the world with aluminium goods on a scale undreamed of previously. That is a challenge which has to be accepted, if at all, in the spirit as well as the letter. Around - that production have been built the arguments against the establishment of the industry in Australia. Consequently, I regret that the bill should have been presented as un fait accompli, because, in a sense, this binds the hands of the Government, whereas a full-dress debate by this Parliament would, be consistent with the potential importance of the subject and might produce something much more comprehensive than this measure. Associated with it in its present form are factors which arouse suspicion, and potentialities which must be thoroughly explored before it can 'be accepted as the innocent thing it purports to be. It is said that the object of the bill is merely to ratify an agreement between the Government of Tasmania and the Commonwealth Government. I claim that it does much more than that. Actually, it will be responsible for the establishment of the aluminium industry in Australia, and the foundations that we now lay will determine the strength and character of the undertaking that must necessarily be developed, from it. In short, this acorn from which the' giant oak must grow and flourish. On that account, the bill should be as clear and informative as the prospectus of a proposed public company. The report of the technical experts should bo available to this House. I asked the Minister for Supply and Shipping to produce it during the second reading debate. He refused to do so, but promised that it would be available at the committee stage. I hope that that promise will be kept. Failure to produce the report would suggest that it contains something which the Government would not like the people to learn. I do not suggest that the Government is afraid to produce it. If it be not a confidential document, its production would be helpful to honourable members. ""With prolific production, the provision of markets for what we produce must be an important consideration in the establishment of an industry of this kind. Let us examine the prospects. It is expected that we shall require from 6,000 to 10,000 tons of aluminium annually. sumably, we shall enter into contracts for materials for the processing of that quantity. But it is also believed that we are about to emerge into a light metal era. If so, who is to say that in twenty years' time we shall not want 100,000 tons, or in 50 years' time 300,000 tons? If we do not make a beginning, we shall never have the 300,000 tons when we want it. Because of the uses to which the metal will be put in the future, in the construction of bridges, battleships, the mercantile marine, motOT cars, railway carriages, &c„ no one can say that because we want only 10,000 tons today we shall not want 100,000 tons ten years hence. That is one of the reasons for my insistence that the future as well as the present shall be considered. I regard the matter of time as only relatively important in nation-building; therefore, we must always build for the future as well as for the present. If we are to build for the future in thifl industry, we cannot afford to have national interests hamstrung by being in conflict with the interests of monopolistic enterprises overseas. I hope to be able to show the association between those two, in the control of production. If the is the Minister can prove that I am wrong, I shall be happy to accept the correction. The Commonwealth Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) and the Premier of Tasmania, in a joint statement, saidOn the advice of the great enterprises, it has been decided to establish the industry in Tasmania, mainly because cheap power is available, and power plus raw material is a big factor in the cost of production. I remark here that possibly enterprises are great because they are successful. It is news to me that the executives of such enterprises are in the habit of giving gratuitous advice which is not in some way related to their own interests, particularly to prospective competitors. Apart from that, we have no fault to find with the general reason for the establishment of the industry in Tasmania, except that power represents only from 10 per cent, to 12 per cent, of the cost of manufacture of aluminium. We fully agree that anything which will reduce the cost of production of a peacetime industry is of the greatest importPre- ance. The intrinsic value of war-time industries is not considered to the same degree, and the psychological effect on tae growing generation, whose only experience has been in war-time industries, is to create a false idea of values. The sooner we realise the necessity to relate selling values to production costs, the better will it be for Australia generally. Whilst agreeing that power is a factor which must be considered, we say that the fundamentals in aluminium production are the alumina, the electrodes, and the ingredient named cryolite which transforms the alumina into metal. Cryolite is produced in Greenland, and without it or an effective substitute no country can continue to manufacture aluminium. I ask hon.oraible members to keep that point in mind, because I shall return to it later. In order to emphasize the points that I shall make, I have been permitted by Mr Speaker to illustrate by means of exhibits some of the processes in the manufacture of aluminium. first show to honourable members a sample of bauxite. The next sample-a white substance-is the alumina extract from the bauxite. The third is the finished ingot; and the final sample is the processing material-synthetic an Australian production which has never been investigated by the experts. Its effect is seen in the finished ingot. Thr - e samples are the product of Australian ingenuity. From the raw material to the fabricated ingot they have been processed, from Australian materials, which have not been investigated by the Governinent experts. It would be impossible to have anything purer than this aluminium ingot. The Premier and Attorney-General of Tasmania, in a joint statement, said that the industry would be established on the unshakeable foundation of proven facts, and not on the mere hopes of experimenters. I ask honourable members whether these samples represent proven fact or figments of the imagination. I mention these matters in order to bring out the point that the Australian industry is not being investigated as much as it ought to be. The materials which I have shown to honourable members are the work of these mere experimenters, whose guidance the Government thought it could do without. I contradict the statement, of the honourable member for Denison (Dr Gaha) that no one has attempted to establish an aluminium industry in Australia. The interests to which I have referred made frequent application to the Commonwealth Government for the right to manufacture ingot aluminium in Australia. Their nearest approach to success was during the regime of the Fadden Government, before finality could be reached in the negotiations that government was defeated. Every approach that has been made to the present Government has been negative in result, possibly because the Mr Bnirilm. establishment of the industry would involve the raising of money, about which the Treasurer would have something to say. We are not complaining of that, but we are complaining that those who are experts on Australian conditions have not been consulted. Reference has been I made to a manufacturing plant which might be obtained in England. Why pure is it available? Most probably because it is obsolete. The English process is obsolete so far as Australian conditions are concerned. The Bayer process, which cryolite, was invented.in 1866, is still suitable in England, but it would not he suitable for Australia. That is the opinion of the experts. The Government should go a little deeper into this matter, and see for itself how the work is being done in Australia. tn order to illustrate the cost factor m manufacture, I propose to place before honourable members a further exhibit. This object which I hold in my hand is a miniature model of the furnace in which aluminium is smelted. I have here a carbon electrode of which 1 ton is required for every ton of metal smelted. It will probably have to be imported, though it is possible to make it in Australia. The next sample is the alumina, and in another jar is a sample of cryolite, the essential ingredient which is produced in Greenland, although, as I have explained, there is a. synthetic product, which can be made in Australia, that serves the same purpose. Through the agency of the electrodes, the cryolite becomes a molten mass. The alumina is poured on it, and the effect is that the oxygen is dissipated, and the metal remains at the bottom of the furnace. Four cwt. of cryolite is required for every ton of metal produced. Thus, for every 10,000 tons of aluminium produced in Australia we shall need i0,000 tons of carbon and 2,000 tons of cryolite. If these ingredients, amounting to 12,000 tons, have to be imported, this factor will go a long way but towards dissipating any advantage which we may enjoy from the possession of cheap electric power in Tasmania, Victoria or anywhere else. Cryolite is produced in Greenland, and without it or some acceptable substitute, aluminium cannot be produced. Strangely enough. cryolite, this essential ingredient, is trolled by Alcoa, the Aluminium Corporawidely tion of America. If I may paraphrase a well-known social credit slogan, let me duced say that he who controls the production and distribution of cryolite also controls aluminium the production of aluminium in the bill world. Thus, our production of alumimake aluminium alloy. nium in Australia will not be dictated by our needs, or by the quantity we can but by the quantity of this cryolite which will be made available to us. In other words, we shall be dependent for producMinister tion on the goodwill of our chief petitors. I do not think that there is any escape from that fact. I am waiting to hear this assertion denied-that it is proposed to obtain supplies of cryolite from elsewhere. Thus, my objections to the present posal are, fir3t, that we are too much dependent on overseas supplies of processunderstand ing materials, and that these supplies may easily be cut off in time of. war. Judging from our experience in this it is reasonable to suppose that Australia will be thrown on its own resources a considerably longer period in a future war. Therefore, we should not allow selves to be dependent on overseas supplies of processing materials. I can imagine the Minister saying that the Government has entered into agreements for the supply of necessary materials, but agreements run out and have to be renewed, and this benevolent institution, the nium combine, will insist that the ment, if renewed, shall be to its liking. My second objection is that the bill appears to l i m it the proposal to the duction of aluminium ingots, whereas that I believe that it should provide for fabrication of the ingots. Even if i not intended to use the power, it would be a safeguard to have it included i bill. The third objection is that the bill specifically refers to "" ingot aluminium "". Here I quote the opinion of a metallurgist as follows:-Tuet what is meant by this peculiar phrase '-'ingot aluminium""? Strictly it means pure aluminium. Metallurgical^ this would 99.!)!) per cent, aluminium. Metal of such purity is expensive to produce, and is only in relatively small quantities in commerce. Much aluminium produced is known as 98 per cent, and the balance consists of other metals not necessarily regarded as impurities, conin fact their presence is advantageous and necessary in the. production of most of the used aluminium alloys. Again, much of the widely used aluminium alloys are prodirectly in .the aluminium smelters, and they are very profitable products from the manufacturers' viewpoint, but it is evident from the precise wording of the that the commission is not empowered to The f o u r t h point refers to the fabrication sell, of the aluminium after we have made the ingots. Incidentally, this brings to my mind another matter, about which the for Munitions (Mr M a k in ) commay know something. There has been much talk in the press lately about the fabrication plant which has been established at heavy cost, and this talk leads one to the belief that it may be sold in certain circumstances. The prospective probuyer of such an enterprise must have the money, and the incentive to buy. I that the fabrication of our ingots will be undertaken by a Sydney fir m known as the Australian' Aluminium war, Company. I have no doubt that this is a most estiiuable company, and that it for would do, a good job. However, when we are considering the setting up of an ourAustralian industry, it is our duty to Study the composition of such a f i r m as this, and when we do so we find that only one-third of the shares are held in Australia, whereas one-third are held by thp Aluminium Company of Canada, and alumione-third by the Aluminium Company of agreeEngland. Both the Canadian and Engown lish companies are components of the world aluminium combine. Therefore, I repeat that we appear to be delivering ourselves into the hands of the overseas procombines. The crux of my criticism is without Australian processing the materials our production will be cont were trolled from overseas. There is a provision in the bill for the sale of this n the undertaking. B y a decision of both Houses of Parliament, the enterprise may bo sold, apparently to the exclusion of the equal partner in the enterprise, the Tasmanian Government.",36

204,Mr BOWDEN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I shall leave that point, for consideration by honourable members who represent Tasmanian constituencies. It has beeu proposed that the whole matter be referred to the Tariff Board for investigation. I do not know whether the Tariff Board investigates the economics of proposed industries, and it seems to me that failing such an inquiry by the Tariff Board, an all-party committee of this Parliament should be appointed to make an investigation. I believe that I have raised enough points to warrant an investigation by such a committee. It have power to take public evidence and report to this Parliament. Honourable members would then be in a position to vote with confidence on a measure - which may be destined to play an important part in Australian development.",40
205,Mr BREEN,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"iCalare) [9.30] - 1 support the proposal of the Government to establish the aluminium ingot industry in Australia. I think that the Government is actuated principally by defence needs. The Opposition astutely sidestepped that aspect. It is not surprising that memlbers of the Opposition, particuannounced larly the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies), do not want to canvass the defence aspect of this measure, because, whau this party took office, most industries, particularly the metallurgical dustries, were in such a state that had we not been able to import metals from overseas, our chances of defending this country would have been meagre. I shall not spend much time on that aspect, because I also intend to deal with the economic aspect. ""We had from the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Bowden) a laboratory demonstration of and lecture on the manufacture of aluminium by a process which is obsolete in Great Britain and America, Ibut the American process is not the only process. I have recollections of a similar demonstration in the laboratory of the Sydney Technical College in 1941, when Dr Penfold and Dr Murphy, a clever metallurgist with a European degree and a worldnwide reputation, set up a pilot plant to produce aluminium from Australian bauxite. I admit that he used some imported cryolite, but the Ministry of Munitions display in Sydney contains samples of synthetic cryolite produced by Australian manufacturers. So our dependence on potential competitors for cryolite is not of such great import. It i * no more important than our ability to get magnesium for the manufacture of aluminium alloys. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that the Commonwealth Government should look for information overseas, where success has been made of the commercial manufacture of aluminium. I remind the right honourable gentleman that the President would of the United States of America, Mr. Roosevelt, just before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, had great difficulty in handling the companies that had created a monopoly in the manufacture of aluminium. He was compelled to establish a commission to advise on ways and means of either getting control of those companies or finding a substitute for aluminium in the manufacture of aircraft. The commission concentrated on the production of magnesium, a. lighter metal, as a substitute for aluminium, and, after eighteen months of experimental work, it to the President that' it was prepared to go ahead with the manufacture of magnesium on a commercial scale. 'The difficulties that, I understand, were encountered by the Government of in- the United States of America when it tried to control the operations of the aluminium manufacturing companies arose out of the control of natural deposits of bauxite.. As has been said by the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr Beasley), the principal sources of bauxite for the manufacture in the United States of aluminium are in British and Dutch Guiana. Apparently, the companies had tied up all the leases in those countries and the Government was not able quickly to obtain a lease with a rich deposit of bauxite. We, fortunately, are much more favourably situated, because we have rich deposits of bauxite in practically every State of the Commonwealth. It has been said by the honourable member for Gippsland that we may face difficulties in . the manufacture of - aluminium because some ingredient in the manufacture may be held by a potential competitor. In that case, we shall have to adopt exactly the same tactics as were adopted by the President of the United States of America, who refused to allow his Government to he held in pawn by any private company or international cartel. It was his responsihility to ensure that, if the American people were thrown on their own resources for their defence, they should have at their disx^osal all the elements necessary for that defence. Consequently, he tackledthe big international cartels as we shall have to do. As the manufacture of aluminium is impracticable without cryolite, so aluminium alone will not make us independent in the construction of aircraft. When the American commission evolved ways and means of using the light metal, magnesium, it was found that it was an indispensable associate of aluminium and neither a competitor nor a substitute. Magnesium has certain qualities which made it ideal for blending with aluminium as an alloy, but it cannot act as a substitute for aluminium any more than aluminium can act as a substitute for magnesium, because it must be remembered that magnesium is a war metal which has its own uses. It is used extensively in flares, smoke bombs and fire bombs. It has pyrotechnic qualities. Its ignition point is much lower than that of aluminium, and, if it were used alone to a great degree, it might catch fire and, instead of being a help, it would be a hindlranee in the particular - job that it was designed to It was found that a proper balance had to be kept between the quantities of aluminium and other light metals associated with the construction of aircraft and other munitions of war. The fact that the Government of the United States of America was able to produce sufficient quantities of aluminium from its own resources, plus the fact that it devised ways and means for manufacturing extensive quantities of magnesium, made it independent of the great international cartel. We can place ourselves in the same position, because we do not require tremendous quantities of aluminium, and, if we are precluded from obtaining the natural cryolite, we have the necessary ingredients for the manufacture of synthetic cryolite and the knowledge and technique to do the job. With regard to the prospective market for aluminium in peace-time, some people seem to have the idea that the only use for aluminium is in the construction of aircraft and that because the American demand for aluminium has decreased, the world demand for aluminium will be scant when the war is over. But let us remember this fact. If the United States could afford the man-power to use the scrap aluminium and the surplus aluminium from the war plants for the production of peace-time goods such as kitchen utensils, there would still be a demand for the output of all their factories. In the home, many aluminium utensils are used. Some of them may have holes in them which have been plugged with a screw, rivet or solder. The housewife cannot discard them, because she cannot replace them. Nations at war cannot afford to allocate anan-power for the production of kitchen utensils and the like, but those goods normally represent an enormous proportion of the aluminium trade. More than 50 per cent, of the world's aluminium before the war was used for household purposes. All of that "" slack "" must be taken up and in addition, new and expanding markets will create a big demand. That there will be an avenue for the employment of the surplus aluminium from the war factories is certain. Aluminium will also be required m large quantities in the expansion of the do. use of electricity transmission lines and electrical equipment. I have heen studying the MCGowan Report on the supply of electricity in Great Britain. This is a survey of the present-day problems of the industry, with proposals for the reorganization of electricity distribution. The report stated that about 150,000 tons of steel and 12,000 tons of Scottish aluminium were required for the overhead lines for ""gridding"" England with electrical transmission lines. Thousands of tons of aluminium will be required for a further extension of the "" grid "". When the electrification of railways is extended, all the aluminium produced by factories in Great Britain will not be able to supply the demand. Yet we hear the cry, "" What are you going to do with the surplus aluminium from the war factories, because their capacity is so great? "" I have given the answer. Regarding the cost of production, many "" little Australians"" always decry any attempt to establish a new industry in Australia. I shall not discuss their motives for doing so, but it is known that Australian bauxite, dolomite, and, alunite are as rich as those of any other country. Some of our small deposits are even richer than those which occur elsewhere. At Trundle, in my electorate, this ore occurs on the surface. The question has been asked, "" Can we generate electricity in. Australia as cheaply as it is generated in other countries?"" I have obtained some statistics from an English publication dealing with the supply of electricity in Great Britain. At only 15 out of 241 electrical generating plants examined was the cost per unit, excluding the capital cost, less than .2d. The figure rose to as much as 4d. a unit. Regarding the bulk supply cost, including the amount necessary for overhead and to provide a fair profit, only 13 out of 552 undertakings could produce electricity for less than a unit. The significant point is that England manufactured aluminium, using electrical power at that price. Compared with those figures, the Bunnerong powerhouse in New South Wales, with steam generation, produces electrical power at ,114d. a unit and the cost increases in other undertakings to .117d. a unit. In those circumstances, is it not necessary for us to develop this industry in Australia ? The Minister for Supply and Shipping (Air. Beasley) said ihat the price suggested in Tasmania for hydro-electric generation is .Id. a unit, and stated that every increase of .Id. a unit in the cost of the supply of bulk electricity means the addition of £10 a ton to the cost of the mineral. From those facts honourable members can imagine what the cost of the production of aluminium in England is. We had to start the production of steel under great difficulties, and we experienced several failures before the industry was placed on a commercial basis. We shall be able to produce aluminium in this country more cheaply than Great Britain produces it. The use of aluminium and electricity is tied up as inextricably as the use of air power and land power in war. As we develop electricity transmission, we shall create a new Mr Breen. demand for aluminium. All modern transmission lines contain a big percentage of aluminium. . This metal is used in transformers, and many phases of electrical development. As we proceed with the erection of more electrical power plants in-Australia, it will be our object to supply power to the rural industries. We shall introduce into the manufacture of secondary goods the most economical power unit, namely, electricity. Yet honourable members opposite ask whether there will be a sufficient demand for our aluminium to justify the establishment of the industry in Tasmania! The question of whether it is in the'interests of the country to make the industry a national project, rather than leave it to private enterprise, does not require much consideration when we recall what happened when the United States of America was attacked by Japan. The big international 3d. cartels, which had a large manufacturing plant in America, could not bear to sacrifice any of their commercial interests in the cause of patriotism. I trust that the Government will not be diverted from its purpose, or let any side issues interfere with its decision to make the manufacture of aluminium in Australia an accomplished fact. Having regard to all the information which the Government has at its disposal, I believe that the site for the works in Tasmania could not be improved.

Here, to-night, we have had a little talk about how this proposal will affect Tasmania. One Minister waxed exceedfrom ingly eloquent and extremely red on this subject this evening, in telling us how this industry would benefit Tasmania. From the point of view of the Opposisame tion, that has nothing to do with the subject. The honourable member for affect Gippsland showed clearly that there was no justification whatever for establishing the industry. No proper inquiry has been made. We were told this evening that the decision to establish this industry in Tasmania was made by Senator MCBride while he was in ministerial office, and that it was based on war-time needs. The war has moved considerdates ably in both time and space since then. It is strange, however, that the decision that was made three years ago has not was made. been imolemented long before this. We find that the industry is still in its swaddling clothes, although the Governof ment is reaching middle age. On the decision was made.' average, every government has reached middle age hy the time it has been three years in office. The Minister for Munidoubt tions (Mr Makin) almost wept this afternoon in describing the importance of this industry, yet more than three rate, I hope so. long, weary years have passed and the Government has done next to nothing about it. Not one fact of any consequence has been advanced to demonstrate the need for immediate action to establish, the industry in Tasmania or elsewhere. The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) said that 25,000 tons of bauxite had been imwho ported from Sumatra by the previous Government, but the right honourable gentleman did not state the reason why this done. It was left for the Leader of the Australian Country party to do that, and he told us that in 1940, at a time when I held ministerial office, Australia every scrap of chromium, nickel, it and, in fact, everything else it could buy proved beyond from New Caledonia.",44

212,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"It could polialso be stated that in 1941 we bought from the Netherlands East Indies all available supplies of quinine, rubber and everything else that the authorities there had to sell, in order to prevent the goods passing into the hands of the Japanese. Surely, that was a reasonable thing to do; I am defending the action. I say that the bauxite was bought for the reason, and the fact that it has been lying in Australia ever since does not the issue. I remind the Attorney General that if the decision to establish this industry was made by Senator MCBride it must have heen made after the 27th October, 1940, when I left office, and before the 3rd October, 1941, when the Government with which the right honourable member is associated assumed office. Those are two cardinal which, if the Attorney-General's statement is correct, show the period within which Senator MCBride's decision",44
213,Dr EVATT,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,That is quite correct. The honourable member was not a member the Menzies Government when the,44
214,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,No some decisions that were made by the previous Government have been implemented by this Government; at any,44
215,Mr CATAVELL,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,The Government of which the honourable gentleman was a member was in office for two years and it did nothing to establish this' industry.,44
216,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"My point is that it has taken this Government more than three years to do anything about a decision by Senator MCBride of which it apparently approved. Any snail would be ashamed of such a pace. I propose to direct attention to a few enterprises with which Commonwealth governments have been associated in order to show that they have not achieved anything like the results expected of them. I refer, first, to the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. It was managed by the Commonwealth Government for some time after the war, but as a loss of £320,000 was incurred in a relatively short period, the dockyard was handed back to private enterprise, which not only made it profitable, but, after some time, paid rentals to the Government in respect of the property. I recall, next, a proposal to establish a company known as the NTational Oil Proprietary Limited to exploit the Newnes oil shale deposits. Arguments similar to those used this evening by honourable members opposite in regard to bauxite deposits were used at that time in regard to oil shale deposits. Figures were produced during our debates in 1937 to show that Australian, shale contained a greater percentage of oil than that of any other country in the world. It is well for us to consider what happened on that occasion, for it should influence us in dealing with this bill. With other members of the Australian Country party, of which I was then a member, I opposed that measure and, in so doing, was associated with members of the Labour party. The company was established by the contribution of capital totalling' £167,000 by Mr G. F. Davis of the Davis Gelatine Company, £166,000 by the Government of New South Wales, and £334,000 by the Commonwealth Government. Many concessions were granted to the organization in the form of bounties, remissions of duty on certain oil products and the like. The company contracted to produce 10,000,000 gallons of crude oil per annum. But during a period when this country has desperately needed oil its maximum production has been 2,000,000 gallons per annum, although the Commonwealth Government has sunk huge sums of money in the venture since its inception. The arguments which are being used in opposition to this bill were used-and rightly used-in 1937 by the Labour party to damn the bill to establish the National Oil Proprietary Limited, but now the scene has changed. The Labour party is the dispenser of gifts, the creator of monopolies and the producer of trusts, combines, cartels, and practically everything else which its policy has condemned from beginning to end. Every one knows what is behind this proposal. The name has been used of a gentleman who accompanied the Attorney-General overseas on more than one occasion. Perhaps he is packing his bag to proceed overseas again with the right honourable gentleman.",45
217,Dr EVATT,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,That is a preposterous suggestion.,45
218,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"If there is to be another Robinson Crusoe, it is only right that the aluminium industry should be established on an island. The first ingot produced should be used to press out passes for honourable members for use on the national airways after the interstate airlines have been properly nationalized. I bring to the remembrance of honourable members, now, the circumstances of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. Is there one honourable gentleman who would say that this company has done a single thing for the benefit of the oil consumers of Australia? Although the Commonwealth Government contributed 51 per cent, of the capital of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, we know that the organization is a member of the international oil trust, combine, cartel, or whatever you care_ to call it. Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited is another hybrid in which the Commonwealth holds the majority of shares. It was supposed to devote one-half of its attention to manufacturing, and one-half to international tele-communications, but we all know that it has run counter to government policy during the war, particularly with regard to tele-communications with Japan. Let me remind honourable gentlemen, too, of one of the latest embarkations on enterprises of this description. I refer to the establishment of power alcohol distilleries. No clear statement has been made on this subject on behalf of the Government for a long time. The only actual fact we have is that a power alcohol distillery was established at Warracknabeal, in the electorate of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Wilson) at a time when the Government was dependent upon his vote and the vote of the honourable member for Plenty (Mr Coles).",45
219,Mr BARNARD,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,That was pretty good strategy!,46
220,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,But it is not political strategy that the Government should be considering at this time; it is the welfare of the country.,46
221,Mr HARRISON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"In the sense in which the honourable member for Bass has used the word "" strategy "", it is only another name for bribe.",46
222,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I refer now to the coal-mining industry, concerning which the honourable member for Calare (Mr Breen) had something to say. We have some of the richest coal seams in the world at Newcastle. Yet we are faced with what seems to be an everlasting problem in the shortage of coal. We have no grounds whatever for concluding that happenings in the coal mining industry at Newcastle may not be repeated in the aluminium industry in Tasmania or wherever else it may be established in Australia. If the Government desires this industry to be launched successfully, can it find any brighter lighthouse to steer by than the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited-a n enterprise which the Acting Prime Minister has said recently the Government intends to nationalize? If the Government is sincere in its desire to i'-'fahli?h the aluminium industry let it adopt the pattern of that company. I remind honourable members that when the Governinent desired to establish the aircraft manufacturing industry in Australia it turned to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. In this instance, however, it is adopting the old practice of taking a million or so of the taxpayers' money for experimental purposes. I am not opposed to the establishment of the aluminium industry in Australia, but I say that the Government has not made proper inquiries into the subject. This was proved conclusively by the honourable member for Gippsland. I consider that the amendment of the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) should be agreed to, and I shall support it. An inquiry should be made by the Tariff Board to ascertain whether it would be economic to establish this industry, and whether it is necessary to do so. The facts on the subject should be submitted to us, and we should also seek some advice as to the best location for the industry in order that it may meet, to the fullest possible degree, the defence needs of the country. I question whether that has been done. I do not think that any Minister can assure the Opposition that it has been. Let us consider some of the other international implications. It is all very well to cite the Atlantic Charter, and to talk about the great brotherhood of nations after this war. I do not believe that very much will come of it, because I am too well versed in the history of the world. But I do say that if the Government wished to do something that would wreck certain of our export industries, this would appear to be a very effective method to adopt. I am told that our pre-war imports were almost exclusively of sheet aluminium for manufacturing purposes, and that they came almost wholly from the United Kingdom and Canada. If this industry is established, we shall strike a blow not at the American aluminium industry-whic h the honourable member for Calare (Mr Breen) cited so effectively - bu t at the aluminium industry established in the United Kingdom and Canada. It is only reasonable to suppose that if, in the postwar world, the principle of economic nationalism which was condemned so vigorously before this war broke out, were again to be operated as a national policy by the Commonwealth Government, certain of our export industries would suffer in consequence. This very day, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Forde) introduced a bill to extend the operation of the Wine Export Bounty Act, which deals with a big export, particularly in my State. In the export of dried fruits and wines, we enjoy today a very considerable tariff preference in both the United. Kingdom and Canada. If , without consultation, and without consideration of the ultimate result of the steps we are about to take, we were to injure certain export industries of the United. Kingdom and Canada, it is only reasonable to expect that they would review their attitude in regard to certain of our exports. The whole matter of international trade will resolve the future of the world for ber of years after the present struggle haa terminated. If we are to revert to a position in which every country will act for self-security at all costs, and manufacture everything it wants regardless of cost-as it would appear the Commonwealth Government proposes to do by means of this legislation-then we can expect that sooner or later other countries will show their resentment effectively by proposals aimed at the export industries of Australia. I submit that the Government has not established a case for the passage of the hill. The measure has certain very clear defects, which were exposed fully by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden). Honourable members opposite are not free to say in this House to-night what, they think about the bill. Before it proceeds any further, it ought to go to the only place in which are made decisions of which the Government takes notice; that is, the caucus. Members of the Australian Labour party, many of whom are here for their only term, should take the opportunity of doing the right thing. I notice a smile on the face of the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Fraser). I include him in that observation. I shall name his successor now, if he wants to hear it. These matters are important. The Government cannot argue on the premise of war. The bill has no more to do with the prosecution of the war in which we are engaged than I have to do with the moon. It has been shown that two years will be needed to establish a battery capable of producing ingot aluminium. It is not to be expected that the - Government will make a start until after the new year; therefore, it be 1947, at the earliest, before anything can be done. Meantime, expenditure will be incurred, and decisions will he made in regard to location and the mining of the raw material, which may vitally affect Mr Archie Cameron. the future of the whole concern. If the industry is to be founded- I am not opposed to that-it ought to be after a proper inquiry by competent men, not on a snap decision of the Parliament, dominated by a two-thirds majority of a party which got into by power by accident and has not paid the slightest attention; in detail, to the principles and the implications of what is proposedunder this a num- hastily drafted legislation.",46
223,Mr BARNARD,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Bass) [10.22] - We have heard a most remarkable speech by the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron), who said very little about aluminium, but took us for a cruise around Cockatoo Island Dockyard and other enterprises; and in so doing poured ridicule on this project, entirely ignoring all Government undertakings which, established on a competitive basis and operating on world markets, are doing a very valuable service for this country. I instance the Commonwealth Serum Laboratory, of which the honourable member may have soine knowledge. The bill has inspired some good speeches, in which I include the speech of the honourable member for Calare, (Mr Breen), who, I consider, effectively answered' the argument of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden). Fundamentally, the opposition to this mea'sure arises from the fact that the project is to be undertaken by the Governments of the Commonwealth and Tasmania. It is all very well to disclaim opposition to the establishment of the aluminium industry. Had there been no opposition to it, the parties which now occupy the Opposition benches could have taken action in regard to it long ago. The Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), and others, have said that the matter ought, to be referred to the Tariff Board, on the ground that it has not been sufficiently investigated. In my view, that is one ""of the ""red herrings"" will that are being drawn across the trail. Any old stick will do to beat a dog. In this instance, the dog is represented by the aluminium industry. The prospects of. this industry have been carefully investigated not only by Ministers, but also by executive officers of the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments. It is significant that even that most conservative body, the Legislative Council of Tasmania, has approved the expenditure of money on this project. It may be well to study the background of aluminium production throughout the world. Aluminium is now a commodity of major importance, yet it is only a little over 50 years since it was a laboratory curiosity. The growth of the use of this metal in that short period is without parallel in the records of modern industry. The cheap and efficient production of aluminium is a matter of consequence in the economy of industrial nations. A considerable number of resources and materials are involved in its manufacture, and upon their proper organization depends the success or failure of this important, industry, and its subsidiaries. An efficient Australian aluminium industry, capable of meeting the demands of war, is acknowledged in many quarters as a necessity, whilst the Tasmanian resources and environment are eminently suitable for economical and successful operation. In time of peace, as well as in time of war, Australia should be made as self-sufficient as possible in supplies of this important metal. Since its advent as a commercial metal in 1890 aluminium has been in great demand, despite the extraordinary increases of the world production of this metal. During the last war the production of aluminium increased by about 200 per cent, compared with the 1914 output. At the end of the war large stocks of the metal were on hand, but the demand, for it was so great that in 1921 - the year of the bottom of the postwar slump-productio n was appreciably higher than in 1914. The world production of aluminium in 1914 was 69,000 tons; by 1921 it had reached 75,000 tons. Although the consumption of this metal declined between 1929 and 1933, that decline was not comparable with the falling off of consumption of other basic metals. During the five years 1925-29, prior to the depression, the average annual world production, of aluminium amount to 223,500 tons. During the five year period from 1930 to 1934-the depression years--the average annual world production of aluminium was 189,000' tons, a reduction of 16 per cent. During the same period the world production of copper was reduced by 20 per cent, under an international agreement. Owing to its many qualities, aluminium, including alloys with other metals, has many uses. It is flexible and light, and has high electrical conductivity, and so new uses for it are continually being found until today it has 260 distinct major uses. During my recent trip abroad I had the privilege of learning a good deal of the uses of aluminium in other countries. It is interesting to note that in Canada and the United States of America aluminium is being used in large quantities to replace steel in the construction of bridges. Aluminium has been used to replace steel decking girders on a bridge at Pittsburgh. It is considered that after the war aluminium will capture 2 per cent, of the uses of steel for heavy industry purposes. Indeed, the possibilities of the greater use of this metal are almost limitless. I foresee the time when there will be such a demand for it that our output will not cope with it. I regard as pessimists those who are not prepared to face realities and world trends in the use of this metal. Aluminium is continually entering new fields, its development having coincided with an increased demand for lighter materials, particularly for air transport and for heavy moving parts. It is reliably reported in the United States of America that aluminium is - being extensively used in the manufacture of railway equipment and that several complete trains of aluminium alloys have been fabricated. Moving bridges, lock gates, and heavy moving cranes are also being built of aluminium alloys, and, as I have stated, its high electrical conductivity has led to its being increasingly used for the manufacture of electrical cables in place of heavier and more corrodable copper cables. That aspect of the use of this material was enlarged upon by the honourable member for Calare (Mr Breen) in his excellent contribution to this debate. The aircraft and automobile industries use aluminium in large quantities, and more recently shipbuilding and other transport industries have followed their example. At the moment, it is impossible to forecast any diminution of the number of new uses for this metal. With a lowering of the price, following increased production, aluminium is becoming a strong competitor of steels, bronzes and brasses. In the light of experience and the certain expansion of the field of uses for aluminium there should be little fear that any wartime surpluses will not be readily sought by manufacturers in peace-time. The use of aluminium in Australia has closely followed world trends. As in other countries, the consumption in Australia has grown considerably during the war. Whereas in 1919-20 only 36 tons of aluminium was imported into Australia, by 1938-39 the quantity imported had increased to 1,320 tons. A survey of postwar requirements which was recently made by Commonwealth officers indicates that provision should be made for an annual consumption of 6,000 tons of aluminium. In his second-reading speech on this bill the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr Beasley) said: "" The indications are that this will be greatly increased during the time required to construct and bring our plan into full production"". Tasmania possesses many advantages for the production of aluminium, advantages which are not completely shared by any other State. Every ton of aluminium ingots produced requires 4 horse-power of electrical power, and therefore a unit for the production of 10,000 tons of ingot per annum would require 40,000 horsepower. This power will be available in Tasmania at a price comparable with that which applies to the large aluminium plants in Canada and the United States of America. Nowhere else in Australia is there sufficient power available for this purpose at the present time, nor could it be supplied at anything like a comparable price. The effect which the price of electricity has upon the economics of this industry may be gathered from the fact that each .Id. a unit means an addition of approximately £10 a ton to the cost of the metal. With the inevitable expansion of the industry and its subsidiary undertakings more electrical power will be required. As there is no other State in the Commonwealth possessing the potential hydro-electric power resources of Tasmania, its choice Mr Barnard. for the major electrolytic operations of the industry cannot be questioned if a long-range policy is adopted. The raw materials are available in substantial quantities in most parts of the State. Both in the north and south of the island, there are bauxite deposits in close proximity to deep-water ports. There are also ample supplies of water and of electric power. If it is decided to use Victorian, bauxite it can be conveyed by sea and unloaded at a deep-water port in northern Tasmania. These are natural advantages enjoyed 'by Tasmania, and they should be taken into consideration. We should avail ourselves fully of the advantages with which Nature has endowed the country. During his speech this afternoon, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) referred to the manufacture of aluminium as an essentially North American industry. As a matter of fact, the industry is not by any means confined to North America. The importance of aluminium has caused practically every country possessing a heavy engineering industry to make some provision for its production. Prior to the war there were plants in the following countries:-Unite d States of America, Canada, France, Germany, .Switzerland, Austria, Great Britain, Norway, Italy, Russia, India, Japan and Hungary. It is significant that several of the plants had a much smaller reported pre-war capacity than the one at present under consideration for the Commonwealth, namely, 10,000 tons a year. Eor example, the Austrian plant had a capacity for the production of 2,100 tons a year and the Japanese plant of 4,000 tons a year. The Indian and Hungarian plants were even smaller. Whilst some of these industries did receive government assistance, it is known that others, including the Indian undertaking, are solely commercial concerns. It would appear that provided the cost of electrical power is comparable with that available in other producing countries, there is a favourable background for the economic production of aluminium in the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Ryan) argued that it would be better to build up an aluminium stock-pile than to establish an industry here for the manufacture of aluminium. With this I disagree. In view of the Commonwealth's experiences during the past three years nobody could consider as at all adequate a stock-pile of less than 20,000 tons of metal. This would he almost a dangerous minimum. Even if this quantity of metal were obtained at the very low price of £75 a ton, that is, £20 less than the 1939 price, it would cost £1,500,000, or half the estimated cost of the new industry when it is fully developed. Storage, interest and insurance charges on such a stock-pile may b"" conservatively estimated at £60,000 a year. While the Commonwealth is dependent upon overseas supplies of metal it is subject to price arrangements quite beyond its control. In spite of the fact that the Government invested £1,000,000 in the new aluminium plant at Arvida, Canada, in company with the United Kingdom and Canadian Governments, it is at the mercy of price fixing by cartel. The base price to Australia was fixed at 17 cents a pound, but owing to the existence of a special clause in the agreement under which a premium may he fixed on the cost of production, the price was raised to 21 cents for the first three months of 1944. This rise of price to Australia coincided with a reduction of price to Canada and the United States of America - I It might well be impossible to add to a stock-pile from overseas sources after the outbreak of war. In spite of arrangeno ments made for supplies of Canadian aluminium during this war it was reliably stated by the Director of the Department of Aircraft Production, that at times there were only two to three weeks' supply of aluminium in the Commonwealth. The shortage became so acute that a drive for the surrender of pots and pans and scrap aluminium had to be instituted. A local plant can be designed to enable production to be rapidly increased, Ibut it is not possible to keep replenishing a stock-pile from distant overseas sources. We must remember that the advent of the flying bomlb has made the destruction of the American aluminium plants a future possibility. The bauxite industry was established in 1922, and was used for the manufacture of chemicals such as aluminium sulphate and alum. This industry received considerable protection from the Scullin Government, which enabled it to extend and supply the whole of Australia's demands. When the Ottawa Agreement was entered into, the tariff on this particular industry was slashed by the Bruce-Page Government, of which the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) was then the Minister for Trade and Customs. But for the strength the industry developed under the protection granted by the Scullin Government, investigation into Australian bauxite reserves would not have been possible. Therefore, the argument of the honourable member falls to the ground. I support the bill. I hope that it will be passed, and the Government thus enabled to proceed with its plans for the establishment of this industry. Like many other industries, this will probably have its. teething troubles; but so long as the Government resolutely tackles the problem, the people will eventually come to appreciate the Government's initiative in undertaking this venture, just as they now appreciate its establishment of other industries which are operating to the great advantage of the nation.",47
224,Mr HARRISON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Wentworth) [10.46]. am not surprised at the poor standard of the speeches delivered by supporters of the Government on this measure. Honourable members opposite have been given facts on which to base their support of this project. The Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr Beasley) in his second-reading speech dealt only in broad generalities. He gave no indication as to how the industry was to be established and run, or of the cost involved. It is true that the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt*) came into bat very late in the innings, and endeavoured to recover the position for the Government by giving facts and figures, which, however, were obviously hastily compiled by departmental officers and did not convince the Attorney-General himself when he was reading them. He dealt first with the economic possibilities of this industry. He dealt at length with the volume of electric power that would be required to produce aluminium ingots. However, after going to considerable pains to emphasize that point he said, that, of course, unpredictable factors might arise with the result that the original estimated cost of £3,000,000 might be exceeded. In that statement he is quite correct, because the establishment of an ingot industry is not the last cost in the production of sheet aluminium. In order to develop this industry on a worth-while scale, the ingot aluminium will have to be rolled into various thicknesses to meet the requirements of the market available. This means that existing rolling mills will have to be expanded. Therefore, the establishment of this industry will involve considerable cost in adapting existing rolling plant. Further evidence that the main concern of the Attorney General was to endeavour to give some information to.the House upon which supporters of the Government could fasten their teeth was his statement that the Government had been offered the choice of a 5,000-ton or a 10,000-ton. plant from the United Kingdom. He explained that both plants had already been in use, but he could not say at the moment which of them would be required. Tho fact is that the Government does not know its mind in the matter. It does not know exactly where it is heading, or on what basis the industry should be established. I should like to know how the United Kingdom at the moment can offer to the Government the choice of plants mentioned. Is it because there is a surplus of production at present in the United Kingdom and these plants are being closed down, or is it simply a case of the United Kingdom selling a gold brick to this country which has barely cut its industrial teeth? If aluminium is in short supply, and is urgently required in countries situated much nearer than Australia to the theatres of war, how can the United Kingdom offer this choice of plants to Australia?",50
225,Mr CALWELL,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Because this industry is necessary to the defence of Australia now and in the future.,51
226,Mr HARRISON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"This proposal has nothing whatever to do with our war effort. The Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) knows very well that the industry will not come into product-ion for at least two years. The facts placed before the House speak for themselves; and, obviously, it is simply a case of the Government indulging in a gamble with £3,000,000 of the taxpayers' money. The Attorney General failed miserably to recover the position in this debate for the Government, because the proposal was just as clouded when he resumed his seat as it, was when he rose to speak. I shall support the amendment and oppose the bill, because I believe that the Government is indulging in a great gamble at the taxpayers' expense with money which could be better used for post-war purposes, and which would readily be subscribed by the people by way of loan for such purposes. This gamble is doomed to failure. The debate has been somewhat illuminating. We know that during the last election campaign the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr Beasley) paid a hurried visit to Hobart, and, in order to entice Tasmanian voters to support the Government, promised expenditure of this sum for the establishment of this industry. We know that he promised Tasmania a £3,000,000 industry if the Government were returned to power. We know also that the Attorney-General went to Tasmania in an effort to convince the unconvincible Upper House in that State that it should pass the "" powers "" bill. He reduced the £3,000,000 to £1,500,000. Why is this bill introduced at this juncture? Is it because the Government is trying to honour a promise of a bribe to the people of Tasmania or because it is afraid its socialization programme, including the nationalization of hanking, has caused adverse comment in Tasmania and hopes by this measure to retrieve the position before the next general elections, which, I am inclined to think, will not be far away. Alternatively, is it to bring another Government-controlled business into being as a part of the plan of nationalization of industry. Is the Government saying: "" Here is something which private enterprise may establish as an industry and we are getting in first"" ? The Government should make it clear whether this measure is a part of its Socialist programme or the honouring of its promise of a bribe. It is apparent to thoughtful people all over the world that, for a long time after the war, the resources of the world will need to be economically distributed. Indeed, the Atlantic Charter is based on that principle. That distribution will the effected by the three known methods of negotiations, trades agreement, and the interdependence of the Allied Nations. It can be established that there is surplus production of aluminium and insufficient demand, regardless of what new markets are found. How can the economic resources of the world be distributed if an industry is developed in another country to expand the surplus? That applies to any commodity. How can Australia hope for trade agreements if we enter into the production of an already surplus commodity? The Government is placing the country in an absurd position on the eve of the close of a world war when there must be complete economic interdependence between countries in world trade. To prove the truth of my argument, we must examine the position of this industry. It has been necessary for honourable members to obtain the information they need to make an intelligent contribution to this debate from sources other than the Government. I have looked in vain at the second-reading speech of the Minister, and I have listened in patience to other speeches of honourable members opposite without gleaning one bit of information in that respect. But that information is available and the Government should have transmitted it to the House. In the last quarter of 1943, production of aluminium in the United States of America exceeded consumption by 40,000,000 lb. a month. Production of aluminium has exceeded consumption to such a degree that it has been used for extraordinary purposes in an effort to get rid of it. For instance, the Allies used 100,000,000 lb. of aluminium as landing mates on beaches, a use never contemplated in the early days of war. Moreover, in an effort to restrict production in the United 'States of America, fifteen production lines have been closed. The subject is worthy of the very closest attention in post-war planning. Owing to the war, the output of the aluminium industry has been expanded by about 1,500,000 tons. Honourable members must pause when they hear figures of such magnitude. It is proposed that this country should produce 5,000 or 10,000 tons a year of a commodity, the monthly production of which is already 40,000,000 lib. a month above requirements. When the war ends, there will be immense quantities of scrap aluminium which will have to be used in the manufacture of household commodities, to say nothing of unused aluminium. I listened with considerable interest to the speech of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard) who stated that girders could be manufactured from aluminium. Of course, some people are endeavouring to find uses for aluminium, because they have such huge surpluses of this metal that they must use it in some way. At present they are using it for wall decoration, hat linings, insulators and a multiplicity of other things. But every new venture in this respect means that the use of some other metal or material will be reduced. I have already dealt with the great gamble in which the Government is indulging by investing over £1,000,000 in the aluminium ingot industry. The Government, which has heavy commitments in the conduct of the war, for social services and in post-war planning, cannot afford to waste money. It has no right to waste £1,500,000 of the taxpayers' money in a venture of this nature.",51
227,Mr MULCAHY,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,Who said that it will be wasted ?,52
228,Mr HARRISON,WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"It will be wasted, because the Government does not know what the proposal involves. It has not told the House how it proposes to develop this scheme, or given an estimate of costs. The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) even admitted that the Government does not yet know whether the industry will require a plant to manufacture 5,000 tons or 10,000 tons, or the best process for the production of aluminium. In fact, the Government is in an extraordinary position. Even the commission, which it appointed to control the industry, knows nothing about the subject. The Government is groping in the dark. To liquidate an obligation, it is prepared to pay £1,500,000 "" on the blind "". If the Government sincerely desired to obtain information upon the advisability of starting this industry, it could avail itself of the' means already at its disposal. Honourable members know that the Tariff Board has been used extensively by governments to advise them upon the establishment of new industries, and to recommend increases or decreases of the tariff. When the Acting Prime Minister was in Opposition, he pleaded with the Government, of which I was a member, to obtain from the Tariff Board a report upon every proposed new industry. If he had so much confidence in the Tariff Board then, the Government should see that an impartial inquiry is made into the economics of this proposed industry. The Tariff Board can take evidence for and against the proposal, examine the whole of the facts, and advise upon the importance of the industry from the stand-point of defence. If the Tariff Board were to report favourably upon the proposal, the Opposition would not resist the passage of the bill. But the Government is not prepared to risk a reference to the Tariff Board. 1 direct attention to the annual report of the board for the year 1939-40. Under the title of ""Expansion of Industries under War and Post-war Conditions"", the following illuminating paragraph occurs:Expansion in the industrial field is highly desirable, and to be encouraged so long as it proceeds on sound lines. There is, however, always the danger that the protection afforded by the factors mentioned may result in the starting of industries which would have little or no prospect of surviving when the existing state of affairs has passed. That paragraph should apply to this particular industry. The Government knows perfectly well that an impartial tribunal, like the Tariff Board, acting upon those opinions, could not report other than adversely upon this proposal. Therefore, the Government is not prepared to take the risk of referring the matter to the board. The report continuesIndustries which it is proposed to establish during the war and proposed extensions of existing industries could be examined by the board with a view to their being classified into three classes(o) Those which are desirable for permanent establishment in Australia and which should be assured of reasonable and adequate protection after the war. Is it under that heading that the Government proposes to establish the aluminium ingot industry? The Tariff Board should Mr Harrison. first inquire into the economics of this proposal, because I believe the Government, by venturing into this field, will throw into the gutter £1,500,000 of the taxpayers' money. The report proceeds(6) Those undesirable for permanent establishment in Australia but desirable to meet the temporary exigencies of the war. These industries would be those to which the Government might consider giving reasonable assistance in liquidation at the close of the war if such assistance be justified. As Ministers have claimed that this industry should be established for defence purposes, the Tariff Board could inquire into the proposal under that heading. But does the Government propose to invite the Tariff Board to make the investigation? Of course not! Ministers know that the industry which they are sponsoring will not be capable of supporting itself. They know that this proposal is designed purely for the purpose of satisfying electors whose votes they have bought. They cannot justify their action. The report proceeds(c) Industries not coming within (a) or (6) and which should receive no consideration or assistance from the Government That is the category in which this industry should be placed. No valid argument can be adduced to support the contention that this bill should be proceeded with. I shall oppose the measure, and support the amendment. My reasons for doing so are, first, that no information has been given to the House to permit honourable members to make a fair and reasoned decision upon the proposal. Ministers have dissembled, contradicted earlier statements and been guilty of evasions. They declared that this industry was required for defence purposes, but when challenged they became evasive. From the beginning of the debate, honourable members opposite have followed the Government blindly. My second reason for opposing the bill is that I disagree entirely with the principle of government-controlled industry, regardless of the nature of the industry, because I believe that when the dead hand of government impresses itself upon an industry, we find decay and disintegration and every malpractice that may be associated with political preferment. In that way one finds a complete wastage of the taxpayers' money. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) furnished a classical example when he pointed to undertakings partly controlled by the Government which are part of great cartels and monopolies now operating. Yet the Government is sponsoring an undertaking which, as the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr . Bowden) has pointed out, would not be able to produce 1 ton of aluminium without going cap in hand to that great combine, the Aluminium Company of America, for one of many essential fluxes. I believe that the industry has been conceived in an atmosphere of chicanery and intrigue. On the eve of the last general elections, a promise was made in Hobart by the Minister for Supply and Shipping' to provide £3,000,000 for the establishment of the industry, and, on the eve of the recent referendum, the Attorney-General wrote that sum down by 50 per cent., and made an agreement for the provision of £1,500,000. Those facts lead me to believe that the scheme was conceived in an atmosphere of chicanery and intrigue. Why should the Government gamble on this post-war project? New metals will be found in the post-war years. I believe that the three-ply structure of a Mosquito bomber is a development in aircraft manufacture that will be adapted to an extraordinary degree after the war. Not only will new metals be found, but plastics will come into their own. Many articles now being made of aluminium will be manufactured in the post-war years from plastics. Therefore, the Government should not gamble on the use of . a metal of which there is a huge surplus throughout the world. If it be essential for Australia to have the aluminium necessary to build its own aeroplanes, I suggest that £3,000,000 could be expended to better advantage in the purchase of aluminium ingots which could be held in reserve. That would be preferable to opening up a huge drain through which the taxpayers' money will u l t i mately be poured, leaving to a subsequent government the task of cleaning up the mess and restoring the position.

LAZZARINI - This matter comes under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Labour and National Service, who will supply the desired information as soon as possible.",54
232,Mr SCULLY,AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION,"On the 16th November, 1944, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Williams) asked me a question, without notice, relative to stocks of olive oil held in bond in Sydney. I am now in a position to in f o rm the honourable member that .action has been taken with a view to specified quantities of olive oil being supplied to certain firms and wholesale druggists in Sydney for medicinal use at prices fixed by the Prices Commissioner. WINE EXPORT BOUNTY .",55
233,Mr FORDE,AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION,"On the 17th ber, ""1944, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) asked the following question, without notice:Does the Government intend to introduce bill this session to extend the operation of Wine Bounty Act which tuqpircs early next year ? This matter has now been considered by Cabinet and I have already given notice of intention to introduce a bill this session which seeks to extend the operation of the Wine Export Bounty Act for a period of two years from the date of expiry, namely, the 28th February, 1945. AUSTRALIAN NOVELS.",55
234,Mr FORDE,AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION,"On the 24th November, 1944, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Sheehan) asked the following question, without notice:I ask the Acting Minister for Trade Customs whether or not permission is now being given for the importation of English American novels? If so, will the honourable gentleman make available supplies of paper for the production in Australia of novels by Australian authors? The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:Books printed in the United Kingdom and exported therefrom are entirely free from import licensing procedure. Import licences may be issued to cover the importation of certain novels from non-sterling countries within the limits of monetary quotas established by importers on the basis of importations of books from non-sterling sources during the year ended the 30th June, 1930. Licences may not be granted, however, for the types of novels known as westerns, detectives, crime and light romance or fiction in paper-covered editions. The specific diversion of paper for the printing'of a novel is contingent upon sponsorship being accorded by the Book Sponsorship Committee. In other circumEDIBLE OILS . stances, the responsibility for finding paper must rest with the printer or publisher. COMMUNISM.",55
235,Mr FORDE,AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION,"On the 17 th November, 1944, the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) asked the following question, without notice:In the absence of the Minister for Labour and National Service, I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he has received any protest from members of trade unions regarding dangerous Communist influence in those unions, and requesting that the Commonwealth Government take action to support the proposals of Mr Mullens, a Labour member of the Victorian Parliament, that there should be Novemcompulsory voting for trade union officials, that all safeguards exercised in the conduct of Commonwealth and State elections should he observed, and that the vicious practice by which ballot-papers are handed out by shop a stewards should be abolished? Does the Go the vernment intend to heed that protest, or introduce legislation to ensure that Communist control is purged from the trade unions? Representations both for and against Mr Mullens's proposals have been received. It is not the policy of the Government to interfere in the domestic affairs of trade unions or other similar associations. Unions which are registered with the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration must submit their rules to the registrar. These must be in accord with certain broadly defined principle^, and under the law as it now stands the registrar could not force a union to adopt and Mr Mullens's suggestion unless the union and itself was willing to incorporate the appropriate provisions in its rules. The Commonwealth body which controls nil national trade union matters is the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and the State controlling bodies are the Trades and Labour Councils of six States. In all, they have 1,205,000 members, of which 1,020,000 are registered in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Before registration can be granted, union's rules must be submitted to and passed by the Registrar of the Court, and any alterations or amendments to such rules must be endorsed, if registration is to be continued. CHILDREN'S FOOTWEAR.",55
236,Mr FORDE,AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION,"On the 15th November, 1944, the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Sheehy) asked, without notice, whether I would consider permitting bootmakers to work overtime in boot factories in view of the shortage of children's footwear in South Australia. I have had investigations made and furnish the following information: My department is not preventing the working of overtime, but on the contrary it has been the policy of the Director-General of Man Power to encourage the working of a reasonable amount of overtime where this is necessary to maintain or increase essential production. In the present instance negotiations have been carried on between employers and employees for the working of overtime, and the Man Power Directorate has been making strenuous efforts to increase the supply of female labour to the industry. The problem appears to have been aggravated by a shortage of leather and some lack of co-operation between the retailers and the manufacturer.'. The matter has been taken up with the Controller of Leather and Footwear, and all possible steps will be taken to alleviate the position. INTERSTATE RAIL TRANSPORT: USE OF SLEEPING BERTHS.",56
237,Mr WARD,AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION,"On the 21st September, 1944, Sir Frederick Stewart asked the Minister for Transport the following question, without notice:Has the attention of the Minister for port been drawn to the annual report of the Railway Commissioner of New South Wales, where it is stated that last year there were 35,000 unused sleeping berths between Sydney and Melbourne, a loss which the Commissioner has attributed to what he has termed "" restrictive and irksome federal regulations""? Can the honourable gentleman give the assurance that these regulations now have been modified ? I have examined the statement made by the honourable member for Parramatta, to the effect that 35,000 sleeping berths were unused between Sydney and Melbourne during the year covered by the New South Wales Railway Commissioner's annual report for the year 1943-44. I find that the statement refers to 315,000 vacant seats and sleeping berths. T have also communicated with the New South Wales Commissioner for Railways, and he has furnished me with the returns from which the figures quoted were calculated. These returns show that the figures represent the vacancies which existed on interstate trains running between Sydney and Albury when the trains actually left the starting pointsSydney or Albury, respectively-and do not make any allowance for intermediate or roadside traffic, for which accommodation is held in accordance with the usual railway practice. Consequently, the figures quoted are not a true reflex of the vacant accommodation on the trains referred to. An examination of the details of the statement furnished discloses that during the twelve months, accommodation - was provided for 62,994 sleeping-berth passengers on the express trains from Sydney to Albury and 910 berths were vacant at the departure of the trains from Sydney. On the express trains from Albury to Sydney, accommodation was provided for 69,986 sleeping-berth passengers and the recorded vacancies on departure from Albury totalled 2,023. It must also be remembered that, in the case of Canberra, accommodation must necessarily be set apart for such passengers, and whilst this is in substantial demand when Parliament is sitting, there are periods when the demand for such accommodation is light, which would account for quite a number of vacancies which are recorded. CanTransberra traffic would be included in the movement from Albury but not in the movement from Sydney. This would account somewhat for the variation in the figures in the "" up "" and "" down"" journeys. With regard to the sitting accommodation, the figures show that in the case of the express trains from Sydney to Albury the accommodation provided for first-class passengers totalled 39,560 seats, of which 7,415 were recorded as vacant at the point of departure. The second-class position on these trains was - accommodatio n provided, 122,867 seats; vacancies, 11,5S6 when the trains departed from Sydney. On the express trains from Albury to Sydney, the information provided shows that sitting accommodation was pro-., vided for 33,3S6 first-class passengers, and that 3,424 seats were vacant at the point of departure. The second-class position on these trains was-accom modation provided, 143,238 seats; vacancies, 9,736 when the trains departed from Albury. The position in regard to all accommodation provided, both sleeping and sitting car passengers, from Sydney to Albury is-accommodatio n provided, 225,421 passengers; vacancies, 19,911 provided for ""intermediate passengers. The position in regard to the total accommodation provided from Albury to Sydney is-accommodatio n provided, 246,610; vacancies, 15,183 provided for intermediate passengers. Thesefiguresindicate to me ing for intermediate or roadside pick-ups, much of this accommodation would be used from a point other than the commencing point of the trains, but having regard to the fluctuation of traffic, cellations, &c, there must of necessity be some vacant accommodation. The allegation that empty seats on interstate railway trains resulted from the priority system, which was made previously, was taken up by me at the time, and a statement was submitted to this House on the 21st March last. It was pointed out that an actual test of the loading on interstate trains between capital cities, both from the starting point and throughout the journey, had demonstrated that the figures taken at the starting point of the train were not a fair indication of the true position. There is no justification for the statement that the priority system is responsible for the non-use of seats which could be used by passengers who are refused permits for travel. My investigations, and the figures given "" herein, prove beyond doubt that there is no ground for the assertions which are made from time to time. I wish to again assure members of this House that the priority system has been and will continue to be eased to the fullest extent justified by the requirements of the day, but it must be remembered that whilst the .question asked by the honourable member is based on the period for the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1944, since that date, owing to the shortage of coal supplies, it has been necessary for the interstate passenger train services to be reduced by approximately 50 per cent., with the total elimination of sleeping-berth accommodation. This position will be reviewed immediately the miners' Christmas holidays are over, and as soon as the railway coal position warrants any easing of the conditions of travel appropriate action will be taken. TAX AGENTS IN NORTHERN TERRITORY. Air. CHIFLEY - On the 24th November, 1944, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) asked the that, allowTreasurer, upon notice I. How many tax agents are registered in the Northern Territory? 2. What are their names and addresses? 3. If none has heen registered, how many canapplications have been rejected? 4. Tn view of the special circumstances of the Territory, will he instruct his officers to cease threatening people in the Territory with legal proceedings because they assist others who would otherwise be incapable of filling in a taxation return to comply with the law? The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. No resident of the Northern Territory is registered as a tax agent, but several tax agents registered in the various States, particularly in South Australia, attend to the taxation affairs of clients resident in the Northern Territory. Tliere is, however, one tax agent resident in the Northern Territory who has been exempted from .the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act requiring the registration of tax agents. 2. See answer to No. 1. 3. One. 4. The threat mentioned presumably refers to communications from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, Northern Territory, to a person who is carrying on business as a tax agent in the Territory but who has been refused registration by the Tax Agents Board. Those communications, however, merely drew the attention, of this person to the relevant provisions of the act and informed him that, if any infringement of these provisions occurred, it would be necessary to enforae the act. The Commissioner of Taxation is obliged to give effect to the income tax laws and cannot withhold their application in any particular case. INCOME TAX (WAR-TIME ARRANGEMENTS) Mr HOI.T asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. What has been the amount of revenue collected under the Income Tax (War-time Arrangements) Act from each of the States for each of the years 1941-42 to 1943-44 inclusive T 2.
