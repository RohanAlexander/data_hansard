1,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister read a paragraph in this morning's Age, purporting to have been telegraphed from Adelaide, in which it is announced that the Premier of South Ausfraliaj in introducing into the House of Assembly proposals for a progressive land taxwarned opponents that if they did not accept the State proposals, the Commonwealth Parliament would come along and {nake the tax heavier. Was there any warrant for that statement? Is the introduction of land taxation part of the policy of this Government?",11
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Premier of South Australia has not done me the favour to inquire, either my personal views, or the intentions of the Government on this subject. His remarks can therefore be regarded only as such a forecast as every one is entitled to make. Mr ""REID - Will! - the Prime Minister answer the concluding question put to him by the honourable member for Cowper, as to whether the introduction of land taxation forms part of the policy of the Government? That is a matter upon which be may have some knowledge.",11
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ha d I continued my reply, I should have said that any change in the incidence of taxation or proposals for the imposition of. new taxation would be too important to be broached in an offhand answer to a question without notice. It was made plain at the last election that the Government did not intend to propose a land tax during the existence of this Parliament. What will be proposed to the next Parliament will depend entirely upon the necessities of the country at the time. CONTROL OF THE PACIFIC.",11
4,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister read the statements which recently appeared in the newspapers to the effect that Japan desires to confer with the great powers regarding the control of the Pacific ? In the event of such a conference, will the honourable and learned gentleman take care that Australia is represented?",12
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"So much in the daily press is mere speculation that Ministers give it only the casual attention it receives from other honourable members. I have not hitherto regarded these suggestions as serious, though' they may be intended to pave the way for a conference. Until a definite proposal has been made, it would be premature to express an opinion. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) agreed toThat the House at its rising adjourn until Tuesday next at 3 o'clock p.m., or such time thereafter as Mr Speaker may take the Chair. TEMPORARY TELEGRAPHISTS : WESTERN AUSTRALIA - 1. Yes.",12
6,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,the Minister reof the presenting the Minister of Home Affairs upon noticer. Is it a fact that temporary telegraphists are employed in Western Australia at 7s. per day? 2. Does the Public Service Commissioner regard this as a fair wage for skilled labour of this class?,12
7,Mr HUMECOOK,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions' these1. One is so employed. 2. The wages are governed by the class of wprk to be performed' and the ability of the employed Temporary telegraphists are usually started at 7s. per day. until their competency .is proved, when, if the work warrants it , the pay is increased.

8,Mr MCDOUGALL,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"the Prime Minister upon notice- T. Whether his attention' has been drawn to the following - paragraph in the Age :--- . 11 Mr Dannevig said he had made some calculations on the subject of the price of fish. He found it cost the fishermen about 23. t^d. a box to get the fish to town. It was sold in the market at about 113. 6d., out of which the fishermen, got 7s. 6d. The agents' commissions and market dues amounted to is. 4d. and is. 6d. The fishermen got about 58 per cent, of the wholesale price of the fish, but they did not get 58 per cent, of the public price. As a matter of fact, the fishermen got about l i d . per lb. as net return. Out of that he had to maintain his boatsand nets, and to live. The public paid from 8d. to is. per lb. for the same fish. This money was absorbed"" to a small extent by conveyance; but it was mainly commission and profits of agents and middlemen."" Also, "" that the market was not allowed to become cheap at'any time to the public, while the fishermen did not get the benefit of the high prices"" ? r 2. If he has seen the paragraph referred to, will he say if it is the intention of the Commonwealth Government to develop the fishingindustry by duties and bounties? 3. Is it the policy of the Government to develop industries, in a general sense, in order (o- maintain middlemen between the producers and* the consumers? 4.

12,Mr KELLY,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"the Minister of fence, upon notice I. Is it not a fact that the Union Jack hauled down at all Australian forts and Australian Ensign substituted for it under amendment of the regulations which he made last session? 2Is it not a fact that, on representations so. made by members of the Opposition that the Union Jack was symbolical of the union British peoples throughout the world, he agreed to instruct his officers to hoist the Union and the Australian Ensign side by Australian forts? 3. Have not these flags since been by side in all Australian forts? 4. Have the regulations yet been altered to legalize the use of the Union Jack in our forts? 5. If not, why not?",13
13,Mr EWING,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"The honourable memGazette ber's suggestion, that the Union Jack has been "" hauled down"" anywhere in Australia-, is misleading, since tralian ensign itself consists of the Jack with the Southern Cross There has never been a proposal to omit the Jack. All parts of the Empire use flags which include the Jack, and distinctive local sjmbols. Each the Commonwealth has a similar flag. Last year the practices prevailing in the States were harmonized by authorizing the Sydney, owing display of the Australian ensign, as the official flag, upon our forts, in the same way as it has been flown on our vessels and public institutions. The Union bolizes the union of the countries which make up the United Kingdom, and, as creasing used in the Australian ensign, the union of the Mother Country with the people of the against Commonwealth. No regulations were reby quired to legalize the use of the Auswork tralian ensign, which is flown, as are the Other ensigns of the Empire, with the mail-matter King's sanction.

In Committee of Supply: Debate resumed from 29th October (vide page 1758) on rhotion by Sir WILLIAM LYNEThat the item, ""The President, ^1,100,"" be agreed to.",14
22,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Yarra) [10.42] - I wish to make a personal explanation. The other evening the honourable member for Fawkner said that there is no evidence that Mr. Walpole, the paid organiser of the Employers' Federation, made the statement which I have attributed to him, that marriage is a luxury for the workers. I have taken the trouble to look up the newspaper files, and in a letter written by Mr Walpole, and published in the Age of 15th October, 1904, I find this passageOn the 12th April, 1902, I gave a lecture at Lilydale, and was asked to define a "" living wage."" I declined, as the Employers' Federation had not empowered me to speak on that point. After the lecture I was asked to give my private view of the question. declined doing, but in order to give some information to the gentleman asking Ihe question I gave him the calculations of leading American economists as to what a muscular man, capable of doing hard work, could live upon. I was then asked, "" What about a married man ? "" and replied that "" F.conomists in dealing with these matters looked upon marriage as a luxury,"" and jokingly added, "" Like long sleevers and theatre parties."" On the following Monday I wrote to the Age as follows :Sir,- I have read Mr Walpole's letter in your issue of today, which purports to be a denial of a statement which I made in my speech in the recent debate, namely, that he had stated at a Lilydale meeting that "" Marriage was a luxury, and so was long sleevers, attending theatres, &c. It was not fair to compel employers to pay for such things."" Mr Walpole, in the first paragraph of his letter, asks to be permitted to give that statement a flat denial; but in the second paragraph he admits that he said exactly what I stated, "" Marriage was a luxury, &c."" But he explains this was said in a private conversation after the meeting. If that explanation is correct., so much the worse for him and the cause which he advocates, as he evidently has one doctrine to be used publicly and the other for private use only. Mr Walpole further states that he does not think the reporter took any notes of what took place. Your readers should be told that Mr Walpole sent on (or took with him) a stereotyped report of his lecture for the use of the local paper, so no reporter was needed to take any record of what he said during the lecture ; but any person reading the report can see that after the lecture a reporter must have taken notes. We see that Councillor Hutton endorsed the remarks of the speaker, and moved a resolution against the Factories Act, which was carried unanimously. Mr .Lithgow moved that steps be taken to form a branch of the Employers' Federation. This was also carried unanimously. The Chairman then asked some one to propose a vote of thanks to the lecturer, and as it was in the reply to the vote of thanks that Mr Walpole made the statements referred to, I will give the report verbatim :- "" The Rev. K. G. Burke would do so with very , great pleasure, as he was quite in accord with the doctrine expounded by the lecturer. Mr B. Morey, in seconding the motion, was somewhat puzzled as to how a married maii could exist on the amount stipulated by Mr: Walpole as a ' living wage.' The motion was carried with acclamation. Mr Walpole, in replying, expressed his thanks for the cordial reception he had met with at the hands of the meeting. What was lost in numbers was made up by the appreciation and intelligence of his listeners. Touching the matter of a living wage, he said marriage was a luxury, and so was long sleevers, attending theatres, &c. It was not fair to compel employers to pay for such things. . . . He had to thank Councillor Hutton for the action that gentleman had taken in bringing about his visit to Lilydale, and he was also grateful to the President of the Shire for presiding. The proceedings then terminated."" This I also Mr Walpole has never replied to that letter from that clay to this. On the following day, a letter signed by Mr T. Oliver, proprietor of the paper in Lilydale, appeared in the AgeSir,- I observe that Mr R. S. Walpole, Secretary to the Employers' Federation, in writing under the above heading in Saturday's issue of the Age, denies that he used the words "" (hat marriage was a luxury, as were long sleevers and going to theatres, & c , and it was not fair to compel employers to pay for these things."" He also makes the bold assertion that the report was a sheer distortion of what he had said. Mr. Walpole further says, "" I do not think the re. .porter took any notes."" Now, sir, the shortly stated, are as follows:-On the 12th April, 1902, Mr Walpole was announced to deliver a lecture in the Red House, Lilydale. .attended with a view to reporting the lecture, ibut in conversation with Mr Walpole beforehand I was informed that if I cared to publish the whole of the lecture I would be supplied with stereo blocks of the matter. I agreed to accept "" economists."" the offer, and intimated to Mr Walpole that I would report the Chairman's remarks and any question that he (Mr Walpole) might be called upon to answer. At the conclusion of his lecture Mr Walpole was asked the question as to what was a living wage. In his reply, Mr Walpole quoted the views of several American economists, but as there was a doubt what Mr. Walpole himself considered as a living wage, he was risked what he thought was a fair living - wage, tie replied that he was of opinion that -1 man could live very well on 30s. a week. He was then asked, "" How about a married man with a family ?"" and he replied that marriage was considered, a luxury, as were long sleevers and going to the theatres, &c.; it was not fair to compel employers to pay for these things. The answer provoked considerable laughter, and one or two persons present said, "" Hear, hear."" I have no desire to enter into the discussion between Mr Tudor and Mr Walpole, but in justice to myself, I think it only right to vindicate any report of Mr Walpole's remarks. Several - gentlemen who attended the lecture affirm that they have a distinct recollection that, when pressed, Mr Walpole gave the meeting his own opinion as to what is a fair living wage and ""his reference to marriage, &c. rstr.mge that after the lapse of two and a half years Mr Walpole should now question the accuracy of what was reported, seeing that he 'had several copies of the Lilydale Exfre'ss for-warded to him on the dav of publication, thus - affording him the very earliest opportunity to - Jinve had any mistakes in the report rectified. Lilydale, 17th October. On 20th October, Mr Walpole replied in .a long letter.",14
23,Mr REID,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"The honourable member can'not make any one else responsible for .asinine remarks like that. Mri TUDOR - We were told the other - day by the president of the organization - which employs Mr Walpole, that there - was no evidence to prove that Mr Walpole had made these statements.",15
24,Mr JOHNSON,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Will the - member take the responsibility for the ar""ticle in last month's International?",15
25,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"No , seeing that I do not Employ the editor of the International, ""Iput Mr Walpole was, and is, employed - the Victorian Employers' Federation. - im simply replying to the statement made miers. fby the honourable member for Fawkner. facts, Mr Walpole, in the course of his letter, statedI In his letter, Mr Oliver varies his report by. referring to the fact that I quoted the views of American economists on the matter. But in what he printed in the Lilydale - Express on iSth April, 1902, there is no reference at all to It is all "" employers."" It is upon Mr Oliver's unfortunate substitution of the word ""employers"" for ""economists"" in his report that the whole of the calumnies against myself have been based. Apparently, therefore, in his anxiety to get out of the difficulty, he desires to make out that he said that "" marriage was a luxury for the worker, and that it was not fair to compel economists""-no t employers- "" to pay for it "" ! This is the first time that I have ever heard that economists pay the wages of the workers.",15
26,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Mernda) [10.53] - I had not intended to intervene in this debate, and should not have done so but for the allusions made last night by the honourable member for North Sydney to the proposals submitted by the Government in connection with the transfer of the States debts to the Commonwealth. The debate has strayed far beyond the items in the Budget, and a variety of matters have been It seems discussed, many relating to the future rather than to the present year. A good deal of the criticism passed upon the Budget has been concentrated on the course taken by the Government in initiating legislation which many honourable members consider will involve largely increased expenditure in future years. No doubt honorYours, & c , T. OLIVER. able members have been within their rights in calling attention to those matters. It was their duty to bring under notice the tendency towards increased expenditure, and to remind the Government of the necessity for looking ahead in connection with the Commonwealth finances. I , however, desire to say a few words today, not with a view of starting a new discussion on the States debts question, but in order to make clear the facts of the position. Later on we shall have an opportunity of discussing the whole question in detail.",15
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,What further op honourable portunity will there be?,15
28,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"I understand that the whole question is to come up for discussion on concrete proposals to be laid before Parliament by the Government in anticiby pation of the settlement of the problem at I the approaching Conference of States PreI understand that that is to be done this session. The Government would scarcely be justified in meeting the Premiers, at what will probably be the last occasion on which the matter can be discussed in Conference, without first ascertaining the views of this House on their proposals. It is desirable that the fullest information should be placed before honourable members, and I take this opportunity of referring to the subject, because the proposals laid by the Government before the last Premiers' Conference, and which will ere long be discussed by this House, are admittedly based on the scheme submitted by me in 1906 - So far as I can see, the only changes made in that scheme by the Government have been in connection with the amounts to be paid, and the period over which the rebates shall extend, and in other details which do not involve its principle. The questions of the amounts to be paid, and the period over which the arrangement is to continue, are matters which clearly should be settled by the Government and by Parliament, and, therefore, I will not deal with them now. I wish simply to explain the principles of the scheme as originally drawn up by me, and to use the figures that I then used.",15
29,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,Has the Government adopted the honourable member's scheme ?,16
30,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"It is. set out in the Government's proposals, as submitted by the Treasurer, that after full consideration, it was decided that the only scheme which met all the necessary conditions was the one that I had formulated. I desire to explain to honourable members what my scheme involved as originally drawn. ' They will then be in a better position to deal with the proposals of the Government, and with the variations made by the Government in the plan as originally submitted. I may say that my object, from the first, in formulating"" these proposals, was to do ample justice, and exercise the fullest ality, towards the States, while at the same time conserving the rights of this Parliament in connection with the finances of Australia. To do that, it seemed to me that any scheme to be perfect must do several things. First of all, it must provide for the taking over of the whole of the States debts. I know the difficulty that exists owing to that section of the Constitution which provides that the Commonwealth may take over the debts existing at the initiation of Federation only, but I apprehend that that difficulty could easily be surmounted. It is inconceivable to methat the Commonwealth would entertain any proposal to take over only a portion' of the debts. It must be apparent that, were the Commonwealth to do so, there would still exist rivalry and' competition in connection with renewals, which it is one of our chief objects ta avert. In the next place it is absolutely necessary that any proposals to be satisfactory must end by the actual abolition,, once and for all, of the bookkeeping system. Although we have practically, to someextent, got used to that system, I think that, if honourable members only realized, as the honourable member for North Sydney pointed out last night, the annoyance, expense, and trouble which it causes, they would agree that it must be abolished. In the third place, I consider that one of the greatest objects to be attained in connection with this question is the adoption of a system which will separate absolutely and finally the connection and entanglement between the finances of the Commonwealth, and those of the States. The Commonwealth, so far as its functions are concerned, should have the fullest right, without involving the finances of any of the individual States, to expend its revenuein the way that seems to it best. On the other hand, it is absolutely necessary for the safety and stability of the finances of the States that they should know exactly what the position is, and should not havetheir finances interfered with or upset by the proceedings of - this Legislature. That object is, perhaps, the most important of all. I should like the attention of the honourable member for Swan-wh o really instigated me to go into this question, over which I have taken a good deal of trouble-becaus e I do not think, from his remarks, that he quite understands my object.",16
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,My objection toliberthe honourable member's suggestions wasconstitutional.,16
32,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,I am not dealing with the constitutional point at present.,16
33,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,The honourable member desires to change the Constitution.,16
34,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Although , as a layman, I do not think it necessary to change the Constitution in order to take over the debts incurred since the inauguration of the Federation, some lawyers hold a contrary opinion.",16
35,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,The honourable member means that each State must pay its own share under the Constitution.,17
36,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"I do not wish to go into that question, which the right honourable member and myself may very well discuss in private. I am now pointing out what I think is necessary, if we are to have a settlement which will prove at once fair to the States and fair to the Commonwealth. To that end I take into account what the present position is. ""Under the Braddon section, the States are entitled, until 1910, to receive three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, but, after that year, the whole of that revenue is to be at the disposal of the Commonwealth Parliament. No one will deny that the Braddon section was adopted in the clear contemplation of this Parliament carrying out what was one of the main objects of Federation, namely, the taking over of the States debts and the obligations connectdd therewith. The claim has been made by the States, that the Braddon section should be retained in perpetuity, or, at any rate, continued in operation for a considerable number of years.",17
37,Mr DEAKIN,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"For twenty years, I think.",17
38,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Practicall y the States are insisting on perpetuity, but at the Hobart Conference twenty years was spoken of. That was a circumstance) which I did not overlook; and I think that Sir George Turner might have been able to close with the States, on that basis had he been prepared to concede as much.",17
39,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,The next Government would have upset the arrangement.,17
40,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Howeve r that may be, I merely mention the circumstances, so as to convev to honourable members some idea of the lines on which I desire to go. take, as a. starting point, what the whole of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue might fairly be expected to be over a series of years; and for that pose, I have selected the four years prior to 1906 as a period in which the excitement consequent on the introduction of the Federal Tariff had passed away, and business might be considered to be under fairly - normal conditions.  speaking of the first Tariff.",17
41,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"r-Yes. This is ancient history, but I desire honourable members to - understand exactly the mental process by which I evolved my scheme, and to enable them to apply it to possibly changed circumstances. I found that, during those years, the amount payable to the States was on the average, in round figures, £ 6 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0, and that, supposing the whole of the debts to be taken over with their attendant Obligations, the. amount payable by the States in interest would be £8,300,000. It was thus apparent that the whole of the three-fourths of the revenue payable to the States was ,£1,800,000 short of the amount due for interest. I may say that the £ 1 , 8 0 0 , 00 0 ought to be, so far as five of the States are concerned, £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, but the amount is reduced by a credit balance on the part of Western Australia, where there is a surplus of something like £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 over and above the interest payable. I mention this because of the peculiarity of the case of Western Australia, which, under any circumstances andunder any scheme, must be provided for ; that is to say, in Western Australia there is a surplus, whereas all the other States, so far as the Customs and Excise revenue is concerned, are short of their interest payments by £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Having arrived at the prime elements in the case, my proposal was that the Commonwealth should at once take over the whole of the debts and apply until 1910, when the operation of the Braddon section expires, three-fourths of the revenue to meeting the obligation, the States finding the remainder until that year, just as they are doing now.",17
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,Eac h State making up its own deficiency.,17
43,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"I mean that the States would pay interest to the Commonwealth instead of toits creditors. The Commonwealth would take over the payment of the I interest on the whole of the debts, and the States would be credited with £ 6 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , each providing the balance in the old way.",17
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"That is, we become pur- the agents of the States up to 1910.",17
45,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Yes . Then starting from 1910, the Commonwealth having assumed the whole of the States debts and interest obligations, would, for a period of twenty years-until 1930-re bate to the States each year 5 per cent, cumulative of their deficiency of interest, £ 1 , 8 0 0 , 0 0 0, so that on that date their debts and the full amount of the interest therein would be assumed by the Conmmonwealth, and they would have no further obligation in connection therewith. My object was to evolve a scheme which, while doing away with the Braddon section and its impedimenta, including the bookkeeping system, would practically give the States all the monetary advantages of that section as nearly as may be, for twenty years; and I shall show how I think that object can be achieved. I have selected the figure of £1,800,000, and have informed honourable members of my reason for doing so. I do not wish to entangle the argument at this stage by introducing any question about Western Australia-that is a matter which must be settled, and can be settled, on equitable and reasonable principles, and does not impair or interfere with the general policy. I calculated that, up to 1910, the amount which the States have to pay-that is, the balance between three-fourths of the revenue, and the actual amount of their interest on the debts-woul d diminish yearly by 5 per cent., cumulative. That is to say, at the end of 1911, the amount in round figures would be £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 less than previously.

I fail to see that we should impose on the States any hardship by requiring them to continue to pay the interest on their debts, either directly to their creditors, or through the Commonwealth, the latter having assumed the obligation in respect of those debts. What is proposed is simply a transposition of the obligation for the debt to the Commonwealth' from the States; the bodies which originally contracted the debt, and had not freed themselves from the payment of the interest thereon, gradually doing so by reducing instalments extending over twenty years.",18

82,Mr FISHER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"The allegation is that it honoris in favour of Queensland and South Australia, and against the Commonwealth",19
83,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Unde r my original proposal, in 1930 the States would have their revenue producing and nonpublic works absolutely free of debt, the Commonwealth having assumed their debts and the obligation to pay the principal and interest. It has been stated that it would inflict an injustice on some, of the States-that it would cause Victoria, New South Wales, and some of the larger' States to carry a very large proportion of the interest on the debts of Queensland and some of the other States. That'argument is also associated with the per capita that argument. To my mind, one of the great advantages of the proposal which I have submitted, is that it would at once r i d us of any necessity of going into the question of per capita. That is a very shifty and troublesome element to deal with, and I a shall show honourable members how I got inrid of it.

85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"If is quite possible, too, that the present inequalities may be further emphasized.",20
86,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Quite so. But to my mind,, it is absolutely impossible for any man to take up the role of prophet and to say what will be the position, year by year, for the next twenty-four years. I came to the conclusion that it was desirable not to adopt the per capita system mode of calculation, but to pursue another line which would enable us to attain the object we have in view, of dealing fairly with all the States, and of not favouring one at the expense of another. That object is achieved by this scheme. I admit that when I wrote my first paper on the subject, my mind had not been impressecl, as it was later on, by' the difficulties that might accrue to some of the States by the arrangement I then proposed, that the remission to the States collectively, year by year, of 5 per cent, cumulative of their deficiency for interest should be distributed amongst them on a uniform plan. When I spoke, in 1906, from the seat now occupied by the right honourable member for Swan, honourable member for North Sydney took exception, on that ground, to my scheme. He very properly pointed out that to remit, without discrimination, 5. per cent, of the Contributions of the States would bring about the result, that some would have to pay more than their share and others less. My reply at the time was that it would be only Federal and fair for the stronger States to assist the weaker; but the honourable member's criticism set me thinking.",20
87,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,That is rangement in the Constitution.,20

That is now mv proposal, and, I underwould stand, that of the Government. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned in its-relaof tions with the States, it will not matter how the money is distributed. All that will be necessary will be to rebate 5 per cent, cumulative each year.

Many persons think that under this scheme there is to be a repayment of capital at the expense of the Commonwealth. Something has been said about the repayment of capital within thirty-five years. I do not know how that idea originated. I am now dealing not with capital, but with the interest which the States have to pay .to their creditors.",20

If in five years the population of Queensland increases by 200,000 or 300,000, its contributions to the Commonwealth revenue will increase proportionately, and in the allocation of its share of the money in connection with the payment of interest it is only right that it should get credit in proportion to its contribution. butions of the States according to population should determine the annual distribution of the rebate.",20

The Treasurer rather objected to my making this statement now, because he said it would probably be the means of prolonging the debate on the Budget. But the matter has had so little consideration in proportion to its importance that honourable members' minds ought to be prepared, before we come to the full-dress debate later on. I am open to any criticism that may be advanced, but I desire honourable members, whether they agree or disagree! with me, to be in the position of really knowing what is proposed, and what the effects of the proposal will be. I come now to the point about increasing population. I may say without egotism that the States Premiers in their meetings have shown no such anxiety as I should have felt in their place to get at all the facts. Not one of them has ever asked me or given me an opportunity to explain to them in public or in private what the proposals and their objective were, although some of them did not absfain from 3isapproval of them. From the character of their objections, it was clear to my mind that they did not understand them, but they gave me no opportunity, such as I was quite willing to afford them, as some of them know, to go over the scheme with them in private, and explain it point by point. This is a business matter. I am dealing with it as a business man, and I assume that the States Premiers are business men. Any business man when he has a difficult financial problem to solve usually obtains all the information, good, bad, or indifferent, that is available, and then makes up his own mind. No doubt, it will be construed as a piece of egotism on my part as a private member to think that those "" potent, grave, and reverend signiors"" would consult any one less than a Cabinet Minister.",22

152,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"We shall have increased revenue from an assumed increase of population. I am assuming that the population will increase, at least, as rapidly as in the past thirty years, and that there will be an increasing revenue, which will provide fox the cumulative rebate of 5 per cent. Honourable members will see that my proposals meet the objection, that, whilst we are taking from the States the whole of their Customs revenue, they will have to provide for the wants of an increased population, for school-houses, and other local expenditure, out of the States resources, because the annual rebate from the Commonwealth will be an addition to their revenues. In my opinion, at the time when I formulated the scheme, and, of course, excluding any increased expenditure which the Commonwealth Parliament might decide upon, of which I could not have knowledge, the expected increase of population would justify the Federal Government in charging itself with the remission of 5 per cent., and, at the same time, the proposal would be fair in the interests of the States. I think I have dealt' with all the points that strike me except one. When asked by the Government to submit these papers I pointed out to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that they must understand that my figures were figures I had taken as in 1906. These figures were necessary to illustrate, the argument, and I considered them fair ; but they must understand that the figures are not part of the principle of the scheme, and could be altered, as, indeed, 1 believe they have been altered.

I wish honourable members to understand that these figures are a matter imfor consideration in the light of information, which, I suppose, the Government not will be prepared to afford, as to their reasons for reducing the amount and extending the time. I understand that one _ of the reasons is the adoption of old-age at pensions, which were not in contemplation! the when my figures were prepared. I wish to impress upon honourable members that the scheme, proceeding step by step, achieves all the ends in view, and is not affected by the figures, which, as I have said, can be varied without affecting the principle. What I set myself out to do was to solve the problem of how best the Commonwealth could assume the total debts of the States in such a way as not violently toaffect the finances of any State, and, at the same time, not put the Commonwealth in a. difficulty, retaining in substance all the advantages of the Braddon section for twenty years. The question of a sinking fund? has been introduced, though I do not know exactly how, because I was not present when, the remarks were made. I proceeded on the assumption-and I may mention thisbecause a good deal has been said about it both here and in London-that it would be possible, if we entered into this arrangement, which, I believe, would greatly strengthen Australia in the financial world, to borrow on the basis of 3 per cent. Of course that would depend on the state of the money market from time to time; but I had in my mind the fact that, at the time. I spoke, the interest actually being paid averaged 3.6 per cent., or a little over 3 L per cent. I showed that, if we could save the .6 per cent, over the long period in contemplation, the result would be that the whole of the debts would be redeemed in some sixty-five years. The Administration, which would have control of these huge operations, would, in time, have a large fund of its own, which could be loaned again and again and earn money all the time.",24
155,Mr FISHER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,Does the honourable member think that we could live without a pub,24
156,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"The question I am now referring to is how to pay our debts, and I am pointing out how, apart from any future borrowing, our successors in sixtyJive years could be made free of debt. I know that one eminent London financier who is very much interested in our loans says that we cannot borrow at 3 per cent, j and I do not say whether we can or can not. J based my assumption on the opinion of the right honourable member for Swan and Mr Coghlan; I do not profess to be an authority, and cannot tell what the market is going to be. I understand that the Government are going to propose, in the event of any deficiency in the sinking fund of .6 per cent., to make it up; but I know nothing on that point. I am assuming that my proposals are carried out entirely, and, if so, if we were to save only .3 per cent, instead of .6 per cent., it.would mean that we should be free of debt in about 100 years, instead of sixty-live years. The mental principle is that, if possible, our bonds' should be like consols, interminablethat is, we should have power, on giving notice, after a certain time, to pay them, but that the lenders should have no right to call up the money. The saving in commission on renewals, and so forth, would, in fifty years, amount to a huge sum, which, capitalized, would grow like a snowball; and it is fair to assume that, without taking into account future borrowing, Australia might, at the end of the period I have mentioned, be in the possession of all her public works-possibl y returning fivefold with the increased population - and, at the same time, have no debt. If we could carry out such an arrangement as I propose, the position from the point of view of the States would be magnificent. It would enable them to rid - themselves of what is at the present time their besetting danger. Owing to the prosperous seasons that we have enjoyed - during the last three or four years, we have had a great accumulation of money in the local market, with the result that the Treasurers of several of the States, as well as the Treasurer of New Zealand, have been borrowing here. If we have the .money, it is much better that we should - borrow locally, and that the interest should remain in the country, than that we should go abroad, but",25
157,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,I hope that the .'States are not wasting the money that are borrowing.,25
158,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"They are borrowing locally as a rule to repay loans heretofore held in Great Britain. The effect of these local conversions upon the local money market is well known by financial men. They have absorbed the loose capital available, and with any' reaction to bad times money will not accumulate in Australia as it has done. The States Treasurers have, in my opinion, come almost to the end of their tether so far as borrowing in the local market at present rates is concerned. The day is at hand when they will have to pay an increased price. The interest rate has increased of late by fully J per cent., and users of the money will have to pay that increase. Some people imagine that the increased rate is paid by the banks; but if the banks pay more for their money the people who use it have to pay more for it. The Treasurers of the States may have staved off a difficulty, and credit fundais' due to them in the circumstances for borrowing locally instead of abroad; but if money which is necessary for the development of the industries of the States is made dear by the action of the States Governments in competing in the local market for it, the progress of the country may be retarded. Cheap money is of immense advantage in the development of a new country, and there can be no doubt that as business improves, and our industries increase, the loose money in the market will be absorbed. The States Treasurers will in that case find that they cannot borrow here at present rates, and they will have to go once more to the London money market. What, then, will be their position? As I pointed out in 1906, from 1915 onwards the States will have to borrow largely to renew loans. In one year four States will have to float redemption loans, and in other years still more will have to do so. As I have already pointed out, in one year loans to the extent of £21,000,000 have to be renewed.",25
159,Mr BAMFORD,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Or'£90,000,00 0 in the next 10 years.",25
160,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Full y £90,000,000. Do honourable members realise what that means? If the Commonwealth is not in a position to take time by the forelock, and to deal with the finances of the States, as a whole, the State Treasurers may have to pay 4 , or even 5 per cent., 1 for their loans to meet urgent necessities. they Much will depend upon the state of the European money markets, the standing of public and private securities, and whether or not capitalists are inclined to invest in Australian stocks. If we have the Treasurers of the States, so to speak, running over one another in the London money market in their desire to be first in floating their conversion loans-and a very small body of men are the media through whom all this money is to be obtained-the y will have to pay for it . On every ground of statesmanship and reasonableness, the Governments of the .States ought now to close with terms so handsome as those offered to them. I am not speaking of the thirty and the thirty-five years periods. That is a matter for discussion; but I have no doubt that the Government will be able to give a reasonable justification for the alteration in figures. The system which I have expounded is simplicity itself, once it is understood, and if the statesmen of the States and the members of this Parliament do not rise to the occasion, they will show a want' of appreciation of the magnitude of the interests involved, amounting almost to a want of patriotism. There is only one other point to which I desire to refer. It has been said by the States Premiers that, under this scheme, we should obtain all their. Customs and Excise revenue at the end of twenty years, and that they would receive no more from the Commonwealth. That complaint was made at the Premiers' Conference, and it has been voiced in this House. When a member of the Government of New South Wales raised that objection to my scheme, my reply was : ""You will have obtained value for your money. You will have got rid of your debts, and will have all your public works free."" I pointed out to him further that my scheme would not debar a further settlement at the end of the period named. We are bound to assume that our successors - as representatives of the people of Australia twenty or thirty years hence will be prepared to come to some reasonable arrangement at the end of the period fixed. It will be open to the States to negotiate. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - That is after severing our financial relations for thirty years, we are to reopen them.",25
161,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"I hope that the honour the able member will not put ""into my mouth words that I have not uttered. Mv suggestion is that there will be nothing to prevent the Parliament of the day then agreeing, as Canada has done, to give all the States a grant per capita.",26
162,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"That is to say, we may then reopen what we have now closed.",26
163,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"As it is we are compelled to reopen the question at the expiration of the Braddon section. Is all wisdom to die with us? I do not know that we have exhibited much up. to date in connection with this matter, but surely it is not to be suggested that those who come after us will be less patriotic in sentiment and less reasonable than we are.",26
164,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,What the honourable member suggests would mean an abandonment of the position taken up by the Treasurer-that there is to be an absolute separation of accounts.,26
165,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"It would not. Does the honourable member mean to sav that if,, at the end of thirty years, £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 were agreed to be distributed per capita amongst the States, an entanglement of the financial affairs of the Commonwealth and the States such as exists now would"" be involved?",26
166,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,No ; but the Treasurer says his principle is absolute separation.,26
167,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,Absolute .,26
168,Mr KING OMALLEY,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,And anything distributed after that would be a mere charitable dole.,26
169,Mr HARPER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Honourable members may call it what they please. It will be for the people themselves to decide. I do not think that we are entitled to say what the people of Australia in 1930 or 1945 will do. Indeed, I do not feel inclined to take the trouble to project my mind so far ahead. I cannot pretend for one moment to prognosticate what will then be done. The objection raised to the adoption of my proposals, or any proposals based upoir them, is that they mean irrevocably that the States. will get nothing more from the Commonwealth after the prescribed"" period. My reply is that the matter is; one for the people themselves to decide. If they decide it now, well and good, but if they do the chances are about 50 to t : that before the time arrives they will have to make an alteration. All that I wish to make clear is that the question as to States obtaining any further contributions from the Commonwealth is a matterfor arrangement quite consistently with theadoption of the principle of my proposal. I do not project my mind into thefuture. What I suggest is a method by which the States debts of £247,000,000 may be taken over by the Commonwealth in twenty years without one shilling being taken from one State for the benefit of another.",26
170,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"The honourable member has not proved that to my satisfaction. Mr HA'RPER - I am sorry that I have not done so. If the right honourable member will be good enough to explain to me, as he may have an opportunity to do, what his difficulties are in regard to my scheme, I shall try to the best of my ability to enlighten him. My scheme does not in any degree tie the hands of the people of the future. It simply aims at a certain object, and I contend that it will accomplish it perfectly.",27

I have listened with the greatest interest to the speeches delivered by the honourable member for Mernda. Mernda and the honourable member for North Sydney, and agree with them that it is well that we should have as much lightenment as possible on will be for the Treasurer, having regard to the speeches that have been made on question, and more particularly to strong criticism of his proposals by the orable member for North Sydney to further enlighten the Committee.",27

As the representative of a country constiextuency, I am glad that the Government is will going to establish a Commonwealth Agriprocultural Bureau. I was a member of the exdeputation to which yesterday .the Acting the Minister of Trade and Customs gave the for promise that the Government would make a departure in this matter. It was pointed' by the apple-growers of Tasmania that it is very important that the fullest investiComgation should be made into the' nature of the pests which interfere with their in the dustry, and the means for destroying them, and the Minister stated that he would use every endeavour to obtain the best experts of - if necessary, from other parts of the world-to investigate these matters. We are always delighted to leam that there Australians capable of filling positions mean in our Public Service; but it must be recognised that we have not a monopoly of all knowledge and skill, and I . trust that when necessary experts from other parts of the world will be appointed-no t only in .the Department of the Minister of Trade and Customs, but in other Departments as well.",27
181,Mr FISHER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,The honourable member has the support of the Socialists in that.,28
182,Mr FULLER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"The tendency of late has been to avoid going out of Australia for experts, even when that has been desirable. I , like other honourable members, have suffered considerably from the bad administration of the Department of the Postmaster-General. Last year a sum was voted for the construction of a trunk telephone line from Sydney to Wollongong, a town which is the centre of the second largest coal-field in Australia. There are at present sixteen coal mines in full work near by, as well as many coke ovens and factories. Wollongong has a port of its own, and is very near to Port Kembla, where steamers as large as 8,000 tons load coal for other parts of the world. Tenders for the supply of material were accepted on 6th July last, and it was then found that the line would have to be repoled. This important district is very much inconvenienced by the error of judgment which prevented that fact from being discovered earlier. I am unwilling to attempt to fix the blame for the occurrence on any official, but some one is responsible for the delay, and I trust that the Postmaster-General will now see that the work is expedited as much as possible. Two memoranda have been submitted by the Government, embodying their new protection proposals. The first was put before us on the 13th December, 1907, and the other laid upon the table week. We know that votes were secured for many of the Government's Tariff proposals because of the promise that, under the new protection, not only manufacturers, but also their employees and the general public, would benefit - One of the contentions of trie free-traders has been that protective duties merely give manufacturers the opportunity to grow rich at the expense of the community, and it was alleged that the new protection would require them to share the benefits which they gained with their workmen and those to whom they sola! their goods. The leader of the Labour Party stated very clearly that the benefits of protection should be shared by employees as well as by employers, and that the general public should get a share. Hestated that in the magnificent railway workshops at Newport the Government of Victoria is saving at least 21 per cent., and tried to make it appear that if the new protection were put into effect all the industries of the Commonwealth would be similarly managed. The Labour Party, however, is not prepared to socialize or to nationalize every industry. It would take over only what it calls monopoliesthat is, good paying businesses. Its members would not risk the success of their theories by applying them to other industries than those which now show a substantial profit.",28
183,Mr REID,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Thos e are the .trimmers. Some members of the party are more thorough Socialists. Mr FULLER?- I understand from the memoranda which has been put before us that if manufacturers unduly raise their prices the protection given to them will be reduced. Under such a system, however, manufacturers who were dealing honestly with the public would be punished for the fault of those who were not. If effect is to be given to the new protection, the employers, the workers, and the consumers should all benefit. But I fail to discover anything in the memorandum recently laid on the table making provision for the protection of the consumers. Paragraph 16 of the first memorandum statedSo far, reference has been made only lo that aspect of the proposals which is concerned with the protection of the manufacturer on the one hand and the employees on the other. An essential part of the completed scheme, however, is the protection of the consumer by the establishment of machinery to prevent the undue inflation of prices. this In the memorandum recently made public there is no mention of the consumers.",28
184,Mr REID,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"No r of the imposition of Excise duties, which was the original new protection.",28
185,Mr FULLER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"That was a feature of the scheme outlined in the first memorandum, but so far as I can gather, no mention is made of it in the second memorandum. On the second page of the new document, it is stated thatThe object of the proposed amendment of the Constitution will be to endow the Parliament of the Commonwealth with a grant of power to do economic justice in.protected industriesI fail to understand what that means, or how it can be brought aboutwith due regard to the unity of the Commonwealth, and the diversity of local circumstances. To ascertain just where economic justice lies, having regard to those matters, and then to apply it to all the protected industries, will be rather a complex task. We find then thatThe electors will be invited to empower the Commonwealth to determine the employment and remuneration of labour in protected industries in view of the protection granted to the manufacturer under the Commonwealth Tariff. At first sight, it would appear to any ordinary individual from that statement that the idea of the Government was to apply the new protection only to what we know as the manufacturing industries, because the word "" manufacturer"" used. But when we come to the new paragraph, which the people of Australia are to be asked to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to insert in section 51 of the Constitution, we find the proposal put in a very different way. Proposed new paragraph x x x v a is as follows :The employment and remuneration of labour in any industry which, in the opinion of the Inter-State Commission, is protected by duties of Customs. That is a very broad sweep.",28
186,Mr HALL,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,It strikes me as very narrow.,29
187,Mr FULLER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"The honourable member takes a different view. As I read it, it appears that any industry in regard to which a duty appears in the Customs Tariff, and which in the opinion of the Inter-State Commission is a protected industry, will come under the proposed amendment of the Constitution.",29
188,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Hear , hear; that is Tight.",29
189,Mr FULLER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"I am glad to hear the Minister endorse my opinion, because it appears to me that under this scheme, not only the manufacturing industries, but all the primary industries from one end of Australia to the other, will be brought under the operation of the new protection.",29
190,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"If they are protected, ves.",29
191,Mr FULLER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"I represent a constituency which is largely engaged in the primary industries, such as coal mining and dairying. I unhesitatingly sav that the men engaged in the dairying industry do not want any new protection system applied to them.",29
192,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,What about the report regarding child labour?,29
193,Mr FULLER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"I saw that reoort in connection with the Teachers' Conference in Svdnev. I have lived in a dairying district all my life. The majority of my relatives are engaged_ in dairying, and have been for the last sixty or seventy years. They were amongst the pioneers of the first dairying district of Australia. I undertake to say that in the Illawarra district, where these things are supposed to exist, and probably in a small proportion of cases do exist, will be found a race of men and women than whom there is no finer or more intelligent body in Australia. As for dairying work affecting the intelligence of,the children, a large number, in proportion to the population of the district, of the boys brought up in its public schools occupy some of the highest positions in is actually professional and other walks of l if e in Sydney today. Those were boys who had to get up at 4, 5, and 6 o'clock in the morning to do their milking before they went to school - The examinations held in the primary schools of New South Wales every year show that the boys and girls in that district are quite equal in intelligence to those of the rest of the State, and that their mental qualities are not impaired in any way. So much for the interjection of the Postmaster-General regarding the employment of children in the dairying industry. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has been, engaged for a number of years in a campaign against sweating in other industries in Melbourne and Victoria generally. Judging by the reports of the conditions in those industries, the dairying industry, so far as sweating and the employment of child labour is concerned, cannot be compared with them, and showsnothing like the long hours or the hardships that have to be endured in other callings in which child labour is engaged, more particularly in the big cities of Australia,",29
194,Mr JH CATTS,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,Would not the honourable member prevent what child labour there is?,29

The honourable member then spoke very strongly in favour of dairying work as employment for children. 1",29

199,Mr FULLER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"I was offered all sorts of inducements as a youngster to learn to milk, but I could never be brought to do it. Althoughit is constant work, and has to be done every day, Sundays included, it is not arduous work.",30

201,Mr FULLER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"I have tried it ; for I can milk now, although I would not learn in mv younger days. It is not hard work for young people. The Government scheme as embodied in the memorandum will bring all the primary industries of Australia under the new protection system.",30
202,Mr HALL,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,How would the pastoral or coal-mining industry come in ?,30
203,Mr FULLER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"All that has to be done is to impose a duty in the Tariff, the matter is submitted to the Inter-State Commission, the industry is found to be a protected one, and then the new protection is applied.",30
204,Mr HALL,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"Does the honourable member think that the Inter-State Commission would regard the pastoral industry, for instance, as a protected industry?",30
205,Mr FULLER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"The chances are that any member of the Inter-State Commission, finding that a duty affecting an industry existed in the Tariff, would regard that industry as a protected one. Time after time, when I have pointed out in the House that the duty in relation to the dairying industry was an absolute farce, and gave no protection whatever, honourable members on the pther side of the chamber have contended that it was strongly protective, and helped the industry considerably. If that position is taken up, we are justified in concluding that the Inter-State Commission would regard the industry as coming within the scope of the new protection.",30
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"I take it that when the honourable member spoke of the child labour at present in vogue, he did not therefore necessarily approve of any sweating that went on?",30
207,Mr FULLER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,Of course not.,30

210,Mr JH CATTS,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,Childre n under a - certain age ought not to be allowed to work .at all.,30
211,Mr FULLER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"I agree with the honourable member as regards hard labour; but I do not think it does children any harm to send them messages or make them do a little work. It is necessary for a good many young Australians to be taught to work in their younger days. Under this scheme, we are to create a new Court, in addition to those already in existence in the various States. There are established in New South Wales and some of the other States, Courts for dealing with industrial matters. In creating a, new Court, we may expose those who are affected to the possibility of having to obey conflicting decisions in relation to the same matter. That would be undesirable. It has not been shown that there is any need'for an additional Court, because these matters have been, and are now being, dealt with successfully by the Courts in the various States. It appears to be an attempt to increase the powers of the Federation at the expense of the States. I cannot agree with the proposition that because the Commonwealth Parliament has power to impose duties of Customs, it follows as a corollary that it should also have the power to deal with all questions arising out of the protective policy. These questions could be very much better dealt with by the States, having regard to the diversity of conditions in each. At the recent Labour Conference in Brisbane, Mr MCGowen, the leader of the Labour Party in the New South Wales Parliament, Mr Holman, and Mr Bowman, the leader of the Labour Party in the Queensland Parliament, expressed themselves .much more strongly in opposition to this proposal than I have done.",30
212,Mr JH CATTS,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"But we agreed upon a compromise, which we all accepted.",30
213,Mr FULLER,PROTECTION FOE FISHERMENAN D,"A good deal is agreed upon in caucus by way of compromise, but in' this case we had two caucuses fighting one another. Senator Givens submitted the following motion to the ConferenceThat the plank "".uniform industrial legislation, amendment of Constitution to provide for same,"" be included in the fighting platform. After the mover had spoken in a'3vocacy of the motion, it is reported that Mr MCGowen, leader of the State Labour Party in New South Wales, said that in a year or two, with the fiscal issue out of the way and a. fusion of conservative free-traders and protectionists, there would possibly be an ultraconservative development. He cautioned them to look ahead and see if such happened in the future with an ultra-conservative party in power, what a lever this would be for such a party to work its will. Might he use a homely saying, and ask, "" Is it a good thing to put all your eggs in one basket ? "" With the six States remaining' as now, where one State had better wages than others, there was a spirit of friendly emulation amongst the other five, but where they had only the one centralized authority a - kind of medium would be struck, and there would be in reality a levelling down for some of the States. In those words, Mr MCGowen struck the exact position. The tendency throughout the history of our Federation has been to level down to the position of the weakest, and not up to the position of the strongest. I advised the railway employees of New South Wales to be very careful in connection with this matter, in view of the wages that they enjoy, lest it should happen-as in all probability it would-that they were brought down to the level existing in some of the other States.",30

The argumenti f he could dignify it with the name of ment-that because a Parliament imposed the Tariff it should have charge of all industrial legislation would not stand investigation. The step that was suggested meant, in the long the end of the State Labour parlies. First, industrial legislation would go, then years there would be a request for the railways, then in another three years, lands, education, fooled. and control of mining. I should also like to quote from marks of Mr Bowman, leader of the wages. Queensland Labour Party, reported as folcussion lowsMr Bowman, leader of the Queensland Labour Party, was not in accordance with arguments of the Federation taking over whole-of the industrial legislation of Australia. He would say, in passing, that he favoured the principle of arbitration in preference to Wages are submitted by the Prime Minister. Bonrds, but he did not think it advisable hand over the local work which those Boards might safely do, to the Federation. The present proposal might be all right as applied to the big industries, - but what about the little tries? They could, he thought, be belter in the State than in the Federal sphere. He was as anxious as any member to consolidate the Commonwealth and State labour forces, but he was not going to sit tamely by and allow the Australian Government to take over the State railways or other functions without very solid reasons being adduced. So far. as the new protection was concerned, he thought that this should be carried, but he resented anything that looked like undue interference in legislation which they could manage in the States. We have this testimony of three representatives, including two leaders of the Labour Party, which is entirely in opposition to the policy advocated by honourable members in the Government corner. On page 2 of the memorandum, which has been circulated by the Government, it is statedThe electors will be invited to empower the Commonwealth to determine the employment and remuneration of labour in protected industries in view of the protection granted to the manufacturer under the Commonwealth Tariff. In some industries the existing protection may enable the payment of fair and reasonable rates of wages. In other industries, not sufficiently protected to enable the full standard of remuneration to be paid, the payment of at least a minimum wage can be required, pending the enactment of effective protection. Unprotected industries will not be affected. It is admitted that under the existing In further Tariff, there are industries which can pay fair and reasonable wages, but it is also admitted that there are other industries in which the Tariff enables only a minimum of wage to be paid, pending the enactment of effective protection. It appears, therefore,, that, while an apparent concession is made be to Labour representatives, and to employees that was - I believe ""employees"" is the proper word-the idea is to sneak in very much arguhigher protective duties than prevail at present. ' In considering the new protection proposals, we have to guard against, first, run, the handing over of the full control of all industrial matters to the Commonwealth, in three and also against Labour classes being fooled through their representatives being I do not believe that the new protection will achieve the result Labour the remen desire, namely, that of raising I have no desire to enter into a disof fiscal matters, but I am justified in saying that the labouring and producing State classes pay quite enough under the Tariff the at the present time. Any further remarks the I have to make in this connection, I shall reserve until the new protection proposals I to have taken this opportunity to shortly place my views before honourable members, and to draw attention to the fact that, more indusparticularly in the country districts, indushandled tries may be adversely affected by those proposals. Before sitting down, however, I should like to remove any misunderstanding there may be in regard to the remarks I made in reply to the interjections of the honourable member for Cook and the honourable member for Maribyrnong, in regard to the employment of child labour in the dairying districts. I hope I made it clear that I am not at all in favour of sweated labour; but, in the meantime, remarks have been made which render it necessary for me to emphasize the position which I then endeavoured to place before honourable members. There is another matter to which I desire to refer. When the honourable member for Melbourne Ports was addressing the Committee last night, honourable members, including myself, made some pertinent interjections, which apparently led the honourable member to believe that we were glorying in the fact that Victoria was losing population: I tried at the time to disabusethe honourable member's mind of any such idea, because I have no desire whatever that Victoria, or any other State of the Commonwealth, should be in any other NA Exclusive of throe-fourths net Dr Transferred DepartmentsDefence (Net) Quarantine P.O.

I know that this matter will be dealt with by the Treasurers of the various States, and as it is highly important, I felt constrained to ask the indulgence of the Committee in order that the return I have read might appear in Hansard for the purposes of reference. I thank honourable members for permitting ma to make this reply to the Treasurer, who challenged the figures which J submitted a few days since.",32
219,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"Calare) [2.33]. - I have listened with interest to the speech on the financial question delivered by the honourable member for Mernda, who I think has struck the right keynote in this debate. He pointed to the raid that is being made on the local money market by the States Treasurers, and the fact that within the next twenty years loans amounting to something like £180,000,000 will mature, and will have to be provided for. That is a vast sum, and the work of making adequate provision for the redemption of those loans will require careful handling on the part of the Treasurers and financial experts generally. The advice which the honourable member for Mernda has tendered is well worthy of consideration. We ought certainly to attack the problem as soon as possible, and endeavour to arrive at a speedy solution. It is not a purely State or Federal question. It is one in which the whole of the people are vitally interested, and we shall not arrive at a satisfactory basis of settlement unless we deal with it from that stand-point. The Treasurer has intimated that we shall have an opportunity later in the session to deal with the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, and that his reference to the question in Budget statement was only an incidental one. Having regard to the contributions to the debate which it has drawn from the honourable member for Mernda, the honourable member for Koovong, and several others, I cannot help thinking that it was well timed. I do not pose as an authority on high finance, and I shall leave the question for future consideration. There is one matter to which I desire to make special reference, inasmuch as it relates more particularly to the party to which I have the privilege to belong. The leader of the Labour Party, in speaking to this question, made some sarcastic references to the change of front on the part of some of those who stand before the electors as anti-Socialists. Those honourable members now wish to hold up the placard of moderate Socialism. They claim to be the pioneers of everything; in the nature of Socialism which they are pleased to describe as "" sensible "" and wish, to brand the Labour Party as extreme ai.'d unreasonable Socialists.",33

221,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"I do not claim to be a Socialist. I belong, not to any socialistic organization, but to' the Labour Party, and that is good enough for me. In the heat of political battle a great deal is said that perhaps in calmer momentswould be considerably modified, but it cannot be denied that a frontal attack has been made on the Labour movement. An attempt has been made to prove that it is intimately allied with the worse phases of Continental Socialism. I do not hesitate to say that with that class of Socialism no honourable member of our party is in sympathy. An attempt has been made to saddle the Labour Party with every possible enormity. It has been urged that the members of it would destroy the Christian religion, abolish the marriage tie, and do away with all the accepted principles of our modern civilization. It was reserved to the honourable^ member for Parramatta, however, to charge our party with being in sympathy with the teachings of Malthus.",33

234,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,I am glad we have had these explanations since they will enable me to deal with this matter from a different aspect than I should otherwise have done.

In an introductory note published in the Worker the week before the appearof the first of those articles the editor any responsibility or 'them.

238,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,That was desimply an intimation that the editor hoped to publish the first article in the next issue.,34
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,I do not mean that sentence.,35
240,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"The honorodour able member charged me with having supteachings pressed something vital to my exrjlanation that the editor of the Worker did not innot dorse every line of the articles which was publishing. Now the honourable memciple, ber says that these articles are boomed "" The Rising Tide "" ; but that is their title. They are an exposition of Australian Socialism by a writer who is not imbued with the theories of Malthus, and who shows, by an extract from Darwin, that the principles of that philosopher do not apply in Japan or elsewhere. The articles were written by a leading professor in one of the universities of the Commonbe wealth, a gentleman, who, by his scholarly attainments, and his keen study of social questions here and in the old world, is qualified to speak with authority.",35
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,I regard the articles as very able.,35
242,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,I am glad to hear the honourable member say so. I do not see the point of his attack on the members of the party in reference to the first article published.,35
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"The honourable member, if he reads my speech again, will find that he has misinterpreted my remarks.",35
244,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"I am very sorry.

He was welcomed by the in wealthy and privileged classes as a sort of theatres. prophet.",35

248,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"Yes , and had a cure of souls, living and dying in the of sanctity. But the result of his is that England is now fifty years behind where it would have been had they interfered with her political progress. he Malthus laid down, as his guiding printhe thesis that population, when unas checked, increases in geometrical ratio, whereas the means of subsistence increase only in arithmetical ratio, and that, therefore, demand must exceed supply, and misery and degradation ensue. He says that these two great natural forces must bi kept equal, and speaks of checks upon the increase of population. He says that the avoidance of irregular gratification may called moral restraint, and in the passage quoted by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, speaks of Nature's mighty forces and the "" uninvited guest "" in these wordsA man who is/ born into a world already possessed, if he cannot get subsistence from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim or right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At Nature's mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders. That passage appeared in the second edition of the Essays on the Principles of Population, revised and enlarged by the author; but was omitted, with others which were considered objectionable, from succeeding editions, though Malthus did not recede from his position. When Sir Robert Peel brought in his poor law reform, Malthus was one of his strongest side opponents, contending that poor laws depress the general conditions of the poor, by to increase population without indiscreasing food supplies, diminishing the share of the worker. He went on to argue that they contribute to raise the prices of provisions and to lower the prices of labour. The honourable member for Parramatta says that neither he nor his party hold similar views, but the honourable member Yarra today substantiated the statement which was denied by the President of the Federal Employers' Union, that its agent intimated that it is not an obliof the capitalist to enable his employees to marry, marriage being a luxury, the nature ° of "" long-sieevers '' and",35
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,What have we to do with that?,35
250,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"The fact shows that there is still a leaven of Malthusian doctrine in the views promulgated by organizations supporting the party to which the honourable member belongs. Coming to another matter, I have here the September number of that eminently respectable publication, the Westminster Review, in which an article "" Socialism through biological spectacles,"" by Bernard Houghton, takes pride of place. I commend it to those who say that Socialists harbour the ideas which the honourable member for Parramatta properly describes as ""devilish"" and ""ghoulish."" The writer saysI f there is one point more than another concerning Socialism, which is impressed on usis impressed on us with studied irritation-it is the right of all human beings to employment"" From each according to his powers, to each according to his wants,"" is, perhaps, not strictly the utterance of a Socialist, but similar shiboleths are amongst the commonplaces of Socialism. "" Every infant that came into the world,"" say Morris and Bax, "" would be born into full citizenship, and would enjoy all its advantages, whatever the conduct of its parents might be."" Or, again, what can be clearer than the statement of Deville- "" The support of children will no longer depend on the chance of birth. Like their instruction, it will become a charge of society."" Then follows this paragraph, to which I direct the honourable member's special attentionNow, Malthus will have lived in vain, the numerous examples drawn by him from the history of the world in general, and from that of England prior to the Poor Law Reform of 1834, will have fallen on deaf ears if such principles as these, which abrogate all responsibility of adults for their offspring, are ever translated into actuality. The swiftness of increase in population under a civilized Government, that is to say under the so-called capitalistic regime, is, in fact, often lost sight o has to be actually verified to be believed. . . . The main fact, indeed, stands out clearly enough, namely, that under a civilized Government, given security of life and property, and an assured abundance of food for the parents and their offspring, the population will increase with a most embarrassing rapidity. The difficulties, miseries, and perils springing from such a condition, form one of the most obvious obstacles which confront the enthusiastic Socialist. The honourable member for Parramatta will therefore see that the doctrines of Malthus. either here or in the Old Country, are not quite so dead as he imagines. On which side of the great line which divides modern civilization into two camps-the camp on the side of social humanitarian reform, or the camp who believe that things as they are are the best that can be obtained-doe s the honourable member really believe that the truth lies? The teachings of Malthus, although not so powerful as they were at the outset in the Old Country, are still a factor to be reckoned with. The honourable member for Dalley was good enought to remind me that Malthus was a member of the church. When the great capitalistic East India Company founded a college for the training of its cadets in England, the man appointed as first professor of the chairs of history and economic thought was the Reverend Mr Malthus. He occupied that position from 1807 until 1834- a considerable period.",36
251,Mr WEBSTER,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"Does not the honourable member think that the advertisements issued by the employing classes, asking for married couples without families afford the best evidence of their sympathy with the teachings of Malthus?",36
252,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"I know that a great section of the employing class act on the principles laid down by their paid agent, and that as soon as a man employed on a station marries, and begins to get a family around him, he is speedily asked to look elsewhere for employment, his place being taken by some one who is not so' encumbered. With respect to the question of applying Socialism, which is the very opposite to the doctrines of Malthus, I am reminded of the severe attack made on the Labour movement at the last general election. I am reminded also of a statement by the late Lord Salisbury, one of the Prime Ministers of England, who had a long experience of the public life of the Empire, and knew all its movements, and all its tricks. He is credited with having said, soeaking of the wealthy and privileged class in England, a class which to af ; it large extent is the ruling class there, thatThe classes' never join issue on a measure which hits them hard in order to beat you onthat. They prefer to select other matters on which they appeal to prejudice, and to upset you on a matter to which they think the masses will be indifferent. That fairlv correctlv expresses the attitude of the anti-Socialists towards the Labour movement of Australia. At the beginning of the last election campaign little, if any, of their attack was directed to the programme put forward by the Labour Party. Labour candidates were rather charged with being Socialists, and all the prejudice of ignorance was appealed to in order to turn public feeling against the Labour movement, with, I am bound to admit, a - considerable degree of success. At the beginning of my political campaign I ' heard the Labour Party charged with being hostile to the Christian religion, with being actuated by a desire to destroy the marriage tie, and the relations of the home and family, to divide up accumulated wealth - every Saturday night and have a good carouse. Those statements appeared to me so utterly ridiculous as to be' unworthy - of serious attention on a public platform, but I found as I progressed that it was no small matter but a real issue that had to. be fought. The anti-Socialists, adopting the tactics of the class interests of the Old World as described by Lord Salisbury, were able by those means to score to an - extent that would not have been possible had they confined their attack to a fair, straight-out fight with the principles espoused by the Labour movement - Since then the people have had an opportunity to think. Attention has been directed to the teachings of leading socialistic thinkers, with the result that the public generally have become better informed than they were then. We now find a number of declared anti-Socialists, who came into this Parliament with the one objective of fighting all forms of Socialism, announcing that they are Socialists. They claim that practically every one is a Socialist, but the line of demarcation that they draw is that there are two kinds of Socialists in the world-the sensible, or moderate, and the extreme. They belong, they sav, to the moderate and - sensible section, while the men who owe allegiance to the Labour movement are the extremists, of whom the public would be well advised to be afraid.",36
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,The honourable member says that he is not a Socialist.,37
254,Mr THOMASBROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"I do not - claim to be a Socialist. I do not belong to a socialistic organization. I belong to the Labour movement. If the honourable member says. that that movement is socialistic, then, if he is right, I am a Socialist.",37
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,The honourable member's late leader said that it was a sine qua non that a man should be a Socialist before he could enter the Labour movement.,37
256,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"That is a very interesting phase of the question. I wish to call honourable members' attention to the utterances of some leading thinkers on the subject of Socialism. First, I wish to quote the views of the leader of the Opposition. He had a good deal to say about the question during the last election, and repeated a lot of stuff compiled by the Women's National League. There is, of course, a considerable difference between the leader of the Opposition and a large number of other honourable members, in that he is a humorist, and most of us, unfortunately, are not so gifted. One of the troubles with a political humorist is that, like the spring poet, he wants a lot of licence, and picturesqueness often counts for more than actual statements of fact. 1 prefer to regard the right honourable member for East Sydney from that stand-point. At one time he was infected with the microbe of Socialism, or alleged Socialism, to some extent, because early in the Federation, when the relative merits of free-trade and protection were under discussion, and the point was raised as to how the establishment and development of industries could be encouraged, he committed himself at Toowoomba to the following position :If industries cannot be established without protection let the Commonwealth Government establish them, because we can be quite sure of the conditions of the factories, of proper wages being paid, and decent hours beinj kept. There would be no one to sweat, because there would be no one to make a profit. He afterwards practically repeated that in the House. In the great anti-socialistic campaign that he led at the last general election, it was reported that Mr Reid, speaking at Terang, in Victoria, said the doctrine of the Socialist was in contradiction to the first commandment, and was in effect, "" If thou cannot win any ""prize in the rac^, share and share alike with those who canlet those who have not divide with those who have. Do not sacrifice thyself ""for the sake of others, but sacrifice others for the sake of thyself."" The honourable member for South Sydney, who then represented Bland, was called upon to reply to that statement. His reply was very neat. He referred to Exodus, chapter xx., 18, and chapter xxiii., t which I leave honourable members to turn up for themselves. The texts were very appropriate. I wish to refer honourable members to an undoubted authority, Professor Kirkup, whose article on Socialism in the Encyclopaedia, Britannica contains the following: The ethics of Socialism are closely akin to the ethics of Christianity-if not identical with them. Professor Laveleye, Professor of Political Economy at the Liege University, stated in an essayEvery Christian who understands and earnestly accepts the teaching of his Master is at heart a Socialist, and any Christian who opposes what is commonly known as Christian Socialism misunderstands Christ or Socialism, or both. I next refer to Professor F. D. Maurice, Professor of Moral Philosophy at Camand bridge some years agoThe watchword of Socialism is co-operation. The watchword of anti-Socialism is competition. Any one who recognises the principle of cooperation as a stronger, a truer that of competition has the right to the honour or the disgrace of being called a Socialist. Another leading authority is Professor Woodward, who has written a very valuable treatise on this subjectThe two ideals presented by the Socialist's programme and the Christian Church are not essentially inconsistent, for in the perfect state each includes the other. The fundamental demand of Christianity is to love Cod; but the second is like unto it : "" Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."" And Socialism, however its teachings may be distorted, has its real hold today on the open public misery of individual suffering which is both produced by and in turn produces degraded moral conditions.",37
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,Dos s the honourable member subscribe to all those opinions?,38
258,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"I quote the which extracts as against those who represent organic Socialism as anti-Christian-as opposed to community, the tenets of the Christian religion. gentlemen I have quoted have studied the question, as neither I , nor, perhaps, ber of other honourable members have the opportunity to do; and they are certo tainly in a"" better position than is the honourable member for East Sydney to.exshow press an opinion as to the real essence the teachings of Socialism.",38
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"The honourable that, member is defending Socialism, and yet he sa/ys he is not a Socialist!",38
260,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"I think it members only fair that this presentation of the case should be considered. Though «I do not belong to the community, if is only justice to show what the teachings of the commumember nity are. I should like to refer honourable members to a report of the proceedings the Lambeth Conference of the Church of England, held as far back as 1888, when this question was considered, and when Committee was appointed to deal with it. The Chairman of that Committee was no less a person than the well-known and respected Bishop Moorhouse, formerly this 'State, while one of the members was a prelate well known in my own State, the Mr.recommendation the Rev. Dr Barry. The definition of Commission, Socialism arrived at by that Committee wasAny scheme of social reconstruction may be called Socialism which aims at uniting labour the instruments of labour (land, and capital), whether by means of the State or of the' cooperation of the poor. Later on, the Fabian Society, which is more academical, in a report in 1896, deprinciple than fined Socialism asSocialism, as understood by the Fabian Society, means the organization and conduct of all the necessary industries of the country, and the appropriation of all forms of economics, rent of land, and capital by the nation as a whole through the most suitable public authorities, parochial, and municipal, provincial or central.",38
261,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,The honourable member is not saying that he believes in those definitions.,38
262,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"It does not follow; at present I am giving various definitions of Socialism. A later definition has been given by a practical politician, Mr J. Ramsay Macdonald, who is not unknown in Australia, in his little! work Socialism and SocietySocialism is a theory of individualism in the individual is regarded as being in relationship with his fellows in the and in which, consequently, the State, the community, and the individual are The seen to be pursuing the same ends. That is the definition of a leading polia numtician on the social reform side in the had British House of Commons. I now come the question-What is not Socialism? right The honourable member for Lang desired to that certain State enterprises, such of as railways, tramways, and so on, do not give expression to socialistic thought, and therefore, anti-Socialists are not to be regarded as inconsistent if they supported such enterprises.",38
263,Mr CHANTER,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"That is what honourable opposite call "" s a f e "" Socialism.",38
264,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"This shows the progress honourable members opposite are making. I suppose that the honourable for Parramatta, who, I regret to say, is not present, will accept the honorof able member for Parkes as a leading political thinker, and an authority on anti-Socialism, and will admit that he is now a on the same side of politics as himself. The honourable member for Parkes, during the last elections, had some criticism to offer on his own party; and he is reported of in the public press as followsReid has recently expressed approval of of the Old-age Pensions which is distinctly soc'.»; stic. Com- ; pulsory arbitration, which Mr Reid supported in the Federal Parliament, is unmistakeably a socialistic measure. His own Sea Carriage of Goods Act was equally socialistic.; and he has always failed to give the true anti-socialistic answer to the argument in regard to the railway and tramway and telephones being already State socialistic functions, namely, that prepared to see them placed in the hands of private enterprise as in Great Britain and the United States. That is the opinion of an anti-Socialist, who looks on this question purely from individual stand-point, and he occupies important place in the councils of the to which the honourable member for ParraStuart matta, the honourable member for Roberteconomic son, and the honourable member for belong.",38
265,Mr CHANTER,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"They were not "" playing marbles "" then 1",39
266,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"I understand there was some difficulty at - that time, cause the honourable member for Parkes did not like the trimming of his anti-socialistic-, friends in regard to the socialistic operato tions I have indicated - Then, during last elections, the honourable member for Robertson had a good deal to say, in way of adverse criticism, of Socialism, yet today we find him charging the Labour Party with not living up to their objective. The honourable member for Parkes tells that, if we wish to be practical antiman .. Socialists, we must be prepared to hand over to private enterprise railways, ways, and so forth; and that is not all. remember that, just prior to the last election, a Conference of the Employer's' Federation, held in' Adelaide, was adwho dressed by a number of representative including politicians. One of' these Mr Brentnall, of the Legislative Council in Queensland, who showed how modern Socialism had evolved. The first step, he said, was payment of members, the second was adult suffrage, and the third was arbiget tration, or interference by legislation, dustrial matters. These he laid down the main planks'of Australian Socialism; and if the honourable member for Parrathe matta asks me if 1 endorse all the extracts I have read, I ask if he endorses the state-' ment of his colleague, the honourable ber for Parkes, namely, that if we are truly anti-socialistic we ought to hand, over our railways and tramways to private enterprise, as in England and Amesidered rica. Having asked the honourable member that question, I am prepared that to say that, if old-age pensions be an [68] expression of Socialism, I am a Socialist. If the regulation of trade to which he takes exception-if adult suffrage, payment of members, and legislation for the settlement of industrial disputes are expressions of he is Socialism-tha n I am to that .extenta Socialist. ' But the Labour movement is not tied to any one economic thinker. The Labour Party do not regard the writings of - any particular economic thinker in the light the of Holy Writ, that cannot err. They are an prepared to take from the writings of party Adam Smith, Carey, MCCulloch, Ricardo, Mill, or any. other of the standard teachers, or from the writings of Lang Karl Marx, Henry George, and others on the socialistic side, anything that appears to them to be desirable, and in harmony with fact, and to work for its realization. They formulate their platform, and the party is wide enough to comprise within its bescope all who are at one as to the desirableness of carrying into effect a policy of practical politics. They do not look merely the theories of political writers; they the turn father to the practical side. Their place in the political world is not merely the to advance theories, but to do something and practical to uplift humanity. Although at times 'our partymay make mistakes, they are prepared to remedy them. Who surfers us most from mistaken legislation? Is it the with the well-filled pocket, the man with large landed interests, or the man who tramhas great wealthat his command ? Do any I of them suffer from legislative mistakes general as much as does the man who has to depend upon his muscle for his livelihood, has to fight for his. position amongst men, his fellow men, whose existence is on the was verge of starvation? Mistaken legislation must vitally affect such men. All that the Labour movement seeks to do is to give ' such men the birth right that they have been denied, and which they can never hope fo as long as. advocates, of the teachings in inof Malthus and those who fortify the as position they take up by such teachings prevent them from obtaining it. Even in Old Country, with all the advances that it has made, there are thousands of men, as well as the whole of the women folk of the memcommunity, who are denied a voice in the determination of who shall make the laws of the land. The first principle we lay down is that every man and woman is to be cona human being, equal in the sight of man, as well as in the sight of God, and all should have an opportunity to determine what remedial. legislation should be undertaken for the uplifting of humanity. Look at the condition of affairs in the days of .Malthus. England was then _ in the throes of poverty, die like of which, has never since befallen her. Thousands of her people were dying of starvation by the roadside. The only remedy which the wealthy at that time could offer them was the damnable, devilish doctrine of Malthus - the y could only . tell them that their Creator was practically responsible for their misery and degradation. We happily have ' been able to remedy that state of affairs, and today we-have reached such a standard that the anti-Socialists, who are looked upon as the hope of the Conservatives, not only in Australia, but in the Old Country, have to throw the teachings of Malthus to the winds, when the test of intelligence and fact is applied. I welcome this further indication of progress on the part of those who took up that line of thought, and .who today are prepared tp accept certain State operations, that have_ proved serviceable to the general community,- even if they do come under-the heading; of Socialism, and are condemned as such. Within the small space of three years, honourable members who went before the electors and denounced the Labour Party and the social reform movement as socialistic-wh o denounced the Labour Party as being'animated with hostility to Christianity and to modern civilization-ar e prepared to claim that they are sensible Socialists. I hope that their good sense will grow, and that the time will speedily come when they will Be prepared to support legislation which will remedyas far as we can hope' by legislation to remedy-the conditions that destroy the .lives of innumerable fellow creatures.",39
267,Mr JOHNSON,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"What about the antiChristian socialistic Sunday school at Broken Hill, established by Tom Mann, the Labour organizer of the honourable member's party?",40
268,Mr JH CATTS,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,He is not.,40
269,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"If the honourable member will give a moment's consideration to the attitude which the party he represents takes up towards a great number of the poor unfortunate people who are ground down under harsh conditions, he will find himself wondering why so many can look beyond the mere instruments of the Christian religion to the Great Founder of that religion, and still have faith in it, despite the contradictory lives and actions of many of its professed teachers. I know that the honourable member for Lang and the honourable member for Parramatta, and others, were at one time in this movement",40
270,Mr JOHNSON,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,But never associated with the irreligious portion of it.,40
271,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"They have turned their backs on it. But I ask them to exercise a little Christian sentiment in dealing with those who remain in the party, even if they do believe that they are mistaken. Let them-credit them with not being actuated by base and degraded motives.",40
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,The honourable member might himself exercise a little of that spirit.,40
273,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,I am prepared to do so.,40
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"There is no evidence of that. Mr .THOMAS BROWN - I am prepared to welcome the honourable member's advance along the line of progress. I remember with considerable gratitude the pioneer work undertaken by him as leader of the Labour Party at a time when he was considered to be its rising star. The opinions to which he then gave utterance constitute some of the best propaganda work that the movement has today. I only regret that he cannot see his way to continue along the same line. That, however, is his business, and not mine. I respect his opinions.",40
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"I am not aware of any change. If the honourable member's party choose to jump about, I cannot help it.",40
276,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"The honourable member must have been made aware in some mysterious way of a marvellous change on the part of some of his old opponents who now sit behind him and are looking to him as an armour-bearer in their great fight against the social reform movement'. I well remember the time when the honourable member for Lang was a leading advocate of the single tax. In those days the Conservative . forces of New South Wales regarded the single tat as the great opponent they had to fight. The single-taxers then occupied in the political world much the same position as the Labour Party occupy today. There was nothing that the Conservatives could say of the honourable member that w.as too bad. I believe that he is still honest and earnest in his advocacy of the single tax, but he has fallen amongst the Philistines, and when my honourable friend and those .who think with him seek to push their single tax theories to the front again, they will find that their strongest opponents are those who sit with them today. Mr. JOSEPH CooKs- I candidly believe that the. honourable member is far more canny politically than is the honourable member for Lang.",40
277,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"I have had a little experience. When I last visited my electorate, I was shown one of what appeared to be a series of "" chain letters "" that were in circulation there at the last elections. These chain letters are a new method of political warfare. The substance of the letter- I do not give its exactwords-wa s this: "" I know that you have been a great supporter of the Labour movement and of Mr Brown. So have I . But he is no longer a free-trader and a Labour man. He has joined the Socialists, as they are termed in Germany, a body opposed to the Christian religion and to good government. In France they are called Communists.; in Russia, Nihilists; in Ireland, Fenians, while behind the movementare the Jesuits,'- who wish to dominate the world. If ever they do, then good-bye to religious and civil freedonv."" The writer, who is well known to me, was perfectly honest, and did not originate those views. But his credulity having been traded upon he was made the' vehicle of their expression by others opposed to the labour movement. I have discovered that good religious people, who would not originate a lie, such as that men like myself wish-to break down the Christian religion or to loosen the marriage tie, will take advantage of - one, by repeating it, salving theirJ - consciences by saying that they are not its authors, and that no moral responsibility attaches to them in its repetition. The honourable member for Yarra has referred to the Malthusian opinions expressed by the paid agent of the Employers Federation. The matter is dealt with in the Age of ist December last. Mr Hewison, who claimed to be one of the originators of the Women's National Association, but who had evidently got into its black books, said, in addressing a meeting, that he had done the preliminary work of organization, but that the League had afterwards employed some one who had changed the whole tone of its political work, so that, instead of opposing Socialism, on individualistic and economic grounds, it was trying to injure the Labour Party by, asserting that its [68]- 2 members would loosen the marriage tie and destroy religion. He said that he ha.d told the League that these tactics were a mistake, and if persisted in would not be successful. He was asked to see Janet, Lady Clarke, on the matter and she told him that this crywas thought to be a good one, and that it should be repeated. She said, "" We wish to stick to it, and.as we do not want to lose your services either, we ask you to hold your tongue about it.",41
278,Mr CHANTER,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,Some of the members of the-League repeated the charge at the Sydney Conference lately.,41
279,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,The honourable member objects to be identified with the statements of Mr Tom Mann and Me Brisbane Worker.,41
280,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"I . repudiate the extreme statements of my own side; but the leader of the Opposition, prior to the last general election, repeated all over New South Wales statements such as those I have objected-to.",41
281,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,That is not so. He certainly did not' repeat the charges about the marriage tie.,41
282,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,He repeated others.,41
283,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,What are they?,41
284,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"I have no wish to be unfair; my statements are correct. It.has been said quite recently that the Labour Party has never repudiated this charge; but at a Conference held' in Melbourne, .in 1905, the following resolution was carried on the motion of Mr D. MCDonald, M.L-A..,. of New South Wales, seconded by the Reverend Mr CullifordThat this Conference repudiates with indignation the charge levelled against the Australian Isabour movementof endeavouring to weaken the sanctity of the-marriage tie,'and to sap the foundations of religious belief. And we furthermore declare it to be our 'firm conviction that the success of our efforts to improve the national condition of the community will result in the elevation and not in the degradation of marriage, and enable the sublime teachings of the Founder of Christianity to be brought home as a living reality to the vast number to whom in the misery* and privation which society as now constituted has engulfed them, they remain but mere abstractions. I do not charge the members of the antiSocialist party with having pursued the tactics of the Women's National Association; but they should tell the Association that it is not using weapons which will ultimately advance its cause, The honourable member for Flinders gave these ladies very wholesome advice when, their recent Conference in Sydney, he them that they, should accept the fact that the misery and degradation against which the Labour movement is a protest exists, and should do something practical to alleviate it. When they try to do so they unlearn a good deal of their anti-Socialism and learn something of Socialism.",41
285,Mr ARCHES,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,Ye t many members of the Labour Party have branded the honourable and learned member for Flinders as a regard actionary.,42
286,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"They may The have grounds for doing so. His advice that occasion"" was, however, very seasonWhite able. I reiterate that the Labour movetianalizatian ment is not bound by any set of political writers or thinkers. It has its own special programme, which it puts before the comrestriction munity for approval or rejection, and which, it is prepared to stand by. It ready to learn from all writers. The jective lays down that it is the purpose the party, as. I hope it will be of all parties, to cultivate a healthy patriotic feeling among the Australian people. Even that statement has been misconstrued, some honourable members . assume that people cannot be patriotic towards Aussound tralia and at the same time patriotic wards the. Empire. They think that Ausnewspapers tralian patriotism necessarily spells antithat Imperialism, but the man who has not learned to be patriotic to Australia, which he claims as the land of his' birth or adopit tion, does not know the ABC of patriotpenny. ism to the Empire. The next statement in trie objective is that the party shall at nationalizing those great industrial tions which are in danger of becoming monopolistic, and which affect such large sections, of the community. The Labour Party prefer to have those functions conwhole trolledin the interests of the community rather than for the profit of private enterlarge prise. In t,hat connection the party take no action without consulting the compresent munity. The stamp of approval must be placed by the people on any project for nationalizing an industry or monopoly. The programme under which the party working during the lifetime' of this liament may be briefly summarized as lows :-The maintenance of a White AusStates, tralia; nationalization of monopolies; - age and invalid pensions; Tariff dum; progressive land tax; restriction of public borrowing; navigationlaws; citizen at Defence Force; and Arbitration Act told Amendment. The scheme put forward by the last Inter-State Congress for the next Parliament will, if adopted by the different State Congresses, be as follows",42
287,Mr JH CATTS,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,It has not to be will approved by the State Congresses in this instance: It is binding if carried by a two-thirds majority;,42
288,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"The ' State bodies will have something to say with reto it, and their views will have weight with the members for the different States. programme for the next Parliament, if on adopted, will be: The maintenance of a Australia; new protection; naof monopolies; graduated tax on unimproved land values; citizen Defence Force; Coinmonwealth - bank; of .public borrowing; navigation laws, and Arbitration! Act amendis ment. With regard to the' proposal for a obNational Bank, the honourable member for of Darwin has done immense service to the party arid to the community generally. He has presented a scheme by which Commonwealth and States can combine to establish and a strong National Bank that will conduct the financial operations of both, and be a recipient of the earnings of the great totoiling masses of the community. In the of yesterday or today I read a similar institution in New Zealand has lent the enormous sum of ^9,000,000 for the development of the Dominion since was established, and has never . lost' a There are many other directions in which an institution of this kind could aim exercise valuable functions .for the comfuncmunity. Unfortunately, the private banks are capitalistic corporations, from whose operations the small men, especially the small land-holders, suffer severely. The tendency of their policy is to make the small estate part and parcel of the estate, and it is largely because of their operations that we are faced with the land monopoly and settlement difficulties. I hope that this matter will receive attention from members in all parts of the House, and that as - an. outcome of it the is Commonwealth will have at no distant Pardate a strong National Bank that will folbe representative of Commonwealth, and work harmoniously, and. discharge oldimportant functions for the development referenand progress of thei"" community.",42

The honourable member for Darwin is the-only other member who desires to speak, and it would be a pity for the Government to shut him out.",42

291,Mr JH CATTS,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"He cannot have another opportunity in a full financial ""bate. The honourable member for Calare cut his speech down by half this afternoon, and no one expected that the debate would be brought to a conclusion so suddenly. The honourable member for Darwin has given as much attention to the financial question as has any other honourable member, and has some valuable information to place before the House. He has been - consulting with the Treasury officials to work out calculations which will be of - great value to us.",43

295,Mr JH CATTS,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,The honourable member and those with him have had their say. Only the other evening honourable - members on that side were making arrangements to keep the debate going in' order to allow one of their members to speak. I was approached in the same way.,43
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,Is that the time that the members of the honourable member's partu were on the chain and tonguetied ?,43
297,Mr JH CATTS,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,That is like the bulk of the honourable member's misrepresentations. I can only say that the honourable member for Darwin has helped the Treasurer on a number of occasions.,43

I am anxious to close the debate, and in spite of the courteous, kindly, and gentlemanly remark of the honourable member for Hunter, I shall take my own course. My only desire now is to deal with a few figures quoted by the deputy leader of the Opposition. I do not in any way wish to prevent the honourable member for Darwin from speaking. I did not know that there was an arrangement between that honourable viember and the honourable member for Calare; but I know that the honourable member for Darwin this morning told me that his remarks would not be lengthy, and that he would not make them today. I take it that, after we have disposed of the first item, honourable members will be confined to the items immediately before the Committee, but I have no objection whatever to the honourable member fbr Darwin, or the honourable member for Hunter, exercising their full privilege of speaking. Statements were made the other night, mainly by the deputy leader* of the Opposition, in regard to the investment of money. With my officers I have taken - I shall not say pride-bu t considerable credit for not allowing money to lie idle, and on that point the deputy leader of the Opposition said that money had lain for very many months without earning interest, until he had goaded the Government, and compelled, them to invest the money ",43

312,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATES IN ACCOUNT WITH,"I could have told the honourable member that, with the exception of a few small amounts, handed over to adjust expenditure made by the officer in charge, no payments have been made by the Agents-General until July last. In that month the first payment was made to Captain Collins of the balance of Commonwealth moneys in the hands of the Agents-General in accordance with instructions issued by this Department some time previously.
