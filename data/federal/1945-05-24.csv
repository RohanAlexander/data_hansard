2,Mr ABBOTT,UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE,"Has the Acting Prime Minister seen the statement published in the press today, wherein Dr Evatt is alleged to have said that he can swing enough votes in committee at the United Nations Conference on International Organization at San Francisco to break down the veto power of the Big .Five? ""Was the power of veto agreed to by the late President Roosevelt, Marshal Stalin and Mr Churchill at the Yalta conference? ""Was the matter also raised by the Australian delegates to the United Nations Conference on International Organization at the preliminary meeting of representatives of the British Empire held in London? Is the policy in regard to the power of veto of the Big Five, which Dr Evatt is enunciating at San Francisco, the policy of the Australian Government? If so, is Dr Evatt acting under the instructions of the Government, and keeping it fully informed of the position?",15
3,Mr CHIPLEY,UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE,"I have not seen the article referred to, and have no knowledge of any official pronouncements in relation to the decisions of the Yalta conference. I ask the honourable member to place his other questions on the notice-paper. GOVERNMENT BUILDING. DAY LABOUR COSTS.",15
4,Mr LAZZARINI,UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE,"Werriwa-Minister for Works and Minister for Home would Security) - by leave-Yesterday, honourable member for Brisbane (Mr. George Lawson) asked me a question in Mr Cook saidconnexion with a statement alleged to have 'been made by the honourable memoriginal ber for Parramatta (Sir Frederick dation. Stewart). I have perused: in the Sydney was too high. Morning Herald of the 22nd May, 1945, the article referred to by the honourable member for Brisbane, and have noted the statement by the honourable member for Parramatta that estimates given in evidence to the Public Works Committee recently showed that a building project would cost £115,000 if carried out by the Government, and £73,000 if completed by private contract. The honourable member for Parramatta has attempted to estabthat if the work were carried out by the Government it would cost £115,000, but if carried out by private enterprise would cost £73,000. His statement infers that if the Government called tenders for the job the cost would be £115,000, whereas if private enterprise called tenders the cost would be £73,000. It is obvious from the evidence that no reference was made to work done by private enterprise. The amount of £73,000 was a revised estimate, prepared by the department after a full investigation of requirements.",15
5,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE," by leave-As the Minister for Works has suggested that my statement was not correct, I shall furnish confirmation of it by reading the relevant official evidence given by Mr George Cook, Works Director, Allied Works Council, Department of the Interior, before the Public Works Committee. In answer to a question by the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), Mr Cook said I am aware that the original estimate for this work was £115,000, while the latest estimate is £73,570. There is, admittedly, a considerable discrepancy, hut I point out that the original estimate was made when it was believed that the work was to be part of the post-war reconstruction programme. The estimate was made on the cubic foot basil and in the belief that the work would bo done under Civil Constructional Corps conditions. In answer to a question by me as a member of the committee, Mr Cook saidThe original idea was that the buildinjr be erected by the Civil Constructional the Corps on the cost-plus system. In a further answer to the chairman, The plan has not been altered since the estimate was made, and there has been no reduction of the proposed accommoThe fact is that the original estimate I am prepared to leave it to the House to judge, on the statements presented by the Minister and by me, - whether I attempted in any way to mislead honourable members or the Feminist Club of Sydney. NA FROM GREAT BRITAIN .",15

7,Mr BEASLEY,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,"Wit h all due respect, that is a fairly tall order. I know that the honourable member's intentions are good, and that undoubtedly shipping is required for the purpose mentioned. We shall do our best to comply with his request. DISFD1TE AT LY.SAGHTS LIMITED.",16
8,Mr HARRISON,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,"Has the Acting Prime Minister been 'advised of the threatened extension of the iron workers' strike at Lysaghts Limited? Is he in a position to reply to the questions that I asked yesterday, seeking confirmation of union policy in regard to the reinstatement of ex-servicemen? Has he considered my suggestion that he warn dissenting unions that the Government will uot countenance any departure from the rc-instatement rights of servicemen, even though their re-instatement may mean a reduction of the status of other unionists displaced ?",16
9,Mr CHIFLEY,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,I am not familiar with all the implications of this matter. I regret that I have not been able to have a full reply prepared to the other questions. I shall have it prepared as quickly as possible. ELASTIC.,16
10,Mr SHEEHY,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,"Can the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs state whether the supplies of elastic released for purchase by the general public may be increased? According to representations that have been made to me from South Australia, some storekeepers impose the condition that other goods must be purchased in order to obtain elastic.",16
11,Mr BEASLEY,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,"Such a condition is contrary to the regulations which govern the matter. If the honourable member will furnish specific information as to where that is occurring, an investigation will he made. I shall consult the Minister for Trade and Customs in regard to increasing supplies of elastic for the use of the general public. BUPPALO-FLY.",16
12,Mr FADDEN,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,"I direct the attention of the Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to the fact that in the Sydney press today there is a full-page advertisement authorized by the New South Wales Minister for Health, in which persons are invited to use D.D.T. freely in their homes for the control of house flies. Can the Minister say whether this may be regarded as an indication that supplies of D.D.T. have been made available to civilians in New South Wales? If they have, will the Minister take steps to ensure that Queensland graziers and other food producers shall be given an equitable share of the available supplies, to enable them to control the spread of buffalo-fly among their herds?",16
13,Mr DEDMAN,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,"I have not read the advertisement to which the right honourable gentleman has referred. My recollection is that supplies of D.D.T. are very scarce, hut I am also under the impression that there has been some reservation, as to its use on a wide scale, because-1 proof is lacking that harmful effect? may not ensue from its general use. However I shall have inquiries made and let the right honourable member know the result. MILK. PRICE-SUPPLY . Mr FRASER,-Has the Acting Prime Minister yet received the report of Professor Giblin on his inquiry regarding milk costs, which was instituted at the request of the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Williams) and myself?",16
14,Mr QHIELEY,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,"In reply to a previous question I said I hoped that the report would be available this week. I had a brief note from Professor Giblin yesterday, or the previous day, informing me that as he had to make another visit to Sydney in connection with the matter his report would not be available till next week. I think he said that it would be ready early next week, and as soon as it is available the honourable member will be informed.",17
15,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS," Having regard to the detrimental effect on the public health of the recurring shortages of milk in the capital cities, particularly Sydney and Melbourne, will the Minister for Health negotiate with the State governments i-oncemed with a view to arranging a permanent correction of this serious deficiency? Mr HOLLO WA Y - I shall certainly consult with the Minister for Health on this matter. AUSTRALIAN ARMY.

16,Mr WHITE,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,"H as the Acting M in ister for Defence read the report of a speech by Brigadier Cremor, at a meeting of the Legacy Club in Melbourne, in which he said that men of the original 6th Division were very tired, and hoped that the Commonwealth Government and the people would recognize that these soldiers had served Australia well for nearly six years, and release them? Is the Government considering the release of those long-service men, if they so desire, or, if they are not to be released will it consider the adoption of a rotation system 'whereby they might be relieved by men who desire to serve in operational areas?",17
17,Mr BEASLEY,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,"I did not read the speech to which the honourable gentleman has referred, but the matter raised is giving the Government some concern because, like all honourable members, it believes that something should be done for men who have served for long periods. On Monday the War Cabinet discussed the matter at some length w i $ i General Sir Thomas Blarney. A decision has not yet been reached as to the course to be followed, but the matter is under serious consideration.",17
18,Mr BERNARD CORSER,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,"Will the Acting Prime Minister consider the appointment of three members of this House to interview Mrs Nora Solly, of Queensland, who is now visiting Canberra in connection with the dispossession of her husband of his f a rm and their home, in his absence as a member of the Australian M i l it a r y Forces, with a view to ensuring that justice shall be done in this case and that no similar case shall arise in future?",17
19,Mr CHIFLEY,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,If the honourable member will furnish particulars of the case I shall arrange for the appropriate Minister to make whatever inquiries are necessary. I do not think that the appointment of a committee of members of this House would assist in the matter.,17
20,Mr CONELAN,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,"I direct the attention of the Acting Minister for Defence to the case of a young Australian, QX49114., Private Alex. Neilson, who has been court-martialed in Brisbane, because, in his anxiety to see active service, he was absent without leave and was later found serving with American troops, in the Philippines. H is service there was marked by brave deeds, and he was recommended for a decoration. Will the Minister give sympathetic consideration to this case, and see that Private Neilson is allowed to satisfy his desire to rejoin his unit, which is now in action?",17
21,Mr BEASLEY,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,Personally . I should favour action along the lines suggested by the honourable member. INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION. PROPOSED REVIEW OF PROCEDURE.,17
22,Mr MORGAN,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,"Will the Minister for Labour and National Service inform the House whether the Government has given consideration to the request of the Australian trade unions' convention in Melbourne recently, for an overhaul of the industrial arbitration system, in order to provide for a greater concentration than in the past on conciliation and the prevention of industrial disputes? Will the Minister also give consideration to the sponsoring of joint production committees of labour and management, which have operated successfully in - Great Britain and the United States of America?",17
23,Mr HOLLOWAY,TRANSPORT OP AUSTRALIANS,"For some time the Government has been discussing with representatives of other sections of the - community the need for a conference, with a responsible person in charge, to OTerhaul the Commonwealth conciliation and arbitration system generally, with a view to greater emphasis being placed on conciliation than it has received in the past. I think that the desirability of appointing production committees was discussed at the recent industrial conference of employers and employees, and that action is being taken along those lines without government intervention. ARBITRATION COURT. EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN - ALLEGED NA JUDICIARY.",18
24,Mr HOLT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I draw the attention of the Acting Attorney-General to the issue of the Century, of. the 10th May, which contains a short paragraph referring to the conference held in Melbourne recently between Commonwealth Ministers and representatives of the trade unions. The newspaper referred to the Minister for Labour and National Service in these termsHe w«» a pathetic figure at the congress, but he tried to get the sympathy of the congress by telling them lie had been double-crossed by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Having regard to the fact that two newspapers have been cited by the court for contempt, on statements arising out of the conference, is the Minister aware of any action which has been instituted by the court, against either that newspaper, assuming the report to be untrue, or against the Minister, assuming it to be correct ?",18
25,Mr BEASLEY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The Minister for Labour and National Service has had a long, honourable and creditable association with the trade unions of this country, and I firmly believe that he would not need to adopt any measures to win their sympathy in connection with problem with which he had to deal. think that is a sufficient answer, in minds of all trade unionists, to this rilous attack upon an honourable man in the Labour movement of this country - matter ? The two newspapers which have been cited in connection with the attack on the court are the Sydney Morning Herald and the Tribune. On a previous occasion I told the honourable member that the action was instituted by the court itself. It requested legal assistance in connection with the presentation of the oase-. Perhaps the Century has not a very wide circulation, and the court may not have read the article. The Solicitor-General may forward a copy of the article to the court, and if the court then decides to take action, the Attorney-General's Department will make available the necessary legal aid. WAR SERVICE AWARDS.",18
26,Mr DALY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Member s of the Militia, the Royal Australian Air Force and the WITH Royal Australian Navy, who have served exclusively in Australia, receive on their discharge no badge or other symbol to indicate that they have given such service. Will the Acting Prime Minister consider arranging for the issue of a badge to members of the forces who have not left Australia to indicate that they have served as members of the armed forces in Australia during the war?",18
27,Mr CHIFLEY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I shall have the honourable member's proposal examined.,18
28,Mr CONELAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Can the Acting Minister for Defence say when the ribbon for the new Pacific Star will be issued to men en titled to wear it I,18
29,Mr BEASLEY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The Acting Prime Minister has referred to this matter twice in the House this week, and has said that negotiations are still proceeding between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the United Kingdom in regard to it. Until all outstanding points are adjusted the distribution of the various stars and ribbons will be held up. CIVIL AVIATION. ROMA AERODROME.",18
30,Mr ADERMANN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Can the Minister for Civil Aviation say whether it is any true that Qantas Empire Airways are I cutting out Roma as a stopping place for the its aeroplanes because of the inadequacy scurof the runways?

32,Mr CONELAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Havin g regard to the fact that recruiting for the Royal Australian A i r Force and the Women's Auxiliary Australian A ir Force has been curtailed, will the Minister for Air see that the signs appealing for recruits are removed? Many young men and women who seek to enlist are disappointed when told that recruits are no longer being accepted. Mr DRAK33FORD - Recruitin g for certain personnel has been suspended for the time .being and the position is being examined in order to decide whether it will he resumed. In the meantime, recruiting signs are allowed to remain in position in case the need should arise to resume recruiting. I shall have consideration given to the advisability of removing the signs. WAR-TIME RESTRICTIONS. M.r. HARRISON - Will the Acting Prime Minister say whether it is a fact, obvious one. as reported in this morning's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald that reference was made by the Acting Prime in caucus, yesterday, to an inter-departmental committee established to examine one who has not. war-time controls, and to recommend the abolition of those no longer required? If so, will he enlighten honourable memcensorship. bers concerning the constitution of conuuittee, and will he arrange that joint parliamentary committee be formed to oonfer with, and to stimulate, departthe ments in their deliberations, and to make urgent recommendations to Parliament as soon as progress has been made?",19
33,Mr CHIFLEY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I stated in reply a question yesterday that the Governbeing ment was examining the matter of wartime controls.,19
34,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,This report states that it is being done by a committee. Who are the .members of the committee?,19
35,Mr CHIFLEY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The examination is being made by a sub-committee of Cabinet. It may be that, in conrelating junction with the sub-committee of Cabinet, representatives of the various [711 departments are also going into the matter. I do not rememiber mentioning an inter-departmental committee, but J do not deny the report. CENSORSHIP.",19
36,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"During the war, there has been 100 per cent, censorship of outward mail from Australia. . Will the Minister for Information say whether this censorship is still operating now that hostilities in Europe have ceased ? If so, will he see that it is suspended wholly or in part so that the persons doing this work may be given more useful employment?",19
37,Mr CALWELL,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The purpose of censorship is to protect the interests of the nation, and the authorities which have exercised, and are exercising, censorship powers are inspired by one purpose onlyto protect the nation from possible saboteurs inside and from enemies outside. But there has never been 100 per cent, censorship of outgoing correspondence.",19
38,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,There has been of mine.,19
39,Mr CALWELL,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I do not propose to draw any deductions from that fact.,19
40,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,No ; but. I can- a very,19
41,Mr CALWELL,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The fact is that a great many other persons have not had Minister, the same experience.",19
42,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I do not know of any,19
43,Mr CALWELL,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I assure the honourable member that it is not 100 per cent, In any case, censorship of this outgoing mail is not exercised by the a same authority which censors matter published in the press or broadcast over radio. The position is being watched continuously, and no surplus staff will be employed on censorship. As a matter of fact, the staff employed under the to Postal Censorship Regulations is now reduced in all capital cities. GERALDTON WAX PLANT. DR UG EXTRACTION.",19
44,Mr BERNARD CORSER,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"On the 22nd March I gave notice of a question to the Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to the extraction of an oil from the Geraldton wax plant which has all the attributes of penicillin without the disadvantages associated with that drug, but the question still remains on the notice-paper; it has appeared on 21 notice-papers. 'Can the Minister say when I may expect a reply?",19

(2.) For the remaining stages, until 8 p.m. on Tuesday, 29th May.",21
56,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [3.11] - The Opposition protests against this truncating of the debate on what has been described rather proudly by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman), who is in . . 36 charge of the measure as a most important . . 17 bill and as the serviceman's charter. The House went into committee on this bill 19 yesterday and we sat until 2 o'clock this .AYES. morning. The committee dealt with nineteen clauses, but, because a very great deal of discussion occurred on clause 4, those in charge of the b i ll became piqued and came to the conclusion that the debate should be curtailed: this motion is the result. All I desire to point out, if not to the House, then, at least, to the people, is that clause 4 represents the actual foundation of this bill, because it determines its scope and what persons are to come within it . Therefore, it merited full discussion. We have in front of us no less than 135 clauses, some of which are of far-reaching importance. I could hardly imagine a more important business for the XOES. National Parliament to attend to. Yet we are told that the time for discussion of these clauses is to be limited to a few hours for each group. On top of that, Frederick we have had a notification from the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) that not only are we to sit u n t i l 2 a.m. each sitting day next week, but also are to commence each day, except the first day, at 10.30 «.m. In other words, the Government, notwithstanding its majority, or perhaps, because of it , is telling us that the business of this country can be the attended to with proper thought, study and debate in sittings of this House lasting fifteen or sixteen hours a day. 11 p.m. this day; Mr SHEEHY - What is wrong with midnight this day; that?",21
57,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Not h in g , if one is 1 a.m. on Friday, 2oth May; asleep for mo3t of the time, but every11.30 a.m. on Friday, 25th thing, if honourable members are May; expected to give proper consideration to the legislation before them. We saw yesterday time after time examples of the Minister being invited to explain important clauses and not knowing what they meant, and if ' those who have all the resources of the Government and the departments behind them still remain vague and uncertain in their minds as to the meaning of those provisions, how are private members of the Opposition to be expected' to direct their minds clearly to them. Mr Calwell. - The right honourable gentleman does not deny that the Opposition has been stone-walling?",21
58,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"No one can honestly say that any speech which I made on this subject in committee was longwinded and not to the point. I take my duty in committee on a bill of this kind very seriously. The position is that from now on we shall reach points where, notwithstanding that there may be very grave matters left to be considered, the guillotine will come down and they will be voted on without consideration at all. However, the longer I speak now the less time there will be for discussion in committee, so I make my protest and resume my seat.",22
59,Mr BARNARD,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Bass) [3.16] - I entirely agree with the concluding remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) that the longer we debate this motion the less time we shall have to consider the clauses of the bill in mittee; but many of his supporters do not follow his example, because at least half a dozen of them rose immediately he sat down. So much for that aspect. The right honourable gentleman has always been concise and always good to listen to. I hope that that admission will not be used against me on some future occasion. That is also true of the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden), but it does not apply to quite a number of Opposition members who used every available opportunity - to stone-wall this measure, and it is of no use for theim to deny it. They rose at every opportunity and said nothing. They stretched the Standing Orders to the breaking point in their efforts to discuss anything but the matter that was 'before the Chair in' order to waste time and stone-wall, on the specious plea that they were trying to dosomething to benefit' the servicemen* They claim to be the chaanipions of theex-servicemen for whom they would have the people ibelieve on one else has any consideration. That cuts no ice with, us or the people.",22
60,Mr BOWDEN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Does it not?,22
61,Mr BARNARD,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"No , as the honourable member will discover.",22
62,Mr BOWDEN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,The honourable member will discover that it does before we are finished.,22
63,Mr BARNARD,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"We have heard that story before. The point I particularly want to make at this stage is that members of the Opposition have themselves, to blame for the introduction of the guillotine in order to expedite the passage of this urgent measure. It is very important that it should be speedily passed in order that the organization necessary to administer it may be completed in time to meet the needs of members of the forces who will soon be discharged in greater numbers. Over 100,000 persons have already been disrcharged from the services.",22
64,Mr HOLT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"300,000 .",22
65,Mr BARNARD,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"That strengthensmy point. Had honourable members opposite f ollowed the example set by the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party in the committee discussion, the Government comwould not need to apply the guillotine.",22
66,Mr FADDEN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party) [3.21] - I support the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) in protesting against the limitation of debate on this important measure. Honourable members opposite, including the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman), who is in charge of the bill, have emphasized that this is the most important legislation that we have been called upon to consider since the war began. One does not need to go into details to show the necessity for giving to it the fullest possible consideration. However, the bill as drafted is clouded in obscurity. Many of its more important provisions require careful .clarification. It is regrettable that the Government has decided to limit debate in this way. It has been forced to take that course solely because of its mishandling of the - measure; the Opposition parties bare been eager to cooperate with the Government in dealing with the bill. When the Minister circulated 34 proposed amendments after the completion of the second reading debate, it was impossible for us to proceed in committee without being given an opportunity to examine them. We asked that the committee stage be postponed to the following day, but that was entirely inadequate to enable us to do our duty and thoroughly examine the proposed alterations. Indeed, on the second reading I moved an amendment for the purpose of having the bill withdrawn and redrafted. Whilst the Government refused to accept that amendment, the circulation of so many amendments meaus that the Government has pi*-actically redrafted the measure. I repeat that the Government is now forced to curtail the debate because of its earlier inaction and its failure to study its proposals thoroughly.",22
67,Mr DALY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Martin) [3.23] - I congratulate the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) upon his motion, because the patience of honourable members on this side of the chamber has been exhausted after listening for the last couple of days to unnecessary repetition and reiteration by honourable members opposite in a deliberate attempt to stonewall the measure. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) invariably made two speeches on every point raised in committee. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) repeatedly rose in mock indignation on points that had been thoroughly discussed, and made no attempt to offer constructive criticism, whilst the honourable ber for New England. (Mr Abbott) invariably repeated himself when he was on hia feet. If the time proposed to he allotted for the remaining stages is not sufficient to enable honourable members opposite to debate the measure intelli-' gently, it is time that they gave up debating. I am not impressed by the indignation assumed by honourable members opposite. Following the defeat of the Government led by the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), subsequent governments adopted "" standover "" tactics so far as the Opposition was concerned, and did not hesitate to force through important measures, regardless of protests against the limitation of debate. Now, when the boot is on the other foot, we hear squealsand cat-calls from honourable members opposite. Not only this measure, which is long overdue, but also other important legislation awaits our attention. Owing to the obstructive tactics of honourable members opposite very little has yet been done this session. They continue to obstruct the Government in utter disregard of the interests of the people. I support the motion because it will obviate unnecessary debating, and because I believe that the time proposed to he alloted for the remaining stages is quite sufficient to enable the measure to be considered thoroughly and intelligently.",23
68,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Moreton) [3.2.6] - I protest against the application of the guillotine to this measure. This legislation affects the well-being and future of all members of the fighting services. I remind the House that but for the efforts o£ the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) and the right honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Fadden) the committee would have passed a clause which would have made enemy aliens eligible for all benefits to be made available under the measure. The Opposition has saved the country from that indignity, and ex-servicemen from a grave injustice. That fact indicates that the Government itself has not given thorough consideration to the proposals embodied in the measure. Furthermore, when the House went into committee the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr. Dedman) circulated 34 amendments mem- which he proposed to move. It has already been made clear that the Minister himself did not fully understand the purport of those amendments. On several occasions last night, the Leader of the Opposition had to explain to him as well as honourable members the meaning of certain clauses. In my long experience in this Parliament I have not seen such bad handling of a measure by the Minister in charge of it. Although the bill consists of eleven parts, each with a number of divisions, we have not yet concluded consideration of Part I . We have yet to consider proposals under the headings of reinstatement in employment, preference in employment, apprenticeship, vocational training, disabled persons, demobilization, land settlement and housing. Any one of those subjects demands the fullest consideration. However, the Government is not showing an intelligent interest in those problems. Honourable members opposite have been dumb, and have made no attempt to debate the measure constructively. I repeat that had it not been, for honourable members on this side the Government would have forced through a clause making enemy aliens eligible for all the benefits made available to ex-service personnel under the measure.",23
69,Mr MARTENS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Herbert) [3.28] - I have rarely witnessed a more amusing position in this House than at this juncture. I have been a member of the House for a long time, and when I and my colleagues were on the Opposition benches, we protested against the guillotine just as emphatically as honourable members opposite now protest. Of course, honourable members opposite are acting within their rights as an opposition in adopting their present attitude. At the same time, however, the Government has the responsibility of putting through its legislation. The motion .by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) is more than justified, on this occasion because the Opposition is deliberately holding up this legislation. This obstruction has been carefully organized, not only in this chamber, but also from outside, in an attempt to embarrass the Government. In such circumstances, I commend the Acting Prime Minister for applying the guillotine.",24
70,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Barker) [3.30] - This is the first occasion on which this Government, the self-styled champion of free speech, has dared to apply the guillotine. Last night, right out of the blue, the Minister for Postwar Eeconstruction (Mr Dedman) moved the ""gag"". The actual facts in regard to the second-reading debate on this bill, are that more speakers rose from the Government side of the chamber than from the Opposition. The debate continued for a number of days, and the records of Hansard, even if they were examined under a microscope, will not reveal that any honourable member opposite made one critical comment on the bill. Government supporters were like a chorus of vocal ru'tiber stamps. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Fraser) may shake his leonine head, but he showed no characteristics of the lion in the debate. Although he threatened freedom of action in committee, we have not seen any evidence of it. Government supporters wasted time, and, in their eulogies of the bill, I repeat, to be reminded us of a chorus of vocal rubber stamps. When certain honourable members on this side of the chamber pointed out vital defects, one of which will go down in history as being without parallel in the introduction of legislation, a few Government supporters, including the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Conelan), who reminds me of the White Rabbit in Alice in Wonderland, discovered grave doubts as to whether this bill should be passed in its present form. Then there were goings to and fro. The Minister in charge of the bill quite obviously did not understand it, and became extremely annoyed when certain defects were pointed out to him. When the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) asked for information, the Minister sat back like a sulky calf which would not take its milk. He declined to answer the questions. When he was effectively "" s t y m i e d h e resorted to the time-honored method of escaping from the difficulty by applying the ""gag"". To the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), I say that application of the guillotine is a better method than the moving of the "" gag"" to expedite the discussion of the bill. The only time that the committee showed any signs of making progress yesterday was when the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ungraciously retired from the chamber for quite a while, and the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) replaced him. If the Acting Prime Minister desires Government legislation to be delayed in future, all he will have to do will be to place the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction in charge of it. If the Minister will not prove the most effective barrier to movement that has ever been devised, I know nothing about parliamentary procedure.",24
71,Mr CHIFLEY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The Minister for Postwar Reconstruction is a Scotsman, like the honourable member for Barker.",25
72,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I am a Highlander. I have not forgotten what Robert Burns said on that point, and I may quote it before the end of the day. One important requirement in committee is that the Minister in charge of the bill shall have an accurate and intimate knowledge of its contents. Last night-, hour after hour, time after time, it was proved that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction knew no more about it than he does about the man in the moon; and he has seen the man in the moon from a distance of a quarter of a million miles, and possibly has not studied him at all. Serious issues have yet to be decided. The committee could usefully employ a whole day in discussing clause 101, which relates to soldier settlement, and another day in dealing with clause 102, which is concerned with housing. That urgent matters like soldier settlement and housing shall be disposed of in two clauses is without parallel in the history of Australian legislation. The bill gives to the Government the biggest blank cheque that has ever been issued in the history of Australian politics.",25
73,Mr CONELAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Griffith) [3.35] After having listened to the Barker .Fiihrer,25
74,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I shall give the honourable member a lesson in the pronunciation of the German language.,25
75,Mr CONELAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The honourable member should be the last person in this chamber to adivocate freedom of. speech, because he is so conservative that, if he bad his way. he would not permit any freedom of expression. The Opposition has been staging a sham fight for the benefit of the gentlemen representing various ex-servicemen's organizations. Those gentlemen have watched the antics of honourable members opposite, and know that they are not sincere in their endeavours to assist returned soldiers. ""What ex-servi.cem.en desire is action, not tination such as honourable members opposite have displayed on this bill. This measure was introduced on the 23rd March, and any honourable member opposite who claims that he has not had sufficient time to study it should, not be here.",25
76,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"At the conclusion of. the second-reading debate, the Minister in charge of the bill circulated 34 amendments.",25
77,Mr CONELAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Most of them are minor amendments.,25
78,Mr HOLT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Has the honourable member examined them ?,25
79,Mr CONELAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The Opposition's legal luminary, the honourable member for Warringah. (Mr Spender), is satisfied with the bill, because, after making his speech, he disappeared. In the second reading debate, 24 honourable members out of 49 on this side of the chamber spoke; that is less than 50 per cent. At the last election, the people left bits and pieces to the number of 24 representatives of the anti-Labour parties, and 22 of them participated in the second-reading debate. The other two were absent.",25
80,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,That is evidence of an efficient Opposition.,25
81,Mr CONELAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Honourable members opposite accuse Government supporters of having wasted time, hut almost 100 per cent, of their number spoke on the second-reading, whilst less than 50 per cent, of us participated in that debate. Therefore, it is easy to understand why the bill has been so long delayed. During the second-reading debate, members of the Opposition repeatedly asked for an extension of time, and even a second extension.",25
82,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,But their requests were refused.,25
83,Mr CONELAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"At the beginning of the debate, their requests were granted. When they made a "" welter"" of. it, the Government declined to accede to any further requests for extensions of time. Now, honourable members have had their "" side-show "" and I am pleased that the Government has applied the guillotine. The Government should proceed with other urgent legislation, expediting progress with the guillotine if the stonewalling tactics of. the Opposition procrasrender its use necessary. One of the most important bills, apart from the measure now under consideration, is the Commonwealth Bank Bill. Honourable members opposite do not desire it to become law. The Government has set it aside temporarily to enable the Re-establishment and Employment Bill to be dealt with, so that hundreds of thousands of men will not be unemployed after demobilization. The Opposition desires to see them unemployed. Honourable members opposite want a great reservoir of unemployed for the big vested interests. That is the reason why they are delaying the passing of this bill.",25
84,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,The honourable member would be a great success on the stage as a comedian.,26
85,Mr CONELAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The honourable member would not be a success as a comedian, even as the Barker Fuehrer. The time that has been allotted to this motion is one hour, and honourable bers opposite will occupy the whole it with their protests. They should have started their delaying tactics, having done so, they must suffer consequences. Last night, even when the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction agreed' to accept certain amendments, the Opposition staged a sham fight and some motion has expired. spoke as many as four times on a paragraph and a proposed amendment to it. They were not satisfied when the agreed to. Minister assured them that he would The House divided. insert their amendments in the correct places, but continued to waste time. They do not want the Minister to agree to amendments. They want to waste time. I contend that so long as an amendment which they favoured was incorporated in the bill, they should not worry when it is done. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honorBarnard, H .

86,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Wentworth) [8.40]. Burke, T. P. - Honourable members opposite complain Calwell, A.

It has been held up for two Daly, P. M . years by the Prime Minister (Mr Drakeford, Dedman, J. J. Curtin) and other honourable members Fraser, A. D . opposite, notwithstanding the assurance Frost, C.

When the Australian 'Soldiers' RepatriaJames, It. tion Bill was before the House in 1943, I moved an amendment providing for preference in employment to returned soldiers, 'but the amendment was defeated. After that, no action was taken until the 24th March of this year, when this bill was introduced. Therefore, the charge that this legislation has been delayed can be more fairly levelled at the Government. The honourable member for Griffith (Mr Conelan) said that we have had an opportunity to examine this bill since the 24th March, and therefore should have been ready to go ahead with it. I remind the honourable member that although caucus has held many meetings to discuss this measure, honourable members opposite, like driven cattle, have not been prepared to contribute one constructive suggestion towards making the bill workable.

Clause 20(1.) The Minister may appoint a Reinstatement Committee i u each State and Territory of the Commonwealth. (2.) Each Reinstatement Committee shall consist of a chairman, one member to represent persons who have rendered war service and one member to represent employers. (5.) Panels of persons to represent persons who have rendered war service and employers respectively shall be selected in such manner as the Minister determines, and the members of a Reinstatement Committee, other than the chairman, shall be selected from the panels in such manner as the Minister determines. (U.) A person shall not act as a member of a Reinstatement Committee at any meeting which considers any matter in which that person has a direct interest as the applicant for reinstatement in employment or the employee, or as the employer or former employer, or as a member of the firm or company which is the employer or former employer. (8.) The Minister may determine the remuneration and allowances (if any) which shall lie paid to members of Reinstatement Committees.",26
88,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [3.43] - I move That, in sub-clause (2.), the words "" and one member to represent employers "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-"" , one member to represent employers and one member to represent employees."" This clause deals with the establishment of reinstatement committees, and there are two reasons for the appointment of a representative of the employees on each. The first reason is that the amendment will bring the committees into line with other re-establishment committees which will be set up under this bill to deal with training, employment services, disablement, and preference, on which the employees will NOES. be represented. It appears to me that the employees should be represented on any committee of this nature on which the employers are represented. The second reason is that many questions of industrial practice will arise in the determination of reinstatement problems, and dt will be to the advantage of the coanimattees to have the experience of representatives of the employees. The act in Great Britain provides for employees to be represented on similar committees.",27
89,Mr MEETZLES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,On a committee of four?,27
90,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Not necessarily on a committee of four, but the British act provides for the employees to be represented. Since the reinstatement committees will have to do very important work in connection with industrial practices, regarding which employees' representatives generally are very well versed, they will be strengthened by the inclusion of employees' representatives.",27
91,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Moreton) [3.52] - I hope that the Minister will not persist with this amendment, which is a sinister move to reproduce the unfortunate circumstances at Lysaght's factory in New South ""Wales, where 1,700 men are now on strike. The bill provides in the first place for each committee to consist of a chairman, a representative of the employees-becaus e the soldier will be the representative of the employees-and a representative of the employers. In every industry in which a serviceman's claim to reinstatement is challenged, he will be represented by an employee who is an ex-serviceman. If this amendment be carried, it is probable that the employers' representative and the employees' union representative will unite when they are opposed to the reinstatement of an ex-serviceman in order to push him out. That would be quite wrong. The constitution of the committees as proposed in the clause as it stands is adequate. Who are chiefly concerned as to whether an ex-serviceman should return to his former employment or not ? Obviously, the man himself and his prospective employer. There is no issue affecting the unions which would entitle them to representation on the committees. I ask honourable members not to accept the Minister's amendment, and I appeal to the Minister to re-examine it. We have an instance at Lysaghts today in which the unions object to the reinstatement of an ex-serviceman. They contend that he should not be given any consideration for promotion, preferment, or even maintenance of his former status in respect of the period during which he was overseas. They want to push him into a back room instead of allowing him to take up the position to which the employer wishes to appoint him. If the unions be represented on the reinstatement committees, they will do the same thing whenever it suits their purposes.",27
92,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Balaclava) [3.56] - I see no necessity for the amendment moved by the Minister, and I shall support the amendment which the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Erancis) proposes to move later. If the Minister presses his amendment, he may aggravate the labour difficulties that have already arisen in Australia. When a soldier returns from service and seeks reinstatement in his former job, there is no need to bring in representatives of the unions to consider his case. The matter re3ts between the ex-serviceman and the employer, and penalties are already provided for the employer who does not do the right thing. If the amendment moved by the Minister be agreed to, I foresee an extension of the industrial trouble which unfortunately is already a shameful feature of our economy. Nearly 2,000 men have gone on strike at Lysaght's factory because a soldier, after serving abroad, has returned to his former position, and the case must now go to the courts to be settled. iSuoh industrial upsets would he aggravated if the wrong men were appointed to the reinstatement committees. Ministers and supporters of the Government, who are associated with trade unions, know that there are many men in the unions today whom they would be glad to be rid of. I refer to men such as Mr Thornton, of the Federated Iron workers Union, and Mr Wells, of the ""oal-miners federation, both of whom are Communists. If one of these men were appointed to a reinstatement committee, as will be possible if the amend not ment be agreed to, the soldiers would face many difficulties. Imagine their bitterness if , after honourable service abroad, some chap who has "" slept in his bed o' nights"" while they have been fighting",28
93,Mr HADLKY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Tomm y White is talking tommy rot.,28
94,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The honourable member does not understand the position. He is ignoring the implications of the proposed amendment. It may lead to such disturbances as are occurring at Lysaght's factory today. The Waterside Workers Federation has closed its books against new members. How, then, can we place a man in waterside work unless the federation co-operates? The only satisfactory answer to obstruction of this kind is for the soldiers to form their own unions, which they are perfectly entitled to do. They can register at the Arbitration Court and form a new organization if they are denied admission to an existing union. I hope that I have made clear to the Minister the difficulties that may arise and the reason why it is hot necessary to have another party interfering between the employer and the employee when every circumstance affecting pay, status, seniority and so forth is already covered in the bill. I ask the Minister to leave the clause as it stands. Amendment agreed to.",28
95,Mr BOWDEN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Gippsland) [3.59] I move That, at the end of sub-clause (2.). the following words be added:-""bot h of whom shall .be servicemen "". This will cover all the difficulties that honourable members have foreseen. The amendment does not require explanation or amplification, because it is obviously desirable in a measure dealing with servicemen.",28
96,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [4.0] - I cannot accept the amendment. But I give the assurance that all members of the reinstatement committee will be ex-servicemen, so far as that may be practicable. I do want to make the rule inflexible, because in an exceptional case the most suitable representative of either the employers or the employees might be a non-serviceman.",28
97,Mr RYAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Flinders) [4.1] - I am sorry that the Minister cannot accept the amendment. His explanation is that a person most suitable for appointment amy not be an ex-serviceman. There will not be the slightest difficulty in that respect. The number of committees will not be large. All the difficulties mentioned by the honourable members for Moreton (Mr Francis) and Balaclava (Mr White) would be removed by the insertion of the amendment. I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision.,29
98,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Balaclava) [4.2] - We are thankful to have the assurance of the Minister because, in every instance, it will be possible to appoint an ex-serviceman.",29
99,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"If it is possible in every instance, an ex-serviceman will be appointed.",29
100,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"It could be made possible by obtaining a panel of the names of persons suitable for appointment from the federal executive or a State branch of. the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, from the Fathers Association, or from the Air Force Association. There need never be any deviation from the principle. Amendment negatived.",29
101,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Moreton) [4.3] - I move That, after sub-clause (2.), the following new sub-clause be inserted:"" (2 A . ) Any organization representing discharged members of the Forces throughout the Commonwealth may, in respect of any Reinstatement Committee, submit to the Minister a list containing the names of not less than three persons from which the organization recommends that a selection be made of a person to be appointed as one of the members of the - Reinstatement Committee and the Minister may appoint a person selected from the list so submitted to be one of the members of the Reinstatement Committee."". This principle is extensively applied under other Commonwealth legislation. Sub-section 2 of section 8 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act contains almost an identical provision. It readsAny organization representing returned soldiers throughout the Commonwealth may submit to the Minister a list containing the names of not less than three persons from which the organization recommends that a selection be made of a person to be appointed as one of the Commissioners, and the Governor General may appoint a person selected from any list so submitted to be one of the Commissioners. That principle is applied also in respect of the entitlement and assessment tribunals. It has been in operation since 1920, and has proved most effective, for the reason that the executive officers of ex-servicemen's organizations are themselves ex-servicemen who have served the organizations for a long term of years, in some instances for 25 and even 30 years. They are specially qualified to discharge work of this kind. All of them have had honourable war service, and have brought to the solution of problems affecting ex-servicemen the thorough knowledge of experts. Because of their knowledge and experience, and the fact that they are so well known, .any decision which they might give against an ex-serviceman is accepted as the result of a fair inquiry. The bill is full of loop-holes, irritations and annoyances. If the Minister accepts the amendment, ex-servicemen will have greater confidence in it. Recently, the Parliament passed the Wool Use Promotion Bill which embodies this principle, in that under it the Australian Wool growers Council and the Australian Wool Producers Federation will each have the right to nominate three representatives for appointment to the Australian Wool Board. Those are the only organizations of consequence in the wool industry. Because of the vital need to establish confidence among ex-servicemen, I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.",29
102,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,'Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [4.7] - I am not prepared to accept the amendment. I assure the honourable' member that what he desires is being given effect.,29
103,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Then why not accept it?,29
104,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"In this division, the bill merely replaces the existing regulations, which have been administered by the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway), who has followed the practice suggested by the honourable member. Therefore, it is not necessary to embody the amendment in the bill.",29
105,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Balaclava) [4.8] - If the Minister has correctly stated the position, the acceptance of the amendment should not present any difficulty. He has described the .bill as the servicemen's charter. It is nothing of the kind, because it embodies provisions for the rehabilitation of civilians. That is not the position in other dominions. During the second-reading debate, I pointed out that in New Zealand, there is a rehabilitation board, the head of which is a colonel of the forces with a distinguished war record and academic qualifications, and every other member of which is an ex-serviceman. There is similar provision in South Africa. Yet in Australia, although a larger number of ex-service personnel will have to be dealt with, civilians who may have rehabilitation problems are to come within the scope of this legislation, notwithstanding the fact that already their needs are catered for by the Man Power Directorate, as well as by unemployment and sickness benefits. The whole of the administration in relation to the ex-serviceman should be in charge of persons who understand their problems by reason of the experience they have gained from the last war, the present war, or both. If the Minister adopted that principle, he would have no difficulty in accepting the amendment, so ensuring that in the initial contacts which the serviceman makes in the negotiations for his re-establishment in civil life, his problems shall be understood.",30
106,Mr BERNARD COSSER,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Wide Bay) [4.11] - I fail to understand why the Minister cannot accept the reasonable amendment submitted by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis). Surely the Minister does not wish to retain absolute control in the administration of the act. That would introduce a new principle. There would be nothing unfair in permitting the servicemen's organizations to submit a panel of three representatives, from whom one could be selected. Of course the Minister may claim that he is a superman, and will always appoint the right person as the representative of the servicemen, but he will not always occupy his present ministerial position. In practice such appoint- Government. ments are made, not by the Minister, but by the officers of his department. The bill should at least reflect the wishes of a majority of the members of this committee. The Minister should not refuse to grant a reasonable request made by a section of the committee on behalf of the servicemen. About 60 such amendments will be submitted, mostly at the request of servicemen's organizations. The Minister himself has circulated 34 amendments to this bill, which contains 135 clauses, yet he has already curtailed consideration of the bill by the application of the closure. The small amendment now before the committee would not confer great benefit on anybody, but it would at least ensure representation of the servicemen which had been approved by their organizations. If the Minister does not accept the amendment he will show that he is still prepared to allow the officers of his department to have whom they like appointed to bodies of this kind, irrespective of the wishes of honourable members.",30
107,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Moreton) [4.15] The Minister's reply indicates that he spoke without thinking of what he was saying. He stated that the regulations in operation today have a certain effect, and that when this measure becomes law the regulations will be replaced by the act; but I urge the Minister to accept the safeguard for which my amendment provides. A similar provision is contained in the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act.",30
108,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Sub-claus e 5 deals with the matter mentioned by the honourable member. Mr ERANICIiS - That has no bearing on my proposal.,30
109,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,It deals with panels ,30
110,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Not where necessary. In order to give confidence with regard to an important provision in this measure, I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment. Very few servicemen are satisfied with the bill, particularly the provisions regarding preference in employment. The Minister should show that he has an interest in the servicemen's organizations, which understand rehabilitation problems better than the bureaucrats who advise the Amendment negatived. Mr DEDiMAN (Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in - charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [4.17] - I move That, after sub-clause (4.), the following now subclauses be inserted:"" (4 A . ) All questions before a Reinstatement Committee shall be decided by a majority of votes. ""(4u.) The chairman shall have a deliberative vote and, in the event of an equality of votes, shall also have a casting vote."" The insertion of those sub-clauses is necessary because of the amendment which increases the personnel of the committees from three to four.",30
111,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,That has never been done.,31
112,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"It is an accomplished fact, and the consequential amendment now proposed should be made. Amendment agreed to. Amendments (by Mr Dedman) agreed toThat, in sub-clause (5.) the words ""and employers respectively"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thei.eof the following words:-""to represent employers, and to represent employees, respectively"".

113,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"New England) [4.2,2]. - Will the members of the Reinstatement Committees be .engaged on these duties full-time, and what fees will they be paid? I understand that the Minister may not be able to say just how much they will receive, but he can give some indication of the manner in which they are to be remunerated. Is it expected that some of thorn will give their services in an honorary capacity?",31
114,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Corio-Minister for Post-w.ar Reconstruction and Minister in charge of ,the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) amendment provides that members of the Reinstatement Committees shall receive remuneration at rates to be determined by the Minister. That is the .answer to the honourable member's question.",31
115,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,But has not the Minister any idea of what the rates will be?,31
116,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The amount will depend upon the time they devote to the work, and that will depend on how much work ds to be done. Some will be employed on a full-time basis, and some - on a part-time basis. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 21 (Extension of periods within which application, &c, may be made).",31
117,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [4.25] - This provides one way of dealing with the matter which I mentioned when clause 10 was under discussion last night, namely, whether the period should be for one month or three months.",31
118,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I promised to examine the matter.,31
119,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I suggest that it might be dealt with either by extending the period from one month to three months, which I would have thought the better way, or by fitting clause 10 into the structure of clause 21. Clause agreed to. Division 2 - Preference in Employment. Clause 22 (Repeal of section 117 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act).",31
120,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Moreton) [4.26] - I rise to object to the proposed repeal of section 117 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. The 'Government has seen fit to reduce the period of preference to ex-servicemen to seven years. This is regrettable. I should like to be assured that, at the end of the seiven years' period, the preference which the ex-serviceman enjoys today will be preserved to hkn. I was amazed to learn that the Government proposed .to reduce the measure of preference provided in the Repatriation Act of 1943, which is the foundation .of this bill. The Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) promised, without any qualification, tp .[4.23] - The extend preference in industry to soldier? fighting in this war. However, nothing was done about it until the honourable member for Henty (Mr Coles) moved in the matter. At that time, the honourable member represented the Government's majority. I do not place the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Wilson) in the same category, because he followed the Government blindly on every occasion. Indeed, it was only in regard to preference to servicemen that the honourable member for Henty did not also follow the Government blindly. The present measure of preference has been forced on the Government against the violent objection of the trade unions. I am afraid that when the seven years preference period expires ex-servicemen will be left high and dry. As it is, the Government is proposing to give only the bare minimum in the way of preference, and that because it has been forced to do so. At the Australian Labour party conference in Melbourne, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman), when he was being strafed by the trade unions in connection with the Government's preference proposal, made a statement by way of apology. He was reported as follows in the Melbourne Age, of the 31st MarchThe Federal Government's bill made provision for both returned soldiers and civilians who had served in combat areas. It might be that in the selection of a man for a job a civilian who had served for a long period in a forward area would secure a job in preference to a returned soldier who had served for only a short period in New Guinea. Mr. DEDMAN - Can the honourable member vouch for the authenticity of that statement?",31
121,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Yes, because the honourable member for Henty has not denied it. The report continues"" The Labour party has got itself into this position and, in my opinion, the very best thing it can do, if it wants to avoid disruption, is to endorse this bill . "" Mr Dedman said the history of the preference bill began in 1043, when ""the Labour Government without a majority and relying on the support of Mr Coles, Independent, Victoria, for its continuance in office in the House of Representatives, wns. amending the Repatriation Art in the Federal Parliament. During the debate on that bill, the Opposition moved an amendment to give preference to returned soldiers, and Mr Coles told the Government that unless it accepted that amendment or gave some undertaking to grant preference in a later bill, he could no longer support the Government. Mr Dedmau said: "" If the Prime Minister had not made the decision which he did at that time, the Labour Government would have been out on its neck before the last election."". The Minister has not denied the accuracy of the report, nor has he asked the honourable member for Henty to deny it. There has been no denial of the authenticity of the statement, or of the facts. I am not so concerned as to whether the statement was made as I am with th? facts. The honourable member for Henty undoubtedly did what the Minister said.",32
122,Mr FROST,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Is the honourable member sure?,32
123,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I am certain of it, because the honourable member has not denied it. These proposals provide for a limited preference to servicemen; and at the end of seven years even that preference will disappear, and the legislation will not be worth a snap of the fingers. I ask the committee to preserve to service men and women the benefits conferred on them by the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act and other legislation. The Commonwealth Public Service Act provides for preference to service personnel in the Public Service and in contracts entered into by Commonwealth departments. That preference is complete and absolute, and is not subject to qualifications or limitations; but it will disappear if this clause be agreed to. I ask the committee to save the existing preference so that when the seven years' period expires ex-service men and women will at least have the preference that they have now.",32
124,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Wentworth) [4.33;|. - This clause seeks to repeal section 117 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act 1920-1943. The history of that section is interesting, Against the wishes of the present Government, an amendment to give preference to returned soldiers in the Commonwealth Public Service was made. I shall not relate all the circumstances, because honourable members know them, but it is significant that the action then taken by the Government to resist the granting of preference characterizes its actions today. The Government seeks the repeal of provisions which give complete preference to returned soldiers within the Public Service. While such an important subject is under discussion only two Ministers and six private members occupy the Government benches; the other 41 members of the Labour party are absent from the chamber. That indicates the interest that they have in matters affecting servicemen. iSection 117 (1) of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act reads(]..) Notwithstanding anything contained any law of the Commonwealth or of any State or Territory of the Commonwealth, or in any iiward, order or determination of any industrial tribunal or of any industrial agreement, preference'shall, in the appointment of persons to the Public Service of the Commonwealth or to the service of an authority of the Commonwealth, be given to persons who have been members of the forces and have served outside Australia or in any area prescribed as a. combat area for the purpose of this act and who arc competent for the work required. Honourable members will observe that that section provides for absolute preference to returned soldiers within the Commonwealth Public Service. But it goes further, for sub-section 2 provides(2.) All contracts entered into with the Commonwealth for the performance of works or services shall be deemed to contain a whorol.y the contractor with the Commonwealth hinds himself, under a penalty . . to grant, in engaging employees for the purpose of executing the contract, preference to persons specified in sub-sections (1.) of this section. That preference was worth having, and was valued by service men and women, but the Government now seeks to take it from them and to give to them an unspecified measure of preference. If the Minister in charge of the bill will cease conferring with his immature advisers in the corner",32
125,Mr FROST,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,That is unfair.,33
126,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,It is not unfair.,33
127,Mr FROST,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,The officers cannot defend themselves.,33
128,The CHAIRMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I ask the Minister for Repatriation to cease interjecting. , Mr HARRISON - If the Minister in charge of the bill does not know anything about the measure, I suggest that he get a returned soldier to tell him what it means.",33
129,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I know more about the bill than does the honourable member.,33
130,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The Minister is continuously seeking advice about the bill. I tell him that if section 117 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act is repealed, the preference now given to returned soldiers in the Public Service will disappear. It is possible that this legislation will be challenged in the High Court. During the last referendum campaign we on this side said that under the defence power of the Constitution the Government had power to introduce a in bill to provide for the rehabilitation of returned service men and women, but the Government claimed that it had not that power. Now it has introduced a bill which it previously said would be unconstitutional. The Government should not introduce a bill of doubtful constitutionality which would take from servicemen their right to preference.",33
131,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Shoul d thit legislation be challenged, it will be challenged only by people whom the honourable member represents.",33
132,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"If the honorabl* member were not one of a number of dumb-driven cattle, he would exercise his private opinion in this matter. The Minister and his satellites who sit behind clause him are prepared to repeal legislation which confers considerable benefits on service men and women. The history of this subject is well known. Honourable members know that on a previous occasion I moved for the inclusion of a provision to give preference to ex-service personnel, and that an assurance was given by the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) thai legislation to give that preference would be introduced. That promise has not been honoured. Honourable members also know what was done in the Senate in connection with this matter. Mr Frost interjecting,",33
133,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,If the Minister for Repatriation will concentrate on apples and not interfere in matters of which he knows nothing,33
134,The CHAIRMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Order ! I ask the honourable member to eonrfine his remarks to the clause.,33
135,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I am dealing with the clause, as you would know if you listened to me instead of roaring at me. In the existing legislation returned servicemen have something of value. It should ihe preserved until replaced by something better, and nothing better is likely under this bill. On the contrary, their right to preference in employment in the Commonwealth Public Service will be shorn from them and they will have to share a general right to preference with munition workers and others brought within the scope of the bill by clause 32. The Minister, as a former soldier, should know that that is not a fair deal to the returned men. We have no power over the State services, but we have unchallengeable power to ensure preference to soldiers in the Commonwealth service. The Government, however, proposes that we should exchange the security that the soldiers enjoy under that preference for something of little value.",33
136,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [4.42] - I cannot accept the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Francis. He considers that section 117 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act should be retained. One of the main reasons why the Government has introduced legislation relating to pseference to returned soldiers is to ensure that preference shall be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. should be obvious that it is not possible for the Commonwealth to operate two preference laws at the same time. Section 117 provides that preference shall be granted to men who have served in the forces outside Australia or in any combat area, whereas this bill provides that preference shall be given to members of the forces, whether they have served outside Australia or not. If section 117 were not repealed, which law would operate? Are we to give preference in the Commonwealth Public Service, in the service of Commonwealth authorities, boards, &c, and in employment given by the Commonwealth through contractors or subcontractors, to members of the forces who have served outside Australia, and in, all other forms of employment to members of the forces regardless of where they have served? Obviously, the two cannot function concurrently. honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison), for his own purposes, adduced as an argument for the retention of section 117 that there was some doubt about the constitutionality of this measure. He said that this bill would be challenged. However, I am sure that when we reach the clause limiting the operation of preference to seven years he will say that there is no doubt about the validity of granting preference without limitation. It suits him now to say that there is a doubt. I put it to the committee that it is not possible for the two preference provisions to remain in operation at the same time. We want preference to be uniform in all occupations in every State of the Commonwealth. For that reason, the Government considers that it is essential that section 117 of the Repatriation. Act should be repealed.",34
137,Mr BERNARD CORSER,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Wide Ray) [4.46] - The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) said that the Government must have uniform preference legislation and that it would be impossible to have preference operating under two acts at the one time. That is exactly what we are complaining about. No one on this side claims that the two should operate at the same time. Our complaint is against It the withdrawal of the preference given in the one act and its non-restoration in this legislation, which restricts preference to seven years, whereas,, hitherto, there has been no time limit. Moreover, this bill will give preference, not only to returned soldiers, but to many others who have never served in the forces. The Minister has claimed that wo doubt the validity of this measure, and he seeks to impress upon the committee that it is valid. Recently, I asked him some questions. This was his replyAnythingthat I wish to say in regard to preference to returned servicemen and the constitutional aspects of the legislation now before the House, I propose to say when the Ke-establishmcnt and Employment Bill is under consideration, particularly that portion of it relating to preference. The legislation is under consideration now. Therefore, I repeat the questions. Was he correctly reported in the Sydney The Morning Herald as having told the trade union convention in Melbourne that preference to returned soldiers was constitutional because it came within the defence power of the Constitution?",34
138,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"For seven years, yes.",35
139,Mr BERNARD CORSER,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"If so, can he explain ""why, in its official case for "" Yes"" in the recent referendum, the Government said that there were grave doubts as to the legal power of the Commonwealth to grant preference to service men and women? What answer will he give to that?",35
140,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I shall supply it on another clause.,35
141,Mr BERNARD CORSER,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Further , can he explain why, in an advertisement published in August, 1944, the present Acting Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) and the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) stated that it was false to say that the Commonwealth already had. power to grant preferential treatment to service men and women and that was why full powers were sought. I know that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction cannot explain away that contradiction. Under this measure, the Government seeks to do away with the preference which, during the referendum campaign, it asked for power to extend. The Government proposes to abolish the old preference and to substitute a preference which, in fact, is not a preference to soldiers at all. I am not surprised when the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) in his pamphlet, Rehabilitation of Servicemen) which sells at the modest price of 3d., declares "" preference has proved valueless"". That, however, is merely an excuse; the reason for the abolition of preference is that the unions have demanded .that there shall not be preference to servicemen. It is clear that that objective will be attained, because, under this provision, preference will be extended to all members of the defence force whether they see active service or not. Obviously, in such circumstances, the principle of preference to unionists will prevail over that of preference to ex-service personnel, and, therefore, the latter form of preference, about which we hear so much from the Government, will be utterly useless. If the claim made by the Minister for Transport that preference is valueless be true, why do the great majority of returned soldiers today desire the Government to continue the preference conferred after the last war? Obviously, ex-soldiers of the war of 1914-18 do not think that the old preference has proved valueless. Only a few years ago,, after all postal officials had been released from the services, the Postmaster General's Department advertised for all soldiers whom it had previously employed to re-enter the department. To-day, the old preference applies to the appointment of unofficial postmasters, whilst preference is also given in this work to widows of ex-soldiers. That class of employment is ideally suited to soldiers who are getting on in years, and to the dependants of those who served in the war of 1914-18. The old preference has proved anything but valueless to the ex-soldiers of the last war so far as employment in the Public Service is concerned. Therefore, I oppose this clause, which wipes out the existing concession. I again protest against the conflicting statements which have been made in the name of the Government to the - trade unions, the press and this committee, concerning the reason why the Government now proposes to abolish the preference we have known in Australia since the war of 1914-18 and which has benefited so many ex-soldiers of that war. This measure, upon the expiration of a period of seven years, will wipe out all semblance of preference to ex-service personnel, including both the old form and the new and worthless form to be provided under this measure. Mv. BOWDEN (Gippsland) [4.541 I should like to move that the clause be deleted.",35
142,The CHAIRMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,That would not be in order. A vote in the negative would achieve the same result.,35
143,Mr BOWDEN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"In that case, I shall vote against the clause. This clause repeals section 117 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. I repeat what I said in my second-reading speech, that the provision in respect of preference under this measure does not mean what the Government would like us to believe it means. Every human being could he brought within the ambit of preference as provided under this measure. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) said that the preference provided under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act and that proposed under this measure could not be operated concurrently because they are one and the same thing. "" Mr Dedman - I did not say that they were the same.",35
144,Sir FREDERICK STE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,WART - The Minisi er said that ex-service personnel could not be given both forms of preference.,36
145,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Yes .,36
146,Mr BOWDEN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"If the preference provided under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act is not the same as that to be provided under this measure, why repeal the old preference? I underthe stood that the old form of preference was being repealed because the Governto ment claimed that it was the same as that provided under this measure. ever, the two are not, in fact, the same, because the old preference applied specifiwhen cally in respect of ex-service personnel in the Public Service. That is provided under section 83 of the Commonwealth Public' Service Act, which section also statute-book. is to be repealed by this measure. Under this bill, any one who has been engaged in war service of any kind can be brought within the ambit of ference, because, in total war, it can claimed that every citizen is engaged those sections. in war service to some degree. That is the effect of clause 32. When this measure becomes law, no preference will be provided specifically in respect ex-service personnel. The old soldier the war of 1914-18 is now to lose the specific preference upon which he now depends, and at the end of seven years, under this measure, all semblance of preference of any kind will be abolished. I urge honourable members to clause. 1I have no doubt that every honourable member who is sincere in his professed support of the principle of preference will oppose it.",36
147,Mr COLES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Henty) [5.0] - I shall vote against clause 22, and, in partibill. cular, clause 23, for the simple reason that the Minister for Post-war Reconpreference struction (Mr Dedman) admitted the years, existence of a conflict of opinion regardlose ing the constitutionality of a scheme of general preference. We know that the preference granted to ex-servicemen section 7 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act and section 117 of the tralian Soldiers' Repatriation Act is legally sound. One of the major reasons which the Government advanced for the referendum last year was that it wa3 not certain that under the Constitution, it possessed authority to grant general preference in employment to ex-servicemen. That opinion was not lightly held. For more than twenty years, previous governments had adhered to it. It is quite possible that the wide preference, which is provided in this bill, may be declared unconstitutional. If clauses 22 and 23 be agreed to, no preference will operate in Commonwealth Public Service to protect ex-servicemen. We should endeavour retain the limited preference in governHowment employment that already exists. I doubt whether the Minister was correct he contended! that, with the passing of this bill, the two sections which now provide preference in government employment may not remain on the Why should they not remain? The bill with which we are now dealing will supersede those sections if any conflict between them preoccurs. For that reason alone, the be Government would be unwise to repeal",36
148,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"New England) [5.1] I , too, intend to vote for the deletion of clause 22. This afternoon, the honorof able member for Wentworth (Mr. of Harrison) accused the Minister ("" Mr. Dedman) of not knowing the contents of the bill, and the Minister strongly denied the charge. I believe that the Minister was right, and that he does know the reject the contents of the bill.",36
149,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Hear , hear!",36
150,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"He knows the coutents of the bill from A to Z; but what is concerning the Minister very greatly is that the people of Australia shall not be allowed to know the contents of the The honourable gentleman told us that this bill will grant to ex-servicemen in employment for seven and that returned soldiers will not any of the existing benefits as a result of the repeal of section 117 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act by and section 7 of the Commonwealth Public .Service Act When, addressing the AusVictorian branch of the Australian Labour party, an organization to which be pays far more respect than he does to this committee, the Minister is reported to bave saidMr Dedman said Victorians bad no choice whether they would have preference or not. There was already a preference to returned soldiers act on the Victorian Statute. So far as the workers wore concerned, it was a rotten act, but it could be over-ridden by the Federal Act if the bill now before Parliament was agreed to . . . It might be that in the selection of a man for a job a civilian who had served for a long period in a forward area would secure a job in preference to a returned soldier who had served for only » short period in New Guinea. In those words, the Minister let the cat out of the bag.",36
151,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Is the word "" New Guinea"" mentioned in the report?",37
152,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Yes . Did the Minister use another word ?,37
153,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,It is quite incorrect. I made no such statement.,37
154,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The Minister admitted, in his remarks to the Victorian branch of the Australian Labour party, that this bill is designed to take away from ex-servicemen benefits which they already possess. This afternoon, the honourable gentleman advanced an entirely different argument, and declared that the reason why the Government desires to repeal the preference provisions contained in the two Commonwealth acts is that two forms of preference may not operate at the same time in a community. But I contend that no argument can be adduced to prevent preference from operating in the specific field provided in those two acts even if .those benefits were better than the general preference that the Government is now offering over the total field of employment. Therefore, the Minister is again convicted, on his own words, of trying to deceive the people of Australia regarding the real intention of the bill.",37
155,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,That is very bad.,37
156,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"It is very true, unfortunately, and I hate to have to use such words. The whole measure is intended to take away from certain ex-servicemen rights which they already possess, and to offer them lesser rights which they will have to share with heaven knows how many other people in the community. Clause 33 readsSections 24 to 32 (inclusive) of this act shall cease to operate at the expiration of seven years after the cessation of hostilities in the war. Ex-servicemen will be definitely worse off, after the expiration of the sevenyear period,' than they were before this legislation was introduced. The Minister referred to the service of men who offered their lives in order to safeguard Australia from invasion as ""old history"". In the words of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr. Fraser), they interposed their bodies between us, who stayed at home, and the vicious and violent enemy whoattacked this Commonwealth early in 1942. This treatment of ex-servicemen is disgraceful. By cunning and deceptive methods the Minister is attempting to whittle down their preferential privileges. In the Minister's speech to the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labour party, we have the key to the riddle of this bill. He is alleged to have made an apology for the decision of the Government to introduce this legislation.",37
157,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE, Order ! The honourable member is not entitled to discuss the bill. He must confine his remarks to the clause.,37
158,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The Minister told the Victorian branch of the Australian Labour party, in effect, ""we have inserted clauses which will enable us to save you from what you are alleged to be suffering under the Victorian Preference Act, and which will abolish certain preferences now existing under Commonwealth legislation"". Government supporters should not be bound by caucus decisions on this bill. In the interests of ex-servicemen, they should vote for the deletion of clause 22. That is what the people of Australia expect them to do. To-day, they may be the kings of creation. To-morrow, when the electors are roused to fury by this treatment of the men who interposed their bodies between us and the enemy, they will assign honourable members opposite to the fate they deserve.",37
159,Mr RANKIN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Bendigo) [5.8] - I also ask the Minister (Mr Dedman) to agree to the deletion of this clause. I believe that he realizes, and that every honourable member realizes, that this is an attempt to take from ex-servicemen a benefit - which they have enjoyed since 1918. It is a treacherous and cowardly attempt to deceive men who stood between Australia and its enemies, and who are responsible for our continued existence as a free people today. There have been two great betrayals in the history of this world. Judas Iscariot betrayed his Master for 30 pieces of silver, and had the decency to commit suicide. This Government is betraying the men who interposed their bodies between us and the enemy, and I am satisfied that, by so doing, it will commit political suicide the next election.",38
160,Mr BRYSON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Bourke) [5.9] - The Opposition is engaged in a sham fight on this clause.,38
161,Mr BOWDBN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,The honourable member should give us credit for being sincere.,38
162,Mr BRYSON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I should like to be able to do so. But I remember that honourable members opposite have continually asked this Government to give a definite preference to ex-servicemen, although for years they themselves neglected to do so. This afternoon they are almost weeping because this bill will repeal section 7 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act and section 117 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, which gave preference to ex-servicemen in government employment. ""We must question the sincerity of honourable members who are making such pleas. I know how little preference has meant to returned men over the years. I have said more than once that preference, as granted by successive governments since the last war, was merely a delusion. Preference was provided in the Repatriation Act and in - Iho Public Service Act.",38
163,Mr BOWDEN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,And the Government is deleting those provisions.,38
164,Mr BRYSON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Yes , it is being honest. Even if - every post in the Commonwealth Public Service had been filled by a returned soldier, preference under the act would still be only a small thing. Mr Bowmw - But it is proposed to Jake that small thing away.",38
165,Mr BRYSON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"If we are sincere we must tackle this problem in a different way. Under this bill,, it is proposed to give ex-servicemen a real measure of preference. It is not proposed to restrict preference to the Commonwealth Public Service. Undersuch a provision, not one-fiftieth of the ex-servicemen would benefit. We propose to provide a real opportunity for the rehabilitation of servicemen. It is absurd for honourable members opposite to continue this sham fightabout preference. Very little was done in the period between the two wars to give preference to returned soldiers, but in this measure something definite is proposed. ' So ineffective have the preference provisions proved in the past that the sooner the whole matter of at preference is forgotten the better it will be for the servicemen and for the community.",38
166,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Balaclava) ,[5.13] This matter was discussed extensively during the second-reading debate. This is actually the most important clause in the bill. The Minister described this measure as the serviceman's charter, but it is anything but that, and it brings within its provisions many who are not servicemen. Moreover, it is proposed to repeal that section of the Public Servioe Act which gave preference to returned soldiers of the last war, and which was responsible for placing many thousands of men in the Commonwealth Public Service. The only time in the period between the two wars when this principle of preference was threatened was in 19.30, when the Scullin Government was in office. On the 1st May, 1930, I asked in this Parliament whether preference to returned soldiers in ' the Public Service was to be withdrawn, and I was told that the policy of the Government in future would be preference to returned soldiers who were unionists, and, secondly, preference to unionists. The returned soldier who was not a member of a union was to be cast out. The men concerned at that time were linesmen in the employ of the Postmaster-General's Department, and employees .of the Department iof Works and Railways, Tvith - whose union the honourable member for Bourke :(Mr. Bryson) has been associated for so long. We did not hear him protest in 1'930 'ffgainst the withdrawal of preference. MT. DEDMAN - Preference was not withdrawn.",38
167,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The Scullin Governsfervicetasin's ment 'gave instructions that it he drawn, but, as a result of the question which I asked, the - returned soldiers league, and members of the Opposition in this Parliament, raised such a protest that the proposal was withdrawn. Mm. iBffiDMAN - That is what the honorrhrfrg able member says.",39
168,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"It is recorded in Hansard, but the Minister for Postfire war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) persists in chattering while I am trying to speak. I was absent fr-Om this liament on service for four years while the Minister was here talking. I am - entitled to my say now, and I propose to have it. The Government, Under cover - of a lot of reguJatioas which concern - civil population more than servicemen, is pretending to confer preference on forms. returned soldiers. Actually, it is providing for straight out preference, and such a provision being in the Public Service Act, the Government proof poses to repeal it. It is proposed limit the period of preference to years. Shall we place a measure on grat> tude? The Minister knows that preferlaws ? ence to ex-servicemen has been granted in Victoria, where there is a board which ferent. manages the matter. The provision works efficiently there, and no time limit has been imposed. There is also preferhave ence to servicemen in Queensland and another State. The Minister knows that ""O&mmonwealth legislation overrides State legislation, and there is no reason why sections which it is proposed to repeal should not remain in force. There are every many men in the Commonwealth Public Service today who are indebted to the government which introduced the prefermen ence measure in 1920. The right honorthis - able member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes), who introduced the repatdiscussion. riation legislation, said that ence to soldiers was introduced because the practice prevailed of granting preference to Unionists. said that if there was one thing which flhould he above preference to unionists, was preference to returned - soldiers. I challenge honourable members opposite to get up a'nd say that they do not believe in preference to unionists. They put thai first. We should try to understand the problem, and help 'him to withmake up the leeway which he has lost during the period of his service. Pref-et'ence to servicemen was not introduced in other countries, because there preference to unionists was not so much in vogue. The Gover-nm-'ent will do a most - improper if it rep'ealls the preiEereiiec section J1 the Repatriation Act. Such action will be resented by the ex-serviceman. Under present proposal, the ex-serviceman must go 'to the Repatriation Department for a pension and for medical treatment, Parto the Man Power Authorities fof employment, to the Social Service Department for education, and to the War Service Homes Department for a home. This is calculated to break the heart of any the man who will have to spend his time going from office to office - filling in In the end, he is likely not to rind himself socially redundant. I urge the Minister in all sincerity no't to do this foolish thing. If this form preference has been effective for years, to why take it away now ? Why not let the seven preference provided in the Commonwealth law remain in line with State",39

176,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I point out to the honourable member that a previous Labour government was the only one that tried to destroy that section of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, and uow this Government intends to do so again. I suspect that the whole scheme of preference will go into the discard if this Government remains in power. It is no use appealing to the Minister's reason or relying on the fact that he was a serviceman himself. He has behind him the Labour cohorts, who have an obsession about preference to unionists. It would have been amusing had it not been so tragic to read the report in the Melbourne Age of the meeting of the Labour forces at which the Minister made his confession about giving preference to servicemen only because the honourable member for Henty (Mr Coles) had insisted upon it when he was supporting the Government. He promised that such preference would, not last very long. "" AVe shall be taking it away soon "", was what, he said, in effect, after unsuccessfully seeking to have the conference held in camera. One of the delegates at that conference said, "" I do not believe in this preference business. I am all against preference to soldiers; I believe only in preference to unionists."" Mr Brysom, interjecting,",40
177,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Unlik e the honourable member with the voice of a football barracker, I have practised preference as well as preached it, and I shall continue to do so. In this Parliament, which is the debating house of our democracy, I shall ask for it at every opportunity. I will not be bluffed by the shouting of honourable members opposite. If in their quiet moments",40
178,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,In their what ?,40
179,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"If they think about outside of caucus and in their homes, they will realise that they are doing a great injustice to a lot of men who, in their youth, have given very fine service and who, on their return, will suffer bitterness and frustration and whose lives may be warped because of that injustice. I appeal to honourable members opposite to throw off the domination of the militant unions and the insidious Communists, such as the honourable member for Swan (Mr Mountjoy), and to give a fullmeasure of justice to the men who fought for the Commonwealth in its time of danger-wh o were, in faot, its strong, right arm. What is said in this Parliament matters very little. What those men have done is the important thing. The talking, and even the homefront effort, good though it may be, are secondary to the considerations that affect these men. Therefore, I appeal to the Government to be generous. If , in the past, these men have not been treated fairly, the Government now has the opportunity to make amends. I ask the Minister not to delete section 117 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, but to let it stand so that the men to whom our soldiers will report, in the multitudinous departments that ought to be amalgamated, as has been done in New Zealand, shall be of the right kind. There are plenty of suitable men among the 300,000 who are now available. Already, I have received letters from ex-servicemen who are unemployed, strange though it may seem. They have gone from one office to another. The manpower authorities thought that they were in employment, but they have lost their jobs and have been unable to find new ones. They have been disappointed, have lost confid.ence, and have become economic and social derelicts. I appeal to the Minister to think again about this matter. He has been wrongly advised. To leave the Commonwealth Public Service Act as it now stands may mean that 1,000 men may replace some of the men now employed in the Public Service or at least take positions that will be open to them when the Public Service is reorganized in the post-war era.",40
180,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Parrait matta) [5.27] - Ver y little that is new can be said on this subject. Very few' supporters of the Government have discussed section 117 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, but they have Mot hesitated to east aspersions on its value. They apparently do not know that this section was inserted in the act by the Curtin Government. That was when the Prime Minister yielded to an ultimatum issued by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Coles). In those days, on account of the strength of the parties represented in this chamber, the opinions of the honourable member mattered a great deal more than they do today. It is strange that the Government should now be. so eager to dispense with this provision, which it had inserted in the Repatriation Act only two years ago. The Minister has said that it is essential to delete the section because, in contracts lot by the Commonwealth Government or by quasi-government instrumentalities, it would be impossible to provide for specific preference for combatant servicemen.",40
181,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,The honourable member is peeved because the new legislation applied to contracts let by him.,41
182,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I differ from the Minister. I see no reason why men who actually fought in operational theatres should not receive preference in employment from the Commonwealth Government and its instrumentalities. I see no inconsistency in retaining the existing legislation. There is no reason why it and the new measure should not operate simultaneously. The Minister said that we could not have a Commonwealth law inconsistent with a State law. There are plenty of illustrations to contradict the honourable gentleman. The Minister has had sufficient experience in the industrial field to know that it is a common practice for litigants in the arbitration courts to have a foot in each camp- a Commonwealth award and a State award-so that they can pick the eyes out of each. I hope that the Government will not persist with its proposal to delete section 117 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act.,41
183,Mr HOLT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Fawkner) [5.30] - I emphasize .again that the effect of the repeal of these regulations will be to withdraw from ex-servicemen of the last war certain rights which, but for this legislation, they would continue to enjoy. No timt> limit was placed on the legislation granting those rights, and had it not been necessary to make provision for ex-servicemen of this war no parliament would have imposed any limitation on them. To deprive men of the last war of right* which, but for this legislation, they would have retained for a considerably longer period, is an extraordinary proposal by a government which claims that thi? measure is a serviceman's charter of rights. The amendments circulated by the Minister contain a very important provision. Under clause 59, the obligation is to be placed on employers to accept for employment a specified proportion of disabled persons. An important departure is to be made from past Commonwealth practice, in. that the Commonwealth has been included in the definition of employer. It would appear that ex-servicemen of this war will enjoy in that respect a right which has not been enjoyed by ex-servicemen of the last war. I ask the Minister to state whether or not that provision is to apply to disabled ex-servicemen of the 191448 war, equally with disabled ex-servicemen of the present war.",41

185,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"ParraUnder matta) [ 5 . 3 8 ] - I move That sub-clauses (2.), (3.) and (4.) out. Sub-clause 1 provides for the amendment of section 7 of the Public Service Act, adding at the end of the definition of "" Returned (Soldier"" the - words "" and also includes a discharged member of the Forces within the meaning of' the Rewill establishment and Employment Act 1945 "". Section 7 of the Public Service accepted. Act is. the definition section. The only purpose of such a section is to indicate who are entitled to the preference rights follows:which the act confers upon ex-servicemen. As the legislation we are now considering Commonwealth contemplates the removal of all those preexamination, ference rights, there is no NOES. taining that definition. An examination of the text of the sections in the Public Service Act, which it is proposed to repeal, is interesting. The first is section 11, which provides for the appointment of the Commonwealth Public Service Board, and the sub-section proposed to be deleted readsPAIUS. In the making of appointments under the provisions of this section, preference shall begiven, other things being equal, to returned soldiers. Servicemen, who for 25 years have had the benefit of that provision, will no longer enjoy it , if the Minister's proposal be accepted. Those who fought in the last war, and will get no benefit under this bill, will be deprived of the preference granted in the past. Section 83 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act by 1922-1943, which is to be repealed under sub-clause 3, states(1.) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, a returned soldier whose name is in the prescribed register for tememployment shall, if competent for the work required, be considered for temporary employment in priority to any person who is not a returned soldier. (2.) Upon report from the Chief Officer that suba returned soldier temporarily employed has satisfactorily performed his duties, the Board war' may extend his employment for such time as on temporary assistance is still required. (3.) Where the employment of a returned has been terminated owing to temporary assistance not being further required, he shall be eligible for further employment at any time after the termination of his previous temporary employment. the Commonwealth Public Service Act, men returned from the last war be'left have had almost a monopoly of opportunity with regard to temporary appointments. Some of the men have been able by by reason of application and competency to lift themselves from temporary to permanent jobs, and some today occupy high positions in the Service; but there be no further opportunities of that kind if the clause under consideration be The next provision which will be deleted, if my amendment is not accepted, is section S4, which reads as (1.) In the making of appointments to the Service from among persons who have successfully passed the prescribed the Board shall give preference point in reto returned soldiers. (2.) In making any appointments under section thirty-eight, thirty-nine or forty-seven of this Act, preference shall, subject to competency, be given to returned soldiers. (3.) In notifying any proposed examination for aiLmission to the Commonwealth Service, the Board may specify that any particular examination shall be restricted to returned soldiers. We know, as a matter of history, that that provision has been implemented by the board, and that advertisements for applications for positions in the Public Service have indicated that the invitation is restricted to ex-servicemen. As the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt) mentioned, had there been no further war, and therefore no proposal for new legislation of this kind, the preference provision which has been helpful to tens of thousands of veterans of the first world war would have operated indefinitely. I am surprised at the temerity of the Government in claiming that its present proposals provide for a wider preference, but there will be little consolation for the men who fought in the last war if the preference that they - have enjoyed through the years and thought was permanent is now to have a limitation imposed on it. I hope that the committee will hesitate to agree to this clause.",42
186,Mr RYAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Flinders) [5.45] - What- "" ever arguments may be advanced in support of the deletion of clause 22, they apply even more forcibly with regard to this clause. Section S3 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act is very definite, and there is no possibility of misunderstanding its import. "" It states inter <diaA returned soldier . . . shall, if competent for the work required, be considered for temporary employment in priority to any person who is not a returned soldier. That shows that ex-servicemen must have priority in temporary appointments over all other applicants, but in the last year - or so the Government has not observed the spirit of that provision, and has certainly not acted in accordance with it. Certain permanent employees in the Postmaster-General's Department, particularly electrical engineers mechanics employed in the Telephone Branch, have enlisted in the fighting forces, and their places have been filled temporarily by girls. Other men who have been discharged from the fighting forces have made application for temporary jobs as mechanics in telephone exchanges, but in every case, as far as I can tell from the information before me, their applications have been refused. I took the matter up with the Postmaster-General (Senator Cameron), and the reply received was that, whilst the department regretted that it could not employ them at present, it was in their own interests not to, as the jobs would be of only >a temporary nature. It was pointed out that the positions would probably be resumed eventually by those who originally held them, and that in any case the girls were now doing the work well. That shows that the Government is not sincere when it claims that it desires to provide employment as soon as possible for men.being discharged from the fighting forces. If it were sincere, surely it would find means of replacing the girls, for whom other jobs could be provided without difficulty, by returned men now aprjlying for temporary positions. The latter would thus have an opportunity to prepare themselves for further employment. If the Government wishes to give effect to the intention of the bill, it should ascertain whether all men being discharged from the fighting forces are being given preference over women. I contend that the portions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act which this clause seeks to repeal should remain upon our statute-book. They do not contain anything that is inconsistent with this measure, and they provide a very strong safeguard for returned soldiers who are temporary employees of the Commonwealth.",43
187,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Balaclava) .[5.51] - This clause is much more important than it may seem. Apparently, some honourable members believe that it does not matter if the. preference is taken away from temporary employees in the Commonwealth Public Service. During the reconstruction period after the last war, many thousands of public servants were and temporarily employed.. Some of them are still only temporarily employed after all these years.. There was a provision that after two years of temporary employment, an employee could be made permanent, but hundreds of temporary public servants, particularly employees of the Posfemasfcer-Generai's Department, were employed for a little less than two years, and then put off to break the continuity of employment. Subsequently they were re-engaged, and so on. The withdrawal of preference to temporary public servants would do a very grave injustice to unskilled servicemen. The bill makes no provision for the training of men who were more than 21 years of age at the time of enlistment, although we had hoped that that limit would be raised to 30 years. Large numbers of men in the older age groups, who enlisted for war service, will be unskilled.",43
188,Mr FKOST,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I agree with what the honourable member is saying, but I think that a limit of 30 years would he somewhat high.",44
189,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Thes e older men may have considerable difficulty in obtaining jobs on their return. They will be definitely handicapped if they have to compete in the industrial market with men who were in. constant employment during the war. I can see no reason why the Government should propose to withdraw these preference concessions, unless in its heart it is against preference. I trust that the Government will reconsider the matter. It is a most important issue affecting a considerable number of returned soldiers of this war and of the last war.",44
190,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Moreton) [5.54] - I wish to repeat a protest which I made in regard to a previous clause - The Public Service Act at present provides that preference in Commonwealth employment shall be given to members of the fighting forces of the last war. The Government proposes, by this measure, to repeal that provision. Clause 27 of the bill provides that the limited preference which this bill envisages shall apply for seven years. If that clause be carried, as unfortunately, is likely, owing to the Government's persistent refusal to accept a-niendonents from this side of the House, at the end of seven years all preference to ex-servicemen will be wiped out. I object strongly to that. There is another reason for my objection to the repeal of thpsp preference provisions: The proposal in this measure to extend preference to servicemen in private industry may possibly be held to be unconstitutional. If that were to occur nobody but the Government could be blamed.. When the last referendum was held, the Government refused, in the face of repeated protests from this side of the chamber, to place the first of its seventeen powers before the people of this country as a separate question. That power provided for the reinstatement and advancement of those who have been members of thefightingservice? of the Commonwealth during any war, and the advancement of the dependants of those members who have died or been disabled as a consequence of the war. The granting of that power to the Commonwealth Parliament would have enabled the introduction of an all-round preference measure; but the Government was more interested in continuing the regimentation of the citizens of this country, and the socialization of industry, than in ensuring that returned soldiers would have preference in employment, and, accordingly, required the seventeen powers to be submitted as one proposal. Therefore, today there is some doubt about the constitutionality of the proposed extension of preference to private - industry. Because I fear that that provision may be considered to be ultra vires the Constitution. I should like to see the existing preference provisions remain on our statute-book. In the Public Service of this country there are thousands of returned soldiers of the last war who have been in constant employment because of these provisions. Many disabled ex-servicemen also are employed in the Public Service, particularly in the Postmaster-General's Department, and so are able to provide for themselves and their families. The Government by insisting upon this clause is proving that it has little interest in the righ ts of returned soldiers. One would think that having had an association of some years with the Repatriation Department, the Minister for Repatriation (Mr. Frost) would have become somewhat softhearted towards ex-servicemen, but I am almost beginning to believe the hard things which have been said of him in Smith's Weekly. I protest vigorously against the repeal of these preference provisions, and I trust that during the suspension of the sitting the Government will think better of this and will accept the amendment of the honourable memnot, ber for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart).",44
191,Unknown,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,45
192,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Kooyong-Leade r the Opposition) [8.0] - I take this portunity to say some things which I need not repeat on later clauses. Clause 33 deals with the position of the Comin monwealth Public Service in relation preference. My colleague, the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) has moved that sub-clauses 2, 3 and 4 be deleted, and, therefore, the position of the Commonwealth Public Service in relation to this legislation is directly raised. My colleague read to the committee the relevant provisions, but as some honourable members were not present when he did so, I shall recall what the present position is in respect of the preference in the monwealth Public Service. Sub-section 3 of section 11 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, which this clause proposes to omit, provides that in law. the appointment of members of the Board of Commissioners of the Commonwealth Public Service, preof ference shall be given., other things being equal, to returned soldiers. Section S3 of the act provides that in relation to temporary employment, returned soldier shall, if competent the work required, "" be considered temporary employment in. priority any person who is not a returned solto dier "". Finally, in regard to permanent appointments in the Commonwealth Public Service, section 84 provides "" in the making of appointments to the Commonwealth Public Service from among persons who have successment fully passed the prescribed examination, the board shall give preference returned soldiers"". Section 104 has similar provisions. The first point look I wish to make is that those are permalocality nent provisions; there is no time limit to their application; and I do not think that any honourable member will suggest, that they have not been useful to many returned soldiers. Clause 23 does two things. In the first place it repeals those provisions. That does not mean that it leaves things in the air. It does because clause 26 then goes on to provide that "" the application of this division shall extend in relation to employment by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth"". In other words, the of Commonweatlh Government is treated opas an employer for the purpose of this division of the bill. Therefore, in order to discover what preference will exist future in relation to the Public Serto vice of the Commonwealth we have to turn to clauses 27 and 33 and we find that instead of a permanent preference in the widest possible terms there will be a preference limited, in point of time, to seven years, and hedged about by all sorts of conditions which are set out in clause 27. That is the position put in the briefest, terms. If any honourable member will say that that does not adversely affect the position of those returned soldiers who intend to enter the ComPublic Service of the Commonwealth, I shall be astonished. In time and in quality the preference extended will bp less than before this legislation bwomes",45
193,Mr BARNARD,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Does the right honourable gentleman suggest that the quality the preference will be affected?,45
194,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Yes . Take the position of a returned soldier who seeks a temporary employment in the Public for Service today. If competent for the for work required, he must be considered to for temporary employment in priority any person who is not a returned soldier. If the honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard) will look at clause 27 that and consider how curiously hedged about it is with conditions, he will see that the Commonwealth Governas an employer in the future, instead of being bound by the clear to terms of section 83 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, will have to at the applicant, consider the length, and nature of his service, the qualifications that he possesses in comparison with a man who has had five years' experience while the soldier applicant was at the Avar, and any other relevant matter before making the. appointment. If I were advising the soldier applicant, I should have no hesitation insaying that his chances of getting effective preference were, under clause 27, only a fraction of what they would have been, under section 83 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. Having said that,, let me carry the matter a little further by citing a few examples of general application. I u the course of this debate there Lave been references to what has happened in other countries. Ministers and Government supporters, with eagerness, have explained that preference is not given by law i'n. any country other than Australia. I do not fully appreciate the point of that remark. If it is designed to excuse the imperfect preference of this bill, it may have some point, but not otherwise. In the second place, hints have been given that the seven-years' limit is associated with doubts about the power of the Commonwealth to legislate for preference. I am utterly mystified. It is plain, almost to the point of demonstration, that if the Commonwealth has no power to give preference generally, as some people say is the position, seven years is too long; this power will expire long before the end of seven years. If , on the other hand, the Commonwealth has full power to give general preference then seven years is a purely arbitrary limit. I urge honourable members to disabuse their minds of the notion that a limit of seven years will make this legislation valid. That limit has nothing to dowith the validity of this legislation. Tf there is a conflict of legal opinion on this matter, I take it that it is a conflict between the capacity to do these things at all and the capacity to do them permanently. I shall not outer into a discussion on the legal position; the Parliament had whatever benefit may be derived from my views on this subject when I discussed the Government's referendum proposals.",45
195,Mr CHIMEY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Surely there is an intermediate view?,46
196,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"In my opinion, the Commonwealth Government, can give preferenceto returned soldiers for all purposes, for an indefinite period of time, and for every section of the community. That may be wrong, but if it bewrong,, it is an error that is shared by the draftsman of this bill, because no draftsman could say that this preference 1 will last for seven years, for all purposes amd for all sections of the community, unless ho believed in the view that I have stated. The Government and its legal advisers can take their choice; either they believe the bill to be valid-and it must be valid on the ground of the law that I havestated'-o r they are putting forward a bill the validity of which they doubt. If that is so, there is immense force in the argument of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Harrison) that torepeal the existing permanent preference by legislation the validity of which is doubtful would be to do a shocking thing, for it would mean destroying something and not settingup something else to take its place. However, in .connection with clause 23 we can forget about lawyers, because, whatever doubts there may be about anything else, there is no doubt whatever that the Commonwealth has unqualified and exclusive power to make laws with respect to its own public service. We shall not find any lawyer who will say that there is a limit to the power of the Commonwealth to give permanent preference to servicemen in relation to the Commonwealth Public Service. Previous Parliaments have done that. This bill says two things which I shall emphasize. Let me take section S3 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act by way ofexample. Clause 23 seeks torepeal that section. Then, in clause 27, the bill sets up this rather checkered piece of preference. Then, in clause 33-, it says something that I confess I do not fully understand. That clause providesSections 24 to 32. (inclusive-) of this Act shall cease to operate at the expiration, of seven years after the cessation of hostilities in the war. It will be noticed that section 23 is not included. Therefore, clause 23, where it repeals certain provisions of the Commonwealth Publice Service Act, does so once .and for all. If the Minister wants to justify his early claim that this legislation will satisfy the people, he will need to demonstrate in what way he has given preference to the fighting men of this country in connection with, the Public Service of the Commonwealth by abolishing their permanent preference, by adding qualifications to that preference, and by reducing it to a period of seven years. If .the Minister can explain that I shall be happier about the bill than I am now. Mr MCDONATiD (Corangamite) [8.13] - In supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) I suggest that the Government is asking the Parliament to throw away the substance and grasp at the shadow. Various soldier organizations have made representations that the provisions of the existing act shall be retained, but, instead of preference 'being extended to servicemen for all time we have presented to us a grudging, miserable, preference which will expire in seven years. Let us consider the men of the 9th Division who have written one of the most glorious pages in the history of the Second Australian Imperial Force. When brought back to Australia these men were employed to load and unload ships which unionists refused to touch. In seven years' time those men, if applicants for jobs, will not be given preference over the unionists who refused to load those vessels. Is that the kind of preference that we should embody in legislation? I am reminded of the words written many years agoWhen war is here and danger nigh, God and the soldier is all the cry: When war is off and wrongs are righted, God is forgotten and the soldier slighted. GoTEETOiENT SuppoRTERs - Exactly what happened after the last war! Mr MCDOrTALD - I thought when I recited those few words it would be sufficient to start a chorus. I said the other evening to the complete satisfaction of every logical person that Australian soldiers of the last war had had more done for them than soldiers in any other part of the world. I pointed out that successive Commonwealth governments had expended nearly £300,000,000 on them, and I am just about tired of hearing the tirade, initiated by the Attorney-^General (Dr Evatt) in trying to carry the referendum, - that our soldiers were badly treated after the last war. I know thousands of returned men whose enjoyment of preference enabled them to rehabilitate themselves in civil life, and they have done an extremely good job.",46
197,Mr JOHNSON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"They had the preference of the swag. Mr MoDONALD - That did not apply only to the soldiers. The depression touched every man of the community. There were men dug in on the land before 1914 who lost everything in the depression. Not only the soldiersettler, but the land-settler generally, suffered from the depression, with the cause of which Australia had nothing to do, a-nd from which it emerged faster than any other country. This proposal is not only a slight upon the men of the fighting forces. It is something more than that. It is something of which every member of this Parliament and the community will have reason to be ashamed if it is carried.",47
198,Mr BRYSON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Bourke) [8.1S] - The honourable member for Coraaigamite (Mr. MCDonald) worked himself into a frenzy of emotion about the gallant men of the 9th Division, and said that if the .amendment were defeated and the clause agreed to we should take away a measure of preference from them. I remind the honourable gentleman that even if the provisions of the Public Service Act that this bill proposes to repeal remained in force there would be insufficient jobs in the Public Service for all the men of the 9th Division, to say nothing of the other divisions whose gallantry needs no stressing. We must get down to earth and take a realistic view of the position so far as preference in employment in the Public Service is concerned. Grant members of the forces full preference; sack every man in the Public Service who is not a returned soldier and give his position to a returned soldier, and you will still not have given to the returned soldiers of the last war a sufficiently great degree of preference. We must fix that in our minds at the beginning, and then we must consider the proposed deletion of the preference sections of the Commonwealth Public Act and the substitution there for of the preference clauses of this bill. There is a great deal of difference between the two. OrposrriON MEMBERS - There certainly is.",47
199,Mr BRYSON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The preference in the Public Service that has been granted since the last war has been a mere Bhadow for the vast majority of returned soldiers. That must be remembered. How many thousands of returned soldiers have received preference in employment, even temporary employment, in the Public Service in the last 25 years",48
200,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Many thousands !,48
201,Mr BRYSON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"In comparison with the 300,000 who returned from the last war? The honourable member for Balaclava says "" many thousands "", but the thousands were very few. The preferonce was a mere shadow. It was like our holding a carrot before the donkey's mouth and saying, "" We promise you this, and if you catch up you shall get it "" , but the donkey remains a yard behind all the time. Honourable gentlemen of the Opposition know that that is a fact. Under the present bill, however, we .are providing a measure of preference, not only in the Public Service, but also in employment generally, and we are saying that every returned service man and woman will have the opportunity to enjoy that preference. We are also saying-and this is a point worth consideration-that all non-returned service men .and women in all industries-the Public Service is an industry according to the Arbitration Act-wil l receive similar treatment. Up to now, many public servants who are not returned soldiers have been harshly treated in comparison with the rest of the population. They are worthy of consideration. Many of them have been most anxious to fight in this war and have endeavoured time after time to enlist in one or another of rhe fighting services, but, because of the nature of their employment, they have been refused permission. They have already suffered under the present system - of preference, and, if it were continued, they would be required to continue to - suffer. Some of those employees are men who, as civilians, have taken similar risks in this war to those taken by a very large number of members of the forces. They are worthy of consideration. All employees in the Public Service are entitled to equal consideration with employees in private industry. Preference, as it has worked up to now has affected a very small section of returned soldiers and a very small section of the civil population. It has worked to the detriment not only of those who were in the Public Service during the last war, but also of many people who were unborn or were children during that period. I have seen many examples of men and women who were at school or unborn in the last war who have been injuriously affected by preference. If we are to give preference it must apply equally inside and outside the Public Service. Whatever preference is given in private employment mu3t be given in the same way in the Public Service.",48
202,Mr HOLT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Fawkner) [8.22] - The committee is entitled to know whether the Government is genuine in its desire to give preference, whether it desires that preference to be effective and continuing, or whether it merely desires to include preference as a useful political expediency? We on this side of the committee resent most bitterly the claims that we have been attempting to stonewall the passage of this bill. Weeks ago both Opposition parties formed their own committees to study this measure clause by clause.",48
203,Mr CONELAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,The honourable gentleman said earlier that the Opposition parties had not had time to study the measure.,48
204,Mr HOLT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I was referring to the 34 amendments circulated by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr. Dedman). The honourable gentleman should be the last one to interject because only yesterday he had to admit that he had not awakened to the fact, that enemy aliens were included in the definition of ""war service"". We raise matters, not in an obstructive sense, but because we recognize that this is a bill on which will depend the shaping of the future of hundreds of thousands of Australian men and women, including a good number of those who served in the last war. Surely, this Parliament, which has wasted weeks on matters of no urgency, can be given adequate time to consider this all-important legislation. The banking legislation is not urgent because banking control can be carried on until the end of the war under National Security Regulations. But it has taken up much of the time of the Parliament. I recall that when the Govern-, ment of which I was a supporter brought down the National Health and Pensions Insurance legislation Parliament debated it for weeks and weeks. There was no attempt to curtail the debate until it had proceeded for months.",48
205,The CHAIRMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Mr Riordan) Order! The honourable member must discuss the clause. _ Mr Holt - I shall do so. Government is abolishing what safeguards exist in current legislation and giving the temporary and miserable degree of preference provided in this measure. Tbat is just burking the issue. Until the Government excludes from the definition of "" war service "" all those groups that it can bring in by proclamation, which the Minister has steadfastly refused to exclude, preference cannot be of real value to servicemen. Under it, preference can be made to cover any industrial group, and, as we have pointed out, until the Minister gives an assurance that those groups shall not he proclaimed under the definition of ""war service"", the sword hanging over the heads of the men entitled to preference by their war service is that any number of industrial groups may be brought into share preference with them. We have this extraordinary position as well: preference is not safeguarded because many craft unions, on evidence already put before the committee, are closing their books against returned men. What is the Government going to do about that? Is it going to take that lying down?",49
206,Mr CALWELL,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,They are closing their books to protect soldiers on service.,49
207,Mr HOLT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The Minister for In f mation is the most unaptly named member ever to sit in this chamber. H is interjection is a typical example of his reasoning and is typical of the information that, emerges fro m his department. He said in effect that the unions were closing their books against 600,000 or 700,000 men and women, who, but for their war service, may have been able to j o in the unions, because they are trying to protect their interests. What eyewash! It means that the younger men and women who were not members of unions before the war are to have no opportunity at all, despite the training systems that the Government has set up, to enter the occupations that those unions cover. The Government is not claiming, I take it , that it has not the power to compel such organizations to admit a certain proportion of men and women, because, under the amendment in clause 59 circulated by the Minister, it appears that The the Government will compel employers to take into their employ a certain proportion of disabled service personnel. It is a very desirable amendment. It is true that it does not go as far as we should like, because it excludes disabled personnel of the last war, but it , at least, takes power to compel employers to accept, a. certain proportion of disabled returned men. If the Government claims the necessary constitutional power to do that, why then does it not also insist tlnit all vested interests, whether they be employers organizations, such as the Stock Exchange and the British Medical Association, a craft union, or any other body that has or desires to have a closed membership, shall be compelled by law to admit to its membership a certain percentage of returned personnel of this war. If preference is to be of any value, anything more than a pick and shovel job on governmentally regimented public works, provisions of that kind will have to be inserted in this bill . We have had no satisfactory explanation from the Minister as to how he can brush aside the contention made by the Attorney General ' (Dr E v at t ) , when sponsoring the Government's referendum proposals, that the consent of the people to those proposals was necessary in order to enable the Government to grant preference. o r - To-day, he seeks refuge in a preference which is to last for a period of only seven years and will destroy the old preference which so many ex-servicepersonnel of the war of 1914-18 enjoyed for the best part of their lives and would continue to enjoy but for the passage of* this measure. The preference proposed. under this bill is a sham and pretence, and will not carry weight with any intelligent person who studies the bill. I ask the Minister if he will give to the committee an assurance that the preference which the Government will provide will endure and be a preference not merely for pick-aad-shovel jobs, or clerks' jobs in the Public Service, but will enable ex-service personnel to enter the doors of industry which otherwise will be closed against them.",49
208,Mr BARNARD,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Bass) [8.31] - I dealt with this clause in my second reading speech and I should not again refer to it but for certain remarks made this evening. While the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) was speaking, I made one or two iutei'jections with the object of getting him to clarify some aspects of this matter. The right honourable gentleman, in his usual style, gave a very clear exposition of the legal of the clause. However, while he was talking I wondered what arguments he would have used had he been speaking to a brief from this side of the chamber in support of the measure. I have no doubt that in that case he would have found some merits in the clause. But, at the moment, he holds a brief to oppose this legislation. Preference has been the subject of keen debate for many years, and has given rise to sharp differences of opinion. It has been argued that the repeal of certain provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act under this clause will deprive ex-service personnel now employed by the Government of the preference benefits which they have enjoyed for many years. I do not believe that this measure will adversely affect their position in the slightest degree. Whatever may be said about the preference enjoyed previously, the bill takes cognizance of the fact that our circumstances today, after nearly six years of war, differ entirely from those existing after the war of 1914-18. We must approach this problem from a totally different viewpoint in order to give real protection to the ex-service personnel of this war. It is a matter of opinion as to whether this proposal falls short of the requirements of ex-service personnel. The Government has decided that ex-serviee personnel, and all associated with our part in the war must be re-established in civil life for a period of at least seven years. Whatever the Leader of the Opposition may say about the weaknesses of that proposal compared with the old form of preference, the fact remains that the Government, in view of the changed circumstances in which we now live, realizes the need to modernize preference as we have known it since the war of 1914-18. Eor that reason I support the clause. I believe that it will meet the needs of those whom it is designed to help for a period of seven years. At the end of that period, or, indeed, in the meantime, should these provisions he found to fall short of the actual requirements of those whom it is designed to benefit, steps can be taken, to amend the measure accordingly. I am sick and tired of listening to the arguments repeated over aspects and over again by honourable members opposite with respect to preference, and their praise ad nauseam of what they say previous governments did for ex-soldiers of the war of 1914-18. They know perfectly well that during the last depression many ex-soldiers of that war were given only a preference to carry their swag. The government of the day did little or nothing to help them. Certainly, some ex-soldiers had preference in sheltered positions in the Commonwealth Public Service. Some were given preference because governments had to accept their responsibility in the matter; and, in addition, returned soldier organizations did much to protect the interests of ex-servicemen in that respect. But governments in the past did not provide worthwhile preference in private employment. Private employers invariably selected the man who was able to increase their profits whether he was a returned soldier or not. Therefore, all the nonsense and humbug uttered by honourable members opposite about preference in the past means nothing whatever to me. I recall the occasion when a body of returned soldiers led by a son of the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) marched to the doors of this Parliament pleading for a crust. The Government of the day did nothing for them. What ex-service personnel require in the future is a preference in the fullest sense of the word. They require full employment. The Government intends to achieve that objective, so that in the future there shall be no reservoir of unemployed in this country. It is our duty to rehabilitate all those who have played a part, however small, in this country's share in the war, as well as those who actually interposed their bodies between us and the enemy. I do not say that this provision is perfect; but whatever might be its weaknesses, it is at least a genuine attempt on the part of the Government to provide for the rehabilitation of members of the fighting forces. I repeat that any weaknesses in the provision can be remedied when they are discovered, and at the end of the period of seven years the proposals as a whole can be reviewed in the light of existing circumstances.",50
209,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Balaclava) [8.41] - The Government is now presented with a wonderful opportunity to provide definite and worthwhile preference for service personnel. It should abandon its proposal to limit the preference for a period of seven years. I remind honourable members that since 1920 definite preference has been provided on our statute book. That preference will be cancelled under this clause, which repeals the relevant sections of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. It is useless for honourable members opposite .to indulge in a misery campaign, talking of some persons who carried their swag, or were on the dole in the depression years. I , personally, have seen much more misery abroad than have honourable members opposite. Past governments provided nite preference within the Public Service. Even in peace, the government supplies 20 per cent, of total employment in the country. I ' could mention many men prominent in the Public Service today who served in the war of 1914-18, and whose advancement has been due to the fact that governments in the past recognized their obligation to provide preference for ex-service personnel. I admit that many more ex-service personnel of the last war should have enjoyed similar benefits. In many cases tie principle [72] of preference was forgotten; but in the main it was honoured. What is the motive behind the Government's proposal to cancel the old preference, and its refusal to give ful l preference for ex-service personnel in employment in the future? The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) in his second-reading speech saidAfter seven years there will be new generations of workers coining along, many of them the sons of servicemen, and these should not be handicapped by old history. In cancelling this clause the Government is playing with combustible material. When ex-service personnel, after the very active existence which they have led in the forces, find that they are obliged to go from department to departmentand six departments will be concerned in the administration of this measurefilling in forms and hanging around, they will soon be disillusioned and become embittered. The Government will let loose a flood of resentment that will submerge it. The Minister would not have dared to refer to "" old history "" in 1B42, when a good deal of alarm : and despondency existed in this country. But now that the conflict in Europe has ceased and victory is looming against Japan, the Government is talking lightly of what it proposes to do for the men who saved Australia from the enemy. That is what is behind this bill. At present, ex-servicemen are entitled to preference in the Public Service. The only attempt to remove that privilege occurred during the regime of the Scullin Government, but the effort was successfully resisted, by the then Opposition and ex-servicemen's organizations. If preference in employment in the Public defi- Service is removed now, unionists will be given unbridled preference. The Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) informed us in this chamber, when we asked him to explain why certain public servants were paid higher allowances than others, that they were members of the Public Service Association. Because they were members of an organization registered with the Arbitration Court, members of that association 1 received higher allowances than did nonmembers.",51
210,Mr BRYSON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Quite right.,51
211,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The honourable member for Bourke is in favour of preference, not to ex-servicemen, but to unionists. When these preference provisions are removed from the Commonwealth Public Service Act and the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, preference to unionists in the Public Service will prevail. According to the Age of the 31st March last, the Minister told the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labour party that the preference provisions of the bill would have a seven-year tenure. Then the delegates to the conference, who are the masters of this Government, carried the following resolution as a direction, to the Government:Conference regards the Federal Government's declared, intention to introduce preference u breach of faith with the trade unions and the Labour movement. That is what is behind this proposal to limit the operation of preference to seven years, giving to ex-servicemen the shadow instead of the substance. The conference of the Australian Labour party regarded the Government's intention to introduce preference as- ii betrayal of thousands of workers who have voluntarily accepted industrial conscription and wage-pegging, and therefore directs its representatives to strongly oppose the implementation of preference to soldiers. That is the motive behind this bill. The Government is not sincere. I,t has introduced a milk-and-water measure, which should be a serviceman's charter but which has been so "" scrambled "" that it will .benefit the civilian as much as it will benefit the ex-serviceman. The Government is adhering strongly to the principle of preference, not to returned soldiers, but to unionists.",52
212,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"'.Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [8.48] - I do not propose to accept the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart). Never in my experience as a member of this Parliament have I seen such a demonstration of dialectical pettifoggery as the Opposition has indulged in on this measure. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), who is sometimes very clear in his arguments, has just about as good a case in this matter as he had when he said to the electors of Corio in 194.0, ""The eyes of Hitler are on Corio "".",52
213,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"If Hitler were alive, he would be looking at the Minister during the last few days with some admiration.",52
214,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,The plain fact of the matter is that there is nothing intrinsically important about preference. It is important only insofar as it reestablishes the men and women of the fighting services into the civilian economy.,52
215,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Is not that important ?,52
216,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,It is important. The honourable member for Wentworth has as got preference on the brain.,52
217,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I wish that the Minister had preference on the brain.,52
218,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The honourable member has described this measure as a ""preference"" bill. It is not. It is a bill to re-establish the men and women of the fighting services in the civilian economy. Preference is important only insofar as it assists towards that end. The Leader of the Opposition, in his second-reading speech, agreed with that view. This evening, he said that he did not understand the significance that was being placed on the observations that have been made by honourable members on this side of the chamber and myself, to the effect that no other country in the world has made any provision for preference to ex-servicemen. The significance of that statement is this: Surely the peojjle of Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States of America are just as alive to the importance of re-establishing the men and women of their fighting services in the civilian economy as are those soi-d.isant champions of returned soldiers in this House. But all of those countries place so little importance on preference as a measure towards rehabilitating the men and women of their fighting services that they have not included it in their re-establishment legislation. The whole of the division now under consideration relates to the measure of preference which this Government intends to give to the men and women of the fighting services.",52
219,Mr BOWDEN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"It is nothing. I think that the Minister will admit that. Mr Dedman"" - No . As honourable members are aware, this bill is based on legislation passed by the Parliament of Queensland. The Queensland branch of the Beturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia has put it on record that it is an effective form of preference. I return to my contention that preference is of importance only insofar as it succeeds in assisting the re-establishment of the men and women of the fighting services in the civilian economy. That is a task for which the Government of this country is responsible, and at present honourable members on this side of the chamber form that Government. We are shouldering that responsibility, and will continue to do so. We shall shoulder any blame that may be attachable for any omissions on the part of the Government in reestablishing the men and women of the fighting services, but I venture to say that after the next election, this Govern-nenit will remain on the treasury bench. I make that prediction for the reason that, in spite of what members of the Opposition are saying about this issue, the plain fact is that the country generally is supporting the proposals put forward by the Government. MT. FATJDEN - The people do not yet know what form of preference the Government proposes to grant.",53
220,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I am one of those who, from time to time, has criticized the press of this country very severely. All will admit that the newspapers are generally ill-disposed towards this Government. But what do we find? The Melbourne Herald, in a leading article on the 27th February last, praised the Government for its decision to introduce this measure.",53
221,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Did the Minister read a subsequent article in the Melbourne Heraldentitled ""Preference stepped "" ?",53
222,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Yes . In the leading article on the 27th February, the Melbourne Herald published the following comments:It is reasonable enough to suppose that there will be an end to the period ference will continue to serve its purpose. A time will come when the returned soldier will, it is hoped, have been given all the opportunity he is capable of benefiting from to overcome the loss of time and training. He can then fairly be expected to take the place in civil life to which his abilities entitle him. The continuance of preference might become a premium on inefficiency which the community could not afford, and ""would be a block in the way of the careers of a younger generation which had no opportunity of qualifying for it.",53
223,Mr RANKIN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Is Sir Keith Murdoch a returned soldier, and is he the mentor of the Minister?",53
224,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The honourable member for Bendigo should address to the Liberal party any questions relating to Sir Keith Murdoch. The Sydney Daily Telegraph, which has always been extremely critical of this Government, made the following comment on this legislation :There is common sense behind the Government's reported decision to impose a timelimit on soldier preference. Every returned man has a right to preference- "" redress"" is the more correct and honest word-in training and employment which will compensate him for occupational disadvantage through his war service. He must be helped over lost ground to a position at least equal to the rest of the community who did not, or could not, make the same sacrifice. But no one can reasonably claim that this preference, redress, or assistance should continue indefinitely while a new generation grows up, while ""difficult"" repatriation cases drift from job to job. The task for our rehabilitation planners is to stop the drifting, to anchor the returned man, happily and successfully, in a job as soon as possible after demobilization. If we still have that task on our hands live or seven years after the war we can write "" failure"" across all our brave rehabilitation blueprints. I turn from that newspaper to another expression of public opinion contained in the Melbourne Herald of the 16th May last. In a Gallup poll, the following Side- question was asked :What do you think of the plan to give servicemen first preference for jobs for seven years after the war? The answers to that question when analysed, showed that only 27 per cent., or one person in every four, was opposed when preto the Government's plans.",53
225,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,They did not know then what the Government's plans were.,54
226,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I think that the Minister should address himself to the clause under consideration.,54
227,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I am dealing with the clause. The Leader of the Opposiretiring tion did not confine his remarks to it.,54
228,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"On the contrary made a speech on preference in the ComService monwealth Public Service, but the MinThat ister is taking us all round the world.",54
229,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,The Leader of the Opposition did not deal with the clause under consideration.,54
230,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I am sorry to have to contradict the Minister, but I did deal years only. with the clause under consideration.",54
231,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"There is clear and distinct evidence that the public ally thoroughly approves the Governreturned ment's plans for the re-establishment of the men and women of the fighting services. As I said previously, the GovernHonorable ment will stand or fall by those plans. Regarding the proposal to delete the clauses repealing the preference provigovernments sions in the Commonwealth Public Serporters. vice Act and the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, honourable members who have been longer in this Parliament than I have, will recollect that the Lyons Government when Mr later Sir John, Latham was the Attorney-General, amended the Commonwealth Public Sereligible vice Act in 1933, in order to allow versity graduates up to the age of 25 years to enter the Public Service. When that measure was before this House, the then Postmaster-General, Archdale Parkhill, who wa9 in charge of the bill, saidThe. Public Service Board has recently reported to the Government that the future efficiency of the service will be impaired the cessation in recent years of the recruitwhich I could not obtain. ment of youths of the desired class. What would happen if preference to turned soldiers were to operate in Public Service for an indefinite period? We should find, that, over the years, older class of men would enter the vice than would be the case if the preof ference provision did not exist. In fact, what Sir Archdale Parkhill said was that because of the application of preference to the Public Service in the years after the last war, a large number of men in the older age groups entered that service and there were no young men coming along to take the place of the returned soldiers when they reached the age and left the service. That would occur again if the preference proI visions of the Commonwealth Public Act were continued indefinitely. is one reason why the Government holds the view that the portions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act relating to preference should be repealed, and replaced by the general preference provision included in this measure; which will remain in operation for seven",54
232,Mr COLES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,The Minister knows that that could not apply because the age generlimit for training will mean that soldiers cannot quality.,54
233,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"That is not the case. members opposite have been very good at picking holes in this legislation, but I shall show them that holes can be picked also in legislation passed by of which they were supFor instance, holes can be picked in the legislation now on our statute book which this measure seeks to repeal and replace. Although I served for seven years with the Imperial forces in the last war as well as in several campaigns after the war, I never have been for preference under the act or uniregulations which we now intend to repeal. I do not complain about that, but I can cite other cases as well. I remind honourable members of the long discusSir sion which took place in this chamber yesterday in regard to enemy aliens., I know of at least one case in which an enemy alien obtained preference under by the Commonwealth Public Service Act, I have . . . another case in mind, and this shows rehow necessary it is to protect the the efficiency of the Public Service. In 1938 an application was made by a an returned soldier of the last war for serappointment to the clerical division the Public Service. It was hoped that plain he would be able to undertake certain tasks in the service. He had passed the required examination in four subjects, his marts being: geography, 51 per cent.; mathematics, 65 per cent.; woodwork, 62 per cent.; and metalwork, 68 per cent. Because he had passed in four subjects, and because, under .the act, he was entitled to preference, he had to be appointed to the service, but he was of little use in the job which he was given, and finally he had to accept a caretaker's position. How can the efficiency of the Public Service be retained if , for an unlimited period, there is to be a preference provision which compels the Public Service Board to give employment to an individual who has not the qualifications necessary to enable him to assist in the task which the service has to do for the people of this country? The general provisions of this measure relating to returned, soldiers are quite adequate to ensure that men and women of the fighting services shall be completely and successfully re-established in our civilian economy. More than that is not required. We should not endeavour to retain on our statute-book legislation which provides a greater measure of preference to returned soldiers in the Public Service than we are prepared to enforce in outside industry and which, according to the statement of Sir Archdale Parkhill, had the effect of impairing the efficiency of the service.

He pointed out that 14 the implementation of this legislation will mean the repeal of the preference provisions of the Commonwealth Public AYES. Service Act. The reason for their repeal, given by the Minister, was that they overlap the provisions of this measure. In order that they may not cease to operate, I wish to secure their restoration to the Commonwealth Public Service Act at the expiration of seven years after the cessation of hostilities.

235,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Wentworth) [9.19] This is one of the most important clauses in the bill ; it deals with preference to ex-servicemen. I therefore move That paragraph (6) be left out. My aim is to ensure that preference shall be granted only to ex-servicemen. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), in his second-reading speech, expressed the opinion-whic h is held by all the members of his party-that preference is not a reward or recognition, but purely a restoration to men. who have given up years of their lives and occupations in order to engage in war service on behalf of their country. The Government has insisted upon the retention of the provision that "" war service"" shall mean "" the continuous full-time service of any person as a member of an organization or pivrt thereof which is declared by proclamation to be an organization in relation to which those provisions apply."" The stubborn insistence upon that definition raises in the minds of honourable members on this side the doubt that preference is not to be confined to servicemen, but is to include also other persons in any organization which, from time to time, may be prescribed by the Minister.",56
236,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Also , persons who come under clause 32.",56
237,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I shall deal with that point later. This means that munitions workers, members of the C i v il Constructional Corps, and, indeed, any other section of industrial workers, may receive preference, even though they had FADDEN) not had war service. That would destroy the benefit of any measure of preference insert to ex-servicemen. We have argued that from this side of the chamber ever since the bill was introduced, but repeatedly the Minister and Government supporters have stated that the clause was not designed for that purpose and that our interpretation of it is not correct. If that be so, let us place the matter beyond reasonable doubt. Even honourable members opposite may have some doubt. The acceptance of this amendment, and the exclusion of those who are not ex-servicemen, would make the matter perfectly clear in the minds of everybody. I have listened attentively to the arguments advanced fro m the other side of the chamber. All .members of the Opposition are prepared to give complete preference to ex-servicemen. On the other hand, the proposals of honourable gentlemen opposite vary, some of them favouring a measure of preference to ex-servicemen, and others wishing to. confine it to 'unionists. The Minister has claimed that We are not sincere. We are perfectly cert a in that he and those who sit behind hi m are not. We differ from them, in that we express the opinion of ex-servicemen's organizations. The Minister has claimed that the bill provides for a preference for which ex-servicemen will be grateful. Who should decide whether or not the ex-serviceman is being given the measure of preference to which he is entitled? Is it the Opposition, the Government, or the ex-servicemen's organizations-whic h know exactly what preference means? From time to time, we may adapt legislation to meet existing circumstances, and to counteract unfavorable economic conditions. Surely, ex-servicemen'a organizations should be the best judges of whether or not this proposal is satisfactory! They have stated definitely that it, is not, because it does not give effect to the preference which they desire, and is not what they understand to be preference, but is a thing of shreds and patches which does not mean what it says. The Minister claimed that it is preference, because it is based on a law of the State of Queensland whi8h has been found to work well. He knows quite well that the law in Queensland is preference to unionists. Let us study the Queensland provisions which have been embodied in this measure. Subclause 3 of clause 27 providesIn determining whether reasonable and substantial cause exists for not engaging in employment a person entitled to preference, the employer concerned shall consider(rf) the procedure, (if any) provided by law for engaging persons in employment in the position; In Queensland, the "" procedure provided by la.w "" is preference to unionists. That wipes out auy preference which may otherwise be granted. It cannot be satisfactory to cx-servicemen; therefore, it should not be embodied in a Commonwealth statute. The Minister also stated that a Gallup poll had favoured the proposed restricted term of preference. He knows, the committee knows, and the country should know, that that Gallup poll was taken among persons who are not in the fighting services. There are 900,000 men and 70,000 women in those services. How would they vote in a Gallup poll? Apparently, the Government considers that its popularity with its supporters might be jeopardized if it legislated for unlimited preference to ex-servicemen. The Minister's arguments have no substance, and are advanced in an endeavour to bolster what does not exist. ""What is the history of preference from the viewpoint of the Government? The Minister chided me earlier with having preference on the brain. Had he paid attention to my second-reading speech, he would know the basis of my arguments. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) has already pointed out that the right honourable member for Yiarra (Mr Scullin), as Prime Minister, proposed to withdraw the provision for preference to ex-servicemen in the making of Commonwealth contracts, and to insist upon preference to unionists only. More recently, the Prime Minister (Mr Ourtin) assured me, when I moved to amend the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act in the direction of granting preference to ex-servicemen, that he would bring down preference legislation. What has happened ? Such a measure has not yet been introduced, the reason being that the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Workers Union told the Government that they would strongly oppose any proposal of that nature. Ministers and other honourable members opposite have said from time to time that they do not favour preference to servicemen, but believe in preference to trade unionists. On the staff of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction only one person in four is an ex-serviceman. Those who have charge of the establishment or re-establishment of ex-service personnel in civil life will need to give individual attention to their claims and understand their problems. Clause 32 should be read in conjunction with the clause under consideration. It provides, in sub-clause 1Where any person not otherwise entitled to the benefits of this Division considers that, having regard to the service performed by him in relation to the war, he is entitled to receive the benefits of this Division, he may apply to the Central Preference Board for registration. This seems to be nothing but a cunning evasion, for it cuts beneath the definition of "" war service "". A definition appears in clause 4 of "" member of the Forces "", and the bill provides that the privileges of preference are intended for not only members of the forces, as so defined, but also "" any persons"". Clause 9 makes it clear that some persons other than servicemen have taken a hand in the preparation of the measure. Sub-clause 1 of that clause statesWbeTe any person has applied for reinstatement in employment in accordance with the National Security (Reinstatement in Civil Employment) Regulations and has not been reinstated in employment in accordance with those Regulations, the provisions of this Division shall apply in like manner as they would apply in relation to an application made under this Division on the date of commencement of this Division. In clause 12 we notice a similar reference to reinstatement in employment as that contained in sub-clause 1 of clause 9.",56
238,The CHAIRMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Order ! The honourable member has exhausted his time. If no other honourable member wishes to speak at this juncture, the honourable member may take his second period now.",58
239,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I shall do so. Some time ago, this Parliament passed the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Bill in which ful l provision was made to assist civilians. When the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act was last under review, it was pointed out that merchant seamen were covered by an act specifically relating to them. No civilians should be included within the ambit of this bill. Why should we clutter it up with preference in employment to civilians by making provision for the granting to the members of an unspecified number of organizations a preference which, under this measure, should be granted only to service men and women ? If the Minister were sincere in his desire to give preference to serviceshows men, he would, without hesitation, accept my amendment. Those who have received the benefit ofi war-time training in industry, and have not made the same sacrifices as servicemen- I recall that "" billy boys"" employed by the Allied Works Council have earned £14 to £15 a weekshould not receive the same preference as returned soldiers. It was revealed some time ago that, out of 40 men employed in a munitions factory, not one was receiving less than £14 a week. We should compare that with the pay and conditions of Australians fighting in New Guinea. When the Minister seeks to introduce into a hill purporting to give preference to servicemen clauses which rob them of that benefit, and give it to men in civilian employment, it shows that the Government is not sincere in claiming that it is giving to servicemen a bill of rights. That expression coined by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen), but instead of being a bill of rights it is a bill of wrongs. One of the wrongs could be removed from the measure by accepting my amendment.",58
240,Mr RYAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Flinders) [9.39] - Mem bers of the Opposition claim that preference should) be reserved for servicemen, and, although the preference for which the bill provides is considerably diluted, the principle should be maintained. It is clear from the Government's definition of ""person entitled to preference "" that anybody could be included within the scope of the bill. Honourable members opposite do not sincerely believe that servicemen as such should have the right to preference. They have said frequently in this debate that preference rights should accrue to trade unionists, and they seek to excuse themselves by saying that trade unionists form a large proportion of the members of; the fighting services. One honourable member has stated that 80 per cent, of the members of the services are trade unionists, whilst other honourable members have claimed that a large majority of them are unionists. I challenge those statements. The trade unionists now serving in the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force are certainly not in a majority. They are, in fact, in a minority. The Commonwealth Year-Book for 1941 that the number of trade unionists in Australia in 1940 was 955,862 out of a total of 1,955,800 employees. That gives the proportion of unionists as 48.9 per cent. In addition, there were among the working population 464,000 juniors under the age of twenty years. Even taking the number of servicemen from the ranks of unionists as being in the same proportion as from people in other walks of life, the total would not work out at more than 48.9 per cent. The vast majority of the discharged servicemen will not be trade unionists, and will have to be provided for by preference other than by preference to unionists. Therefore, I object to preference being granted to persons other than those who have served their country in the fighting forces.",58
241,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Parrawas matta) [9.43] - In discussing other parts of the bill, members of the Opposition have expressed dissatisfaction with the nature and tenure of the preference proposed to be given to certain persons, and this clause indicates the classes of persons who are to receive the benefit of preference. I agree with the contention of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) and shall support his amendment. The Minister, with selfflattering unction, has told the committee several times in the debate that this measure has received the considered and unanimous support of the public generally. His memory must be very short, because I have an idea that certain people in Victoria, with whom he is not unassociated, have made it clear to him that they are not in favour of the bill, and that the proposal to adopt even the principle of preference is not acceptable to them. I understand that the Minister himself, in common with his Victorian colleagues, has had a definite direction from the Victorian executive of the Australian Labour party that he must oppose this measure. That does not sound as though that body is in perfect agreement with him. The Minister knows that for opposite reasons the organizations of the servicemen are strongly opposed to the measure. I do not know whether by that strange reasoning, which is a feature of his presentation of the bill to the committee, he accepts the dictum that those two protests offset each other, because they indicate diverse attitudes to the bill. It is evident that this measure has not obtained the unanimous approval of the public. Last night, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Johnson) said that the Australian Workers Union, which is the largest union in Australia, and is generally acclaimed as the most moderate, was opposed to the principle and purpose of the bill. I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth that preference should continue in force, and that its application should be limited to servicemen. Indeed, I would be disposed to go further, and specify the types of servicemen to whom it would apply. However, seeing that some have served continuously for a number of years in non-combatant areas, and have thus lost opportunities to advance themselves in civil life, I am prepared to accept the amendment as it stands.",58
242,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Balaclava) [9.47] This clause proposes to extend preference to an unknown number of unspecified civilians. Why is this? Is it because pressure has been brought to bear upon the Government by certain groups ? Ministers have stated that the policy of the Government is full employment, and the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) said that, having regard to this policy, preference to ex-servicemen was not necessary. There is special legislation such as the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act to meet the needs of civilians, so that there is no need to include them in this legislation.",59
243,Mr CHAMBERS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Adelaide) [9.49] I am opposed to the amendment, and I hope that the clause will be agreed to as it stands. There has been a great deal of talk about preference to servicemen, but I point out that it may be desirable to give consideration to certain other persons who, while not members of the fighting forces , have been employed in opera1 tional areas, and have faced the same risks as members of the forces. When I spoke on the second reading of the bill, I pointed out that in one part of New Guinea where I served civilians had been required to work at the loading and unloading of ships in an operational area. I citea two instances in which ships had been sunk by enemy action, thirteen civilians being killed on one occasion, and ten on the other. Other civilians were wounded. I do not believe that members of the lighting forces who will benefit under this bill will object' to the preference provision being extended to civilians who were employed under such conditions. During the 69 air raids on Darwin, men who bad been called up to serve in the Civil Constructional Corps were employed in the danger zone, and some of them paid the supreme sacrifice. I should like to take some of those who want this provision eliminated from the bill to the cemetery which has been arranged by the War Graves Commission in one part of the Northern Territory. On one side of it flies the American flag and on the other side the Australian flag. Among the hundreds buried in that cemetery are civilians who were killed in the air raids on Darwin while working as members of the Civil Constructional Corps. I cannot believe that any member of this comimittee is opposed to extending preference to people who had to work under such conditions. Therefore, I oppose the amendment. I hope that the clause will be retained in its present for m so that the benefits of the bill may be extended to those who played an important part in ensuring the security of their country. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 26 (Application).",59
244,Mr FADDEN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Darling Leader of the Australian Country party) [9.53] - This clause readsThe application of this Division shall extend in relation to employment by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth or a State OT by any authority constituted by or under any law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth. I draw particular attention to the words "" employment by the C r o w n "" . The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) has stated that he knew an enemy alien who has been a member of the Commonwealth Public Service since 1938. I point out that we were not at war in 1938, and consequently there could not, at that time, be any enemy aliens. I also draw the attention of honourable members to a provision in the Commonwealth Public Service Act regarding entrance examinations for appointment to the Public Service. Section 31 contains the following passage:No person shall be admitted"" to the Commonwealth Service unless he is a. natural-born or naturalized British subject. How, then, does it happen that an enemy alien has been a member of the Commonwealth Public Service since 1938? This matter should be cleared up at once and Parliament should be informed who was responsible for his appointment. Clause agreed to. Clause 27(1.) An employer shall, in the engagement of any person for employment, engage, in preference to any other person, a person entitled to preference, unless he has reasonable and substantial cf<us« for not doing so.

Nothing in this section shall(b) require the engagement in employment of a person who has, since the termination of his service, been convicted of an indictable offence.",60
245,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Wentworth) [9.57]. - I moveDowns- That the clause be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following clause:"" Notwithstanding anything contained in any Commonwealth or State legislation, statute, act, regulation, or measure or in any award or industrial agreement, every employer shall give first and complete preference in employment to any person defined in this Act as ' member of the for c e s and those who served in the 1914-18 war, including the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force"". I do not propose to speak at length on this matter. I have spoken u n t i l I am sick and tired in an attempt to impress upon the Government the need to grant to servicemen preference in employment to the exclusion of all other sections of the community. If the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) is sincere when he says that he desires to assist servicemen, he w i ll accept my amendment, which really does provide for preference to servicemen, and which excludes civilians.

As in the course of my second-reading speech I dealt with this matter, I shall not now repeat what I said then, but I propose to submit, an amendment which will test fair l y pointedly what the clause is designed to do. Sub-clause 3 providesIn determining whether reasonable and substantial cause exists for not engaging in emBarnard, H. C. ployment a person entitled to preference, the Bryson, W.

If , however, paragraph b be omitted, the employer will no longer be entitled to ask him if his comparative qualifications are better than those of other applicants. The questions will then be whether the PAIRS. serviceman is entitled to preference under the legislation; whether he has the qualifications required for the performance of the duties; and whether he is disqualified^ by any other set of circumstances mentioned in the clause.

This is the first time in my life that I have heard it said that you must not impose a penalty because it may lead to the impression that the payment of a fine will give immunity, that you must not provide that an offender must go to gaol for six years because it may lead to the impression that he can do six years and get away with anything. It is a fantastic argument. The Leader of the Australian Country party has pointed out with complete accuracy that no penalty is provided, and it may be added that no penalty is provided by any other . statute of the Commonwealth which bears on this matter. Accordingly, if an employer is to be proceeded against, it must be by some complicated system such as a prosecution or proceedings at common law for a misdemeanour, or some other antiquated procedure must be practised to deal with him. The simplest and most effective way of dealing with the matter is to provide for a penalty and state what the penalty is. The Minister has taken refuge in a world which just baffles me. He says there is appeal to the Arbitration Court. His faith in that court is such that he believes that, once an appeal gets to it, it is bound to be able to do something. I tell him, for his guidance, that the Arbitration Court has no powers of any description except those conferred upon it by statute. It is purely a statutory court. It has no inherent powers. You can take all the people concerned to court and fill the building, and it still will not be able to fine them or send them to gaol. The next comment that I make is that the appeal to the Arbitration Court is an appeal from an order made under clause 28, because clause 29 says(1.) The Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration may, if it thinks fit, grant special leave to appeal from any order under the last preceding section which is clause 28, but, under clause 30 there is no appeal. It saysAn employer shall not, without reasonable cause, terminate the employment of any person whom he has engaged in employment in accordance with the provisions of this Division. There is no appeal to the Arbitration Court. So, with no appeal and no penalty provided, the Minister says, "" Oh, well, this amendment comes from the wrong side and I think I would like the chance to chew it over"". I tell him what advice his experts will give if he does chew it over: ""Obviously the amendment is good and should be agreed to "".",63
271,Mr HAYLEN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Parkes) [10.26] - I appeal to the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction- (Mr Dedman) who has said tint he will examine the clause,63
272,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Whj r appeal to him?,63
273,Mr HAYLEN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I am making this speech in my own way and I am still on this side. I think this provision is a bit too loose in an otherwise good bill. We have to protect members of the forces from unscrupulous employers. I believe that the Minister realizes that there must be strength to do that and will come to the conclusion that this is one of the few flaws in a bill of tremendous strength. I suggest that the Minister examine it again at the right time.,64
274,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"New England) [10.27]. - I cannot help feeling, and I am sure that many other ' honourable members share my feeling, that there is something very sinister behind the motives of the Government and the Minister. It is said that there is to be preference in employment for returned soldiers for seven years. Yet we find at the beginning of the bill the provision in clause 4, paragraph /, of the definition of "" war service "" under which all sorts of organizations are to be brought within the ambit of the bill. Then we come to clause 32 and find that people who have never had war service will be given all the rights to preference given to ex-servicemen. Then we come to a vital clause, clause 28, and, in clause 29, we find no provision laid down for enforcement of their rights and no penalty provided for failure to comply with the decision of a police court or the Arbitration Court. The Minister rises and most extraordinarily and curiously says, "" We will not fix any penalties because people may buy themselves out of the obligation to give preference by paying the penalty"". The Minister is convicted out of his own mouth. The Leader of the Australian Country party said that there should be a penalty of either a fine or imprisonment or both. If the Minister thinks that employers will buy themselves out of the obligation by spending six months in gaol for not having given preference, he has a queer, warped mind. He is playing false with this committee and making any statement he feels like making regardless of truth. He made a statement on a previous clause that a man employed in the Public Service was an enemy alien, but, when the Leader of the Australian Country party quoted the Commonwealth Public Service Act",64
275,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE, What has that to do with the amendment or the clause?,64
276,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"It has everything possible to do with both, because I say that behind all these clauses is a sinister motive. They are designed to water down preference so that it shall be utterly impossible to enforce. There is a pretence at giving preference. I believe that the Government and the Minister have given certain undertakings to their outside masters, the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and various other Labour bodies, that, although this hill provides that preference shall be given to returned soldiers, it* will be ineffective. It is wicked that the soldiers should have it "" put across "" them in this way. The amendment of the Leader of the  is simple, yet the Minister will not accept it. He crawls and. cringes, and gets out of his difficulty by putting up a bogus story that he is afraid, that, if a penalty were provided, the employer would buy himself out of his obligations under the clause. The Minister should be ashamed of himself for putting up a story like that, and betraying the 900,000 members of the fighting services who have interposed their bodies between this country and the enemy. He should now say that he is willing to accept the amendment, and cease trying to humbug the people.",64
277,Mr DALY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Martin) [10.31] - Wit h the honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen) I support the suggestion put forward by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden). The suggestion seems to be reasonable, because I believe that there is no chance of an employer buying himself out of his obligation simply because a penalty is imposed. The penalty could be made so severe, with the alternative of a term of imprisonment,' as to put the matter beyond doubt. The Minister should also consider providing for the reinstatement of any person penalized as the result of such a breach. The Minister should consider the aspects mentioned by the honourable member for Parkes and provide a penalty for breach of this provision, because it seems unreasonable to provide for something to be done, and, at the same time, fail to provide a penalty in respect of breaches of the provision.",64
278,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I have given an assurance that I will look into the matter.,65
279,Mr BERNARD CORSER,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Wide Bay) [10.33] - After listening to the debate on this clause and the response of the Minister to the suggestions of honourable members, including some honourable members opposite, to provide a penalty in respect of breaches under this provision, I am convinced more than ever that owing to the attitude adopted by the Minister that we are getting farther away from democratic procedure in considering legislation in - this chamber. I ndeed, we are drifting towards a position which we have been led to believe existed prior to the war in totalitarian countries in Europe. It is the duty of the committee to pass final judgment upon amendments that may be proposed but we find that when an amendment is proposed and seems to be acceptable to the majority of the committee, the Minister does not meet the wishes of the committee, but merely tells us that he will consider the matter later, and should he himself deem it necessary, he will have the bill amended accordingly in the Senate. When a majority of the committee favour an amendment, the matter should be finally decided by the committee. When the Minister cannot help accepting an amendment he takes it upon himself, regardless of the wishes of honourable members opposite, to decide the matter. Although he says that he will have a look at such matters later, the fact is. that he will be advised by officers outside this chamber. That is not democratic procedure. It is a disgrace that in respect of a matter of such vital importance as the bill now before us, amendments are to be decided, not by the vote of the committee, but by the Minister himself with outside assistance. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 31For the purposes of this Division there be a Central Preference Board and one or more Regional Preference Boards, each of which shall be constituted as prescribed and shall exercise such powers and functions ae are prescribed. Amendment (by Mr Dedman) agreed toThat the clause be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following clause"" (1.) The Minister may appoint a Central Preference Board and, in each State and Territory of the Commonwealth, one or more Regional Preference Boards. "" (2.) Each Preference Board shall consist of a chairman, one member to represent persons who have rendered war service, one member to represent employers and one member to represent employees. "" (3.) In the event of the illness or absence of the chairman of a Preference Board, any person appointed by the Minister to be a deputy chairman of the Board shall have, and may exercise, all the powers and functions of the chairman. "" (4.) Any act done by a deputy chairman shall not, in any proceedings, be questioned on the ground that the occasion for the exercise of his powers had not arisen or had ceased. "" (5.) All questions before a Preference Board shall he decided by a majority of votes. "" (6.) The chairman shall have a deliberative vote and, in the event of an equality of votes, shall also have a casting vote. "" (7.) Panels of persons to represent persons who have rendered war service, to represent employers, and to represent employees, respectively, shall be selected in such, manner as the Minister determines, and the members of a Preference Board, other than the chairman, shall be selected from the panels in such a manner as the Minister determines. "" (8.) Unless in any particular case the Minister is satisfied that it is not practicable, a majority of the members of a Preference Board selected from the panels shall be persons who have been members of the Forces. "" (9.) A person shall not, at any meeting, act as a - member of a Preference Board in relation to any matter in which that person has an interest, whether personally or as a member of a firm or company. "" (10.) A Preference Board shall exercise such powers and functions as are prescribed. "" (11.) The members of Preference Boards shall be paid remuneration and allowances at such rates (if any) as the Minister determines."".",65
280,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Moreton) [10.36] - I move That the following new sub-clause be added:""-(12.) Any organization representing discharged members of the Forces throughout the Commonwealth may, in respect of the 9hall Central Preference Board or any Regional Preference Board, submit to the person empowered by the regulations to appoint the members of the Board a list containing the names of not loss than three persons from which the organization recommends that a selection be made of a person to be appointed as one of the members of the Board and the person empowered by the regulations to appoint the members of the Board may appoint a person selected from the list so mitted to be one of the members of the Board."". I remind the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) of the arguments I advanced in respect of any amendment of clause 20. The same arguments apply in this case. I urge him to accept the amendment because it will enable the Government to procure the best men possible for appointment to the Preference Boards, including ex-servicemen who have had experience ever since the war of 1914-18 in dealing with problems of returned men. Amendment negatived. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 32 (Registration of certain persons entitled to preference).",65
281,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [10.38] - This is the clause which was referred to in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) on a previous clause. It is the clause under which, apparently, persons other than those who have performed service in the armed forces may be brought into the preference scheme. One great disadvantage we are under here is that the Minister, (Mr Dedman), so far as I know, has not told us what this clause is designed to achieve. When we raised the question on an earlier clause relating to a somewhat similar matter, he had recourse to the Young Men's Christian Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Salvation Army and other kindred bodies; and, perhaps, that is the reason for this clause. But in the absence of any explanation one can only go on the language of the clause. Indeed, one will go on the language of the clause in any event, because that is what the bill will mean-wha t it says, and not what any Minister says it means. Sub-clause 1 readsWhere any person not otherwise entitled to the benefits of this Division, considers that, having regard to the service performed by him in relation to the war, he is entitled to receive the benefits of this Division he may apply to the Central Reference Board for registration. I point out that by virtue of the amendment just made at the instance of the Minister, each Preference Board is sub- to consist of a chairman, one person to represent persons who have rendered war service, one to represent employers, and one to represent employees; so there is uo guarantee that more than one member of the Preference Board will himself be an ex-serviceman.",66
282,Mr CONELAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,The Minister has given an assurance.,66
283,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"There is no guarantee. Assurances mean little when we are passing a measure. When the measure goes on to the statute-book it is what it says that will matter. The Central Preference Board is in this fashion given power to admit civilians to the benefit of preference. That is the simple English of it. If they were soldiers, or came within any of the definitions of those deemed to have rendered war service, there would be no need for this clause. Therefore, it exists for the sole purpose of making civilians with civilian service in the course of the war entitled to preference to soldiers, to use the normal expression. That, on the face of it, is completely unjustifiable and, at the very least, we are entitled to say to the Minister at this stage, ""What is this clause designed to do? What people have you in mind? If you cannot tell us we should vote against it. If you can tell us then the clause should be redrafted to cover those people, if we think they are a good case, and nobody else "".",66
284,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Wentworth) [10.42]. - The case put up by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) should have some effect upon the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) because, when faced with a like request on an earlier clause, he mentioned the Young Men's Christian Association, the Salvation Army, the Australian Comforts Eund, and other kindred bodies, and when an amendment was moved to include those organizations he refused to accept it. Although he had named those organizations as the bodie-s covered by the clause,, he refused to accept an. amendment embodying them in the clause. Therefore, when we ask him to name those he has in mind under this, clause, we shall not be surprised if he remains dumb. Nobody else knows better than the Minister what this clause has been designed to achieve. It has been designed to give to civilians the whole of the benefits provided under the bill. There is no doubt about that. I remind the Minister that he would not establish a precedent if he would answer questions raised in committee as to what a clause is designed to accomplish. Every other Minister is prepared to adopt that course, if only as a matter of courtesy to honourable members and also the country, because the people are entitled to know exactly what is provided under the measure. If the Minister is capable of interpreting a provision for the committee he should be prepared to do so. However, he sits absolutely dumb, and refuses to answer a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition-no t by a rank-and-file member of the Opposition, whom the Minister always treats with discourtesy. When the Leader of the Opposition asks for information on behalf of the Opposition and the country, he is entitled to an explanation. If the Minister is not prepared to give that information, the country can only place its own interpretation upon his action.",66
285,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [10.45] - This division deals with preference, and this clause provides that certain individuals, not organizations, may claim that because of the circumstances in which they, as civilians, rendered service, they are entitled to the same preference as are members of the forces.",67
286,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Who would they be?,67
287,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Thos e who would be entitled to preference under this clause will have to submit their claims to the Central Preference Board.,67
288,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,But who will they be?,67
289,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Such a claim might be made by members of the Young Men's Christian Association, the Young Women's Christian Association and the Salvation Army whohappen to he giving service, in a civilian capacity, in an operational ox combat area. But, again, I emphasize, that this clause will apply, not to. all members of those organizations,, but only to particular individuals who might claim that they were stationed at, say, Port Moresby or Lae, in a Young Men's Christian Association, Young Women's Christian Association or a Salvation Army centre. A claim might also be made by members of the mercantile marine, who served in combat areas, or by civil airline pilots who piloted aircraft in operational or combat areas. Those are the type of individuals, not organizations, who might place before the Central Preference Board their claims to be registered as persons entitled to preference.",67
290,Mr MARTENS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Herbert) [10.47] I am vastly amused by the way in which' honourable members ""opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies), talk about granting preference to ex-servicemen. Recently, the political organization to which they belong appointed to a position carrying a salary of £2,000 per annum, a man who was not an ex-serviceman. Some returned soldiers were also applicants for the office. In the opinion of the leaders of that organization, the efficiency of those ex-servicemen was not equal to that of the successful applicant; but I have obtained some information about this matter and I believe that the successful applicant was given the job because he was a better supporter of the Liberal party than they were.",67
291,Mr COLES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Henty) [10.48] - I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) to explain whether any machinery will be created to guide the Central Preference Board in determining what individuals shall be entitled to preference. In paragraph / of the definitions in clause 4, ""war service"" meansin relation to any of the provisions of this Act. the continuous full-time service of .any person as a member of an organization or part thereof which is declared by proclamation to be an organization in relation to which those provisions apply. The Minister stated that no organization, as such, but only individuals, will be entitled to apply to the Central Preference Board for registration. So far as I am able to ascertain, the only provision to this bill, which prescribes who shall be eligible for preference, refers to members of an organization. Therefore, the explanation given by the Minister is not satisfactory. Question putThat the clause be agreed to. The committee divided. (THISCHAIRMAN - MR . W. J. Ayes .. .. Noes .. ..

Whatever theories the Minister ("" Mr Dedman) may put forward on the matter, neither he nor any other honourable member has attempted at any stage to answer the case which I put in my second-reading speech. I refer to the case of the man who is partially disabled as the result of war service, who will be partially disabled for the whole of his life, and who will need to have preference just so long as he needs a job. Parliament, through this Barnard, H . C. clause, is saying to that man, "" You may Bryson, W.

305,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Wentworth) [11.6]. This clause reads(1.) An apprentice who has been absent his usual employment by reason of hi* engaged on war service may, within two months after he ceases to be so engaged, make application to an Apprenticeship Authority for the revival of the contract of apprenticeI consider that two months is not sufficient. I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Hoiloway), to. who has had considerable industrial experience, whether the Government will consider extending the period to six months. When a young man is discharged from the forces at the end of his war service, he will have a thousand and one things to do. Pro16 bably he will want to have a short holiday. He may have to restock himself with clothing. Then, he will have to re-orientate himself in his new circumstances, and decide what he intends to do; yet, within two months after his discharge he must make an application for the revival of his apprenticeship contract, otherwise he will lose it. I have some knowledge of demobilization following the last war. I know how difficult it was for me and for other servicemen to become accustomed to the new conditions with which we were faced. This provision will affect mainly those of immature years who broke the continuity of their apprenticeship to enlist in the fighting forces. Six months would not be too long to allow them to adapt themselves to their new circumstances.",69
306,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Balaclava) [11.9] - I support the suggestion of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison). I point out that there are still 15,000 members of the Royal Australian Air Force in Great Britain. Are they to be excluded from this provision? Some of them will be demobilized in Great Britain, as I was after the last war. They will not know about this stipulation and may lose their apprenticeships because of the short notice. Are they to be denied the benefit of this clause? I suggest that the Minister (Mr. Hoiloway) should agree now to extend the period to six months.",70
307,Mr HOLLOWAY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Service) [11.10] - I think that honourable members opposite will find when they read the clause thoroughly that the contingency which they have mentioned is provided for. This does not mean that a discharged soldier will be prevented from resuming his apprenticeship if he fails to make application within the specified period. The apprenticeship authority will take the facts of each case into consideration and examine both the employer's position and the position of the apprentice. In somecases it may be necessary to find a new employer. An apprentice will not be tied to the two months.,70
308,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia does not agree with the Minister in that respect.",70
309,Mr HOLLOWAY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The apprenticeship authority will review the situation from time to time. I can assure honourable members that if it is unreasonable for a discharged soldier to make application for the renewal of his apprenticeship contract within the two months specified, the period will be extended. - Clause agreed to. Clauses 39 to 44 agreed to. .Clause 45 (Modification of conditions of entry into employment).",70
310,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [11.13] - This clause causes me considerable uneasiness and I should like to put a view on it to the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Hoiloway). The clause states(1.) The Governor General may make regulations modifying or suspending, in relation to discharged members of the forces.(a) the requirements by way of training or practical experience, the completion of any course of study, the pasaing of any examination or the holding of any degree or diploma, to be complied with by persons desiring to engage in any profession, occupation, business, trade or industry; Finally, the clause provides(3.) A regulation under this division ahall have effect according to its tenor notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith in any other law. Clearly under that clause the Commonwealth Government could direct that a man be treated as a qualified medical practitioner although he had not passed his examinations. It could admit somebody to the practice of law without that person having passed the examinations. It could direct that a man be regarded as a skilled tradesman for various purposes without first having served an apprenticeship or passed any trade tests. In short, the Government could make anybody qualified to carry on any occupation notwithstanding any State or Commonwealth law. I think that what the Government has in mind in making a provision of this kind is that some assistance has to be given to discharged members of the forces and that some technicality here or there might have to be waived, but I say very deliberately that the Government will not be doing a service to a discharged member of the forces by sending him out as allegedly qualified to carry on a certain occupation when in fact he is not. That would be imposing a real hardship on that man. If it became at all customary to. give some truncated - qualification to men who came out of the forces, for the rest of their lives they would be marked as a group of individuals who had not completed all the normal tests of their occupation. They would be handicapped and not helped. I realise that every time a matter of this kind is raised, it is very easy to point to an affirmative case in which something should be done, but clause 45 as it stands entitles the Commonwealth Executive, in relation to any discharged member of the forces, to override any existing provision referring to any qualification for any occupation of any description. That means that a great army of "" quacks"" could be passed out into this country. That would not be good for the country nor for the people who were passed out in that manner. If there is one thing at which we must aim it is not the lowering of standards of skill, hut the raising of these standards, That is more necessary now than ever. Anything that can be done in and under a bill of this kind to raise the level of skill of the man who has served his country for years, ought to have the support - of all of us, whatever it may cost. We do not help either him or the country by lowering the standard of skill, by dispensing with the passing of tests and the granting of diplomas or degrees for occupations which require them. This - clause, passed in its present form, and used as it could be used, might inflict very grave injury on the men it is designed to help.",70
311,Mr JAMES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Hunter) [11.16] - There has been a good deal of hypocrisy in regard to this measure. The Government has been given a mandate to pass it, and should not brook delay. I am wholeheartedly in favour of preference to ex-servicemen. Those who fought in the last war have since been provided for, but provision has not yet been made for those who have fought in the present war.",71
312,The CHAIRMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The committee has already dealt with the matter of preference, and is now dealing with the modification of conditions of entry into employment.",71
313,Mr JAMES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I am dealing with the clause, which refers to persons who desire to engage in any profession, occupation or business. There are professional politicians. I am not one, and have never wanted to be. My aim is to be a representative of the working class, to which I belong. Should the opportunity arise I am prepared to test the sincerity of those who claim to be so greatly concerned; about preference to ex-servicemen, by moving an amendment to the Electoral Act to provide that the nomination of a candidate for election to this Parliament shall not be accepted unless he has served in this war. I repeat, that the whole of the discussion on the bill savours of hypocrisy. It is a genuine attempt to do something for the ex-serviceman, yet the Opposition is delaying its passage. The.Opposition has protested against the application of the guillotine, as we did when we occupied the benches opposite. My only objection to the time allotted to the remaining stages of the bill is that it does not proride for the discussion of the measure to terminate to-night instead of next week.",71
314,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Balaclava) [11.22] The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) apprehends danger in the modification of educational and other courses. People could, as he has said, receive degrees prematurely. In my view, however, the danger lies in the other direction. At the moment, the Universities Commission controls entry to the university, under a quota system which excludes many desirable young men. Very often, it is difficult to say whether entrance should be permitted at a certain age, because some men mature later in life than others. I pointed out in my second-reading speech, that a very distinguished man of the House of Commons, who is also a King's Counsellor and may be Lord Mayor of London very shortly, was an Australian private in the last war. Upon his return to Australia, had he not been given an accelerated course and been made a Rhodes Scholar, he would not have achieved such distinction. So I suggest that whoever frames the regulations in relation to these courses should be generous, and not run the risk of students being only "" halfbaked "" when they have completed their studies. There should be the largest quota possible of young men and women, who should be given the highest education obtainable. At the same time, there may be merit in what the Leader of the Opposition has said. If the Minister can say who is to be the adviser in this matter, our fears will be allayed. I am acquainted with the case of a young articled clerk who went away without ha'ring attended the university, and was refused entry to it upon his return. Yet he intends to be a solicitor. courses must he modified to suit individual needs. Will the Minister state how that is to be done? Mr H 0 LL 0 WAY (Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Service) [11.25] - The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) are entitled to every consideration, but there is no intention under this clause to break down educational standards. The object is to help servicemen who have lost years of study to make up the leeway. Some of them have been taking correspondence courses, whilst others have attended classes for study since their return from the war. The university authorities are deeply interested in the scheme. They entertain no fears regarding it , because they will closely watch its operation. The persons in charge of the professional classes are associated with the universities and regard the scheme favourably. I have no fear that we shall run the risk of overloading the professions with half-baked recruits.",71
315,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,I agree that everything depends on the advice taken and on the administration of the scheme.,72
316,Mr HOLLOWAY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"As the matter is in the hands of the university authorities, we may safely anticipate that the proposal will prove successful.",72
317,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"New England) [11.27]. - After the last war, arrangements were made in Great B r it a in for shortened courses in medicine, law, and, I believe, also engineering, and many of these shortened courses will be necessary after the present war. There should he safeguards and also a time l i m it . Possibly a period of ten years would be a sufficient time in which to permit shortened courses to be undertaken. The Minister should jjrovide for the appointment of an authoritative body to deal with those courses in order to prevent the professions from being manned by unqualified persons. Clause agreed to. Clause 46 agreed to. Clause 47 (Functions of Commonwealth Employment Service).",72
318,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Wentworth) [11.28]. - This clause statesThe functions of the Commonwealth EmployThe ment Service shall be to provide services and facilities in relation to employment for the benefit of persons seeking to become employed, to change employment or to engage labour, to provide facilities to assist in bringing about and maintaining a high and stable level of employment throughout the Commonwealth and, in particular, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing(a) to provide facilities to assist in the rc-cmployment of discharged members of the Forces, including facilities relating to the operation of the preceding Divisions of this Part and to the operation of Part IV. of this Act; (6) to provide facilities to assist in the re-establishment of civilians who have been engaged in war work; The Opposition claims that the bill should provide only for the establishment and re-establishment in civil life of ex-servicemen. The full title of the hill includes the words "" and for other purposes"", and the clause now under consideration shows what some of those other purposes are. This measure should l)e designed exclusively for the benefit of service personnel, and civilians should be provided, for under a separate bill. The attempt by the Government to provide for the needs of servicemen and civilians in one measure must inevitably result in chaos. An ex-serviceman who attends the employment agency in order to find a job will find himself at the end of a queue of other persons who are out of employment, the other persons being civilians. If that is the way he is to be re-established in civil employment it will be a poor look-out for him. The Minister should explain why the proposed Commonwealth employment service is to be established, and what will happen to servicemen who seek employment. Will they be lumped together with civilians who are out of employment ? Among the functions of the Commonwealth employment service is the following:(/) to provide means whereby any person in receipt of unemployment benefit under the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act 1944, or of a re-employment allowance under Division 2 of Part VI . of this Act, may employment. That further aggravates the position. The Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act 1944 was passed for a specific purpose, and no doubt the Commonwealth employment service will be a vast clearing house for all of the people who will be unemployed when the Government's »cheme for full employment for all comes into operation.",72
319,Mr HOILOWAY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Service) Tll.33] - The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) has erected a man of straw in order to knock him over. The Commonwealth employment service is not a temporary scheme. It is not intended to operate in connection with demobilization, but it will he a permanent institution. It will have special offices and special officers. The latter will meet ex-servicemen as soon as they are demobilized and give to them special attention according to their needs. They will guide them to the right kinds of avocations, and if training be required the servicemen will receive it. Apart altogether from the re-employment of unemployed civilians, 100,000 or more persons have already been dealt with, and of that number only 211 required unemployment sustenance - The re-establishment of ex-servicemen is proceeding at present, but the Commonwealth employment service will continue indefinitely. There is no need for the fear3 expressed by the honourable member for Wentworth.",73
320,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Moreton) [11.35] - I was amazed to hear - the statement which the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Hoiloway) has just made. The phrase "" full employment"" has been used glibly by honourable members opposite since this debate began. We have been told that there is no need to give ex-servicemen preference in employment because full employment will be assured to all. Now the Minister tells us that a huge organization, which is - to continue indefinitely, will be set up to find jobB. It would appear that the inconveniences and restrictions associated with the manpower regulations are to be foisted on the public in perpetuity. This is not a serviceman's reinstatement bill. It is, as a obtain matter of fact, more concerned with the rehabilitation of civilians than servicemen. This clause, in particular, demonstrates effectively the Government's lack of interest in the servicemen.",73
321,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Balaclava) [11.3S] - I suppose it is too much to expect the Government to delete from the clause all reference to employment of civilians. It has purposely placed the servicemen and the civilian together in this omnibus bill. If the Government desired to make of this a measure for the employment of ex-servicemen it should omit paragraphs b and /. I suggest that those officers with whom ex-servicemen will have to deal should be specially selected, and should be impressed with the need for dealing sympathetically with applicants. In addition, social service workers and medical officers should be attached to the depots, particularly for the benefit of ex-servicemen. In my second-reading speech I cited instances of discharged Servicemen who had become discouraged because they had been sent to job after job without finding one that was suitable for them. I do not make a sweeping condemnation of man-power officials. Many are doing a good job, and I have heard .tributes to them, particularly those in the Melbourne Central Office. However, it is not enough to tell the serviceman that he will get a pension. The average soldier does not want a pension if be can do without it. A pension should be regarded as compensation for a disability. The soldier wants to be restored to civil life, and to be given a chance to make his own way. I ask the Minister to ensure that those officers who will borne into contact with ex-servicemen will be men who have themselves seen service. Mr HOLI.OWAY - Every officer in charge of a State office is a returned soldier selected because of his knowledge of the job.",73
322,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"It was recently pointed out that six new officers had been appointed to this department, none of whom was a serviceman. However, I understand that the appointments are temporary, until servicemen can be appointed. - Clause agreed to. Clause 48-(Committee s to advise Minister).",74
323,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Wentworth) [11.43]. - In this clause it is proposed to appoint a number of committees to advise the Minister' on matters of administration, but it is not provided that a majority of the members of each committee shall be ex-servicemen. I take it that the idea is that members of the committees should approach their work in a sympathetic spirit. They should be familiar with the needs of the servicemen, and the difficulties under which they had served.",74
324,Mr HOLLOWAY,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,That is the Government's policy.,74

327,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Well , that is all to the good. If the Minister will give me his assurance that a majority of the members of each committee will be ex-servicemen I shall be satisfied. I am intrigued with the words "" if any"" after the word "" allowances"" which appear in parenthesis in sub-clause 2. What do the words "" if any"" mean? Members of these committees will probably work full time and some remuneration should be paid to them.",74

334,Mr DESMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [11.50] From time to time in the post-war period large numbers of men may be required in particular occupations. For example, in the building of homes it may be found that not sufficient discharged members - of the forces will offer for training in - the various trades to enable the Government's building programme to be proceeded with and to utilize all the facilities available. Should sufficient discharged servicemen not offer for training, other persons will be trained.",74
335,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Will there be, any age limit?",75
336,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"That will depend on the number of men available. Naturally, the Government would prefer to train younger men, but the action to be taken will depend upon the number of men available. No age limit has been decided on.",75

The addition of the proviso would define eligibility, particularly as to age. I dealt with this matter in my second reading speech, when I said that in the absence of details it was reasonable to assume that it was intended to train only those servicemen who were under 21 years of age on enlistment. The Minister did not deny that, and so I take it that my assumption was correct. Those men would now be probably 25 years of age. An age limit of 21 years would do a grave injustice to a large number of men. who had never had a chance, as it would give to them an opportunity, for the first time, to qualify for their chosen vocations in life. Unless provision be made for these men now, we shall perpetuate the disabilities which they suffered before their ment. I have in mind the large number of young men who had no opportunities - at all in the depression years, and want them to have an opportunity, on in their return from active service, to - qualify in whatever calling they wish to be trained.",75

If this is limited to persons under 21 at the date of enlistment, youths who went through the depression will again be denied their rights. Two reasons exist why they should he included; first, the justice to which they are entitled, and, secondly, their inclusion will give honourable members a long sought opportunity to prove by their actions their oftexpressed solicitude for that generation. I think the Minister will see the justice of the amendment and be as generous on this occasion as he has been on others and accept it. Mr Dedman .('Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [11.55] - It is quite true, as the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) has said, that I should like to be generous in this matter, but there are difficulties in the way of implementing his suggestion. His amendment would mean that men up to 35 years of age would have the right to vocational training. Honourable .members must realise that at any given time only a percentage of the community can be undergoing training. The majority must work to provide the goods and services required for the community to carry on. Eor instance, we could not possibly have 100 per cent, of the working population engaged in training.",75

If that means that we can raise the age at enlistment to 23, 24 or 25, it will be done, but prefer not to fix an age in the bill. prefer to leave it flexible so that we alter it in accordance with the accomwhen modation and teaching staff that available. This matter was brought forward by Sir Gilbert Dyett and the other members of the federal executiveof the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and' Airmen's Imperial League when they met the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) and me in conference thismorning. We discussed it and I think they were satisfied with our assurance that it was the intention of the Government to train the greatest number possible. Friday, 25 May, 191/5.",76
355,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Balaclava) [12.1 a.m.].. - A word or two on this matter may assist the Minister. The Royal Australian Air Force has trained 30,000including engineering fitters,, riggers and radio technicians, as well as many other technicians. It has a large staff, and huge engineering at which men could lie trained. will During the second-reading debate the Minister gave figures as to the number of ex-servicemen undergoing training. The Minister said that some 1,200 men were undergoing full-time training and 300 part-time training. I said that over 300,000 bad already been demobiof lized, and only about one in 800 was receiving full-time training and one in 130 part-time training. The Minister is now condemning many thousands of availmento lives as hewers of wood and the drawers of water. They were victims be of the depression, during which they the swag and drew the dole. In 1936 I put forward a scheme for training 35,000 of them. It was agreed to at a Premiers Conference, but unfortunately lapsed. The head of the Department of Labour and National Service, we Mr Rowe, assisted me very much in After having been at war for five years, servicemen will return to a life of labouring and remain labourers until they are old men. The Minister talks of preference! Surely human problem is not something which cannot be solved. It is hopeless addressing the Minister because he will 22, not listen. But this discussion will not we be the end of the matter. The GovernWe ment will have to train these men. The may number of men who were 21 years of age they enlisted and are being trained we find now would be hard to find.",76
356,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Does the honourable member think that I can produce schools and teachers out of a hat?,77
357,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"It is all very well for the Minister to say, "" I will think about it. We shall do OUT best"". That is not good enough. Men who enlisted as privates and have risen to the rank of colonel will say when they return, "" I will not be a labourer. I want to be trained technically or clerically"". Many men who went to the last war in humble circumstances rose to high executive positions. They got their opportunities. The Minister has his opportunity, simply by lifting the age level and saying to his department, "" Give these men a chance "", and to the heads of technical education branches of the States, men like Mr Eltham, ""We will acquire the machinery and buildings of the Royal Australian Air Force for this purpose"". The Royal Australian Air Force engineering school at Ascot Vale, Melbourne, has accommodation for 6,000 pupils. It will be disbanded at any time. There is no reason why it should not the taken over as a training place. The Minister for Munitions (Mr Makin) knows the position in that regard. I am sure that if he were consulted by his colleagues, he could convince them that they could do more than they are doing with respect to technical training. More opportunities should be provided for the black-coated worker, who may have been an office boy when he enlisted, to enable him to qualify for an executive position. To-day, the Minister for Munitions received a deputation on this subject from the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, and he knows what the view of the league is on the subject. In five years, the Royal Australian Air Force trained 35,000 technicians, many of whom commenced training at the age of 35, and, in view of that achievement, much more can be done by way of vocational training of ex-servicemen than is being done at present. Whereas the Royal Australian Air Force gives specialized training, only more or less elementary training will be required in these cases. However, some ex-service personnel are not getting an opportunity to undergo even elementary training. Many apply for that opportunity, but, after being kept waiting, are told that they are unsuitable. Every man is entitled to a comfortable home, a good job and the chance to make a decent living. Any man who is disqualified from training because he is over 21 years of age is treated unjustly. Apparently, honourable members opposite are not aware that these opportunities are now given only to those who were between the ages of 18 and 21 years when they enlisted. So few of the 300,000 members of the fighting forces who so far bave been discharged are being given the opportunity to undergo training. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction simply replies that he will be guided by existing circumstances. What is to prevent him from raising the age under this clause to 30 years? In the United States of America any man, up to the age of 25 years upon mobilization, can qualify for technical training. Yet the United States of America has a far greater proportion of technically trained people than we have in Australia.",77
358,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,The honourable member should know that in the United States of America the man-power resources are not strained to anything like the degree they are in Australia.,77
359,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Apparently , the Minister is prepared to condemn a large proportion of the members of the Australian Imperial Force and the Militia to be hewers of wood and drawers of water, to be unskilled workers, for the remainder of their lives. Ho gratuity, no pension and no free bottle of medicine will compensate a man for lack of skilled knowledge. These men want to be able to earn for themselves a decent niche in life.",77
360,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,The honourable member is a humbug if ever there was one.,77
361,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The Minister is the biggest hypocrite I have ever known. I have had a lifetime in the services, and I speak from experience. I shall attack the Minister in his electorate, and elsewhere. I shall go after him at every opportunity in' order to try to remove him from this Parliament because of the scandalous attitude he adopts towards returned men. I am speaking with greatearnestness on this matter, but the Minister sits at the table and laughs. He acts the buffoon one minute, and goes into hysterics in the next.",77
362,The CHAIRMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Mr Riordan) Order!,78
363,Mr WHITE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I resent the presence in a democratic Parliament of a Minister who sneeTS when honourable members point out the fact that members of the services are not being given the opportunities due to them to undergo technical training. I resent the Minister's remark. I am sorry that he has refused to accept my suggestion. I commenced my remarks in a helpful way in order to give him information concerning technical training resources, of which he appears to be unaware; but he does not wish to be given that information. I repeat that under this clause the age should be raised to 30 years.",78
364,Mr BURKE,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Perth) [12.10 a.m.] I hope that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) will endeavour to raise the age at which members of the services will be eligible for training. I regard, this as one of the most important parts of the measure. I believe that under the clause as it stands, an undesirable restriction may be placed upon ex-service personnel who on their discharge may desire to undergo vocational training. The remark made by the Minister concerning the present strain on our available man-power emphasizes the need for making such training available to as many ex-service personnel as possible. Should the demobilization of the fighting forces be properly planned, it is probable that we shall not have a surplus of labour in the immediate post-war years, but rather a labour shortage. Should that prove to be so, many men who should have had the opportunity of a conversion course, or a course of vocational training, will certainly not be able to take advantage of such courses, because they will be obliged to return immediately to their former employment. In this respect, I instance the teaching profession. Teachers who have been serving with the forces for periods up to five years will be returned immediately to their profession in order to make up the present shortage. They have been out of touch with developments in their profession in the interim, and, being denied the advantage of a refresher course, will be unable to keep abreast of their profession. Therefore, even ex-service personnel who are obliged to return immediately to their former occupation or profession should have the right, later, when .the shortage of man-power is remedied, to elect to undergo 7ocational or conversion courses in order to enable them to make up the leeway incurred during their absence with the fighting forces. The Minister should provide tba* as far as j>ossihle all service personnel who can benefit by such training shoulr"" be given the opportunity to undergo it. As the industrialization of the country proceeds we shall probably find men in many walks of life who may be redundant in the activity in which they were formerly engaged. It is a good investment in the interests of the nation and of the individuals themselves to retrain such men. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) has pointed out that in the A i r Force we have been able to train men in comparatively short periods to do intricate work. I have no doubt that we shall require to retrain many men in the immediate post-war period. However, I have in mind particularly men of the classes which I have indicated, namely, those who on their return are obliged to take up their former occupation or profession without bsiug given the opportunity to get abreast of the developments in their callings during their absence in the services. Such cases should, be met by providing that later, when circumstances permit, they will be given the opportunity to undergo courses to bring themselves up to date in their former profession, or to engage in other trades or callings for which they believe they are more suited. Amendment negatived. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 50(1.) For the purposes of this Part there shall be a Central Reconstruction Training Committee.",78
365,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [12.14 a.m.] - My colleague, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis), has circulated an, amendment on this clause. It is similar to the amendment he submitted with respect to the personnel of the reinstatement committees and the preference boards, and, therefore, I shall not repeat his arguments. On his behalf, I move That, after sub-clause (3.), the following new sub-clause be inserted:"" (3 A . ) Any organization representing charged members of the Forces throughout the Commonwealth may submit to the Minister a list containing the names of not less than three persons from which the organization recommends that a selection be made ot a person to be appointed as one of the members of the Committee and the Minister may appoint a person selected from the list so submitted to be one of the members of the Committee."".

366,Mr MENZIES,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [12.15 a.m.] - On behalf of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis), I move That, after sub-clause (3.), the following new sub-clause be inserted:"" (3 A . ) Any organization representing discharged members of the Forces throughout the Commonwealth may, in respect of any Regional Training Committee, Industrial Committee or Provisional Committee, submit to the Muiister a list containing the names of not less than three persons from which the organization recommends that a selection be made of a person to be appointed as a member of the committee and the Minister may appoint a person selected from the list so submitted to be one of the members of the Committee."". Amendment negatived. - Clause agreed to. Clause 52 agreed to. Clause 53The regulations may proscribe matters providing for or in relation to(d) 13ie giving effect to any scheme for the training of persons under this Part agreed upon between the Commonwealth and any organization composed of or representative of employers and employees; and Amendment (by Mr Dedman) agreed toThat, in paragraph (d ) , the word "" and "" first occurring, be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" or "". Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 54In this Part, "" disabled person"" means a discharged member of the Forces, or a person included in any prescribed class of persons, who, by reason of injury, disease or disdeformity, is substantially handicapped in obtaining, or maintaining himself in, employment, or in undertaking work on his own account, of a kind which, but for that injury, disease or deformity, would, in the opinion of the Minister, be suitable to his age, experience and qualifications, and ""disablement"" has a corresponding meaning.",79
367,Mr RYAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Flinders) [12.16 a.m..] I move That the words "" or a person included in any prescribed class of persons"" be left out. This clause appears to suffer from the same defects as many other clauses, because it "" lump3 together "" ex-servicemen and civilians. It is most unfortunate that men and women who suffered serious injuries to body and mind while serving in operational areas, should now be classed with members of the civil population, who may have bad similar disabilities from birth. Certainly, they did not sustain them in the service of their country. Disabled civilians should be dealt with in other legislation, such as the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act. Servicemen who were disabled while in the armed forces will be placed at a great disadvantage if they are put in the same category as disabled civilians. Doubtless the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) will reply that the persons whom he has in mind arc members of the Australian Comforts Fund or the Red Cross, but in point of fact, the provisions of this clause may be extended to cover other civilians. A definite decision should now be riiade in order to ensure that only those persons who incurred disabilities when they were on active service shall be deemed to be "" disabled persons"" for the purposes of this clause.",79
368,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,'Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [12.19 a.m.] - I am not prepared to 'accept the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Ryan).,79
369,Mr FADDEN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,That is surprising!,79
370,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"When I explain the reason,, the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Eadden) will agree that I am justified in rejecting the amendment. The honourable member for Flinders stated that the phrase "" or a person included in any prescribed class of persons "" might include civilians. That interpretation is obviously incorrect, because, under the Constitution, the Commonwealth Government has no power to legislate with relation to the employment of disabled persons, unless those persons were disabled in the defence of the Commonwealth, or in a service carried on by the Commonwealth, such as the posts and telegraph service. At any rate, the powers of the Commonwealth in this matter are restricted to a very limited class of person and cannot possibly apply to the whole population.",79
371,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Then whom has the Minister in mind?,80
372,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Individual s of the same class as I mentioned earlier.,80
373,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,An officer of the Salvation Army?,80
374,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Yes : A member of the Young Women's Christian Association, Young Men's Christian Association or Salvation Army, disabled when rendering service in a combat area, should not be excluded from the benefits of this legislation.",80
375,Mr RYAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"If the Commonwealth has power to legislate for sickness benefits, why can it not legislate for disabled persons?",80
376,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"The Commonwealth, I think, can make grants of money to any individual in the community, but what the Government proposes to do in this division of the bill is to legislate for the employment of disabled persons. Employment is one of the powers which, generally, the Commonwealth does not possess under the Constitution. But it has power to legislate for the employment of disabled persons, provided they were disabled while performing some service relating to the existing powers of the Commonwealth. If they were disabled in the defence of the Commonwealth, whether they were members of the forces or the civilian population, I think that the Commonwealth would be entitled to legislate for their employment. That is all that is intended by the inclusion of the words "" or a person included in any prescribed class of persons"". I hope that my explanation will satisfy the honourable member for Flinders and that he will withdraw his amendment.",80
377,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,Wentworth) [12.22 a.m.] - I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister (Mr. Dedman).,80
378,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,The honourable member would not be satisfied with it ,80
379,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"I believe that the Minister is telling the committee what he has in mind regarding those persons prescribed in this clause, but the honourable gentleman will not always be Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. The present. Minister for Transport (Mr. Ward) was formerly Minister for Labour and National Service. One day he might become Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. If words mean anything, this clause gives power to a person who may become Minister for Post-war Reconstruction to interpret them literally. It would then lie within his power to prescribe persons whom the present Minister for Post-war Reconstruction might not have in mind at present.",80
380,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,What class of person?,80
381,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Anybody who works under Commonwealth control. Therefore, the point made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Ryan) was well taken. Earlier, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) declared that disabled persons would not enjoy preference after the expiration of the seven-year period, and the Minister replied that those persons were catered for in a special part of the bill. However, this clause caters not only for disabled persons but also for "" a person included in any prescribed class of persons "". The' honourable member for Flinders gave his interpretation of those words. The Minister may have something else in mind: but Mr Thornton, who represented the Commonwealth Government in London, or the Minister for In formation (Mr Calwell), might, in the fullness of time, become Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, and neither has ftn y sympathy for ex-seiwicemen would place a literal interpretation on those words. The Minister should place the matter ""beyond doubt and accept the amendment moved by the mission, honourable member for Flinders.",80
382,Mr RYAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Flinders) [12.25 a.m.] I. am not entirely convinced by the ment advanced by the Minister for Postvision war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) in reother lation to the constitutional aspect. He claimed that the Commonwealth was not constitutionally able to prescribe employthat ment for all disabled persons, but I conthis division. tend that as the Commonwealth has been able to pass a law dealing with sickness benefits, it should be able to legislate with regard to disabled persons. The whole question of the category of persons to be covered depends on the view of the Minister as to what class of persons is to be prescribed or is not to be prescribed. As it will be necessary include, within the scope of this clause, statescertain classes of people who are not discharged service men and women- I rebe fer, for instance, to officers of the Army Comforts Funds, the Australian Red circumstances, Cross, &c - wh y not specify the organiin the Kegister. zations in the clause and so remove the possibility of doubt.",81

If that person became disabled as result of his work in that area, be entitled to the benefit of this sion. The benefit which this portion the measure prescribes is the benefit obtaining employment. It is quite true, as the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Ryan) has said, that we could vide a benefit in the form of a monetary contribution to these individuals, but we and do not want to do that. Persons whose disablement is the result of their service with the fighting forces will obtain a pension from the Repatriation Combut so far as possible, we want these individuals to take their place in the community, and be useful workers to the degree that their disability will permit. arguWe cannot do that unless we make profor them in this bill or in some measure. I do not think that there can be any objection to the inclusion of such persons in this clause, thus ensuring they shall receive the benefits of Amendment negatived.' Clause agreed to.

At the end and of three months, the allowance payable e under this clause will cease, and that may impose hardship upon these men. I suggest that the Minister for Posta war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) should We examine this matter with a view to extending the period to, say, six months, any or in special cases twelve months.",81

390,Mr FRANCIS,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Moreton) [12.37 a.m.]. - I have heard the Minister, and other honourable members opposite, say that the provision enacted by the Hughes Administration, for preference to be given to ex-servicemen wherever practicable, meant nothing. That argument has been used since 1917. Yet I am now asked to accept a similar proposal. I repeat, the Minister 'has been most unreasonable.

Amendment (by Mr Francis) negativedThat, after sub-clause (1.), the following new sub-clause be inserted:"" (1 A . ) Amy organization representing discharged members of the Forces throughout the Commonwealth may, in respect - of any such committee, submit to the Minister a list containing the names of not less than three ""persons from which the organization recommends that a selection bo made of a. person to be appointed as one of the members of the committee and the Minister may appoint a person selected from the list so submitted to 'be one of the members of the Oommittee."".

Clause 62A member of the Forces . . . shall, prior to his discharge from the Defence Force, unless his discharge is other than an honourable discharge, be entitled to leave of absence (to be known as re-establishment leave)Amendment (by Mr Dedman) agreed toThat, after the word "" is "" , the following words be inserted:-""in the opinion of the prescribed authority,""",82
391,Mr HARRISON,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Wentworth) [12.41 a.m.] - The Government having proclaimed its recognition of the value of the services rendered by members of the forces in keeping Australia free, one could have expected it to make the re-establishment leave of those men commensurate with the work that they have done. A man who has served for six or seven years is to have no greater re-establishment leave than one who has served for only six months. I suggest leave of one month for each complete year of service, with a maximum of three months. That is the procedure usually adopted in connection with long-service leave. A man who has served overseas for six or seven years should have more leave than one who has served for only seven months, and certainly more than double that of a man who has served for less than seven months. The proposal of the Government does not make sense.",83
392,Mr DEDMAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [12.44 a.m.] - I cannot adopt the suggestion of the honourable gentleman. Honourable members will be aware that clause 2 provides that each part and division of the bill shall come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation. The provision in relation to re-establishment leave has been specially designed by the Government to come into operation ""during the demobilization period. Clause 62 provides for a grant of re-establishment leave to members of the forces in the period prior to their discharge, at the rate of 30 days when a member has been engaged on war service for not less than six months, and in other cases fifteen days. The provision forms a part of the Government's plans to meet the general demobilization problem. The leave is one of the measures designed to meet the circumstances which will arise when general demobilization occurs following [73] the conclusion of hostilities with Japan. At this stage, when large numbers of members of the forces are being demobilized, the individual member m i l need time to look for suitable employment and to adjust himself to his civilian surroundings. All members on discharge will receive their deferred pay entitlements, and 'leave or payment in lieu of it for their 'overseas service, as well as accumulated recreation leave. Overseas service leave is granted on the basis of seven and a half days for every six - months of service overseas, and ""recreation leave is credited at the rate 'of two days for every month of service, 'all accumulations being preserved to the member. Members serving in the Pacific theatre outside Australia receive both 'recreation leave and overseas leave entitlement. The provision of re-establishment leave will give a further benefit to those members who are discharged following the termination of hostilities with Japan during the period when general demobilization operates, and is a part of the comprehensive range of provisions to meet the case of servicemen released on general demobilization. This leave is to be granted, not in recognition of the length of service of members, but in order that they shall have time to re-establish themselves in 'certain occupations.",83
393,Mr RYAN,MINISTERIAL INTERFERENCE,"Flinders) [12.47 a.m.] 'How does this proposal fit in with the 'ordinary leave which servicemen get prior to their discharge? They may have accumulated one or two months' leave, but according to this clause the .'^-establishment leave is to be taken immediately prior to their discharge. I suggest that it should be taiken immediately after discharge. ' Mr Dedman - It will be given in addition to the ordinary leave to which they are entitled.",83

AUSTRALIAN ARM Y: DETENTION OF SAPPER SLADE.",84
399,Mr DEDMAN,TOTAL MONTHLY COSTS OF THE VOLUNTEER,"On the 16th May, 1945, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr. Conelan, asked a question concerning Q.121115, Sapper Slade, who was courtmartialed and sentenced to detention for absence without leave. The Acting Minister for the Army has supplied the following answer:This case has been investigated and it transpires that the soldier was called up on the 12th January, 1942, for full-time duty in the Australian Military Forces and served until the 8th December, 1942, when he was released for employment in a reserved occupation. Wit h the consent of the Deputy Director General of Man Power, the company in which lie was employed terminated liis employment and on the Kith March, 1944, Sapper Slade was again made available for militar y service by the National Service Officer. He was called up on the 29th March, 1944, and marched into the Recruit Reception Wing for allocation in the Army. After training, ho was posted to the loth Australian Field Company, Royal Australian Engineers, and served with the unit until the 3rd December, 1944, when lie absented himself without leave. He was arrested in Brisbane on the 23rd March. 1945, when he was wearing military uniform. A court-martial was convened and in his evidence Sapper Slade pleaded guilty and stated his reason for absenting himself without leave was the illness of his wife. No other explanation was given by the defendant. Slade was sentenced to detention for seven months, but the confirming authority directed that the sentence be reviewed on the 2nd July, 1945, with a view to suspension subject to good conduct. This means that, provided his conduct is good while in detention, he will serve only three months' sentence. Subsequently, reports appeared in a section of the press that Slade was convicted because he was unable to produce documents which would have proved his case. The press report stated that Sapper Slade had been given permission by Man Power to change his job and that, after the termination of his employment in a reserved occupation on the 10th March. 1944, he should have been permitted to engage in other civilian employment and t h a i he should not have been called up. No reference was made to this at the court-martial, and it has no relation to the military offence. No reference was made at the court-martial to any missing documents which would assist Slade to prove his case, hut present inquiries disclose that Slade has a certificate of discharge issued to him on the 2fith July, 1944. This discharge related to his previous service from the 12th January, 1942, until the Sth December, 1942. It is clear that Sapper Slade could not have been under any misapprehension as to the nature of this discharge certicate and that he deliberately and wit h full knowledge of what he was doing, absented himself without leave. claim that his arrest, trial and punishment were unjust is not sustained.
