3,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Home and Territories (1) Whether he has a Bill prepared providing for preferential voting at parliamentary' elections; and if so, when will he introduce it ; and (2) Whether he has been made aware, that the undue delay in introducing this measure is causing much dissatisfaction, more particularly as no reason has been given for it ?",21
4,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have two Bills dealing with electoral matters. One of them is designed to secure uniformity in regard to Commonwealth and State procedure, and on it . I hope Boon to get the decision of Parliament, so that the State authorities may be afforded an opportunity to r deal with the matter. The second B i ll deals with, methods of election, and when I submit it to the Cabinet will probably include provisions relating to preferential voting, as well as provisions dealing with the method of Senateelections. Both Bills are practically ready, but. I have not yet had an opportunity of obtaining the opinion of my colleagues regarding them. PRIVILEGE.",21
5,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I ask you a question, Mr Speaker. It relates to something that happened during the recent adjournment, in regard to which the honourable member for Cook. and myself promised that . a question of privilege would be raised as 'soon as Parliament should meet again. I ask whether you propose to refer to the matter today?",21
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I propose to. make a statement on the subject during the course of., today's proceedings. Later:",21
7,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"May I ask, Mr . Speaker, whether a question of - privilege with does not take precedence of all other business ?",21
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"No question of privilege has so far been raised, and I am not prepared to say that any question of privilege is involved in the statement whioh I propose to make to the House later. It will be for the House itself to determino that point. I considered that before submitting the statement to honourable members it would be well to allow questions without notice and other formal business tb be disposed of. NA",21

If the Minister is not aware of these facts, will he make inquiry concerning the case, and will he also see that it is made impossible for a reputable citizen to be treated as a criminal for what at the most is merely a breach of the military regulations?",22
10,Mr WISE,UNLAWFULWEARING OF,"I do not know anything about the case, but I shall have inquiries made concerning it . MILITARY PENSIONS.",22
11,Dr MALONEY,UNLAWFULWEARING OF,"I understand that returned soldiers who have taken lip the craft of weaving are not so well treated in Victoria as in New South Wales. I have been credibly informed that from the pensions of such men there is deducted in Victoria the amount of their earnings, so that indirectly these men are being penalized for assisting themselves. I have here in the suit I wearing a sample of the weaving done by a man who, three months before the material was woven, knew nothing of weaving. Will the Minister in whose Department the matter lies make an inquiry into the matter?",22

13,Mr KELLY,UNLAWFULWEARING OF,"Some time ago it was the practice of the Post and Telegraph Department to stamp letters with a lettermark at both the place of posting and the ofiice of receipt. That practice was discontinued allegedly in the interests of economy. I desire to ask the Postmaster Generai whether, in view of occasional delays that have taken place in the delivery of correspondence, & c , ^e will take into earnest consideration the advisableness of reinstituting that check upon the Department in the public interest ?",22

15,Mr CONSIDINE,UNLAWFULWEARING OF,Is the Minister representing the Minister for Defence aware of the scandalous treatment that is being meted out to lads in training at Broken Hill under the compulsory military service provisions of the Defence Act? I refer to the brutal sentences that are being imposed on some of these boys for slight breaches of discipline. Will the honourable gentleman contrast such sentences with those inflicted in other parts of Australia for similar offences ? I ask him to have inquiries made.,22
16,Mr WISE,UNLAWFULWEARING OF,If the honourable member will furnish me with particulars of the cases to which he refers I shall have inquiries made. AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE. ALTEB'ATIONS OF PAY .,22
17,Mr CHARLTON,UNLAWFULWEARING OF,"Is the Minister representing the Minister for Defence aware that considerable delay occurs in forwarding from abroad official advice in regard to alterations made in the payments to our soldiers, and that consequently there is a good deal of dissatisfaction on the part of dependants? Will the honourable gentleman take action to expedite the ream ceipt of such official information ?",22
18,Mr WISE,UNLAWFULWEARING OF,I will see that that is done. SMALL ARMS FACTORY : UNEMPLOYMENT.,22
19,Mr NICHOLLS,UNLAWFULWEARING OF,"I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that 1,000 men previously employed at the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow, are at present out of work, and if so, whether .he will take steps to see that these men are returned to their employment as quickly as possible ?",22

21,Mr HIGGS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he remembers the promise he made to our soldiers, that he would not desert them either during the war or afterwards, and whether he has seen a paragraph which appeared in the Argus of 20th February last to the effect that a request by a returned soldier that he should be given a monopoly of bone collecting and rag-picking at the Footscray rubbish tip was refused by the local council on the ground that there were other returned soldiers earning a living in the same way? Will the Prime Minister state what has becpme of the repatriation scheme ?",22
22,Mr HUGHES,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I have not seen the paragraph, and I do not recall the circumstances. The honourable member, perhaps, will supply me with the information. WAR PRECAUTIO NS ACT : PROSECUTIONS.",23
23,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he will consider the advisableness of creating a department, free from political control, to take action under the War Precautions Act with a view of preventing the followers the Government, both inside and outside of Parliament, from endeavouring to bring about a revolution in Australia.",23
24,Mr HUGHES,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I shall have pleasure in dealing with anyone who tries to bring about a revolution in Australia. whom is the honourable member alluding?,23
25,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I am alluding to a lot of clergymen and press writers. Later :,23
26,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I do not think the Prime Minister quite grasped the question I put to him. A lot of individuals are tion of Australian leather ? eudeavouring to bring about a rebellion by urging the arrest of otlier people, and I submit that they ought to be prosecuted under the War Precautions Act. At present the Government alone can take action. Will the Prime Minister create department, free from political control, which will be empowered to take action uuder the War Precautions Act"", so that hia supporters, as well as the supporters of our party, may be prosecuted where prosecutions are considered necessary?",23
27,Mr HUGHES,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I understand the honourable member's suggestion is that 1 will not prosecute persons other than those whose political opinions do not coincide with my own. That is a reflection upon me-, which, if justified, would make than leather. me unworthy to hold office. honourable member states is not in accordout. ance with fact. I am ready to prosecute anybody who offends against the War Precautions Regulations.",23
28,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Has the Prime M in ister read the cables in this morning's press regarding the methods adopted in the United States of America for the treatment of disloyalists? If so, will he introduce the same punishments in Australia ?",23
29,Mr HUGHES,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I read the cable message to which the honourable member refers, and I think it stated that the penalty proposed in America is imprisonment for twenty years and a fine'of £2,000. I do not know whether we shall best deal with disloyalists in that way or by some shorter method. I-shall tliink the matter over. DEPORTATION S.",23
30,Mr CONSIDINE,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Is the Prime M in ister prepared to inform the House as to how many men have been deported from of the Commonwealth, and the reasons for their deportation, and what number of ! men are being held at the present time witli a view to deportation?",23

33,Mr HUGHES,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I am aware that cona siderable trouble has been created by the embargo placed by the British Government on the importation of Australian leather. We have made many representations to the Imperial Government, and I am sorry that so far none of them has been successful. I shall be very glad to make further and more pressing representations, but the honourable member must realise that the scarcity of freight is the real reason for this embargo.",23

35,Mr BAYLEY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Will the Minister for the Navy inform the House whether any steps have heen taken to utilize the services of returned soldiers to relieve those Naval cadets who have been performing picket duty for some months, and thereby have been prevented from, continuing their training for ordinary civil avocations?",24
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Step s have been taken, in that direction, and, in a very great many cases, relief has been already effected. We are doing our best to recruit returned soldiers to the fullest possible extent, and as we do that, we shall return the young trainees to their ordinary occupations. NA MINISTRY.",24
37,Mr JH CATTS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"Will the Prime Minister say whether it is true, as published in the press, that there has been some reconstruction of the Ministry ? If so, does he propose to make any announcement to the House as to the new appointments and the duties to be performed by the new Ministers ? ,.",24
38,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"I am not able to say whetlier the report in the particular paper the honourable member read is correct; but there has been a reconstruction of the Ministry, and in regard to it I made an official announcement!. As soon as the preliminary business is disposed of I shall make a statement to the House on a motion for the printing of a certain paper, and it will then be competent for honourable members to discuss the whole matter. T HEWAR : AUSTRALIAN TROOPS. Motion (by Mr HUGHE S) proposed - That this House records its unbounded admiration of the heroic efforts of the Allied Armies on the Western Front, its pride in the valour and achievements of the Australian troops, and its firm intention to fight on to secure a victorious peace and the freedom of the world.",24
39,Mr BRENNAN,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"(Batman) [3.28] - I would be most hearty in my co-operation in a motion congratulating our Australian soldiers upon their valour, and, in deed, any soldiers who have fought for the Allies in this war, but I do not propose to concur in any further fatuous expressions on the part of this Government in regard to what they are pleased to term a ""victorious peace.'' I .think that the very presence of this Government in office and in this House is in itself prejudicial in the highest degree to the success of our arms, and I consider, further, that the head of the Government knows perfectly well that when a few months ago he pledged himself to a certain course of action, and was condemned by every member ot the Labour party, and by leading representatives of his own party outside this Parliament, for having failed to honour his word, and when he still continued to cling to the spoils of office in spite of that condemnation, he deliberately made the policy of recruiting a failure. He knew, without question or doubt, that the policy he had decided upon, would inevitably reduce' the Australian quota of reinforcements to a minimum. Quite apart from that fact, I do not propose to join in - a resolution of this kind, which expresses our inflexible determination to continue this war until we have won a victorious peace.  is for Germany!",24
40,Mr BRENNAN,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"l t is easy for the Prime Minister, and for the barrackers who sit behind him, in their safe places in this House, and with the support of the persons who keep them there, fco prate about carrying on this war until we have achieved what they call a victorious peace. They suffer very little from their resolution ; the price of their inflexibility is very light. I am one of those who believe now as I did, but much more strongly, in 1915, that it is not beyond the competence of our own statesmen to bring this war to an end. It ought to be brought to an end; it is my opinion that w e - I had almost said wickedly, but I certainly say insanelymissed one golden opportunity that presented itself to us some time ago of entering into negotiations for the purpose of bringing this war to an honourable and speedy end. I am happy to know that since I expressed that view in 1915 I find myself a very humble follower of many distinguished statesmen of the British Empire at the heart of the Empire. At the very opening of these sittings of the House I want 'the Government to understand that it is quite idle for them to associate with motions of fchis kind the names of our valorous Australiansoldiers, or for them to suppose that under the cover of those immortal names they can prate here about those things which they not only know are incapable of realization, but which, as they also know, are rendered less capable of realization by the very course which they have pursued. It was only a .moment ago that I learnt that this motion was to be moved. I desire fco say nothing further about it at the present time, except that, in giving expression to my own settled convictions, and speaking for the Labour party, whose delegate I am, I say the time has arrived when our best efforts should be directed to bringing this war to an honourable end, so that it may no longer stain civilization with the blood of millions of our fellow men. I want to see some statesman-like effort made to embrace opportunities from time to time arising to open negotiations which will end this bloodshed at the earliest possible moment.",24
41,Dr MALONEY,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"Melbourne) [3.33] I certainly will support the motion. . MTKTBTKRIAI, MEMBEBS - Hear , hear!",25
42,Dr MALONEY,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"I am not seeking the cheers of honourable members. neither want their cheers nor their, pity. of Is. a year. I believe that there will always be a blight on civilization unless the cursed cancer Prussia's power is destroyed. Even though Archdeacon Hindley lied in the pulpit the House of God when he said that I others were only f it to sign an address welcome to the Kaiser, I recognise while there is a Hohenzollern on the throne of Prussia or a Hapsburg on the at the Front,' becomes ill . It is not his throne of Austria-Hungary, those brutal kingly murderers, there is no hope for civilization, and my address of welcome the Kaiser would be to see him and all kinglets of Germany hanged at Berlin. Afc the same time, I recognise that fchis war would not have lasted so long had it not been for the aristocratic governdren ment of Great Britain , that has not given any of its subjects the right to the ground that they are human beings, the Front. and is saying today that a woman entitled to vote until she has reached the age of thirty years. That abominascience tion of the ages, and that infamy of present day, called the House of Lords, says, "" We will only have 4,000,000 more voters."" I honour our brave men, and I cannot understand how ministers of ligion in Germany are idolizing that beast the Kaiser, saying that he is the God-appointed man to rule the world. If they would only follow the preaching of Christ they would say that any one who causes war is nothing but hell's agent. Some of the most brutal and bloodthirsty men I have heard on the platforms in Australia are those who earn their living as servants of Christ. I am tired of a good many of them; bufc I am proud of the bravery of our boys at the Front. Why do not the Government admit what some of them know is a fact, that there are 1,000,000 Americans in training in France and England? The information is in their Departments, so I have been informed, and I have been told by an American who came here to repret sent the whole of the Chambers of Commerce of the TJnited States of America that there were 960,000 Americans training in France before the vote was taken on the 20th December last. It is this hide-up policy, and also our in fernal system of treating the dependants of soldiers, that is a drag on our efforts. In the State of New South Wales there are 700 widows who have their homes rent I free, or else pay a peppercorn rental Can any honourable member_representing a Victorian constituof ency name five widows in Victoria who are similarly situated? I can name one, in ' and one only. If Ministers are anxious and to get recruits-if they are honest and of sincere in their desire-let them treat .the that women and children better, and not punish them because the husband, who is 1 fault;, it is the'fault of the commanding officer, who has not taken proper medical to care of the men, who, he knows, are exthe posed to danger. What is the holocaust of blood which presents itself to us today compared with the constant waste of infant life ? In times of peace, more childie each year from bad attention, poor food, and inadequate clothing than vote on all the men who are now dying at Therefore, I seek cheers is not from no honourable member opposite. I care little for them. So long as my contells me that I am right, I will the follow the course that I choose, even though, in the opinion of others, it may be the wrong one. But while I support the motion, I ask Ministers to follow the renoble example of Queensland in regard to brute the treatment of returned soldiers and their dependants. A nd next to Queensland is New South Wales. Next to New South Wales is Western Australia.",25
43,Mr WATKITTS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,Thei r treatment in New South Wales is bad enough for anything.,26
44,Dr MALONEY,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"- In New South Wales there are 700 widows who have no fear of the landlord's knock. I cannot point to anything equalling that in any other State. I am ashamed of Victoria in this respect, and I am ashamed of this Government in allowing women and children to be punished when the fathers or husbands f all ill . The honourable member for Nepean (Mr Orchard), who now sits here as a Minister, made one of the first big exposures of the administration of the Defence Department in this . House. What was done ? The man concerned went away with groans and sneers. Some said that he would not dare to go to the Eront, else he might not come back again. The honourable member knows that his accusations were met with ridicule at that time. There are many other abuses. The suit of clothes that I am wearing was made from cloth hand woven in Queen-street, Melbourne, by returned soldiers. Those men are not getting a fair deal. It has been intimated to them that they must not interfere with private enterprise, and they are not allowed to supply a suit of clothes to any one, though any person should be proud of wearing a suit of clothes cut from cloth woven in Australia. The men who are doing the same class of work in New South Wales are far better treated under the Eed Cross. I asked the men in Melbourne who their boss was. not know. A splendid man, who has seen service both in the Imperial Forces and during the present war, is teaching them, but he is not getting a fair show. If he would send all his cloth to the warehousemen in Flinders-lane it would be all right. I appeal to the Prime Minister, to Senator Millen, or whoever is in charge, to see that our returned men get fair play. The landlord of the splendid building where the weaving is being done to which I have referred, lets it for the purposes of the returned soldiers at the nominal rental of Is. per week; and I am only asking the Government to do something in the nature of what private people are doing, and, above all, to remove the i nfamy of the"" ill-treatment of the women and children, while, at the same time, so providing for the men that they shall not have to slink round and beg, as some of them have to do at present. I am sorry that medical opinion has not reached agreement as to the nervous affections caused to our soldiers on active servioe. A man suffering from shell shock may appear to have perfectly recovered, but he may not be answerable for all his actions for many years to come; and, unfortunately, the pension given is not sufficient for many of them. In supporting this motion, I speak for myself personally, as I take it the honourable member for Batman does also. While I shall vote for the motion, I must say that there is something in what has been advanced by that honourable member. While we are offering congratulations, we are doing very little in our own weak way to show the men our appreciation of their efforts; and it would be much better if we looked after their dependants better than we have done, and saw that the men themselves received every practical consideration.",26
45,Mr JH CATTS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"Cook) [3.43] - We all, I am sure, have the most unbounded admiration for the most magnificent stand being made on the Western Front by the Allies, and especially for the part taken by the Australian soldiers; and I hesitate to express one word in connection with a motion of this kind which would introduce any disharmony. But the use ' of the word "" victorious ""-the insistence on what is called a "" victorious peace "" is open to an interpretation which might place some honourable members in an They did Utterly false position. Unfortunately, this motion has been sprung on the House without notice; and it is rather difficult, on the spur of the moment, to make any statement which may not be capable of being misinterpreted or misunderstood. I suggest that if the word "" v i c to r i o u s "" were replaced by the word "" equitable,"" every'one might agree to the proposition.",26
46,Mr MCDONALD,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,""" H o n o r a b l e "" peace.",26
47,Mr JH CATTS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"We could call it an "" h o n o r a b l e "" or an "" e q u i table "" peace; but, certainly, ""victorious peace ' ' does give the impression in some minds that the war is to be carried out to the bitter end, and is to become one of aggrandisement, both as to territory and economic wealth. Certainly, if the position is interpreted in the light of the Paris Conference and the speeches of our own Prime Minister in connection therevour with , the motion seems to commit the House to do something which proof previous wars ? bably the Prime Minister himself would feel like revising after our experience since that time. This war ought to be brought to a conclusion at the earliest opportunity that honourable .understanding can be arrived at. If all the Powers fighting the war there. found that they could gain nothing by the war:-if they found that by use of the sword they gained not one point in economic advantage or territorial aggrandisement, it would be the greatest object lesson to the world that the sword of a submarine base there. must not be resorted to again for the purheard pose of either advancing the welfare nations, or rectifying old grievances.",26
48,Mr BOYD,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,Surely you do not think for a moment that any of the Allies entered the war to make profit out of it ?,27
49,Mr JH CATTS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"I do not think so; but I must say there is some confusion in my own mind, and in the public mind, caused by the varying statements that are made, corresponding to the fluctuations in the fortunes of the war. As I have said previously, I stand absomore to be feared in that quarter. lutely by Britain in the publicly expressed object for which she entered the war; since then aims have been stated were then never hinted at. Of course, one has some diffidence in saying things in connection fchafc may be misunderstood other places; but, apparently, the have been so hardly put to it that, order to induce others to come to their aid, they have had to arrive at some kind of understanding with them. Whilst is to be sympathized with, it may make the difference between what may be called an ""honourable peace"" or an ""equitable peace"" and a "" victorious peace."" "" victorious "" peace may mean the imposithemselves when appealing tion of terms upon the vanquished to pay for assistance bargained. for. That may be vastly different from a ""just"" I submit 'that this war ought to be brought to a conclusion on a basis of the status ante helium. '",27

53,Mr JH CATTS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"Le t me tell the an honourable member straight out, if he wants a reply, that I do not think the German is the worse enemy we could have I have no sympathy with Germany or German militarism; but some the honourable members seem to lose their heads about New Guinea, although we are told by navy men that it would be impossible to construct anything in the nature We have it stated that there is great accomof modation for submarines and other warships at New Guinea, but navy officers whom I have met-me n who have served at Rabaul and New Guinea-tel l me that the whole character of the locality renders such a thing absolutely impossible. As a matter of fact, we ourselves endeavoured to send a submarine there, and we lost it . The whole character of the coast, with its rocky and coral-bound waterways, renders any idea of a naval base there an absurdity. There is probably something By insisting that Germany, Austria, and but Turkey shall be shorn of this and that which possession, you provide the statesmen of those countries with the best propaganda this that they can have. The declaration that in territory will be taken from them by the Allies Allies has made the masses of Germany in and of Austria feel that they are now fighting a life and death struggle against the aggression of foreign powers. . It is that these braggings about a victorious peace, all and about what we are going to do when we have utterly crushed the enemy, that are largely responsible for the comfortable A position in which German statesmen find to tlieir people. However, the subject is a difficult one to discuss without some preparation. peace.

Exception is taken to word ""victorious"" in the - motion, and exception to that word was taken by Labour gathering in Perth some twelve months ago. What will be a victorious peace for the Allies is a peace that enable them to demand of Germany's military power that it shall restore map so far as Belgium, Russia, and Serbia are concerned.",28
57,Mr FENTON,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,Is not that equitable?,28
58,Mr HEITMANN,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"Yes ; but such a peace can be brought about only by force of arms. To those people who say that we should have peace, and that we can obtain it by peaceful methods, Russia should be a sufficient example. Her fate should convince of his folly the greatest pacifist in the world.",28

62,Mr HEITMANN,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"Yes . Is there a canman in this country who, after the experiences of the last three years, fails to recognise the inutility of endeavouring to open up negotiations for peace with Germany? The doubts expressed as to the with advisability of passing a motion of this kind, and the protests by certain members in regard to the disabilities under which our soldiers and their wives labour, while at showing that we are not dealing fairly with those who are fighting for us, contain the insinuation that if we were to lose the war the Government of some other country would deal more fairly is with them. In my opinion, there can be no question of peace until the Allies have convinced Germany that they can dethe mand it by force of arms. That there are 1,000,000, or even 10,000,000, Ameria cans training in Great Britain should make no difference to our attitude towards the motion before us. If we take the will lead from President Wilson-and those who have doubted the equity arid justice the of the cause of Great Britain and her Allies might well take heed.of the words of that statesman",28

As a neutral, he saw what was being done on both sides. He had opportunities which of the Allies had. After watching the course of events for two years and six months, he said to the people of the world, "" I have been a neutral observer, and, after due deliberation and long consideraretion, I now ask the 100,000,000 who form the American people' to take part in the war on the side of the Allies, not for the aggrandizement of their country, not to increase its territory, but in order that the Democracies of the world may Presicontinue to live in freedom.""",28

A f t e r the sinking of the Lusitania, after the outrages in Belgium, after all the horrors that we have witnessed during the last three years, there are those among us who say that they are not in favour of a peace under which we should take from this damnable country some islands lying to the north of Australia - I would take^ those islands if I could, and whatever other territory might be necessary to preserve the peace and future of this country.",28

He spoke of the triment to recruiting which the Governwar, ment constituted. Just imagine sentiment coming fro m a man who, if am informed correctly, has never enintention couraged recruiting, and has never spoken wholeheartedly in favour of the British Empire. He has never yet shown that he How ex1 is a true-blue Britisher who is prepared to do anything for the British flag. Yet he has the temerity to declare that others have done things which are detrimental to recruiting. These are the utterances of a member of a political party, the supporters of which in every State have passed' resolutions in opposition to recruiting, and who are represented in the journalistic world by newspapers that for nearly two years past, with one or two exceptions, have never given-whole-hearted support to the Allied cause. This man dares to speak of interfering with recruiting, and because something has been done' with which he does not agree, he endeavours to cast doubt upon the wisdom of passing a resolution of this kind. No matter what has been done in England, no matter what treatment-may have been meted out to soldiers' widows and other dependants-and I admit that many fail ures and many mistakes have been madeI am still going to support a resolution which affirms that this Parliament, and the people of Australia, are behind Britain and her Allies in this war.",29
74,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"Capricornia) [4.3] - John clapBright once wrote to Cobden - that he would never again advocate peace It during war, because the people durthe ing war-time - were like a mad dog. I am quite aware that, in speaking as I propose to do this afternoon, I shall meet with a good deal of adverse critinot cism, as well as frivolous and thoughtless interruptions from the honourable memf o r Hume (Mr Falkiner), the honoporable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith), and other honourable members who occupy seats on the cross benches. The Prime Minister desires us to pass a motion affirming that this House records its unbounded admiration of the heroic The efforts of the Allied armies on the Western Front, and its pride in the valour and achievements of the Australian troops. beThere is not a man in this country, and especially amongst the native born of this country, who cannot agree with the second part of this resolution, and there is not a deman who has read anything about the who cannot agree with the first porthat tion - of it . But when the Prime Minister I wishes us to declare that it is the firm of this House to fight on, to secure a victorious peace and the freedom. of the world, I am bound to ask him and every honourable member sitting behind him, what they mean by a victorious peace, and what they mean by the freedom of the world. I think we are entitled to know from honourable members opposite what they mean by a victorious peace, and when they wil l consider that victory has been achieved. The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy have declared that there can be no peace while the mili* tary power of Germany continues. Is that what they mean by a victorious peace? I find it very difficult to get myself into the military state of mind, . which appears to be that if you are winning it is foolish to discuss peace, whilst if you are being attacked and driven back a little it would be cowardly to talk peace. When, in the opinion of any man imbued with the military spirit, ought we tp talk peace? I think that the righ t honourable gentleman, who has proposed this resolution nearly four years after the commencement of the war, ought to give us an idea of when the conflict is likely to end, and especially of when he . considers that victory will have been attained. I find a great difference of opinion between .the pronouncements of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook) and the declarations of the Prime Minister of England (Mr Lloyd George), of Mr Bonar Law, of Mr Balfour, of President Wilson, and of others. There is a very great difference of opinion",29
75,Mr CHANTER,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,There is very little.,30
76,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"We shall see. 8th January, 1918, in Washington, President Wilson made a speech setting forth what, in his opinion, are the war aims of the TJnited States of America. It is a very singular thing-indeed , it is a deplorable thing-that that speech has not been reported in full in any daily newspaper in Australia.",30
77,Mr FENTON,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"Hear , hear! procurable.",30
78,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"It is procurable, but it has not been printed in any daily newspaper in this country, and I say that the people of Australia are being kept in the dark about what is happening in the world. There is in operation in Australia a tyrannous censorship under which the newspapers are instructed not to give certain information to the general public. I am informed, on what I believe to be most excellent authority, that the Germans have such a powerful wireless telegraph instrument that they can send messages throughout the world. These messages are daily being received in Australia, but the Prime Minister declines to allow them to be published for the information of the people. Are we not entitled to know what is the German view of the war? Surely we are. I have read-and I believe the statement to be quite true-that in Berlin one can obtain copies of the London newspapers. But in this country we cannot obtain any German newspapers. Of what have we to be afraid ? - Are we, a comparatively educated people, likely to be stampeded by any panic reports? The more we know, I think, the more we are likely to steel ourselves, if necessary, to greater efforts. What reason is there for suppressing all , the information that the Prime Minister is suppressing at the present time ? I do not believe that the majority of honourable members who sit behind the Government are afraid of publicity. But I consider that the Prime Minister is a political freak who has distorted views. Indeed, his views upon this question border on a state of mental aberration. He is suppressing information which ought to be published, and his action ought not to be tolerated by men who pose as representatives of the people, and who possibly hope that their names will go down to posterity as friends of Australia,, if not as statesmen. I ask honourable members whether they On the have read in any daily newspaper in the Commonwealth the following terms of peace, which are set out m President Wilson's speech in January last: 1. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no private understandings of any kind. 2. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas. 3. The removal, so far as possible, of all It is not economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions. 4. Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments shall be reduced. 5. A free and impartial adjustment of colonial claims. 6. The evacuation of all Kussian territory. 7. The evacuation and restoration of Belgium, f 8. The freeing of all French territory, and the restoration of Alsace-Lorraine to France. 9. Re-adjustment of the frontiers of Italy. 10. The peoples of Austria-Hungary to be afforded an opportunity to establish autonomous Government. 11. Boumania, Servia, and Montenegro to be evacuated. 12. The Turkish portions of the Ottoman Empire to be assured a secure sovereignty. 13. An independent Polish State. 14. A general association of nations to assure permanent peace. Now, i u the speech referred to it appears to me that there is a considerable inconsistency, because all previous utterances of President Wilson have contained the statement there were to be no annexations and no indemnities - In making that speechand I ask honourable members who have been going through this country talking about crushing Germany and bringing her to her knees to take note of it-Presiden t Wilson saidWe have no jealousy of German greatness. We grudge her no distinction of learning or of pacific enterprises such as have made her record very bright and very enviable. We do not wish to injure her or to bloqk in any way her legitimate influence or power. We do not wish to light her, either with arms or with hostile arrangements of trade. Now, if those words mean anything, they mean that the great TJnited States of America is not going to penalize Germany in any way in regard to her commerce after the war. What does the Prime Minister say about this matter ? Speaking in London on 9th March, 1916, he saidWe' in Australia have done something to show our earnestness in tearing out tlte cancer of German influence. We have annulled every contract; we' have cancelled every trade mark and design belonging to Germany. We have given notice to every company that they must within three months from January 16, put out every German shareholder, whether naturalized or not.",30
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"Americ a already done that. . Mr HIGGS - We shall come, later, to parliamentary institutions. . . . what America has done. The Prime M in ister said, further, while in London i 1916, that we should declare .without delay the trade policy of Britain after warI f our Allies follow our lead, as I believe would, German credit and German confidence in ultimate victory would topple like a house of cards. For once the financiers, manufacdislike turers, and the people of Germany, realise the markets of the British Empire and France and Bussia and Italy and Belgium are permaought to possess."" nently closed against them, the bubble of their ceeded, hopes will be burst and confusion and dismay will spread through the land, dissensions honeycomb their political structure, and the spectre of revolution rear its sinister head. Let us, then, do this obvious, sensible and necessary thing without ""further delay. Does he mean that this victorious peace for which we hope is going to take the form he has outlined here? 'We ought certainly to know whether the. Prime Minister desires that we shall continue to send our brave sons to the Pront to fight for his views of what "" v i c to r y "" shall mean. I have a number of other statements by the Prime Minister which I that shall not read. It is sufficient for me to say that they all have for their main text the idea that there can be no peace until Germany is utterly crushed; there can be no peace until Germany is brought to her knees. If that is what we are sending our sons to the Front to do, then we have to consider whether it can be done, and the sooner we consider that point the better. The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has said, "" We shall go on u n t i l the military power of Germany is crushed."" President Wilson does not say that.",31
80,Sir ROBERT BEST,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,He has said that the Allies should go on until Prussian militarism is crushed.,31
81,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"Speakin g at Washington on 8th January last, President Wilson said of GermanyNeither do we presume to suggest, to her any alterations or modification of her institutions. The great German military machine is part of her institutions. Then, again, Mr A . J. Balfour does not agree with the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy, in their boastful, arrogant utterances. Speaking in the House of Commons last July, he saidhas We all hope that the autocracy in Germany will give place to free government, and to parliamentary institutions as we understand That does not mean that anybody is fool enough to n suppose that anybody can impose upon Germany a Constitution made outside' Germany. Germany must work out her own salvation. the You do not mend matters by imposing constitutions, even if you had the power to imthey pose them, even if some great military catastrophe were to put the Allied Powers in a position to say to them- "" You may like it or it, but you shall adopt a Constitution that which suits our views of freedom, our views of the Government which. a civilized State That has never sucand it will never succeed. Nations must work out their own scheme of liberty for themselves according to their own ideals and bused upon their own historywhat has actually occurred to them in the past and what their hopes suggest to them for the future.",31
82,Mr MAXWELL,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"What does the honourable member suggest America is out against in this, war ?",32
83,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"I hope the honourable member will not expect me to interrupt my argument in order to reply to his question at this stage. We are requested to say that we want "" a victorious peace,"" and that we ask for the , l world -"" Where are we to get our victorious peace? Have honourable members recently examined the map? I in vite them to consider the TJnited States of America-that great nation for which I have the highest admiration, and to whom members are looking for an early victory.",32
84,Mr BRENNAN,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,The honourable member does not agree with the Treasurer's (Mr W at t ' s ) ' strictures on America.,32
85,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"No , nor do I agree with his strictures on President Wilson, whom he once described as "" a n anaemic philosopher."" Lord Derby said in May lastThe war will not end until the TJnited States' full lighting force is thrown into the scale, ancl until the United States makes war as if she alone were facing Germany. It would - then be possible to predict the end. We are looking to America. President Wilson, and all the English, Irish, Scotch, and Welsh people in America, together with their dependants, will do everything within their power to help the Allies. But there are very many difficulties in the way of the TJnited States of America, and it is well that those who urge that we should pursue this war to the end, refusing to discuss peace terms or to negotiate until Germany is brought fco her knees, should consider fchose difficulties. I propose to point to some of them.",32
86,Mr JOWETT,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,Does the honourable member infer that we do not consider them?,32
87,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,Honourable members cannot have considered them if they think the question of peace should not be discussed until Germany has been brought fco her knees.,32
88,Mr JOWETT,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,All that we ask a victorious peace for the Allies.,32
89,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"What is a "" victorious peace "" ? Do honourable members agree with the Prime Minister, who says it meansfchafcGermany shall be brought to her knees, and that her military despotism shall be swept away Boastful Lloyd George a few days ago addressed fco the TJnited States of America a message which, in my opinion, he should have refrained from sending. It was a cowardly message, for so boastful a "" j in g o "" as Lloyd George has heen, to send to the American people. Let us consider for a moment the position of that great Ally of ours. Is the honourable member for freedom of the Grampians (Mr Jowett) aware that in 1910 the foreign white stock in the U n it e d ' States of America, excluding the English, totalled 22,000,000, or, including English residents of the States, 32,000,000? At that date there were 2,501,181 nativeborn Germans resident in the United States of America, 1,174,924 Austrians, 495,600Hungarians, 32,221 European Turks, and 59,702 Asiatic Turks,, or a total of 4,263,628.",32
90,Mr JOWETT,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"Ouf c of a population of 100,000,000.",32
91,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"They and their descendants make up a considerable portion of the total of 22,000,000. I would invite attention towhat is going on in the United States of America-to 'facts which - a section of our press studiously refrain from publishing, either because they are denied the right to do so by the censors who are acting under the instructions of the Prime Minister, or because they deliberately seek to blind the people of Australia to what is going on in America. I shall quote, first of all, remark's made by Mr Harrison H . Wheaton, Chief of the Division of Immigration Education of the United States Bureau of Education. Addressing a gathering of some 200 manufacturers in the State House of Massachusetts, he saidThe enemy has used every insidious means possible to hamper the United States' war preparations, and Germany is spending more money in one month in New York. City alone for this work than the United States is spending in one year for its Bureau of Investigation and Secret Service combined. The enemy money is being spent in setting fires, committing sabotage on industrial machines, and in many other plots. In the Melbourne daily newspapers of is for 28th ultimo there appeared a cablegram to the effect thatSenator Henry Cabot Lodge, one of the foremost statesmen in the United States, caused a sensation in the Senate on Tuesday by asserting that the United States troops at the Front in France were not supplied with a single aeroplane or gun. He added that only two American-built ships had yet been completed. America declared war on Germany on 6th A p r i l , 1917, and after the lapse of practically twelve months Senator Lodge declared that the United States' troops at the Front had not yet been supplied with an aeroplane or a gun. He went on to sayOur brave Allies are holding the Germans with sacrifices beyond eulogy. Six months were wasted trying to improve the French 75 gunsix golden months wasted. These French "" 75 "" guns, as we have read in the newspapers, are terribly destructive. On the 3rd inst. an officer, writing from the French Head-Quarters, said-""Our ' 75's' are now in action, wreaking tremendous execution."" What explanation can there be for this wasting of "" s i x golden months,"" as Senator Lodge said, on an effort to improve these guns, unless it be that there are in the United States of America a number of enemy aliens who are friendly to the German cause? They are employed, . no doubt, in munition factories and on the various military staffs. I dare say' that, in every ten men in the United States, one would find one German, or one German sympathiser. Senator Overman, speaking recently in the United States Senate, in reply to continuous recent attacks on the Government for its delay in supplying General Pershing's forces in. France with flying machines, said-""There 400,000 German spies in this country, and some of them are at work on our aeroplane plants."" He went on to exhibit a piece of steel, which, he said, had heen sawed through and plugged with lead by a spy who had painted it so that the presence of the lead would not be detected. He said the presence of this spy in the Curtiss plant had delayed the construction of battle planes for two months, and that the man had not been caught. He added, "" It has been said that there are 100,000 German spies in this country, but I believe there are 400,000 of them.""",32
92,Mr BOYD,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,But that might be the kin d of sensational statement that we get in the Senate and in this House here occasionally.,33
93,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"It may be, but let said that Senator Lee Slater Overman is a barrister by profession, and had sufficient influencewhen in the House of Representatives to be elected as Speaker. Senator Lodge is, as I have already pointed out, one of the foremost statesmen in America. The Government are asking the House to pass a motion the effect of which can only be a prolongation of the war, and I ask honourable members who are talking now about a victorious peace whether they read these words of Mr Holman when he returned from France, as reported in the Argus of 10th November lastHe had passed through France within a few weeks of a great defeat which fell upon the French as the result of what was probably a too precipitate advance after a retreat of the Germans. It was a defeat which cost the French 70,000 men, taking the killed, wounded, and prisoners. He learned' that at that time there had been a definite possibility of the French Government concluding that it must make a separate peace. For some months prior to his arrival in England the French Government had been in the balance as to whether it would not'have to inform the Allies that it eould not any longer carry on the struggle, but stronger counsels prevailed, and the French Government resolved not to think of any surrender. That resolve was justified by later results. He was also informed that England was staggering under the shock of the success attendant upon the new submarine campaign. He found the Government confronted, not with the problem how to win the war, but of how at that time England was to be kept in the war at all for another eight months.",33
94,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,He would say anything ,33
95,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"Thos e statements of his are have not yet - been contradicted by the Prime Minister or any one else. The Government are talking in this way about a victorious peace, but are not doing anything at all to try to end the war. What does the Minister for the Navy say? What has Lloyd George to say? Let us take this boastful, arrogant Lloyd George of England, who has done more to prolong the war than, I suppose, any other man. Recently, in the City Temple, London, he said, "" Do n ' t be depressed; don't be discouraged; don't always point to the clouds and ask ' When is the dawn coming?' It always is coming; believe and trust in the Lord, and the light will shine."" That is the same Lloyd George who predicted that .the war would be won in it be 1915, and who said, when the war was not won in 1915, "" W a it t ill the spring offensive of 1916."" When the spring offensive ""was not successful in 1916 he said, "" ""Wait t ill the spring offensive in 1917,"" and, in his own speech, made the other day, he said that in 1917 we were overwhelmingly superior in numbers on the Western Front. Yet the. Hindenburg line was not broken, and now he says to the people, after all this boasting, "" Believe and trust in the Lord, and the light will shine."" When the Kaiser said that God was on his side he was called a blasphemer. In my opinion, the Germans cannot beat the Allies, but from what I can read they are hoping not so much to beat the Allies as to compel them to talk peace. We might as well discuss this matter calmly - We in this chamber do not suffer. Like my honourable friends opposite, we have drunk the wine of life, and we ought to think of that when we are sending away young fellows of sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen, because that is the age at which they are going to the war now. Beautiful boys, many of them well educated boys, with brains, intelligence, and courage, we are sending to the Front to fight, while we refuse to recognise the facts. We refuse to discuss peace with Germany. Germany asked us to discuss peace in 1915. The offer was refused. In 1916 the, Germans renewed their .offer, and we spurned it . Their Chancellor then saidIf our enemies are obdurate, and choose to continue a hopeless endeavour, we shall only continue to make them pay a bitter price for their folly. The German soul is resolute and undaunted. Against our firm, far-reaching lines the billows of attack will break in There is nothing to affright us in any quarter. To-morrow we will embark upon an enterprise of defence of staggering magnitude. There has never been a mobilization of national energy on so great a scale. An Act for mobilization for non-military service will be duced in the Reichstag tomorrow (Wednesday). Germany is absolutely determined to carry the war through, and is thus summoning the whole power of a united people. Yet, while the will of the people grows more determined to carry the struggle to any length that may be necessary for the vindication of our national integrity and destiny it has ever been, and is now; our desire to resume amicable exertions for peace as soon as we are allowed to do so. It will probably be found, when the history of this war is written, that the Germans had, before this great offensive, which they commenced on Thursday, 21st March, asked the Allies, "" Will you discuss peace with ,us bef ore we conduct this offensive?""",33
96,Mr BOYD,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"That statement is in the paper today, by the Austrian Chancellor.",34
97,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"I thank the honourable member. Although we have been boasting in this arrogant fashion, it took us two years to take from the Germans the territory, which they have won back within a fortnight.",34
98,Mr RILEY,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,W it h in a week.,34
99,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"I could safely say within a week, and with our. numbers overwhelmingly superior on the Western Front in 1917, according to Mr Lloyd George, we could not break through the Hindenburg line. That does not prove that Germany is going to beat the Allies, but it does prove that in modern warfare the man who is acting on the defensive, especially with the military machine the Germans have got, has a tremendous advantage, and it is a very costly thing for the people who have to undertake the offensive. Members talk, but they will not look at the map. Germany is repeatedly asking us to negotiate for peace. We refuse - We seem to be blind. Why do we not look at the map?",34
100,Mr JOWETT,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"We do look at the map, and that is why we refuse.",34
101,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"When we look at the map we see Russia, a country whose area is not less than one-seventh of the-whole of the land surface of the globe, with 8,647,657 English square miles of territory, and a population in 1907 of 152,000,000, now at peace with Germany. How did we treat Russia? Where were vain.' our diplomats ? What is the use of talking about the money Germany is spending ? I presume we have money to spend; and where were our diplomats ? Is it not a fact that Lord Milner was in Russia a introfew day's before the revolution, and came back and told the House of Commons that everything was all right? Yet within a few days the revolution occurred. What was our attitude towards the Russian revolution ? The Russian people by that revolution succeeded in overturning a regime which was nearly as tyrannous as that which prevailed in France prior to the f all of the Bastille. There was in Russia a horrible condition of things, men being put in prison, and kept there without t r i a l, but it was nut an end to by the revolution. I cannot at this stage go into the indignities, cruelties, and suffered by educated and uneducated sian people who tried to fight for liberty in their country, but any one who Tolstoi's works can learn of the sufferings of the masses of the people of Russia.",34
102,Mr JOWETT,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,How did the Bolsheviks treat the educated people in Russia?,35
103,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"No doubt the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has been a very successful business man. * has amassed a lot of this world's > and shown himself the possessor of a great deal of brains. He has a deavouring great capacity for making money, in that respect any one who possesses very little of this world's goods must him, as he is admired by his friends i the commercial world. No doubt he jects to the action of the Bolsheviks repudiating the Russian national debt.",35
104,Mr JOWETT,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,I did not say anything about that. I objected to them butcheralliance. ing people of their own race.,35
105,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"I believe the Bolsheviks were wrong when they declared that they would not pay back the money lent to Russia, and I quite agree with Mr Bonar Law, who, when the question was raised in the House of Commons recently, said he did not believe that when Russia got back into a settled for m of government there would 'be any repudiation of loans. But what did we do with Russia ? Did we try to show the people of Russia, who wanted peace, that we were in favour of peace? Did we try to show them that we were truly in earnest in supporting President Wilson's announcement of no annexations and no indemnities? No. It is true that when Mr Ramsay MCDonald and Mr Jowett, of the I m perial Parliament, desired to go to Russia to satisfy the Russian people that the British nation had no Imperialistic - aims, the British Government thought it wise to give them passports, but at the same time they allowed a branch of the Seamen's Union to practically kidnap those men. They were not allowed to proceed on tlunr mission, and' the boastful, Jingoistic Lloyd George Government remained passive. When the matter was brought under the notice of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, he said, "" I do not know whether it is true, but this action by the Seamen's Union is something to be thankful for . "" And he is said to be a statesman! barbarities However, we have failed to be friends Ruswith Russia', as we ought to have been. Our diplomats have proved themreads selves as incompetent as our rulers. There is talk of bringing Germany to her knees; but not only has Russia pulled out of the war, but Roumania, too, has made peace with Germany, and has given her a <monopoly for ninety^nine years of petroleum wells that are said to be worth He £50,000,000. I point out these facts as goods, reasons why we should be prepared to accept peace by negotiation instead Of ento force a peace in which Gerand many is to be beaten to her knees, the flag of liberty is to be planted in Berlin, admire and the Hohenzollerns are to be den throned. All this talk is a lot of bombast obwhich cannot be realized, and neither in Mr Balfour nor President Wilson would endeavour to realise it . We are told now that Persia is about to join the Germanic A cable appearing in the newspapers gives another instance of the incapacity of British statesmen- ' The correspondent of the Times at Tientsin states that Hayashi, the Japanese Ambassador in China, has returned to Pekin from Tokio. It is understood that he is fully authorized to negotiate for China's - co-operation with Japan in an advance into Siberia, to which the Allies have consented. I do not know whether the Allies have consented to Japan intervening in Siberia; but I would warn honourable, members who may be favourable to that course that there may be a danger of Russia throwing in her lot with Germany and ""forming a defensive and offensive alliance. It is a mistake for us to ignore the teachings of history. Seemingly, most impossible alliances are formed between nations, as between individuals. A yeaT or two ago nobody would have contemplated that the Prime Minister, who was denouncing the pastoralists, the shipowners, the lawyers, and the combines, would be found sitting cheek-by-jowl with the honourable member for Grampians, a multi-millionaire. B ritain and America were enemies 100 years ago, and B r it a in employed Germans to fight the Americans. At the time of the Boer war, the Union Jack was turned to the wall in Washington; today the American people are fighting on the side of the British . Sixty years ago we fought for the Turks against Russia; a year ago we were fighting with Russia against the Turks. Russia and Japan only a few years ago were at hostile grips, yet prior to the withdrawal of Russia from the war, the two nations were fighting on the same side. In 1914 It a l y and Germany were A l lies; today they are enemies. If we are to continue this war for ever, as some honourable members appear willing to do, we must be careful of the possibilities in regard to future international alliances. Some honourable members seem to be quite content to prolong' the war so long as our young boys can be put into the battle line as they reach military age. Boys who were fourteen years of age when the war started are now enlisting to do a man's joSb on the Western Front. I come now to a statement by President Wilson which. I think is helping to prolong the war. President Wilson has said thab he favours the restoration of AlsaceLorraine to France. In the Franco- Prussian war of 1870, Germany was not the aggressor, but was compelled to fight.",35
106,Mr FOWLER,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,No . Bismarck dragged France into the war. It is beyond question that Prussia manoeuvred to bring about the war.,36
107,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"That may be the honourable member's view. On the 4th July, 1870, the provisional Government in Spain elected Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, a relative of K in g William of Prussia, to fill the vacant Spanish throne. This gave offence to the French Government, and although, by the advice of the K i ng of Prussia, Prince Leopold withdrew his candidature, the French Government was not satisfied, but demanded an assurance from Germany that at no future period would Leopold's claims be sanctioned. This assurance the K in g of Prussia refused to give, and on the 19th July, 1870, the Emperor of the French declared war against Prussia. Thus on such a flimsy pretext commenced the dreadful war which cost so many lives and the payment of an indemnity by France df £200,000,000, and.the cession of AlsaceLorraine to Germany. As I have a great admiration for the American people, so I have also the highest respect and admiration, and even love, for the people. But, after all , what is AlsaceLorraine 3 Those provinces comprise an area of only 5,604 square miles, about the size of a big cattle station in Queensland. From the tenth century Alsace-Lorraine formed part of the German Empire, till portion cf it was ceded to France at the peace of Westphalia, in 1648; the remainder fell a prey to the aggressions of the French King, Louis XIV., who seized Strassburg in 1681 by surprise in time of peace. By the peace of Ryswick, in 1697, the cession of the whole was ratified. Thus, as the Garmans used to complain, was this fine land, with one of the noblest branches of the race, alienated from the German people, and the command of the German Rhine was disgracefully surrendered to the enemy in time of misfortune. But German never ceased to be the chief language of the people, and during the whole period of the French possession all newspapers were printed in both languages. In 1814-15 Russia would not hear of the restitution of AlsaceLorraine to Germany, and it was not till 1871, after the Franco-German war, that Alsace and German Lorraine were, by the treaty of Frankfort, incorporated in the new German Empire. These are the facts as given in Chambers' Encyclopaedia. In 1905, of a total population of 1,814,654, only 200,200 were of French origin, and 1,571,1U0 were of German origin. These figures are taken from the World's Almanac and Encyclopaedia of America. For every one person of French origin in Alsace-Lorraine there were seven persons of German origin. When one reads the history of those provinces, he can understand the basis of the claim made by the German Imperial Chancellor, Baron von Hertling,. that, "" There is no Alsace-Lorraine question in the international sense. If it exists, it is purely a German question."" I regret that my time will not permit me to go into this matter as full y as I should like to do. But how deep are we to dig into the past in order that we may settle old grievances? In 1704 Great Britain took Gibraltar from the Spaniards. Is it proposed that we should return Gibraltar to its former owners ? In 1796 Britain displaced the Dutch in Ceylon. Cape Colony, South Africa, was originally founded by the Dutch about French the year 1652, and they occupied the place for over 150 years before it was taken from tbem by the British. intend to dig into even modern history trouble the war will never end. As I said, I admire and respect the Erench people, but I ask them in deepest earnestsquare ness whether it is worthwhile to sacrifice valuable lives in fighting over territory which there are seven German residents every one of Prench origin 1 W it h regard to the captured German miles. colonies in the Pacific, I have here a cirGuinea cular issued by the Queensland Recruiting Committee, which saysAustralia has taken from the Germans expenses. Rabaul, her Papuan possessions, and her % Pacific Island stations. The mere suggestion that Britain might hand them back without pounds a year. Australia's consent, for Germany to re-establish her military system and her Naval bases in Australian waters, has already raised violent protest from Labour and Nationalist alike. In short, Australia does not want Germany again on the steps of her back door. If that be our attitude towards the German colonies, what becomes of the statement made by Mr Lloyd George on the 15th March that the war must be mainhave tained as a holy war? A holy war something acceptable to God, even comlarger manded by God, something pure. annexation of German colonies seems me to be quite inconsistent with our tains claim that we are waging a holy war. I say quite frankly, and with complete indifference concerning any abuse or adverse criticism by the press,, that ought now to affirm that we are willing to return captured colonies to Germany the moment peace is declared. Mr JOWETT:-We are not.",36

113,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"Of course, Germany, how which is holding Belgium, will occupy be in war. that territory until driven out, or peace is declared. Germany has stated that she will give up Belgium.

In the face of this we say we want German New Guinea, in order that we may we settle and colonize the island. In m y opinion, every pound spent in trying to settle the New Hebrides, or New Guinea, or any other of those islands, should be devoted to the improvement and develop? ment of this Commonwealth, and in order that we may ultimately secure a population sufficiently large to make it impossible for any nation at any time to attack us successfully. .",37
118,Mr BOYD,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,Is it not just as well not to give an enemy a base as a jumping-off,37
119,Mr JH CATTS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,We might get some,37
120,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"It is quite true that we might get some other nation which we might not appreciate quite so much. is We must take into - consideration the position of an enemy, no matter f r i g h t f u l and terrible he may Germany has an area of only 208,780 square miles, and, with Austria-Hungary, is in possession of a territory not so large as Queensland. In my judgment, therefore, it would shorten the war if , instead of allowing busybodies in London or elsewhere to say that Australian public opinion demands the retention of captured German Pacific colonies, we said that we are willin g to return them as soon as peace is declared.",37
121,Mr BKENNAN,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,We cannot blame people in London for so representing Australian public opinion when we have people doing it here.,38
122,Mr HIGGS,RECONSTRUCTIO N OP,"There is another i m portant matter to which I desire to refer. We have declared that we are not in this war in support of an Imperialistic policy; that we wanted no annexations and no indemnities. President Wilson recently made this declaration, but against this statement. I have a copy of an English paper containing these headingsEGYPT IS OTJP.S NOW. NA AND £100,000 A YEAK. More Red on the Map. Egypt is ours. The suzerainty of Turkey, tolerated for many years, is at an end now that he has been fooled into making war on us; and henceforth the land of the Pharaohs is a British Protectorate.

British Garrison (peace time), 6,067; chief products-cottons , sugar, rice, cereals. Those figures do not include Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, already for all pracv drawn. tical purposes, a British possession. Mr Lloyd George has said that this conflict "" must be maintained as a holy war."" Is it to be maintained in order we may keep Egypt, and "" put more red on the map,"" as the English paper rebe ferred to states? Mr A . J . Balfour is the wordsreported to have saidWe certainly did not go into the war for what is called an Imperialistic policy.

Honourable members opposite, through their mouthpiece, the then Leader of the Government, the Right Honourable Andrew Fisher, pledged themselves and this country to prosecute this war up to the last man and the last shilling.

137,Mr RODGERS,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I am confident there was nothing like that in his mind at the time. I propose, now, to read a copy of a resolution passed by an outside body, the terms of which may have been responsible for the attitude taken up by honourable members opposite today. The following motion was passed at the annual conference of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labour party, which was concluded in Melbourne Trades H all this week - It is contained in today's issue of the Melbourne Argus, and was the outcome of a discussion of the probability of securing peace with Germany -:That this Conference enthusiastically reaffirms its resolution of 1917 upon peace^and war, approves of what has already been done in the work of propagating those ideas, and instructs the incoming executive to continue to extend that work and secure the discussion of peace in the Federal Parliament. In particular, this Conference records its contempt for the audacious lie that the Australian people insist upon retaining the German possessions in the Pacific, and has nothing but utter abhorrence for the commercial class and its press, which would prolong the world's torture that new markets may be won for Australian traders. Further, that this Conference recommends the Federal Conference to make it a plank of the Federal platform that Australia shall engage in no more oversea wars. The cut-the-painter resolution. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) by incessant applause says, "" Hear, hear,"" to the suggestion for the return to Germany of the possessions taken from her by us, but in his speech today he was absolutely silent in regard to the possessions of the Allies which are now under the heels of the Germans. We have reached a stage in this, war in which democracy meets autocracy in the final death-grip struggle. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) would seek to make out. that we are now at a stage when we are commencing to lay down reasons tor entering the war. As a matter of fact, we are at the final death grip. Autocracy and democracy Some, are like two men locked together, where the one or the other can give the knockout blow, and the honourable member for Capricornia would plead with autocracy to relieve democracy from the fate that is impending. If we followed the advice of the honourable member it would be an absolute surrender on the part of democracy, an utter surrender of the principles of democracy, under which he has pretended to govern this country of ours, an utter surrender of the principles of democracy to autocracy. One who in times of peace has helped to build up an ideal system of democracy would yield completely to those forces against which he and his party have pretended to be always arranged. I regret that a new stage has been reached so tar as the Australian Labour party is concerned.",39
138,Mr BLAKELEY,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,They are quite able to look after themselves.,39
139,Mr RODGERS,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"But they are not free from criticism in connection with a war of this description. Surely we have nom reached a stage in Australia when we, by a resolution of the National Parliament, are to give a direction to the recently created Allied Council as to how it should conduct the war and finish it . In the hands of that Allied Council lies the fate, not only of the British Empire, but also of all the Allies, and to hear the honourable member, in a long and carefully prepared speech, indicating to that body how it should conduct and finish the war is like hearing a child talking to its grandfather. In view of the information that has recently come to us about the massing of the whole of the resources of the Allies, their man-power, and their armaments of every description, to participate in a life and death struggle, and in view of the terrible suffering that has been endured, it is treason to the men who have fought and died for Australia that this country should be asked to be the first to pass a resolution in the form proposed by honourable members opposite. deeply sorry that this debate should have taken place at all. We on this side and honourable members opposite have invited men to go to the Front. For what did we ask them to go? It was to fight for freedom, justice, and victory; and now that they have fought right up to victory's door, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) says, "" For God's sake give us peace, even though it be on the terms Germany dictates while she is on top of us.""",39

141,Mr CONSIDINE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"He said that he was the delegate of the Labour party, which has pronounced in no uncertain way its attitude, not only in regard to this war, but also in regard to all wars. Those honourable members opposite who have spoken today seem to imagine that it is some new development that Labour should be opposed to war. In every instance Labour has to bear the brunt of war. It is Labour that has to fight the war, and has to pay for it , and it is 'Labour that is exploited during the progress of war. Therefore, it is no wonder that Labour has always been opposed to war, and in so far as it has expressed itself today it says that it is time this slaughter stopped, and an end was ,put to the misery that has beeu brought about by a war commenced without the consent of the Democracy of any country engaged in it . No country engaged in the war has entered this struggle with the consent of its people. The people have never been given the opportunity of expressing their views. It is the desire of all Governments, except the Russian, to prevent the expression of the people's views in regard to the war.",40
142,Mr ARCHIBALD,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,The German Socialists voted for the war.,40
143,Mr CONSIDINE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"No , they did not; but the Germans who called themselves Socialists did, just as Labourites who "" r at t e d "" and still call themselves Labourites, did so. I am Mr JOWETT - What side are they on?",40

153,Mr JOWETT,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,No . I merely said that I did not call myself a patriot; that I did not set up any claim to be regarded as a patriot.,40
154,Mr CONSIDINE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Returnin g to the attitude of the Labour party in regard to the war and towards the motion which has been submitted to us today, I claim that if they are true to the Labour movement the representatives of Labour musfc ask for the ending of this slaughter, and must support any motion that has for its object, not a German peace, not a'British peace",40
155,Mr ARCHIBALD,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,But a Russian peace.,41
156,Mr CONSIDINE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Not even a Russian peace; but a peace that is acceptable to all the Democracies engaged in the present struggle. The Labour party in Australia has expressed itself very definitely in regard to this war, and all other wars. In this House I have already quoted the speech delivered by the Prime Minister at the Pilgrims' Club in London, where he said we were fighting for the commercial supremacy of the world. What on earth has the commercial supremacy of the world to do with the working class in Australia, England, or Germany? Their interests are in the abolition of war and not in fighting for one group or other of competing capitalists for the supremacy of the world. Consequently, I claim that I am in harmony with Labour pronouncements, and with the feeling of the Labour movement in Australia today and elsewhere, when I say that every move that can be made with a view to shortening this struggle and saving human life, and at the same time preventing the misery that is incidental to a continuance of the ""strife, will be welcomed by the working classes of this or any other country.",41

We are told, in the words' of President Wilson, that the suspected intentions of the A l lied Powers in the matter of tlieir wishing to block Germany's development after the war have been responsible for perpetuating the desire on the part of the German people themselves to continue to Talk about children!

171,Mr CONSIDINE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,I can quite understand the objection to Russia today under the Bolsheviks. It is the same objection as is held by the Russian people who' occupy a similar position in that country to what the honourable member does here. We have heard in the Good Hook about the rich man who went away sorrowful. There are a number of those in Russia today.,42

173,Mr CONSIDINE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"No, they have been put to better use. The Bolsheviks have put them to useful work. If you read your own British war correspondence as cabled to Australia, you will learn that the Russian Government found useful occupations for those whose only occupations hitherto had been exploiting the Russian masses. What do the Allies care for the Russian revolution being crushed by Germany? The Russian revolution has no friends on the Allies' side any more than on the Kaiser's side, because the Russian people are wiping out just the type of interests that are held in common by the Central Powers and the Allied Powers today.",42

177,Mr CONSIDINE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I do not think so. I go so far as to say that if to the German people followed the Russian revolutionaries' example and overturned the Kaiser and his satellites and estabunder lished a social democratic revolution Germany, the Allied Powers would be found on the side of Kaiser Bill, or some [132] other Royal aristocrat, ready to impose him on the German people with British bayonets. Look back on the Paris Commune, when French and German aristocrats joined together in crushing out the Commune.",42

179,Mr CONSIDINE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"How many did Thiers and his crowd murder? Thirty thousand men, women and children, shot down in cold blood. There is nothing about them; nothing about the murders which the Czar perpetrated; nothing about the outrages on innocent women and children - some of them in Australia today-wh o were exiled to Siberia merely for singing The Marseillaise. We have people telling us about the atrocities committed in Russia, and those-lyin g curs I was going to call them-wh o malign the Russian revolutionaries today are akin to the people who, when the Commune was in existence, said everything that was vile about those revolutionaries, but who, when the Revolution was crushed, remarked with their tongues in their cheeks that Paris had never been better governed. There is nothing about the atrocities then. They came after. The same kind of peopJe are interested in continuing this war, in exploiting the Australian people, in making huge profits. Whom did the Prime Minister refer to after he came back from the Referendum? He said he could understand the Sinn Feiners: he did not agree with them, but they had an ideal. He could understand the Industrial Workers of the World man who was true to his principles. But-h e added-h e would never forget, nor forgive, those men who were making vast profits out of the war.

Are they not of the type of man who said he would far rather live Prussian militarism than under in trades unionism in Australia? I refer to Mr Brookes; and there were no prosecutions for disloyalty in his case. Those men who prefer .that are the same kind of people who would he prepared to murder, not the property-owners, hut the propertyless people of Australia and elsewhere who try to make an end of their profits. As to this much-maligned people of Russia, the only hope of progress for them is the success of the Russian Revolution. I trust that that revolution will not be confined to Russia, but will spread through Austria, Italy, France, and to every European country until we shall have an end of all exploiters, Royal and otherwise.  a supporter of the resolution,, and I in the first place, to make some reference to the remarks of the honourable member for Batman. This honourable member has been good enough to say that he is in this chamber as a delegate of the workers. It were wise for us to consider the remarks made by the actual workers of this community as distinct from the organizers of so-called Labour unionism - There is not the slightest doubt that these organizers are men actuated by disloyal principles, while the great mass, of the working community in this country is thoroughly loyal. Its loyalty has been demonstrated by the large number of sons whom these people have < permitted to go to the Front; and the honourable member casts a slur upon the working people when he says-wit h those disloyal sentiments which he is known to hold-that he is here as their representative. Upon one noted occasion in this chamber, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) was good enough to assert his loyalty in this way, namely, that if he were on GalRpoli, and had a rifle placed in his hands, and a Turk was in sight, he would not pull the trigger.",42
181,Mr BRENNAN,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"You r history is a bit out, but the facts are fairly good.  ments of the honourable member, and he has never varied in his opposition to Great Britain from that time to the present. He has demonstrated today that, as long as he can do anything to weaken the British Empire, he is fulfilling what, he conceives to be his mission. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) was good enough to slander the Sovereign of this Empire. He said that the King had made a statement that this war was bound to result in a draw. When asked pointedly for. his authority, what was his reply ? It was, "" I decline to say."" In other words, in a scandalous manner, the honourable member, who has sworn allegiance to the King and the Constitution, comes here and slanders His Majesty. The honourable member for Capricornia says that the Labour party is against all wars.",43
182,Mr CONSIDINE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Are you not against all wars?  wars; I stand on all fours with the honourable member in that respect. But if an honourable member comes over here and wish, attacks me I shall hit him back; I am not going to allow any one to crunch me without doing my level best to give him as good as he sends. The whole of the argument of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) is fallacious, because he is on unsound premises. He forgets that Britain had no choice about entering into this war; she had either to fight or go down. Of course, the honourable member, with his well-known principles, ' does not care twopence for the Empire; but I venture to think that this assembly represents the loyal sentiments of the people. The great mass of the people are truly loyal to the Constitution, and they recognise that we have no more to expect from Germany than Russia has received. Russia - is suffering grievously today because her rulers for the. time being accepted Germany at Germany's own valuation. The Russian people were induced to .believe that they could secure their safety by making a temporary peace with Germany, and the result of the false move is, as everyone knows, that disaster after disaster will overtake them. We in the Commonwealth of Australia are per-; fectly assured that if we make an immature peace with Germany it will simply mean for us the worse of possible conditions, all of which will gofcodepress the workers of the world more than could any other event. The only way we can secure the best interests of the peoples of the world, and the only way that makes for peace, is by subjugating effectively this arrogant power which seeks to dominate humanity by its methods. I commend this idea to the honourable member, who thinks he is representing the best interests of the workers, but who is really advocating conditions that can only result in placing on the in a financial burden to retard their progress for many years. There is another point worth bearing in mind. If any section in the community will suffer by reason of Germany's success, or by reason of a patched-up peace, it is the organized labour unions.",43

There is no question that Germany has designs on Australia, because there is no portion of the world the control of which would suit them better. One of their first acts would be to establish their government here on military lines, and then down would come the union organizations. All the advantages that have been gained in consequence of unionism, and unionists' principles, would disappear with the German occupation of Australia. We cannot give the Government too much backing in their expressions of loyalty and faith in our soldiers. The men who are fighting for us require fco be encouraged by the knowledge that they have behind them a loyal people, and the motion proposed by the Prime Minister would give them that assurance.",44

The honourable member for Capricornia gave us a very long oration based mainly on whafc different men have said in different parts of the world. It would be a remarkable thing if we found complete unanimity, and still more remarkable if ' President Wilson, when he occupied the position of a neutral, viewed .things in precisely the same light as he does now that he is a combatant. The honourable member .for. Capricornia (Mr Higgs) was guilty of quoting President Wilson as taking a certain line of policy at one time and a distinctly different line at another time. He told us that President Wilson was afc one time against any territorial acquisition, but that later his speeches showed him to be in favour of the restitution of Alsace and Lorraine. All the specious reasoning in which the honourable member indulged was intended for the one ma- purpose of showing to the Labour organizers-those , and not the workers, who are afc present dominating the situation-that they could depend on him to support the ideals that they had in view ",44

Honourable members opposite think that fchey can do everything by waving a flag; but, make no mistake about it , every time they wave the Union Jack, which stands for liberty, they pollute it .

If honourable members opposite and those behind them were fools, I would forgive them; but they are not fools-the y are very brainy men who have fooled the general community for a long time past.",45
196,Mr FENTON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,They did not fool it on 20th December last.,45
197,Mr MATHEWS,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"No , but, unfortunately, they did so on the 5th May last. If the passing of the motion meant the sending to our men at the Front a' message of sympathy with them from the members of this House, and of admiration for the bravery with which they and their comrades have fought, and suffered, and died, I would support it. But behind the motion are those who have used the war to amass millions of money, who have profiteered ever since the war commenced, and have piled up big bank accounts. They are putting their war profits into the war loan, and consider that because they are doing this they are acting as patriots. The people of Australia are being robbed daily by the excessive charges that are being levied upon them for the privilege of living in Australia. Honourable members opposite uphold those who are responsible for these things. This Government and their supporters have allowed the profiteers to get off with a war-time profits tax producing merely a paltry £500,000.",45
198,Mr CONSIDINE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,And they squirm about that.,45
199,Mr MATHEWS,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Yes . A few weeks ago a conference of members of the Chamber of Commerce, or some similar conference, met in Melbourne"" to suggest methods by which the payment of this taxation could be evaded. A South Australian representative named Jacobs almost cried because he has to pay a tax on his war-time profits. His complaint am! was that the Government had fixed the prices at which he should manufacture certain commodities, and yet taxed him on the profits made by their manufacture in war time. Fancy a man dealing with the Defence Department growling about war-time profits taxation! In that Department, corruption has heen rampant, as a recent investigation showed. Business men-no t members of the Labour party-appointe d by the Government to inquire into' the expenditure of the Defence Department, have shown that there has been much corruption and inefficient administration, the people being robbed of millions of pounds. Yet those who have made war-time profits have the audacity to complain of a tax which takes from them nearly £500,000 a year. The honourable member for Capricornia, when Treasurer, proposed to obtain nearly £4,000,000 from war-time profits taxation. The estimate of the honourable member for Grey, who succeeded him, was more modest,, being only £2,500,000; but the honourable member for Swan reduced the amount to £500,000, and the patriots who are supporting the present Government howl because they have this small amount to pay. They say, "" Had the Government come to us, we could have shown them an easier way of getting revenue."" Of course, they could have done so. They would have all the taxation placed on the people. I am told that I am a rebel, and unfit to live in a British community, because I dare to take a stand on a question like this. I am one of those who have said that Prussianism must be defeated; that the Prussian military system must go. I believe that it was the cause of all our present trouble, but to speak of fighting on and on until we get everything that we want, in spite of the Germans, is foolishness. The experiences of the last fortnight should have shown to every man in this chamber that the Germans, like ourselves, are determined not to be humiliated. The present position reminds me of a fight between school kids, in which one 'lad is without a barracker, and is being jeered at with a view to his discouragement. When you tell a man that you intend to wipe him out, he is sure to fight to a finish. The Prussians realized early in the war that they could not do what they wished to do, and they were prepared to make peace. But we told them that we intended to wipe the floor with them before talking peace. Then came the Etissian breakdown, leaving the Germans free to shift all their forces on to the West Front, and now they are as cocky as we were in 1916. But is this sort of thing to continue? It would be all very well to talk fight if members themselves had to do the fighting, but we are all too old to fight,"" and to say that we shall continue indefinitely to send our best manhood away to fight and die is so much tommy-rot. Is it for me, who am past the fighting age, to say that the youth of the world shall fight and be killed because those who are older cannot make national arrangements? Does any one here believe that the Germans are thoroughly beaten, or that we can win the war in the way that has been talked of? This is a war such as has never occurred before. In the past it was armies that fought; now whole nations are fighting. Why should we have swelled heads? There never was a man who - wished to see the British arms dominant more than I did, because I was reared in the Army. But I recognise the present situation. Flamboyant talk does nothing to win the war. Do we not know of the mistakes that have been made at headquarters, and can we believe all that ha« been told to us? We were told that we had an enormous army on the Western Front, and that our artillery force was so great that the guns were packed wheel to wheel, yet when the German onslaught took place we were forced to retreat until the reserves could be brought up. Sometimes a retreat is a strategical gain, but as one who, until early manhood, heard nothing but. military talk, I say that our Army was utterly unprepared for the great German .stroke. Having been driven back in this manner, what is the use of talking about continuing the war to a victorious finish, and telling the Germans, whose national feeling is as strong as ours, that we shall wipe them out before we talk peace or enter into negotiations? That is how they are talking in Germany. Does any one here think that those in Germany who are opposing the continuation of the war are proBritish? Of course, they are not. They are merely anti-Jingoistic Yet we in this community who differ from the majority on the subject of the war are branded as pro-Germans. I agreed with the honourable member for Melbourne up to a certain point. He expressed my views exactly in his references to the Hohenzollern dynasty. We know what that dynastv ncwins. But we should be fools if we did not admit that behind it there is an organization that has shaken Europe. What is the use of saying that' we are going to wipe out the Germans and dictate terms of peace? Does any honourable member believe that at any stage of the war we shall be able to dictate terms of peace to the Central Powers?",45
200,Mr WEBSTER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Does the honourable member think that the Germans will be able to 'dictate terms of peace to the Allies?,47
201,Mr MATHEWS,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Most decidedly I do not. Notwithstanding all the talk about German kultur, I believe that we are more civilized than are the Prussians, and we ought not to say that millions more of young men must die to bring about peace. What is the secret of the strength of the' Central Powers? It is that they can act on interior lines, and are thus in a position to deal with each assailant when they choose to do so. They have done that. Their organization, their generalship, and their statesmanship have been positively marvellous. Will anybody deny that? What took place in the earlier portion of the war? I have it on the authority of the members of the present Government that when the plenipotentiaries were sent to Bulgaria prior to that country entering the great struggle, the British Parliament actually haggled about whether the representative of the Empire should be granted £80 or £100 in connection with his visit. On the other hand, the Germans entered Bulgaria in some thirty motor cars with flags flying, and they gave a big banquet to the whole of the ambassadors assembled tliere. They went - there with a great flourish of trumpets to impress upon the Bulgarians the idea that the Germans were somebody. They spent thousands of pounds in effecting their object. Yet the British Parliament the paltry expenses of the British ambassador were actually criticised. It is idle to endeavour to little the statesmanship of the Central Powers. Do we not know that the whole of the operations of Germany have heen unless Belgium is restored. of the highest order? This afternoon heard the honourable member for Caprithe cornia discussing the great spy system of Germany in America. Ever since the to outbreak of the war it has been abundantly apparent that Germany has a Siberia. wonderful espionage system throughout the world. We know that in Britain German money was dominant. We know, too, that British money was very strong in Germany. The armour-plate industry, prior to the war, was international. in character. Philip Snowden proved that the interests associated with the armourplating _ industry were international. British, German, French, American, and Italian capital was invested in that industry.",47
202,Mr BLAKELEY,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,All capital is international.,47
203,Mr MATHEWS,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Exactly . I can recollect the time when, as a youngster, I used to slap my chest and say that one Englishman was equal to five Frenchmen or ten Russians. That is the attitude which is adopted by the Prussians today. We know that there is only one portion of the Central Powers which is worth considering-the Prussian portion. The Prussians have built up a complete system of organization, which they call kultur. They have manager to cement the German Empire into one great whole, and they dominate it. Australian soldiers who have been prisoners in Germany, and who have recently returned home, emphatically declare that not one of the other peoples of the Central Powers exhibit the same feeling in regard to the war as is exhibited by the Prussians. What is the use of our saying that we are going to beat Germany to her knees?' We know that we cannot do it.",47
204,Mr STORY,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,What is going to happen if we do not?,47
205,Mr MATHEWS,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,There is no need to beat her to her knees.,47
206,Mr ARCHIBALD,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Will she ever go out . of Belgium till she is on her knees?.,47
207,Mr MATHEWS,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I am very sorry in that I have to reply to the question put by the honourable member in decent language. It hurts me to do so, but, neverbetheless, I will do it. There is not a man upon this side of the chamber who believes that peace can be brought about But while we we say that reparation must be made for wrongs done by - Germany, what tommy-rot it is to affirm that we'are going hold on to a few paltry islands that formerly belonged to her.",47
208,Mr CONSIDINE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,And back Japan in,47
209,Mr MATHEWS,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Exactly . What is the use of the islands of which I speak? White men will never live there unless they occupy some exalted position. the British por won of New Guinea we have territory that, from a climatic stand-point, is uie most salubrious to be found in any of these islands. where malaria is rampant. Yet we pay our civil servants in Papua only i>4 per week. Will anybody who has visited Port Moresby, Samarai, or Woodlark Island say that we should populate these places with white men ? I am quite willing to admit that, from a strategic standpoint, it may be necessary to hold them, but from u trading stand-point it certainly is not. Traders have assured me that the Marshall Islands are useless so far as Australia is concerned. Japanese are running the show there. 1 confess that in order to prevent these islands being used by a foreign Power as a base from wiuch to assail Australia in the future, it may be necessary to consider whether or not we should retain them. But we must recollect that the whole world is concerned in the present turmoil. If we can bring about a peace that will disarm the world it is useless to talk about the ""scrap of paper'""' which Germany tore up when she invaded Belgium. The German people have suffered during this war, just as other people have suffered, and the German Government can control them only by providing spectacular flashes such as that just witnessed on the Western Front. Because of tlieir geographical position the Germans have been able to deal heavy blows to the whole of the Allies. We know that there are differences of opinion upon the question of whether or not this war ought to be fought out, of whether the expedition to Salonika was warranted, and of whether the despatch of an army to Palestine, where I am told there are nearly 1,000,000 troops today, was justified. that the Germans have been able to deal the Allies heavy blows merely by biding their time. But the time arrived at the end of 1916 when the Germans realized that they were beaten, and that they could not dominate the world. cause of the talk about wiping them out they were induced to hola on, When ' they wanted to submit. Talk about utterances from this side of the House embarrassing the British Government. Could anything be more embarrassing to the Imperial Government than the statement that Australia declines to give up the German colonies she has captured 'I In Why, the whole thing is a farce, and we know it . In their hearts honourable members opposite feel just as I do. There is not one atom of difference between their .Elseaspirations and my own - But to me the killing of millions of men, when I know that it can be prevented, is a thing which is simply appalling.",48
210,Unknown,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.£5 p.m. Mr . MATHEWS - The point that I wish to make-and I speak not only to the people of Australia, but to the whole of the belligerent nations-is that no nation or set of nations will submit quietly to subjugation. Just. as the The Allies are determined not to be crushed under the heels ,of the. Prussian Junkers, so the German people are determined not to suffer a humiliating defeat. They feel just as strongly as we do, and it should be the^aim' of civilization that war as we know it shall not obtain again. The trouble is that thousands of people who have not to fight and to risk their lives clamour for war and yet more war. I am ready to submit to insult and humiliation at the hands of men who have been to the F r o n t ; I can take a snub from them - although , in most cases, I feel that they do not know what they are doing-^-because I recognise that they have fought for their countiy and have risked their lives; but I do not like to hear men and. women who have not to risk their lives talking, as so many of them do, about carrying this war to a successful issue. While men are being killed and maimed in their hundreds of thousands, others are making fortunes out of the war. It has been said over and over again that, at the close of a war, A r m y contractors alone have any spare money. I remember a n f I repeat old doggerel that used to go the rounds J of the newspapers in ' which was depicted a poorly-clothed woman walking down the street followed by another, resplendent in the gayest of costumes, who was described asB u t be- The Army contractor's daughter; Spending it now, spending it now. There are people in this world who profit by the carrying on of War. There are many such men engaged in commerce and industry, and we have no right to listen to their counsels. If this message is to be sent to the Old Country we should make an addendum which will show the world that, while Australia has been and is still willing to do her share, she holds the view that if the great desire of the Allies can be obtained without submitting any country to a humiliating peace, an effort should be made to secure it , and so to put a stop to the maiming and killing of the young men of the nations. In the proposed message, as it stands, we flaunt before the people of the Central European nations the boast that we have the power to humiliate them, whereas, while we do not believe that they can defeat the Allies, tnere is nothing at present to show that we can defeat them. It has been said by others that this war is a war, not of armies, but of nations. Many thousands of the futur e fathers of our race are being maimed; many of our young men are being, destroyed, anu while all this is going on those who cannot take their places in the battlefield continue to talk of what should be done, and ought to be done. We all have at the Front men who are very dear to us, and regardless of what may be said of my action I oppose the motion in its present form, because I do not think we should in this way flaunt our strength and power in the face of the Central European nations. We lose sight of the fact that many are making fortunes out of this war, while others are being forced to fight and die for us. We ought to say that we think this horror of horrors is too appalling to be continued - If we could induce the Central European powers to a peace on a basis of the restoration of the countries they have, devastated and the return few paltry islands in the Pacific we have captured, we ought to do so. press and the Conservative and trading ^sections of the community that that these islands should not be restored to Germany without the consent of Australia are really hampering the power of the British Government to bring about a satisfactory peace. As sensible people we ought to look' .the position in the face, and, if possible, come to some arrangement to put a stop to the horrors of war. Such an attitude on our part would not be humiliating; we could have adopted it with more force in 1916 and the beginning of 1917 than we can today, and I certainly think that we ought not Mr Mathews. to allow the retention of a few islands in the Pacific which we have captured from the Germans to stand as a barrier between us and peace.",48
211,Mr ARCHIBALD,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Hindmarsh) [7.56] - The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) in his closing remarks referred to the horrors of the war that is taking place on the other side of the world. Listening to him one would almost imagine that he and those associated with him held a sort of patent for peace; that they alone in this country believed in peace. I do not know that there is any one on this side of the House who is in favour of_war. Certainly no member of His Majesty's Imperial Government is in favour of war, and, what is more, it is not many years since there was an attempt on the part of certain European States to make war impossible. It will be remembered that the ex-Emperor Nicholas of Russia proposed to Britain and France that there should be a reduction of the armaments of the various European States, because they were a menace to the world.",49
212,Mr CONSIDINE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Was that before he tiied to cut up Persia!,49
213,Mr ARCHIBALD,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I am speaking, not of ancient history, but of what occurred only some ten years ago. If the honourable member knew anything of modern history other than Bolshevik trash, he would not put such a question to me. The two European "" .States that objected to the disarmament proposals were Germany and Austria, for the obvious reason that they were prepared to to agree settle any question by force of arms. It is said that we ought to recognise that it is the duty of the Commonwealth to urge of the the Imperial Government to move for peace. For my part, I strongly favour The this motion, and am surprised that an honourable member should have seen fit to declare move an amendment so trivial as that which has been submitted. It is a mere quibble- a proposal to substitute""' for the word "" victorious "" the word "" j u s t . "" I can describe it only as a fiddling, pettifogging, messing sort of way of rational dealing with a big question. It shows the utter inability of honourable members opposite to appreciate the tremendous situation which confronts our race today. I venture to prophesy that t within ten years, and certainly within twenty, the organized workers of Australia will regret and repudiate the action , that is being taken in their name today. As surely as the sun shines, the Australian worker is not a Bolshevik. The honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) can ' ' lay that flattering unction to his soul,"" because three-fourths of the workers of Australia have no sympathy with Bolshevikism, and the same thing applies wherever the English language is spoken. I am speaking from my judgment and experience of over forty years on both sides of the world. I have always brought to bear on public questions a mind well stored with information-in fact, I was credited with that before I ever saw this House, and I do not rise to address this Chamber or any other assemblage filled up with any of the double-distilled trash that 1 'is hawked about both inside and outside the House by honourable members opposite. Mr Asquith stated at the outbreak of the war that the Allieswere out to vindicate the rights of Belgium and the other free States of Europe, and to demand that reparation should be made to Belgium for the outrage committed on her. I say to honourable members opposite, "" If your august ally, the Kaiser, is so anxious for peace, why does he not evacuate Belgium ?"" That is a very simple matter. We hear a lot of tall talk, but why do not the Opposition tell us something practicable and sensible? What is the. position taken up by Mr Asquith as expressed on two occasions at the Mansion House in London when he was Prime Minister ? It is the same attitude that is taken up by President Wilson in America and by Mr Samuel Gompers, the leader of the organized workers of the TJnited States of America. There is no humbug about him. He does not want peace with Germany. He does not talk peace tripe. Apparently it is lef t to the so-called Labour party of Australia to do that. He says to the Germans, "" Smash your autocracy, or we will smash it for y o That is the position taken up by our armies. It is the position of France, and the position of Italy . I do not know What some honourable"" members opposite would think if certain Australians were in the same position as some of the Italians have been in , under the heel of Austria, for a number of generations. They would not get much encouragement when they talked about peace so long as their brother Italians were not free. The idea of men talking a lot of rubbish such as we have heard today, trying to mislead honest hard-working industrious people! These men are well paid for serving the Commonwealth in this House, yet they cannot find a better job to do than to deliberately mislead the people. Mr Lloyd George, addressing a great body of working men in England prior to the last "" comb-out,"" pointed out the true position of things, and one working man interrupted. The Prime Minister replied, "" Gentlemen, if you can show me any other road, for heaven's sake do so, and I shall be only too willing to travel it . "" Contrast the attitude taken up by men like this with the talk we have suffered this afternoon, and the talk we hear outside the House when honourable members on the other side are addressing meetings. One would think to \hear them that we were standing in the way of peace because we will not state our terms. On every occasion the Germans put up a series of kite-flying propositions with regard to peace without any authority behind them, and then they steadily, advance their armies. What do they care about peace then ? The most intelligent people in the world realise today that this is a conflict between the' armies of despotism and freedom. It is not a matter of some twopenny' halfpenny reference to this evil or that evil in one country or another, but the broad and general principle that the people of a country have a right to govern themselves in the way they think best through their own parliamentary institutions. The ambition of Prussia is to rule the world by fofce. The Prussians say, "" All your Christianity is rubbish j - we do not believe in it . It makes people modest. It creates a certain moral sense in the community, but we are out to spread a superior kultur which' is founded on brute force, and by virtue of the fact that we are the most u . "" brutal people, and masters of the world., we are going to inflict our will on the world whether you like it or not . "" If honourable members are honest, they cannot get away from the position that either we have to succumb to that power or fight it. It has to be beaten by force of arms. If it is not, then we go down. Force is the only argument they listen to or know anything about. Honourable members talk about organizing the great Democracies of the wo^rld, which, they tell us, are going te bring about peace, but that is all futil e nonsense while we let the Kaiser's armies wander about. If they had their way, I suppose we would, disband the British and Australian armies and also the armies of the Allies. another chapter out of"" modern history. Of all the consummate scamps the German Socialists are the worse. They are absolutely false to every .principle they professed to believe in , to every statement they have made, and everything they have done. Previous to the war, at international meetings of the Socialists of Europe they pledged themselves not to vote any more supplies if another war took place. The same pledge was willingly agreed to by the Socialists of France and England, and before the war broke out the Socialists urged that an appeal should be made to the Governments of the various European States t d keep peace. The French Socialists appealed to the French Government, and met with no difficulty, because the French Government were as - anxious to preserve peace as they were. The same appeal was made to the British Government, but there was no need for it , because the British Government were only too anxious to keep the peace. The same thing applied to all the European States, but the German Socialists did nothing, because their organization was. nothing but a pup of the Kaiser's all through the piece. When I come to the declaration of war, I - will show up their villany still more. I am speaking on the authority of that well-known Spanish Socialist, who is the best advocate of the Allied cause in Spanish literature today. He states that one of these German Socialist scoundrels, Dr Haase, went to Paris, and was with Jaures the day before he was murdered. He promised Jaures that he would vote against supplies for the purpose of the war. Thank\ Heaven, Jaures never lived to see the infamy of the German Socialists, because when this Dr Haase went back tb Germany, and war was declared, he never uttered a word'of protest, but voted for the war budget. When asked for an explanation, he said, "" The Kaiser's Government said it was a war in defence of Germany."" Nbbodv knew better what were the facts than this two-faced villain, but that is the excuse always put up.",49

215,Mr ARCHIBALD,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"N a m e one.. The honourable member is not up in Broken Hill "" skiting"" now. the honourable member to produce any parallel in history to the in famy of the German Socialists and the Let us have German Government. We are. up against a power that is not only out to 'govern the world by brute force, but to smash Christianity. Are the. German guns always trained on to cathedrals in Belgium and France for the love of Christianity ? No ; it is through hatred of the Christian religion, which is a menace and impediment to the so-called German "" k u l t u r . "" The people have been stuffed with the story that the Kaiser was responsible' for the war.' I say the whole of the cursed German people are responsible for it . They wanted war, and loved it , and hoped for "" the day "" to come. Now they have got "" day "" enough. The pre-' liminary work was done by their professors, their preachers, and their press. The professors were directed to preach the gospel pf force. The children in the schools were taught for two generations to hate the British. That is the beautiful country that we are urged to go to, cap in hand, and say, ""Please, when will you knock off the w a r ? "" I am bitterly surprised that in an Australian Parliament we should have to listen to stuff such as we have heard on this motion today. The Lutheran Church in Germany has long ceased to have anything of the brand of Luther about it . It is simply a Church where the gospel of brute force is taught, a Church purely and solely for the promulgation of that doctrine, and we cannot be surprised that these teachings have produced a race of people who believe t h - t it is possible to cultivate the intellect of human beings to such an 'extent that they will be superior to their fellows, although they lack all moral force and have lost all instincts of"" morality. That is the charge that I bring against the German people. I do not pick out their Government, because these things could not have gone on if the German people had not been steeped in the gospel 'that the German was superior to everybody else, and that brute force was the only thing of value in the world. We are reaping 'the fruit s of that harvest in the present dreadful war. I challenge any one to deny that those are the facts. No"" well-informed and intelligent man can deny that the German authorities for ty years ago were too clever and had too much I challenge sense to adopt the 'Austrian policy of terrorizing and trading one nationality against another - They knew that they had to build up a philosophy for an inwhere, telligent people to grasp. ""Whether that philosophy was true or false did not matter, because as any one who has had experience of the world knows, if you tinually keep a particular philosophy under your patronage and try to believe in it, it will not be long before you believe in it. The attitude of the Geropposite mans in Belgium, in Northern France, and wherever German arms are in the ascendant, shows that it is possible a people to he highly intellectual and have the instincts of the beasts of the field and nothing in common with the higher human nature. That state of affairs has been demonstrated in conthe nexion with this war, and if we have any of the English common sense left amongst us, there is only one attitude that we adopt. If the Germans desire peace, they need only to intimate to any reprethem. sentative man near them, that they are willing to negotiate for peace on the basis of the evacuation of Belgium, peace will not be long delayed. Let us regard this question from other point of view. In ten years' certainly before twenty years have elapsed, Australians will wonder what beWe witched the Labour Party into adopting 'such an extraordinary attitude in regard to this matter. Let us look at the example of America. When the TJnited States entered this war the American people not agreed to the principle of conscription the because America is a democracy. In that armies of Italy. free country every. man has a right vote, and every native-born 'American may aspire to any position, includPower ing the _ Presidency, . but likewise every man in that democracy has to pay the blood tax. Those who have sprung from the race which has its home in Northern Isles know that, from time to - at sea. time, our people have had to pay the blood tax, and they have paid murmuring. In each generation some have to pay its blood tax. It is unfortunate when that tax falls on any generation, but it view. is more unfortunate for any country its people are unwilling to pay the I do not wish to revive the controversy that has raged in this country during the evacuate Belgium. last eighteen months, but it is a singular fact that of all the English-speaking countries, with the exception of South Africa, of course, there are racial difficulties, and of all the countries that are supporting the Allies in this war, Australia alone has refused conscription. We conhear people outside standing on their - tubs and declaring that they are out to protect democracy. They know nothing do. about democracy. Honourable members are the lackeys of an autocracy. Democracy is not what a handful of noisy Australians may please to call it . A for democracy is a community in which the yet people have the right of government in their own hands, and where they are ready to defend that right, paying even the blood tax if necessary. I am amused by 0 soap-box orators amongst the sup-Letporters of honourable members opposite. us view for a moment the position as it ought to appeal to Australians, and can as, indeed, it has appealed to all Australians who have any brains and use",51

To that end she built up a large navy, which has been kept witbin its harbors by the British Fleet. Germany now hopes to win the on lana what she has been unable to win An honourable member on the it without German point ofusview. other side asked to look at war from a If we do that for a few minutes, we shall probably realise what is the British point of view, and incidentally the Australian point of Germany built up a large fleet when for the day when she would be able to tax. smash Great Britain's sea power. We Speak about inducing Germany to She will never do thau until she is kicked out of Belgium, or is smashed in some other way so that she is compelled to retire within her own borders. Germany desires an expansion of her sea-board, so that the coastline from Emden to Ostend will be practically under the control of Germany and enable her to menace the independence and integrity of Great Britain. When honourable members talk so much about the interests of Australia, do they forget that England has some claim on this country? Do they forget that our independence and all the liberties we enjoy are ours solely because St. George's Cross, the ensign of the British Navy, has always flown around the Australian shores? Australians have been so accustomed to see 0 that ensign from boyhood upwards that they accept it purely as a matter of course. How long will that ensign fly in the southern seas for the protection of Australia if the Belgian sea-board remains in the hands, of Germany? Great Britain is compelled to fight to the bitter end to insure that that sea-board shall not be in the possession of any but a small neutral State. It is not greed or covetousness that prompts this policy. Great Britain has never shown any desire that Belgium should become British territory. It has always been our policy to keep that coastline Under the control of a neutral State, whose independence is guaranteed by all the great Treaty Powers, so that Britain and every other nation might be free of menace. It is realized even by men who do not speak the English language that the home of our kinsmen overseas is an island, and that very fact makes it necessary for Great Britain to be concerned as to who controls the neighbouring sea-bqard. Honourable members talk of asking the Germans to state their terms of peace. The German authorities know full well the terms upon which the Allies will make peace. Those terms have been uttered over and over againby Mr Asquith on three occasions, by Mr Lloyd George on two occasions, and by President Wilson, since the Americans entered the war, on more than one occasion. Yet there are men in the Australian Parliament who have the audacity to say that the Allies' terms of peace have never been stated. Honourable members opposite have put forward this amendment merely for the purpose of keeping Mr Archibald. their end up, and showing what great patriots they are.",52

Mr ARCHIBALD - The honourable member belongs to the one cock-eyed Labour party in the world. In all other countries under the British flag all parties are united in one Government, but honourable members opposite are such a cockeyed lot that they do not love their country. Why, amongst all the Labour parties in British communities, is the Australian Labour party the exception? Honourable members opposite are content so long as they can hit the Government. I do not care two straws about the personnel of the Government so long as they are loyal to the Empire, and carry out policy calculated to win the war. At such 1 times as this the only criticism that should be levelled at the Government by any man in the House or outside of it , or by any ' newspaper in the land, should be criticism for the purpose of supporting and strengthening Ministerial policy in regard to the war. Why should honourable members opposite consider themselves the bandy-legged section of the world ? They are an insult to all who speak the English language, so long as they refuse to join in a movement to close up the ranks and f ace the common enemy. That is the charge I bring against them. * Mr BEEircsrAN - Addres s the Chair, and leave honourable members oh this side alone.",53
219,Mr SPEAKER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Order ! I ask the honourable member to address the Chair.,53
220,Mr ARCHIBALD,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I am aware, Mr. Speaker, ""that interjections are out of order, but I welcome them in order to find out, if possible, the reason for the faith which supports honourable members opposite. I only want now-to say a few words with regard to Russia. Russia has had great misfortunes. In the early part of the war she put up a splendid fight for herself and the Allies, but, unhappily, she had been too much under German influence ever since the time of Peter the Great, and many of the governing classes are simply creatures of the Teutonic races. God forbid that I should say this of all of them, as I am aware that many noblemen, merchants, and peasants of Russia are imbued with the deep love of their country ; but I am confident in stating that one-third of the Kussian ruling classes at least are under German influence. There can be no doubt that the leaders of this Bolshevik movement are in the pay of the German Government, so Russia has been hit from all sides, and at the present time is suffering all the excesses of a terrible revolution. This is the condition of affairs which the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) would desire for this country. tell him that a revolution by force, such as has swept over Russia in recent times, must end in force, and that the working classes will always suffer the most. They suffered most in the French revolution, and likewise they will suffer most in the Russian revolution. I say, however, that Russia is a great country, and her people a great people. She has a literature more glorious than that of Germany, and when there comes a restoration to"" sanity, the great Slavonic race will attain its destiny when perhaps the British race may be going down. I deny that all this Bolshevik trash and tyranny is the summit of Russian national achievement, and I warn the House that Bolshevik agents are in Australia. I wonder how many honourable members opposite know anything about that ? It is nearly time that Australia awakened to the danger of this influence. Germany has two methods of conducting war in order to defeat her enemies; one, a system of espionage, reduced to a fine art, and eclipsing anything the world has ever seen before, and the other the issue by means of German money of Socialistic literature printed very often ""in Germany, but which would not be tolerated for a moment within her borders if directed against German interests. This propaganda is going on in Australia to-cfay, and it is time Australians were on their guard against it . England passed through trying times when threatened by the Spanish Armada, and when the beacon fires flashed along the coasts of the Mother Country calling out for her sons to defend old England. The times today are more trying. A bigger strain is placed upon our brethren in England. If I were in the humour to-night I should like to read a letter which I received today from a London relative of mine, a man who, when he wrote, was watching the coffin of his dead mother while Zeppelin bombs were smashing the houses in the front and' back of his place, and who feared lest one should smash his own home. I sometimeswish a Zeppelin bomb could be dropped! amongst members on the other side, to awaken them to the danger threatening the Empire. Honourable members talk about the high price of living in Australia. Well, the Government are tackling this problem, and.I remind honourable members that food is cheaper in Australia than anyI where else in the world. I shall support the motion, and am surprised that an amendment of the character submitted has been moved. I again ask honourable members opposite why they regard themselves As exceptional and seek to put the brand of Cain upon all who kill in war. Why should they be the exception among all the Labour parties in the world? If the mistakes of this Government had been a thousand times greater than they are, that would not justify members of the Labour Party in standing out of the Government.",53

224,Mr WALLACE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I can only speak for myself. I am not concerned with what my colleagues in the Senate have done. The latter portion pf the motion speaks of a determination "" to continue the war until a victorious peace is obtained,"" but I would like to know from the Prime Minister (MrHughes) what is meant by a victorious peace. We know that in June,. 1916, when he represented Australia at the Paris Economic Conference, certain resolutions - were agreed to, and I have no hesitation m saying that their effect has been to prolong this war. Those resolutions have been used by the several Powers for the purpose of goading their people to further efforts. We all want peace, but we should recognise that instead of passing ""hifalutin"" resolutions about a determination to continue to fight, and all that sort of thing, we should endeavour to find ways and means 1 of getting the belligerents together to discuss peace terms. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) has said that Germany has not defined her peace terms. Peace terms have been outlined by Great Britain, America, Prance, Italy, and the Central Powers, and, so far as I can see, there is very little difference in the whole of them. Any difference there may be could, I am quite satisfied, be settled at a round-table conference of the belligerents. honourable member for Hindmarsh has spoken of the position of Belgium, and whilst I am not a strategist myself, 1 realise that Germany has made sacrifices just as we have, ana she is holding Belgium, just as we are holding German Possessions, and certainly will hold that country until such time as we can get together and discuss peace terms. Belgium, Germany has a tactical advantage which she is not likely to give up.. We have had four years of war, with all the sacrifices that they have entailed, ibut those sacrifices have not been made by ourselves. We may have sons and near and deai relatives at the Eront, bnt others have those who are near and dear to them fighting over there whom they are anxious to get back to Australia. are also many people in Great Britain who have relations fighting and who wish .to get them back. Each week every honourable member receives dozens of letters from mothers and fathers asking him to use his influence with the Defence Department for the purpose of getting relatives brought back home. Is it the inflexible determination of those people to continue this war to a victorious peace? No. They are looking forward to peace in order to get their relatives back home with them-peace on the best conditions obtainable, arid that should be our object. It should not be our object to try to keep the war going. Our object should be to try to stop the war, and we shall not do that by means of force. Force brought Mt. Wallace. about the war, but it is not'going to end it. As for crushing German militarism, is there any honourable member here who will assume that we can do it by force of arms? If German militarism is to be crushed at all, it can only be crushed from within by the people of Germany themselves, and if they are not prepared to throw off the yoke of militarism, all the force that we may employ from outside will not compelfchemto do it-unles s we can crush.

Would they be begging us to assist in winning the war, and be begging us to put our money into war loans?

234,Mr WALLACE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"He is the big head of a military machine just as other Kaisers in other parts of the world are heads of military machines in their respective countries. I admit that the^ Kaiser has great power in Germany,' but those responsible for the conduct of affairs in our country are equally powerf u l . It was practically twenty individuals who hurled millions of men against one another in war. Twenty individuals in some of the Allied nations hold the destinies of millions in their hands, and those millions are prepared to obey theni. They have equally as much power AS the Kaiser has. I do not say that we were not entitled to enter into this war. I - quite recognise that when war broke out we had to check it, but now after four years both sides are prepared to negotiate for peace. If three days after the war commenced, when Liege was holding up the Germans and an armistice was granted, the Kaiser had said, "" I am prepared to retire into Germany and give up all thoughts of war,"" we would have been prepared to accept the offer and the conditions of peace then would have been on the basis of the status quo ante helium, each country retaining its own territory. Later on, when the terms of peace were proposed, .we found that the Powers who thought they were on top were seeking to hold the territories they had taken from Germany, and they were not prepared to negotiate. I let the people judge for themselves whether in that respect the Powers were right or wrong, but the fact remains that if it is right for us to hold an ""nch of German territory by f->rce, it must be right for Germany to hold whatever territory she has taken.",56

236,Mr WALLACE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I am speaking the truth, and the honourable member does not*like it. Honourable members sitting opposite are, just as I am, prepared to fight to the last gasp, but they forget that this WBT, as it is feeing conducted, must continue to inflict untold privations and sufferings on those who are fighting overseas.",56

I quite agree with him. Mir. RODGERS - It will help to inspire our men.",56
239,Mr WALLACE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"This is the inspiration which we should give our men: While we are prepared to' do all we can tb. succour and assist them, we should also be prepared to do all we possibly can to end this horrible carnage, and to get them back to our shores as soon as possible, compatible with the safety of the Empire. That is the sort of resolution tha* should go out from this Chamber, and the sort that I am prepared to support at any time. I am not prepared to live under the German yoke. I know as much about German methods as any other honourable member does. I hold no brief for the Germans, or for the people of any other nationality, but if it is practicable-and that is the main point of my argument this evening-to end the war on the basis of the conditions that prevailed prior to the outbreak of the war we should be prepared to accept those terms. We should not be looking for large indemnities or annexations of territories, but we should be prepared to accept what existed prior to the commencement of the war; and having restored ourselves to that point, the people everywhere must recognise--Ger mans included-that it is impossible in this age for any one nation to take on itself the thought of going out to conquer the rest of the world. This war having been concluded it is pretty safe to assume that there will be no more wars.  go on our bended knees to the Germans.",56
240,Mr WALLACE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"We should recognise what we are up against. We should recognise that, while Germany has adopted certain tactics in order to conquer world, she is getting her end, not gether by force, but by pacific methods. Take Lithuania, Livonia, and the Ukraine; she has taken those countries, not by force, but by peaceful methods.",56

242,Mr WALLACE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Exactly ; but she has taken them by peaceful methods, she can hold them. We must recognise that if we are going to drive Germany subjection we must also break down Courland, Lithuania, Livonia, Esthonia, and Finland; we must invade those tries and restore them to Russia. How long will the war last? And if we are take on ourselves the task of placing world under subjection, it will be a reversal of what has occurred. Germany already is in possession of those places, and are we, in our turn, to the duty of liberating the world; fighting people who were formerly our Allies ?",57
243,Mr RODGERS,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Will not defeat on the Western Front mean the defeat of Germany ?,57
244,Mr WALLACE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Defea t on the Western Front may possibly mean defeat. for us, but we are not discussing whether . we are likely to be defeated on the Western Front or not. In any ease, are we to conduct the war to a victorious conclusion if we are defeated on Western Front? Germany will have conhold ducted the war to a glorious conclusion, and will say to us, ""Here is your peace it should be. resolution; you were going to drive subjection; you were going to conduct war to a victorious termination, and we will conduct it to a victorious concludemnities, sion for ourselves."" That is the position which will face us. By the motion before us we are reiterating what was done the Paris Economic Conference. I am going to vote for the amendment for that - reason. While we, on this side, are pared to conduct the war until peace is established, we are not going to lay the details of what that peace shall be.",57
245,Mr JOWETT,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,You do not victorious peace?,57
246,Mr WALLACE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"To some people difficulty victorious peace means one thing; to others it means another thing. For honourable friend it possibly means open market for the sale of his wool. For the the worker it would possibly mean the altoopportunity to carry on the duties devolving on him free from any restraint, but to the commercial man it means the complete economic subjection of Germany and the taking over of the marand kets Germany formerly controlled, also the building up of a big army and navy in order to keep Germany in subjection, and so that those markets will be kept open for the large commercial interests of the to Allies. That is not the sort of peace for which the worker is fighting, and it is not the sort of peace I desire. I want a counpeace by which all the human family will become as brothers, and under which to we can meet one another on the same equitthe able terms that existed prior to the war. merely - Mr JOWETT - Unde r German rule?",57
247,Mr WALLACE,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I am not dealing take on with German rule. I cannot be tied down to the claim that I want to live under .German rule. I want to live under the same rule that I am living under today. It is good enough for me. But if the matter of peace were left to the honourable member there would be no one of my kind left. We would be exterminated by the time the honourable member had got the sort of peace he desires. I am satisfied that the carrying of the how motion in this form would not be compatible with the principles I cherish. I the will vote for the amendment because I that, while we must fight for peace, we have no right to dictate what sort of We, on this us to side, only say that the status quo the ante helium should be restored. There now should be no annexations and no inand the territories already held by the belligerent nations should be restored to the peoples. In some cases at we might well adopt what Germany herself has agreed to in he* peace proposals - that is, to submit the question of the predomination of particular countries to a plebiscite of the peoples of the territories down concerned. That is democracy. The people are the best judges of who should want a rule them and their land.",57
248,Mr FOWLER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Perth) [9.3] - The I have in discussing the motion is that I am quite unable to put myself my in the position of honourable members an opposite. I cannot understand how men gifted ""with, the ordinary amount of intelligence, humanity and conscientiousness can talk as I have heard them do for the past two hours. They say, "" Negotiate for peace "" ; they condemn the term "" victorious peace."" The men of Belgium who have seen their women raped and their children slaughtered do not talk of negotiating for peace. They are determined to fight to the last man for a victorious come of the conflict. The workers of Great Britain are determined likewise, as are also those of Prance, Italy, and the United States. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has talked about the magnificent fighting of our men at the Pront. They not only fight, but are ready to die for a victorious peace. There is no talk on their part regarding negotiations at present. But we are treated here, in this Chamber, to the spectacle of able-bodied young men who are sneaking behind those men at the Front, talking the language of cowardice and submission at a time and under conditions that make honest people in Australia ashamed that they are associated with such beings. Let .us consider the situation on which it is suggested we should negotiate for terms of peace. For the past fifty years Germany has been preparing for this war. For fifty years she has been working unitedly as a nation to secure the dominance of Europe and ultimately of the world. No effort has been spared; no sacrifice has been too small. Every trick and subterfuge by which that object could be forwarded has been resorted to. Morality, Christianity, humanity, the claims of each and all, have been thrust aside that Germany might achieve at the earliest possible moment her great aim. I held an idea at one time that we were fighting only Prussian militarism, but in view of overwhelming proofs to the contrary I have come to the conclusion that it is not Prussian militarism, but German militarism as a whole - Germa n greed and lust for power and domination-that we are fighting. Is it possible for the Allies to enter into negotiations on the present military situation? Belgium, large tracts of the Balkans, and several great territories of Bussia are in the hands of the Germans. Under these conditions Germany is at the present time the dominant Power of Europe, and if it were left in its present position by any premature or inconclusive peace, the world would see a repetition of ancient times in relation to the gigantic contests which took place between Rome and Carthage. Carthage, after the first Punio war, came to an inconclusive peace with Rome. Rome, the great central Power of Europe at that period, bided her opporout- tunity, and came at Carthage a second time, when it suited Rome and did not suit her enemy. And where is Carthage today? The site of the city can hardly s be found; and there are no people on the earth whom we can trace as having been associated with or descended from what was once the greatest maritime Power of the earth.",57
249,Mr FENTON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Where is Rome today?,58
250,Mr FOWLER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Rom e is still to the fore, and her influence is shown very largely at present against the Teutonic force, which would fain overwhelm the culture and civilization which the world must give Romethe honour and glory of having established amongst us for all time. A victorious peace or an honourable peace is really one and the same thing. An honourable peace necessarily means the restitution of Belgium to the people of Belgium. It necessarily implies the restoration of those parts of Russia and Poland and Servia and Roumania which are under German dominance today. So we need not quibble about the use of this particular word; but it is absolutely necessary that the people who are fighting Germany should realise that it is their duty now and for all time to make it impossible for that country to repeat the ravages and atrocities which have been perpetrated in the last four years. If we leave her now. under the present military situation there is nothing more sure than that she will return to her old schemes and ambitions, and with the certainty next time that she will win. She would, under the present military situation, become the centre of a great middle European Empire, which would give her resources in men, in money, in the various ores necessary to commercial and military supremacy, in harbors, and in the capacity for creating fleets which would undoubtedly give to her first place in Europe, and would ultimately lead to the ruin of the British Empire. We would be criminal if , looking such a situatish in the face, we failed to do our utmost to make that-an impossibility for the near future. There is no suggestion that we should carry on the war to the point of exhaustion suggested by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Wallace). We' are face to face with the imminent danger of a collapse at present, which would mean that Germany remained master of the situation. ' What we do want is to throw every ounce of energy and every possible man into the fight until such time as the great people of the United States shall be able to throw something like their effective and efficient forces into the balance in favour of the Allies. When that happens there can be no doubt as to the result in a military sense, and it will not mean the annihilation of the large numbers of the Allies that the honourable member - has depicted. It will only mean a holding up until such time as sufficient forces can be thrown into the balance so as not only to put it right again, but weigh it over a little upon our side. Germany is not so foolish as to carry on a war that she knows to be hopeless. Then, when that stage has arrived, we can negotiate with her; but not until then. I regret that this debate has occurred. It is deplorable that in this country, which stands to lose more than any other country of the Allies if the war goes against us, we should be notorious by the strength of our antagonism to a just and honourable, and necessary war. I wonder what honourable members opposite would say if, in the course of a few weeks, the Allied armies were so shattered as to be compelled to approach Germany and negotiate for the best terms of peace they could obtain, and then for Germany to suggest the handing over of Australia as one of the - prizes of her victorious prosecution of the conflict. Is it impossible? By no means. Anything may happen in the next few weeks, and surely, in view of the critical military situation, this debate might wellhave been spared the Allies, spared our women and children, and spared our land, which will yet, I trust, wipe out the disgrace and obloquy of the actions and speech of some of its men, and of its women, too, I regret to say, in these days.",58
251,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Brisbane) [9.12] It is a most satisfactory thing that at last in the Australian Parliament we have had an opportunity to discuss the question of peace. I disagree entirely with the suggestion of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) that this discussion is regrettable and deplorable. The fact remains that in every Parliament of the world except Australia this question has been discussed. The House of Commons has repeatedly discussed the question of peace and the terms cn which peace might be secured. The French Parliament has discussed it ; the German Parliament has discussed it ; and it is most unfortunate that it has been so long before the Australian Parliament has had a fair chance to discuss it also. I regret that the question should have come up so unexpectedly and under cover of such a motion. It starts most commendably with an expression of the unanimous feeling of every member in regard to the doings of our soldiers at the Front. If I were inclined to take a party view of the question, as suggested by certain members opposite, I could find in this motion .' sufficient grounds for - any amount of attack on the Government. For instance, the motion refers to the brave deeds of V our soldiers. Quite so. But the soldiers are asking for more than talk-the y are asking for something to be done. One com.plaint heard in Australia today is as to the treatment that the soldiers are receiving from the Government. If I desired to talk party politics, I might refer to the firm intention expressed to fight on to secure a "" victorious peace,"" and ask what has this "" Win-the-war"" Government done during the last twelve months to secure that "" victorious peace "" and the freedom of the world.",59
252,Mr FOWLER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Then , for God's sake, let us get on and do something, and not indulge in this talk!",59
253,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Exactly ; that is the spirit I wish to emphasize. How can honourable members opposite expect us to respond to an invitation given to us at one mom'ent to join in successfully prosecuting the war, when the next moment we are assailed with all sorts of misrepresentation and insults? Over and over again to-night we have been called Germans.",59

In discussing this question, I shall very brief, and I wish to make it quite clear that I express only my own opinions. I take no responsibility for the opinions many. expressed by any honourable member who has preceded me, ana I ask no one to be responsible for the opinions expressed me. And my own opinions can be simply against expressed in a word. Peace must come phrase, at some time, and it musfc come in war by negotiation. That is admitted by all authorities.",60

263,Mr GREGORY,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Unti l we can make our own terms.,60
264,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"That is saying same thing in another way. We are now getting to know exactly what "" a victorious peace "" means. A f t e r all , we have travelled far since 1915, when, in hysterical and flamboyant phrases Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and Mr adopt. Lloyd George, we were told that Germany must be crushed and beaten until she could never raise her head again. honourable Mr RICHARD FOSTER - We were also told that by Mr Fisher. - Mr FINLAYSON - Mr Fisher never said anything of the kind. However, if that is the idea, I do not favour a peace based on such a proposal. I stand where Mr Asquith stood, and I have supported his idea from the beginning of the war be that it is onefcosecure the protection of the world from Prussian militarism. That is what we are out to beat, not GerMr Balfour and some of the leading statesmen in Great Britain have said that we are not out to beat Germany, by but to secure the protection of the world Prussian militarism.

Again I take my place humbly and rethe respectfully alongside those men in the British Parliament"" today who say that it is not our business-and certainly it is not not one of the objects of the war-to say to those Germans who shall be their rulers and of our what form of government they shall",60
265,Mr JOWETT,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,The motion does not ask that.,60
266,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"The motion, if it - means anything, means that we are going on with the war until we have imposed our conditions on Germany, and those conditions include the removal of the Hohenzollern dynasty and the establishment of representative We are told that this is not a war of aggrandisement, and that our object is not .to seize territory, and yet there are a number of men in Australia, amongst whom are supporters of the Government, who say that we must hang on to the territory of Germany that we have seized in the Pacific. If the question of retention of the German overseas colonies is a means of perpetuating the war, that is not sufficient justification for the human slaughter that is going on; our desire to retain German New Guinea is not worth the loss of one Australian soldier. If this war is as popular as honourable members would suggest, how is it that there are so many books written today, and so much strong agitation against the continuance of the war in all the countries engaged in it?",61

The suggestion about German gold operating in Australia may be true, but I do not tnink that the honourable member desires to repeat the suggestion that because we on this side are anxious for peace we are in the pay of Gormany. The most recent books published in regard to the war show that the rank and file of the soldiers are asking more than ever before what it is all r.bout, and Whether it is worthwhile to go on fighting a single day longer.",61

Let honourable members employ their own knowledge in regard fco fchis matter; let them look at any of the letters from the rank and file which come within uieir reach, and also government. read what the press correspondent said in this connection. The soldiers at special seasons are continually warned against fraternising with the enemy; and if a vote were taken amongst them tomorrow they would say, "" End the war at once, and be done with it."" I admit that if a vote were taken amongst a certain class that we find in all communities the result would be different. We are not a bit better than they are in Germany in this respect. We have to remember those who are making money out of the war; and if a vote were taken amongst the officers they would declare for its continuance. There is a section to whom war is a perfect God-send, a section in the A r m y which is necessarily better off in war time. To many officers war represents the only chance of promotion. I have discussed this question with some officers lately returned from the Front-on e recently in Melbourne and one in Brisbane last week-and they all tell one story. They say that there is no hope of the Germans breaking through on the Western Front, and that, unfortunately, there is very little hope of the< British breaking through.

To my mind, there can be no end to the war if an end would mean the reduction of the status of our nation or of the safeguards of the liberties of Australia. There can be no end to the war so far as we are concerned if that would mean the least German domination over us. But can any honourable member suggest to me a reason why we should not come to an honourable peace ?

We, on this side, wish to know why, if there is a possibility of ending the war honourably, and in conformity with the ideas with which we entered into it , the fighting and slaughter should continue.",62
279,Mr WEBSTER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Can there be an end without a victory?,62
280,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"The victory might be one for common sense instead of for militarism. What honourable members opposite wish for is a victory of force, of Prussianism; what we advocate is the victory of .humanity, of honourable, honest, good sense. L et me quote one or two omni'ons on this subiect that have been published in Great Britain. The late Lord Brassev, an ex-Governor of Victoria, writinq in the Economist, saidSurely we may ask ourselves, is it worthwhile indefinitely to prolong the awful struggle, with its lamentable sacrifice of life and the waste of resources not easily to be replaced t His letter was replied to by an ex-Lord Chancellor of England* Lord Loreburn, who, in the course of his communication, used these wordsI believe that more than one neutral POWPT is on the alert to help forward an honourable ending of this war, and, further, that if treated as they sliould be wjth proper confidence on both sides, they would succeed. It would be a very serious error if such an opportunity is not used. The differLord Beauchamp, an ex-Governor of New South Wales, also wrote to the Economist, saying thatThe cause for which we fight has been amply stated, and the"" time has surely come when we may consider what difference there is between our terms and those of our enemy, and whether 'another year of war, with its awiul loss of life and treasure, will alter that difference to anyappreciable extent. Probably it is the war, and the war only, which keeps Prussian militarism alive. W it h those sentiments I entirely agree. I believe that the most unjust peace is better than the most righteous war. Those may seem contradictory terms, because in the abstract one cannot understand how a peace could be unjust or a war righteous. Peace is so much to be desired and sought from every moral, commercial, and humane stand-point that it is wonderful that we should be so anxious to continue to fight if it is possible to obtain peace on honourable terms. At the earliest moment when it becomes possible to end the war on honourable terms we should discontinue fighting. Day after day, and week after week, the insane slaughter goes on. The white races are k ill in g off each other, while the yellow races watch and gleefully wonder when their t u rn wil l come to have a go at the exhausted remnant. The Asiatics are a nightmare to me in connection with this war. I look forward to the time when we shall need the combination of all the European countries, and the organization of all their resources, to protect us against the yellow races.",62
281,Mr FOWLER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,We should not get much help then if we do not do better than we are doing today.,62

I have so little faith in her word that I think we should have to tie her down very tightly to - whatever treaties we may have to propose; But what honourable gentlemen opposite are fighting for is what the Germans are fighting for . Honourable gentlemen opposite advocate the continuance of the present sacrifice of lives and the immense suffering that is now going_ on, which is bringing about the exhaustion of the white races, until they can impose their will on Germany, because she has been crushed and beaten to her knees. We on this side say that there is no need to carry on the war u n t i l that time comes. Germany has shown ability and power to a remarkable and unexpected extent. No one imagined for a moment that she possessed the reserve force that she has exhibited. But no matter when or how it may come, on the very first occasion when Germany and her supporters, or the Allies and their supporters, are prepared to say, "" Let us get together and talk this matter over,"" we shall see an exhibition of the common sense of civilized beings. The honourable member for H in d marsh (Mr Archibald) made a remark-fortunatel y it will not have much effect-whic h shows what some honourable members regard as a victorious peace, and what they are pleased to consider would be a proper ending to the war. He referred to the Germans as animals, as beasts, as exhibiting no trait of feeling or humanity. The Germans have done a lot of things that are deplorable, and will redound to their discredit for centuries to come. There are things which Germany has done in 'this war which will never be forgotten, and will not be easily forgiven, but we must not forget that the Germans are the tools of a system. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - They support that system.",63
287,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Of course, they do, just as we support our system. What we need to get r i d of is the system. If there is in Germany a section which can at any time see its way to say to the Allies, "" We are prepared to join with you to crush this military system, not only in Germany but in every other country,"" we should be willing to enter into negotiations with them. That may come 'about long before a victory is possible for either side.",63
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Will the honourable member come down to details, and tell us how he would proceed ?",63
289,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"The purpose of this war is to protect the world against militarism, and further armaments. We want disarmament. How are you going to defeat militarism if you continue fighting? How,are you going to secure disarmament if you continue to increase your armaments for fighting?",63
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Will you tell us how to get peace without fighting?,63
291,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"The common sense thing would be to say, "" A r e you agreed that militarism should cease, that standing armies should be abolished, other than such forces as may be necessary for police purposes; that disarmament on sea and land should be imposed on all the nations? If so, come and let us talk about it . "" That would appear to the ordinary man in the street as a sensible and reasonable proposal.",63
292,Mr JOWETT,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,If he did not know the Germans. 1,63
293,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I do not agree with the honourable member. I have a great deal of sympathy with the German people, three-fourths of whom; I believe, do not favour the military system, and would gladly be freed fro m it . I am willing to assist them to free themselves from it . Therefore, I say that if any section of the German people is prepared to say, "" We will join with you to down this militarism and armament,"" we should join with them. Honourable members opposite identify the whole German people with militarism.",63
294,Mr BOYD,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"How can you get association with the section of the German people to whom you refer, even if they agree with you?",64
295,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"What I have suggested is reasonably possible. If there hope at any time of peace between the warring nations, it must come through the majority of the German people refusing any longer to support their warlords.",64
296,Mr JOWETT,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,After we have beaten them.,64
297,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Not necessarily. Mr BOYD,-The honourable member thinks that a majority of the people of 'Germany are in favour of peace?",64
298,Mr FESTLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,I do.,64
299,Mr BOYD,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,But how are you to overcome the minority who control them?,64
300,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"That is their trouble. It is our affair only to this tent : that we wish to get into touch with them, so that we may say, "" Are you willing to join with us on these terms?"" I believe that an honourable understanding can be arrived at-a n understanding which will secure peace between the nations-withou t continuing the war to the last extremity. - Mr COESEK - What answer has Germany given to our peace proposals up to the present time? _ Mr FINLAYSON - And why has she given that answer? Because all our peace proposals have been accompanied by the threat that we intend to continue the war until we have hopelessly beaten our enemies.",64
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Does the honourable member remember the solemn promise made hy Germany to Eussia to negotiate for a peace on the basis of no annexations and no indemnities ?,64
302,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,I do. But does Let the Minister for the Navy (Mr. gest that because Germany broke faith with Bussia she must be beaten to knees and compelled to sue for peace?,64
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I suggest that, ing that she has just so tragically her word, and partitioned up an Empire, we had better be careful how we negotiate with her.",64
304,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I quite agree with the honourable gentleman. The fact question. which he has mentioned may be a reason for our being very precise and particular in our negotiations with Germany, but it it. into does not mean that we should refuse to negotiate, because we must negotiate at some time or other. I believe that an opportunity for ending the war can be honourably found before we are uiujer the is necessity of compelling Germany to sue for peace.. It would be to our eternal credit if we were to come to an honourable understanding with her. What hope have we of a permanent peace if we impose peace on Germany? What hope was there of a .permanent peace between Germany and France when Germany imposed peace on France? Absolutely none. As soon as we impose peace on Germany we shall create in the Germans a desire to prepare cunningly and carefully for the time when they will be able to have another go. We want to avoid that, and the best way to avoid it is to recognise exthat what the white races of Europe need more than anything else is an opportunity to live in peace and harmony with each other, so that each may extend the liberty which it now enjoys. If by any means we can arrive at an understanding with Germany, and thus stop the awful holocaust which is now proceeding, the sooner we do, so the better. No man who is a lover of his kind can view the position today without grave qualms as to the future. After all, when thp war is over what shall we have to show for it ?",64

In another place a similar motion was submitted by one of the with Royalty.

But. here the position is quite different. day? Nothing has caused my blood to boil more than some of the statements which"" have been made in this chamber to-night. We have read a lot ahout the Germans - and the use they make of poison gas; but use was made of mustard gas today iwhen the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Wallace) was speaking. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) asked us why we had entered this war. Why did we enteT it? Because of the call of the Empire. The response which was made to that call was really marvellous. When w© us entered the struggle, was there one fhan either in this chamber or elsewhere who raised his voice against the proposal the of the Government to raise troops to send to the aid of the Old Country? I do not is an know of one. When the boys came forward, honourable members helped to cheer use them on their way. Are their sacrifices to be in vain? Are we now to be told that all the sacrifices which have been that the made are to be null and void?

315,Mr BRENNAN,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,I have no connection,65
316,Mr GREGORY,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I have said that we have the enemy within our gates. There are disloyalists in Australia. Who can speak of "" the clean living German "" to Has there been throughout this war any atrocity too vile, any outrage too abominable, for these barbarians to commit? I have read most carefully all -« the reports which have come from Belgium and from the North of France, and in this connection we have to recollect that the Germans were represented at the Hague Convention. They helped to frame rules which were intended to mitigate the evils resulting from war. But have they proved themselves opponents in whose word we can place any reliance? Were Ehey not committed to upholding the neutrality of Belgium? How did they respect their word? Reference has been made to the action of the Germans in connection with their peace proposals to Russia. Then we cannot forget the awful tribulations that have been endured by those who have been cast a d r if t on the ocean as the result of German submarine attacks on merchant shipping. If one-half, or even one-third, of what we have read, be true, it is surely impossible for us toleave these people with their controlling power.",65
317,Mr FALKINER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Thei r attacks have been upon all classes.,66
318,Mr GREGORY,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Yes . To-day we find that the British sailor refuses even to allow his representatives to travel in connection with Peace Conferences. bitterness is the result of the awful trials endured by those who' have been cast a d r if t on the ocean from steam-ships and sailing vessels. We all recall the atrocities committed by the enemy in Belgium, where houses were burned, old men, women, and children massacred, and young women outraged'. When the Germans took Antwerp they promised that the Belgians could return to that city, and that no harm would befall them. But in district after district adult male inhabitants have been bundled into cattle trucks, and taken away in order that they might be forced to assist in making munitions to be used against their own k it h and k in . The blood of those who have made the supreme sacrifice cries aloud, not for peace, but for vengeance. I do not say that we want vengeance, but we must be quite satisfied that when peace is made the people who have shown the lust of barbarians will not be able to again bring the same devastation upon the world for generations to come.",66
319,Mr BRENNAN,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,That is the same old story that is heard in connection with every war. It is the same old futile business.,66
320,Mr GREGORY,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"We may have heard these things before, but I am quite satisfied that never before have there been so many traitors in the community as there are today. At the outset of this war not a member of this House was opposed to our entering it . Since then the conditions have absolutely changed. We have seen since then what the Germans are prepared to do. We have learned what we should have to face if Germany secured the victory. Humanity, Democracy, even civilization, are at stake! As the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) has pointed out, the Germans today are in possession of nearly the whole of Belgium, the northern part of France, a large part of It a l y , and the whole of Servia. They have smashed Roumania and have destroyed Russia. If in such circumstances we made peace with her, should we not leave her the dominant power, free to force her will on the whole world? If we had peace today, would, not the German authorities be able to tell their people that they were the victors ? From a military stand-point they are the victors today.",66
321,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,That is encouraging This the enemy.,66
322,Mr GREGORY,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"If the honourable member would encourage our people as I endeavour to encourage them there would be little cause for complaint so far as our part in the war is concerned. If I were in control I would close down Parliament, and, so to speak, "" make things h u m . "" I would see that Australia did its duty, and, if it were necessary, would require even old men like myself to go to the Front. In this war', as I have said, Democracy is at stake. I invitehonorable members, opposite, who talk of making peace with Germany, to read Bernhardi's book, and particularly those passages in which the writer points to the growing power of trade unionism in Germany, and what he describes as their adhesion to the socialistic clique. He clearly and distinctly declares that if the trade unions continue on that course they must be suppressed'. Would the Labour party care to have in operation here today German domination of that kind ? What would become of the liberty we enjoy today if Germany were in control? Not only Democracy, but the futur e of humanity is at stake. Some sixteen years ago when Germany with other countries, sent troops to China to suppress the Boxer rebellion, the Kaiser told his men to emulate the barbarian At t i l a , and so to treat the Chinese that for the future a Chinaman would not dare to look askance at a German. He told them to show no quarter. Then again, for the last thirt y years the German professors have been teaching the doctrine of might.",66

325,Mr BRENNAN,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,I was not referring to the honourable member.,67
326,Mr GREGORY,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Surely we have something to fight for . Por over a hundred years now Australia has been free of the fear of a foreign 'foe landing on her shores. Then again, consider for a moment the wonderful response that has been made to the call of the Empire. Throughout this vast Empire of ours the response has been marvellous, and particularly in South A f r i c a, where only a few years ago the people were at death grips with the British. The glorious response which the South A f r i c a n Dominion has made to the call of Empire bears tribute to the magnificent ideals of those who control the Empire's destiny. Consider for a moment what is happening today in that great home of Democracy, the United States of America. We cannot forget how long America held out. We all remember the speech made by President Wilson, in which he declared that America was too proud to fight. But the German outrages became so intense that the people of the United States realized at last what their f u t u r e might be if Germany won this war. Honourable members opposite should not lose sight of the response which Labour leaders in the United States made to the appeal to them. They have realized what a German victory would mean to Democracy, and they have unanimously told President. Wilson that they are anxious to give every assistance possible to bring the war to a speedy and successful issue. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) asked what hope we had of imposing a peace upon Germany. What would be the position if Germany imposed a peace upon us?

330,Mr GREGORY,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"The honourable mem- ber's friends in Russia have taken up an attitude which I do not wish to see here. It would not be good for us any more than it would be good for Britain, America, or indeed civilization generally. It is necessary that we should push this war to a victorious conclusion. About a year ago the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) put forward certain peace proposals, and a society, of which - he was a member, declared tnat the people should be consulted by referendum before we entered any war. That was his position at that time. Would such a thing be possible today? A r e we going to settle the war by referendum or by peace talk? Are we going to allow Germany to be the dominant power? I hold that we must be in the dominant position, and that once we have secured it , it will be time for us to talk about terms. This motion should be carried with absolute unanimity, as it was this afternoon in another place. I can hardly believe that honourable members opposite, with one or two exceptions, are voicing their own opinions when they suggest that the amendment should be carried, I hope the amendment will be withdrawn, and that we shall be able to tell those who are fighting for us at the Front that the motion was carried unanimously in both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament. ' Mr MAXWELL . (Fawkner) [10.9] I agree with an honourable member of the Opposition who has said that in order that this question might be fitly debated we should have had time for preparation. As it is, all that one can do is to give spontaneous expression, to one's feelings on the subject. From my point of view, it is absolutely astounding that there should be in this House a single discordant note with regard to the motion proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). Honourable members, perhaps, have not had an opportunity to consider its terms. It was read at the outset of the debate, but I did not quite grasp its,purpor t u n t i l I obtained a typewritten copy. It reads as follows: That this House records its unbounded admiration of the heroic efforts of the Allied Armies on the Western Front, its pride in the valour and achievements of the Australian troops, and its firm intention to fight on to secure a victorious peace and the freedom of the world. Having regard to the fact that we have >jeen fighting for nearly four years in the cause thai, we espoused in August, 1914, it seems almost incredible that a single member of this i'arliament should say that he is unable heartily to subscribe to o the terms of that motion. able member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson), for instance, says that he has no objection to a "" peace with victory,"" but objects to a ""victorious peace."" I cannot see the difference. He recognises that we cannot get a peace that is worth anything unless we first secure victory, and that is all we are asking for . I am exceedingly sorry that the debate should have disclosed the fact that every speaker opposed to the motion has come from the opposite the House. That is' most regrettable. The Leader of the Opposition. (Mr . Tudor) has just left, but it is exceedingly mercially and militarily. significant that he has preserved an unimplicit broken silence during the debate, espemilitary power. cially when one remembers that the selves Labour party came into power a month after the war was declared.

346,Mr FENTON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Do you not think that a nation which believes that other nations .are trying to crush it out of existence likely to fight to the end?,70
347,Mr MAXWELL,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"That is not our lads business. We can judge of Germany's tentions only by her acts. One honorlowed able member to-night lauded German statesmenship, generalship, and organizapersuasion tion. Certainly these qualities are to admired in the highest degree, but the honourable member forgot to point out that Germany's humanity is the humanity of of peace. the savage, and that vitiates all her other qualities. In proportion to the excellence of her generalship, statesmanship, organization, she is all the more dangerous because of her worship of brute force. Why. should we in this House refuse a of tribute to our brave fellows at the Eront? Why not let us be unanimous, and say that we desire a victorious peace, inasFront, much as we were at one at the beginning of the war, and have not changed our minds any more than has Germany. Until we have made our strength felt such an extent that Germany relinquishes her ambition, it is of no use our proposing to discuss terms of peace.",70
348,Mr JH CATTS,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Does not the honornations able member think that it would have been fair to have consulted this side the House regarding a resolution that might have been agreed to unanimously ?,70
349,Mr MAXWELL,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Suppos e that that course would have been better, is that reason why, on a matter of national portance, we should not be unanimous? This motion, I am sure, will secure the t support of a certain proportion'of honorof able members on the Opposition side; why should it not be supported by all? - It must have struck some honourable members to-night that while we, are talking the and indulging in a good deal of cheap hilarity our boys are dying. At the very moment that we are occupying our seats in this House our soldiers may be looking game is up, death in the face ",70
350,Mr FINLAYSON,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,We cannot forget,70
351,Mr MAXWELL,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I would to God that more people would think of it and act accordingly; but, however that may be, why cannot we, in the meantime, sink our differences? Whatever may be our views with regard to the ultimate form is which the terms of peace should take, why should we not close up our ranks and express unanimously our admiration of the at the Eront and our firm determinaintion to pursue the policy we have folfrom the beginning without wavering until the end. That end must be the of Germany by our superior be strength that the doctrine of force cannot succeed, and when that is achieved we shall be in a position to make terms",70
352,Mr JOWETT,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Grampians) [10.30] After such an eloquent defence of the and motion by the honourable member for .Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), I would not have intruded upon this House, except to make an appeal to my friend the Leader the Opposition (Mr Tudor) and my other friends on the other side of the House-for with Australian soldiers and British soldiers fighting together at the we are all friends and one people here to-night-to withdraw their opposition, and allow the motion to be carried unanimously and with the same applause to that greeted a similar motion in another Chamber today. I venture to say that if this motion were submitted in any legislative chamber of any of the great Allied whose sons are fighting side by side with our sons, it - would be carried of unanimously and with enthusiastic applause. I ask my honourable friends opposite what is there in the latter part of the motion to which any man can reasonably take exception, and I urge them not to any place any stigma upon this Chamber and imthe whole of Australia by' refusing to carry it unanimously. What are the words to which exception, could be taken ?That this Houserecords its unbounded admiration of the heroic efforts of ""the Allied armies on the Western Front, its pride in the valour and achievements of the Australian troops, and its firm intention to fight on to secure a victorious peace and the freedom of the world. While perhaps it might have been better if the Leader of the Opposition had been consulted with regard to its terms, the motion itself was put before the House with the best possible intention and without the remotest idea that it would create any discord. Why, then, has discord arisen ? Possibly if my friend, the honourable member for Eawkner, had been asked to d r a f t the motion, or if I , or the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson), had been intrusted with this task, we might each of us have used different words; but we could not have employed language more appropriate to the occasion than is contained in the motion before the House. Because we may quarrel about a phrase, and differ about a word or two, I urge honourable members opposite not to allow any stigma to be placed upon the loyal and patriotic people of Australia by taking a vote upon such a question as this. I beseech, therefore, the Leader of the Opposition to secure the withdrawal of the amendment, so that the motion may be carried unanimously.",70
353,Mr LISTER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Corio) [10.35] - The question which has been coursing through my mind more than anything else isWhither are we drifting? I find it exceedingly difficult to express my opinion regarding the opposition to 1flie motion. It is extremely painful to me to think that the time has arrived when it is necessary for a returned soldier to stand up and defend the men who have made the name of this land of ours ring with credit and honour throughout the world, but I feel that I would be recreant to my duty to those men were I to allow such deliberate insults as have been hurled at them to pass unnoticed. I regard the references that have been made to the men who have been, and are still, fighting for us as an insult to them. The question has been asked, "" Why a victorious, peace? Why not an honourable peace?"" I say that no peace can be honourable to Australia that is not victorious. To-day there is proceeding in a southern State a battle in the political arena, and although our nation is at war we hear nothing about an honourable peace there. On the contrary, each party is striving for victory. Likewise, the men who lef t these shores in 1914 with the fixed determination to' secure victory are as determined today as ever they were. This House does those men no credit by discussing such *an amendment as has been proposed. I am not surprised it was introduced, nor am I surprised at the source from which it emanated, because since I have been in fchis chamber I have found that a section here has given evidence of disloyalty, and this amendment, as far as I can see, is another evidence of it .",71
354,Mr BKENNAN,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I rise, Mr Speaker, to BUggest that the offensive words, containing an allegation of disloyalty against members of this Chamber, be withdrawn.",71
355,Mr SPEAKER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I did not catch the words to which the honourable member for Batman refers, and I ask him to indicate what words he desire's to have withdrawn.",71
356,Mr BRENNAN,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"The allegation of disloyalty, Mr Speaker, which, I . think, is sufficient warrant to require withdrawal.",71
357,Mr LISTER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"If I have made any statement which should not have been uttered, I will withdraw it , but before I resume my seat I am going to inquire into the loyalty of the honourable member, and others too, in this chamber, and perhaps I will prove my case in a way they will .not like.",71
358,Mr TUDOR,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"We are more loyal than you, who were fighting a man while he was away. You are a nice sort of man to talk like' that.",71
359,Mr LISTER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"I remember that at the close of last session some sarcastic references were made by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) to the "" imported."" element in this Chamber. Well, I am an importation. I am an Englishman, and I am not ashamed of it ; and, what is more, I am a better Australian than any of those eligible men who are sitting on the opposite side, because I have proved it . I have been in Australia more than two-thirds of my life.",71

362,Mr LISTER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"But he is going to be given an opportunity to secure one. A more 'disgraceful insult could not be offered, not only to our troops, but also to their relatives, than to ask that the sacrifices that they have made should be made in vain. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) said this afternoon that the people who advocated war most were those who were not prepared to go away and fight. am as much a man of peace as any honourable member. I do not like war. No Australian soldier-in fact, no soldierbikes war, but this war was forced upon us; we were forced into war in order to defend our honour, and wewould indeed be dishonourable had we stepped aside and held up our hands, and cried, ' ' Peace at any price."" At this late hour, I do not intend to detain the House, but I want to say that I have had twenty-five months' service in the Australian Imperial Porce, that I am in better health now than I have ever been since my return, that the pledge that I gave«to my country in 1914 stands today, and that ' I am willing to go back if necessary and do my "" b it . "" Therefore, I challenge honourable members in this House, no matter on what side fchey may sit, who are eligible, to go down to the recruiting office with me tomorrow morning, and offer their services fco their country. Some honourable members have said they do 'not believe in fighting. We heard to-night the remark of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), who said that if he was confronted with an enemy, he would not pull a trigger. I am not going to ask him to pull a trigger; but I am going to ask the gentleman who believes so much in peace, and who desires that this war shall be brought to a speedy termination, as we all do, to go along with me and volunteer to take up the other end of a stretcher. I am prepared fco do my little bit, and if he is a man he will offer his services.",71
363,Mr MAHONY,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,He was down to that office on a previous occasion.,72
364,Mr LISTER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"On this occasion, he will find he will have a different person to accompany him. It is criminal for members of Parliament, who are supposed to be in telligent men, to be engaged in a controversy of this kind under existing circumstances. If a man cannot fight, he ought to be able to sacrifice some of his time, his energy, or his ability in procuring the necessary help for our men overseas. Thafc remark applies to every ineligible man in this Chamber, or in any other legislative body in Australia. Tnere was never a greater need for reinforcements than exists today. If we recognise our duty to our men overseas, we must fulfil our pledge to them. We I hear a great deal of talk about broken pledges. I know of no pledge more binding on the people of Ausfcarlia, or on honourable members in this House, than that which was given to me and my comrades when we left the shores of .this continent in .the early stages of the war; and I appeal fco every man, irrespective of his politics, fco concentrate the whole of his energies in securing, as far as he possibly can, the necessary numbers to re-inforce our brave lads overseas.",72
365,Mr BRENNAN,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Batman) (10.47) I have listened with great interest to the observations of the honourable member, and I regret that I cannot accept his in vitation, because from my knowledge of him, I feel that if I should accompany him to the field of battle, he might do the double upon me, as he did to another honourable member of this House, and retur n to Australia in time to occupy, on the strength of his doubtful valour, my seat in this Chamber. I feel I cannot trust myself to the kind consideration of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister). I wish to address a few words to the amendment, because of some sentences which occurred in the speeches of the honourable members for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) and Grampians (Mr Jowett). The latter honourable member says that we should not worry ourselves about a phrase bufc should heartily endorse the motion as it stands, without amendment. I should like the House to understand that I do not speak now, and I did not speak earlier, because of any cavilling at phraseology. There is much more than a phrase involved in the amendment, as also in the declarationfchafcwe must continue the war until we have obtained victory as it is understood by honourable members on that side, and as it has been more than once expressed in the incitements to kill contained in speeches made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). The honourable member for Fawkner drew a picture of what is taking place on the other side of the world, while we are sitting here, and it was a faithful picture. It was a picture of facts which have moved me to say what I have said on other occasions in this House, and what I have said today, and which I will continue to say in scorn of consequence and in the face of there heing attributed to me the basest motives, and being addressed to methe most vulgar personal .abuse by honourable members opposite. I appreciate the picture drawn by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell). see in my mind's eye what is taking place on the other side, and what our sons and brothers are suffering there; and in those circumstances, in'view of the fact that there has been opened up to the Allies the possibility of entering into a discussion of the terms of peace on the basis appropriate to civilized peoples, we are no longer justified in thrusting aside an opportunity of this kind. Our difficulty arises from the state of mind disclosed by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). The honourable member makes the claim that we must be the dominant people. It is just this arrogant claim, so often made by our jingoes and by the junkers of the enemy, that lies at the very basis of war generally, and certainly at the root of the present conflict. Let us discontinue all useless incitements to hatred and revenge. When I am asked what we may do - as we were asked by the Minister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook)-I that what I would do in the present circumstances to promote peace in the world would be this: We in this Chamber are not fighters. We are, at least, not fighting; none of us can claim that he is. We are in a debating chamber. We ar,e members of a Parliament whose business it is to deliberate. We pursue a peaceful occupation. We occupy comfortable positions; we are substantially rewarded. In these circumstances it behoves us to do something more than indulge in mere idle incitements to hatred d revenge. If we would employ our talents to promote a better feeling, if we would employ our skill to the fearless and courageous uncloaking of our own faults and the equally fearless discovery of merits on the part of those opposed to us, then we would be moving a long distance in the direction of a permanent peace. The honourable member for Fawkner asks, ""Must we go cap in hand to Germany?"" Mr Brennan.",72
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Will Germany stop fighting while we talk peace?,73
367,Mr BRENNAN,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"My answer to that is that the reason I have made an emphatic declaration for a peace movement in this House today, the reason why, for the first time, the question of peace has been discussed in this Chamber after nearly four years of fighting, is the important fact that overtures for peace have I been made by the enemy. An honourable member puts it that this has been by one section only. I repeat that overtures have been made by the enemy Governments. Surely I need not inform honourable members' minds of those deliberate representations. Surely honourable members' memories are not so. short that they have forgotten the headings which appeared in some of our own newspapers. I recall one, namely, "" Britain slams the door."" I remember the words in the Herald. That was in response to those overtures. Therefore there is no need to go cap in hand to Germany to enter into negotiations for peace. We have only to say that the enemy, having opened up negotiations for peace, it behoves us not to i wait an instant longer without putting them to the test, with a view to discover precisely what her proposals are.",73
368,Mr WEBSTER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Russi a did that.,73
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,May I remind the honourable member that two months acjo reply Mr Lloyd George laid down a basis for peace as far as we were concerned ?,73
370,Mr BRENNAN,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,Tb e honourable member is right; and a better basis than hitherto.,73
371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"An infinitely better proposal ,tban any that Germany has ever made.",73
372,Mr BRENNAN,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,But not greatly different. I remind the right honourable gentleman of the high ideals which were laid down by the Labour party after the war began ; the high ideals which were an first prescribed by the Allied Governments; those high ideals of right against might; those noble ideals formulated for the protection of the weak against the strong; and all those other high ideals which inspired the peoples of the 'Allies to enter into this contest. Since that time we have in some vital particulars varied our demands and shifted our objections. That has been illustrated in this chamber today.,73
373,Mr JH CATTS,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"It has caused a groat deal of confusion with the general public, too.",74
374,Mr BRENNAN,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"The member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) has spoken of our ideals and of the sufferings of our troops. Did they suffer, and are they suffering in order that we may add tbese miserable clods of earth on the South Pacific to our territory? Did honourable members read 'that wantonly extravagant article of abuse in this morning's Argus in which the Labour party and everybody associated with it wero abused and accused of gross disloyalty, because they dared to say that we were justified in bringing this war to an end without adding to our territories in the manner indicated?",74
375,Mr SPEAKER,TBEACHEEOUS KHEDIVE LOSES HIS THRONE,"Order . I am afraid the honourable member is wandering away somewhat from the amendment. Mr BRExTNAN - I will endeavour to concentrate upon the matter, Mr . Speaker. Mr Born - What would you do if you were assailed by two burglars? ' Mr BRENNAN - In such circum.stances, I dare say I would consider discretion the better part of valour-that is, if confronted by two burglars. would resist to the limits of my power if I were assailed with a chance of success; and I repeat that all we as a debating Chamber can do; all that we as members of the Commonwealth Parliament can do, as persons not i nvested with the duty of is but deliberating. ' to endeavour to put the international position so fairly and dispassionately that sane views will permeate into enemy countries and lead to reciprocity, and ultimately, and very shortly, bring the war to an end. a thing, of course, appears quite impos-. sible to the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald), whose splenetic outbursts against .honourable members on this Bide are just on a parallel with his insatiable international bigotry. Such an attitude of mind brooks no argument or answer. nilr. JOSEPH COOK - Whil e this leaven 'is working, in the meantime, what? Nothing T mr. BRENNAN - I have sufficiently trespassed on"" your goodness, Mr Speaker, in the matter of answering interjections, and I think I have answered them sufficiently. [133] This amendment is not a mere phrase. I wish to Bay. with great deliberation and without passion that it is honourable about time that the word "" victory "" was abolished from our vocabulary in connection with the war. We can only judge of the future by having regard to the past; we can only tell what will happen as to the future peace of the world by a reference to the past. If we examine history with even moderate attention to fact and detail, we must be satisfied with"" the one outstanding circumstance that no permanent peace was ever brought about by force of arms, and, we may assume, never will be.' Force of arms has sown the seeds of future wars. That was so at Jena, when it was thought that permanent peace would be secured by foroe of Napoleon's sword. That French victory was the very foundation of. Prussian militarism. In 1870, again, when the Prussians crushed the French, they merely founded a party of revenge in France, which has been one of t i e ministering causes of the present world war. I am glad that this amendment has been moved, and I shall give it my heartiest support: I am also glad that the few remarks I uttered at the beginning of the debate have led to such a clarifying disBut I cussion on a subject as grave and important as could engage the mind of the world today.
