1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 2 pm and read prayers. REMEMBRANCE DAY: 90TH NA,17
2,Mr RUDD,ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMISTICE," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: today the Leader of the Opposition and I attended the Remembrance Day commemoration activities at the Australian War Memorial. I believe it is important for the parliament to reflect on Remembrance Day, this being the 90th anniversary of the Armistice. It is important for the parliament to reflect the extent of Australian casualties in the First World War-casualties which, as I reflected this morning, are mind numbing in their dimensions. There were 60,000 Australian dead and 150,000 Australians wounded in the First World War. The implications and the impact which that had on families and communities across Australia were profound and continue to be profound. As we gathered again today, we had the opportunity to meet with the families of some of the more recently fallen. This was a moving occasion for us all. It reminds us afresh of the continuing service of our men and women in uniform. It reminds us afresh of the fact that there is no higher calling in Australia than to wear the uniform of our nation. It reminds us afresh of the fact that we have our troops still in harm's way in many theatres around the world. Also on this, the 90th anniversary of the Armistice, it is important for us as a parliament to reflect again publicly on our friends and allies with whom we have fought for the better part of a century in so many theatres around the world-in difficult theatres and in dark days for our nation and, indeed, in dark days for the world. It is, furthermore, important for the parliament to reflect on the significance of the Armistice and its aspirations for the peace of the world. We know from the history of the 20th century that the aspirations for peace following the Armistice of 1918 were not realised, that within a generation the world was again at war. Again, following the Second World War, since 1945, peace has not been the order of the day. I think that if those whose names we revere and honour as we walk through the corridors of the War Memorial-and see their names inscribed in the Hall of Honourhave one message for us all today it is not simply to remember their sacrifice, which we must do; it is not simply to honour their on heroism, which we must do; it is also to hear their voice to us today telling us to be ever vigilant, not just in the defence of the nation but in the prosecution of peace. There is nothing more horrific for any nation, any community or any family than the direct experience of war. Let us resolve afresh as a parliament to maintain the vigilance which they would expect of this generation of Australians, but to be equally vigilant in the prosecution of peace.",17
3,Mr TURNBULL,ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMISTICE," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I wish to associate the opposition with the remarks of the Prime Minister and compliment him on his very eloquent address at the Remembrance Day ceremony at the War Memorial. When we look back on the First World War at the scale of the casualties the horror is mind boggling-almost beyond our comprehension. The numbers were staggering in a world, a society, much greater than the country from which those brave fallen men came. We contemplate an Australia a quarter the size of what it is today in population and then the horror of Fromelles, that most cataclysmic of Australian military campaigns, where 5,533 Australians would die between one nightfall and the next. It was possibly the worse 24 hours in our nation's history. We think of the mighty struggles undertaken and the thousands of men whose lives were lost to gain a few metres ground, only to lose it again. We think of Villers-Bretonneux, the village where Australian and French forces had to fight literally door-to-door to drive their enemy into retreat. And we think of the 1,200 ANZACs who died to rescue that village, to liberate it, three years to the day after the landing at Gallipoli. Over 320,000 Australians volunteered for the First World Warthis from a nation of five million. There were 61,000 killed and 155,000 wounded. ‘There were so many of them but we never saw them,' wrote Les Carlyon in The Great War, his epic study of the Australian deployment to the Western Front. We never really knew them, or perhaps never knew enough about their lives or deaths. What we have are memories: faded photographs, bits and pieces brought back from the war. Perhaps the one war relic that is most evocative for me is a German button brought back by my grandfather. He no doubt found it on the battlefield. I remember it has written on it ‘Gott mit uns': God with us. I wonder sometimes whether that was a proud boast by the aggressor nation saying, ‘God is on our side and not on the side of our opponents,' or whether it was perhaps just a prayer-a silent prayer every day as that soldier buttoned up his greatcoat, hoping that God was indeed with him in the horror of the trenches and indeed with the men he was fighting against on the other side. The Prime Minister spoke today about peace, and that of course is what we must never lose sight of. I am reminded too of Psalm 34, where King David wrote, ‘Seek peace and pursue it'. It is not enough just to look for it or be aware of the virtues of peace, to be in favour of peace; we must pursue it. In that passage, in the original Hebrew, ‘pursue' means relentlessly, tirelessly chasing, with the passion of the hunter. That is the challenge that comes to leaders in every age: not simply to be vigilant, not simply to stand up for peace, not simply to seek it, but to chase after it, to pursue it relentlessly, tirelessly, with all our heart. NA Economy",17
4,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the government's unlimited deposit guarantee and its consequences: the frozen savings of hundreds of thousands and indeed the hundreds of car dealers that are struggling to finance the sale of automobiles. I ask the Prime Minister: does he take any responsibility for today's collapse in business confidence, or is it, like all bad news, somebody else's fault?",18
5,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Firstly, on the question of business confidence, business confidence is bad here as it is in practically every other developed economy in the world. If you look at the surveys of business confidence in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, Germany and Italy, as produced in the relevant indices, you will see they are all heading downwards, and that is because of the global financial crisis. The global financial crisis has impacted on global financial markets, which have in turn affected equity markets, which have in turn affected property markets, which have in turn affected the real economy and jobs. Businesses looking at these developments around the world have become pessimistic about the possibility of investment and growth. The key challenge in responding to that is to ensure that, first of all, we maintain the stability of the Australian financial system. The stability of the Australian financial system was underpinned by the two bank guarantees which we delivered about a month ago-and we did so, I understand, with the complete, bipartisan support of the opposition on that occasion, but I am not so sure that that is the case today. It seems to be a case of their agreeing one day and then disagreeing the next-not looking at what the opposition say but in fact what they then do. They say that they are bipartisan but then, if you look at what they do the next day, they seek to undermine that bipartisanship. These are tough and difficult economic times, but what is required is, firstly and fundamentally, the stability of the Australian financial system; secondly, governments around the world putting their shoulder to the wheel and supporting appropriate fiscal and economic stimulus for the economies; and, thirdly, governments around the world cooperating on a new regulatory arrangement for the financial systems which landed us in this difficulty in the first place. That is very the charge which this government has taken on. It is a charge which the government will prosecute into the future. There will be difficult times ahead, not just for Australia but the rest of the world, but we are determined to act and determined to continue to take all necessary action to ensure that we can do everything possible to support positive growth in this economy in the future, when the rest of the world is already experiencing the ravages of global economic recession. Economy",18
6,Mr DANBY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline the importance of the government's Economic Security Strategy as part of Australia's response to the global financial crisis?,19
7,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. The key challenge is what governments do around the world in support of fiscal measures and broader economic measures to support growth at a time when the International Monetary Fund tells us that global economic recession is looming across the major economies. If we look across the world at the stimulus packages which have been embraced by various economies, we begin to see evidence of governments rising to this challenge and taking appropriate action. Yesterday I made reference to the stimulus package which has been embraced by the government of China. Upon further examination of the detail of that package, this is a major package indeed, one of relevance not just to us but also to the wider region and to the world economy. I support fully the actions taken by the Chinese government, obviously, mindful of their domestic circumstances but, I believe, equally mindful of the importance of their growth to the wider regional and global economy. This is an impormuch tant economy for Australia-important given the extent to which our external account and our trade account are dependent on future access to Chinese markets and the sale of for Australian goods and services into that market. We will continue to work as closely as possible with our friends in China to ensure that we maintain maximum access to those markets in the future. It is of relevance to Australia, of relevance to jobs in Australia, of relevance also to our future prosperity. Fiscal stimulus action has of course been taken elsewhere in the world as well. You see large fiscal stimulus packages in Germany, ¼ ELOOLRQ LQ WKH 8QLWHG 6WDWHV 86 billion; in Japan, something approaching ¥40 trillion; and, in Korea, $10.98 billion or KRW14 trillion. You see governments around the world embarking on fiscal stimulus packages, as we have done in Australia. It is important for the government of Australia to embark upon a war against unemployment because if we look at what is happening around the world we see rising jobless data in many of the developed economies. Unemployment in the United States is already running at 6.5 per cent; in the UK, 5.7 per cent; in France, eight per cent; in Germany, 7.5 per cent; and it is rising in other economies as well. That is why we have embraced an Economic Security Strategy, a stimulus package of some $10.4 billion, and that is why we believe it is necessary in our current circumstances to support growth but also to support jobs. That package of $10.4 billion, we are advised, will help to create up to 75,000 additional jobs over the coming year. It is a $10.4 billion package aimed at helping to create up to 75,000 additional jobs over the coming year. On top of that, the government announced yesterday a long-term strategy of $6.2 billion in support for the Australian automobile industry. This industry already directly generates a large number of jobs. If you add the indirect generation of unemployment, there are some 200,000 jobs in Australia dependent on the future success and transformation of that industry. That is the second step that we have embarked upon. The third step, of course, lies in what we will do on infrastructure. Infrastructure investment, both through the Building Australia Fund and more broadly, is very much on this government's agenda and has been from day one. Infrastructure investment, investment in the future of our auto industry and investment through the payment systems we have provided to families and pensioners for the future as well are designed to underpin growth and jobs growth into the future-all part of this government's war on unemployment-and that is something we need to embrace more fully.",19

9,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Those opposite seem to think that this is unimportant.,20
10,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left will come to order!,20
11,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I regard war on unemployment as the government's highest priority. Those opposite, presumably, would have us stand idly by as the world at large experiences increased unemployment. Mr Ciobo interjecting",20
12,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, the member for Moncrieff!",20
13,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This government will not stand idly by. It will take necessary action through an economic stimulus strategy and necessary action through our automobile strategy and infrastructure strategy, and we are doing these measures in addition to what is already equivalent to a two per cent interest rate fall in recent months-a two per cent interest rate fall which, if you have an average mortgage of some $251,000, results in a $314 a month reduction in your mortgage. Mr Haase interjecting Mr Ciobo interjecting",20
14,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, the member for Kalgoorlie and the member for Moncrieff!",20
15,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite catcall because they obviously do not believe it is necessary for government to act on supporting the economy and supporting jobs in the face of a global financial crisis and in the face of the global economic downturn which flows from the crisis. This government has a course of action for the future. This is the strategy that we are embarked upon and the government remains determined to take whatever additional action is necessary for the future in order to support the economy, to support growth and to support jobs. It is a responsible course of action for the future and I ask those opposite to join us in a bipartisan spirit. I ask those opposite not simply to say one day that they offer the government bipartisan support and then the next day seek to undermine it. Mr Haase interjecting",20
16,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, the member for Kalgoorlie!",21
17,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It would be useful for the first time in recent times for the opposition actually do what they say, because this nation looks on all of us to provide leadership through what is a period of great economic challenge flowing to our economy off the back of a global economic and financial crisis.",21

19,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! While I have a slight semblance of control of the House, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the Republic of Kenya led by the Speaker of the National Assembly, the Hon. Kenneth Marende. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Economy",21
20,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. How does it improve business confidence around Australia to have a New South Wales Labor government that is dumping infrastructure projects, sacking employees, increasing taxes and running the biggest budget deficit in 15 years? Does the Prime Minister agree with his own finance minister that the future of the New South Wales economy will ‘depend on what we do'? Does he agree that the Rudd government now owns the New South Wales economy?",21
21,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This government has embarked upon a course of action which does not simply perpetuate the blame game of the past. This government believes that when it comes to the nation's future challenges you work with state and territory governments, Labor and Liberal. We intend to work as closely with the state government of New to South Wales as we will do with the state government of Western Australia. The state government of Western Australia has an interest when it comes to the future-it is in how we partner with them in infrastructure investments-and that is the interest of all responsible state governments. The difference is this: state governments in the past, when they approached the previous Liberal government for assistance on infrastructure, were simply given the cold shoulder. The previous Liberal government was not interested. The previous Liberal government-and the member for Higgins will recall this very well-said that when it came to infrastructure that was exclusively a state responsibility. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, a point of order that goes to relevance: I asked the Prime Minister whether he will accept responsibility for anything.",21
22,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call and he will respond to the question.,21
23,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for North Sydney's question was about the extent to which Commonwealth governments work or do not work with state governments. I have responded to that question by saying we have an approach on infrastructure. We have an approach when it comes to COAG. We have an approach when it comes to the future of health and education expenditure and we will seek to work cooperatively with the states for the future. What is at stake here is the nation's economy and the national interest in which the states and territories also have a significant part. The other part of responsibility, I would say to the member for North Sydney and to the member for Wentworth, is this: it lies also, at times of global financial crisis, in supporting our major economic and financial regulatory institutions. Once again the Liberal Party has been off the leash today, this time in relation to the Secretary of the Treasury. Comments by Mr Don Randall todayMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance which comes back to the question: will the Prime Minister accept responsibility for anything? He has got a war against everything but no responsibility.",21
24,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. I will listen carefully to the Prime Minister.,22
25,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for North Sydney's question goes to the matter of economic responsibility, and economic responsibility in turn depends on whether you are going to support the independence of the economic institutions of this country, including the Reserve Bank and the Secretary of the Treasury, and including the independence and integrity of the regulators. Once again we have the member for Canning out there today hooking into the Secretary of the Treasury. It says here: When asked about the Secretary of the Treasury the member for Canning says that he is an ‘activist'. It is unusual for a head of the Treasury to behave in this way. He is probably the first show those tendencies. We then go on to the member for O'Connor who goes on to say: What is going on down at the Treasury? John Howard in a conversation going back to the opposition days said to me, ‘If in doubt, take Treasury's advice.' That was because in the past they put policy before politics. They really need to take a close look at themselves. They used to be one department that was held in high regard even in opposition. So today, on this day when the debate on the future of the economy is again central to our concerns in this parliament, we have the attack dogs of the Liberal Party out there attacking once againMr Tuckey interjecting",22
26,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor will not encourage the Prime Minister.,22
27,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,the independence and the integrity of the Secretary of the Treasury. The member for Canning stood up in this place recently-I presume at his own initiative-to recant on his attack on the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Barely a week or two laterMr Sidebottom-I'm the attack dog!,22
28,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I remind the honourable member for Braddon that I might be the attack dog. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The Prime Minister cannot talk about ending the blame game and then use this kind of language in the parliament. He really should be brought",22
29,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Warringah will resume his seat. The question went to the matter of economic responsibility. The Prime Minister will respond to the question. As I said earlier to the member for O'Connor: no further encouragement.,22
30,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again, the member for one to North Sydney's question goes to the matter of economic responsibility, which again hangs on the independence of our regulators and the integrity of those regulators. Our responsibility as the government is to defend the regulators. Those opposite seem to believe it is their mandate to attack the regulators or, as they have done today again, authorise an attack on the regulators. That is what has occurred not just through the member for Canning and not just through the member for O'Connor but also from the member for Goldstein. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order, again on relevance. This matter is no more authorised by the Leader of the Opposition than the Prime Minister authorised the leak to the Australian about George Bush.",22
31,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Warringah will resume his seat. A point of order is not an opportunity to debate or inter- memberrupt.,23
32,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Then we have the member for Goldstein, who is quoted in today's Australian online as saying about Treasury's role in the production of MYEFO documents: It's got the smell of manipulation about it. So we have, therefore, not just the attack dogs from the backbench but the attack dog from the front-bench unleashing on the integrity and the independence of the Secretary of the Treasury. Does the member for Goldstein stand by that attack? Mr Robb interjecting",23
33,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He nods his head. He has accused the Secretary of the Treasury of manipulating MYEFO. This is an extraordinary statement. We had also a report in the Australian newspaper online about what appears to have been an active debate in the Liberal Party party room, because the member for Kooyong told the party room, it is said, to be ‘very, very careful about attacking Treasury or their institutional representatives'. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It goes back to relevanceabout whether the Prime Minister, the guy that wanted the job, will accept responsibility for anything happening in Australia.",23
34,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The Prime Minister will bring his answer to a conclusion.,23
35,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So, on the question of the integrity of the institutions, we have the Leader of the Opposition saying: I've never criticised Dr Henry, and in fact, I spoke about him in such glowing terms yesterday in the house that even his mother would blush. So I have very high regard for Dr Henry. Yet today we have an orchestrated attack by three members of the Liberal Party on the Secretary of the Treasury. Again, with the",23
36,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,23
37,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Has the Prime Minister concluded? Mr Robb interjecting,23
38,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Goldstein has not got the call. Mr Albanese interjecting,23
39,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the House and the member for Goldstein will resume their seats. I think that it would be better if everybody could just calm down slightly and if the Prime Minister would now bring his answer to a conclusion.,23
40,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question for the Leader of the Opposition is not what he says but what he does on the question of the independence of the regulators. The question from the member for North Sydney was about taking responsibility for the economy. I would say this to the member for North Sydney: as Prime Minister of Australia, I take responsibility for the good news and the bad news, and when the bad news comes I will take responsibility for that as well, because what the nation wants is not some political game plan whereby you flick responsibility to someone else all the time-where you flick responsibility to the states and territories. What the nation wants is national leadership in the national interest. What the nation wants is tough decisions in tough nomic times. This government is prepared to take them. Economy",23
41,Ms BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Will the minister update the House on the benefits of recent interest rate cuts and how monetary policy and fiscal policy are working together to help Australia withstand the global financial crisis? Are these policies receiving broad support?,24
42,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. Australia is facing an enormous economic challenge emerging from the flow-on effects of the global financial crisis, and both the government the Reserve Bank have taken strong and decisive action to strengthen growth and support households. Later on today I will be introducing the government's legislation",24
43,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,24
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister for finance will resume his seat. It would assist the proper conduct of the chamber if ministers were at least listened to and half the membership of the chamber did not speak over the ministers. Mrs Moylan-Well, it would be nice if they said something worth listening to.",24
45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Pearce is warned.,24
46,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Later on today I will be introducing the government's legislation to deliver an Economic Security Strategy of substantial one-off payments to pensioners, families, carers and, of course, first home buyers. If the member for Pearce does not find that worth listening to, then I suspect she is in a small minority. These initiatives will strengthen jobs and economic growth and they will help the government to push back against the downward pressures on our ecoeconomy emerging from the international financial crisis. Over its past three meetings the Reserve Bank has cut interest rates by 200 basis points-a full two percentage points reduction in interest rates since September. That means, on average, about $400 per month in relief on interest rates for people with mortgages around $300,000. After years of coping with ever-increasing interest rates under the former government-the government that told Australians they would keep interest rates at record lows-this is welcome relief for homebuyers in Australia. The government guarantee of deposits and wholesale borrowing by banks has also asand sisted. That has been acknowledged both in the Reserve Bank's statement on monetary policy and by the Australian CEOs of both the ANZ Bank and the NAB. They have acknowledged that has helped to put downward pressure on market interest rates as well. I note also that the Chief Executive of the Business Council of Australia, Greg Gailey, wrote to the Prime Minister a few days ago on both of these matters-the Economic Security Strategy and the government's approach to protecting our banking systemsaying: ‘The BCA supported the government's economic security initiative as timely, targeted and temporary. We support the amendments to the deposit and wholesale lending guarantees for the same reasons.' Unfortunately, the support for the government's strategies has not been completely universal. It has been very broad, but it has not been entirely universal. The opposition, on both occasions when these initiatives were announced, stated that it would offer them bipartisan support. But in practice the opposition has done nothing other than attack and undermine and snipe against the government's initiatives. We saw a lot of statesmanlike posturing by the Leader of the Opposition at the time about how he would give all this bipartisan support and so forth but, unfortunately, we cannot trust what the Leader of the Opposition says-we have to watch what he does. He is a very clever politician but, unfortunately, the investment banker gene runs very strong: you spin the story, you do the deal, you take your cut and then you move on-that is the Leader of the Opposition. That is why, in a few short months in the job, he has been against cutting the fuel excise, in favour of cutting the fuel excise and then against cutting the fuel excise. He was against increasing pensions; now he is in favour of increasing pensions. He described the global financial crisis as greatest economic crisis in our lifetimes and then he said that it was being overhyped. That is why we do not take the pious platitudes about bipartisanship all that seriously. Last night the member for Curtin really let the mask slip, because she was on Good News Week-I am not quite sure why but she was on Good News Week: they clearly were a bit light on for talent that week-and she was asked to do a word association test. When the word ‘bipartisanship' was put to her, her response on the spot was ‘Overrated.' I can understand why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would have some problem with copying something the government is doing and not giving credit for it. Given her recent experiences, I can understand why she would have some problem with that, but now today we have seen the consequences from the signal that was given on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition by the deputy leader last night. We have seen it in a coordinated, concerted attack on the Secretary of the Treasury-not a one-off, isolated instance but a coordinated, orchestrated attack on the Secretary of the Treasury by no less than three members of the Liberal Party, one of whom is a senior frontbencher-alleging manipulation of the Treasury forecasts in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, alleging that the Secretary of the Treasury is an activist and alleging that the Treasury has lost all of its credibility and that it should take a close look at itself. That last one, of course, was from the member for O'Connor. There is one honourable, decent person on the opposition benches, and that is the member for Kooyong, who is widely respected in the community on both sides of parliament. You can see why: he understands what is going on here-he realises how appalling this is. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to immediately repudiate these attacks by his the three members on the Secretary of the Treasury and to stick to his statements of 22 October when he indicated the Secretary of the Treasury was held in his highest regard. Diplomatic Protocol",24
47,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the account in the Australian on 25 October of a highly confidential telephone conversation between him and the President of the United States, an account which acclaimed the Prime Minister's diplomatic knowledge as much as it denigrated that of the US President. Given the Prime Minister now says the Australian article was factually wrong, why did he take no steps to correct the record until after the White House took the unprecedented step of expressly rejecting this self-serving story in the Washington Post three days later?",25
48,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. The purpose of my call to the President of the United States was to discuss the importance of the G20. The President was fully aware that was what the conversation was about. We supported the decision by the President to host that meeting, which I will be attending over the course of this weekend-on Saturday. It is an important meeting, it is important for the country's future, and we will be cooperating closely not just with the government of the United States but with other governments on the key challenges on the global agenda, namely, the global financial crisis, global financial regulation and global economic growth. We will get on with the business of conducting what is an appropriate level of policy coordination with our friends and partners. We will do so in the future. It is right course of action and we have our sleeves rolled up and intend to get on with it. Pensions and Benefits",25
49,Ms NEAL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Will the minister outline how the government's Economic Security Strategy will deliver extra support to pensioners, carers and working families and any response to that support?",26
50,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Robertson for her question. As she knows, there are more than 27,000 pensioners and 11,000 families in her electorate who are going to benefit from the government's Economic Security Strategy. Pensioners, carers and disability support pensioners are all going to get a helping hand in the lead-up to Christmas. Four million pensioners, in fact, and 1.9 million families will all get some extra help from the $10.4 billion extra that is going into the economy. This will be $4.8 billion as a down payment on pension reform through lump sum payments to pensioners. That will mean $1,400 each for single pensioners and $2,100 for pensioner couples. It will apply to those on the age pension, disability support pensioners, carer payment recipients, wife and widow pensioners, partners, veterans and self-funded retirees holding a Commonwealth seniors health card. All of these people will receive a payment from 8 December. People who are receiving the carer allowance will also get $1,000 for each eligible person that they are caring for. Unlike those opposite, we will not be pitting pensioner groups against each other. We certainly will not be excluding two million carers, people with disabilities or pensioner couples. We recognise that all of these people are doing it tough. For the first time, disability support pensioners will be getting a lump sum payment. This strategy, which will the be introduced into the parliament this afternoon, will bring new spending on pensioners to $12.3 billion since the last election. As I said before, one of the most important things is that this is a down payment on our pension reforms for the future, intended to provide the additional support that pensioners need and that they have been waiting for for a very long time, in the nine months between now and when long-term reforms are introduced from the next financial year. It is also the case that, as a result of this package, Australian families who are under significant pressure will get some extra help. Families who are receiving family tax benefit part A will get a one-off payment of $1,000 for each eligible child in their care. That will mean extra money for around four million children in Australia before Christmas. There are about 190,000 families with dependent children who receive youth allowance, Abstudy or a benefit from the veterans' children scheme, and they also will receive the $1,000 payment. There have certainly been a lot of groups indicating their support for the government's strategy. The Fair Go for Pensioners Coalition has said that this is very welcome news that builds confidence and security amongst pensioners and seniors. Those from disability organisations have recognised that this is much needed assistance at a particularly vulnerable time for pensioners. They have also said that it goes some way towards addressing the neglect of the previous federal government over the past 10 years. Carers Australia have said that they are very pleased to see that the government has listened and is now taking real action. They also said that this is an important victory for those left out of previous proposals and that this extra money will provide desperately needed relief for Australia's hardest working families. That is certainly the case for those who are doing the very tough job of caring. Of course, the responses that we get from these groups representing carers, people with a disability and families is that they all understand what the government is doing. What is not clear is what the opposition believe. We had the Leader of the Opposition on 14 October saying that the opposition were not going to argue or quibble with the government's proposal. It seems to be the case that the Leader of the Opposition cannot hold onto a position for more than a day and some people say he cannot even hold onto one for an even shorter period than that. But, in this case, on 14 October he was in full support with no quibbling. The next dayMr Hockey interjecting",26
51,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have no idea what the member for North Sydney thinks eitherwhether he supports the proposal or not. One day later the Leader of the Opposition said, ‘We would no doubt have designed it differently.' All we got from the opposition in the past was that they were going to exclude carers, people on the disability support pension and pensioner couples. They will get the opportunity in the House this week to indicate whether or not they are going to support this package. They can either provide the support that families, people on disability support pensions, carers, coupled pensioners and single pensioners need or continue to do what they have been doing and play politics instead of what the government intends to do and provide the support that these people deserve.

53,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister, and I refer to my previous question and his answer. Given that the account of the leak of the telephone conversation with the US President has been published around the world and given the inescapable implication in every publication that the Prime Minister or his office were responsible for that leak, how will the Prime Minister convince world leaders he is a person who can be relied on to keep a conversation confidential when he has repeatedly failed to deny any responsibility for that leak?",27
54,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the part of the question which refers to my conversation with the President of the United States, I would refer the Leader of the Opposition to my earlier answers. On the question of Australia's engagement with the global negotiations leading up to the G20 meeting in Washington and beyond Washington, the government has been engaged for quite some weeks in highlevel coordination with other governments on how we approach the future regulation of the global financial system. We have been doing that at official levels. At present, the Treasurer is in Washington and has just been at a G20 meeting in Sao Paulo in Brazil. The purpose of these meetingsMr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The standing orders require the answer to be relevant to the question that was asked, not the question the Prime Minister would like to ask himself.",27
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,28
56,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable gentleman's question went to the government working with other governments, and that is what I am responding to. It goes to the question of the agenda which is being framed for the G20 meeting in Washington and the intense preparatory work which is underway in relation to that between us and the other governments participating in this meeting. One of the things on the agenda will be the future regulation of the global financial system, and that will also deal with the future, I believe, of executive remuneration and other such considerations. Long term we have to look at appropriate regulation under the Basel arrangements and, beyond that, we also need to look at the capacity for coordinated action on fiscal policy and, where possible, on monetary policy. These are the big agendas for the future. We will be participating in this meeting, as we have been at an officials and a ministerial level in the preparatory meetings. This is important for Australia. We are playing a positive role and will continue to Housing Affordability",28
57,Mr SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Housing. How has the government's decision to boost the first home owners grant been received by the community?,28
58,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to thank the member for Longman for his question. The government recognised the importance of a strong and stable housing market and acted very early and decisively to commit $1½ billion to the first home owners boost. The homeowners boost was increased to $14,000 for existing homes and $21,000 for newly built homes. The increase in the grant has been very well received by the broader community and by the housing industry. The Reserve Bank, in its statement on monetary policy released recently, said that recent falls in interest rates in the fiscal stimulus package, which includes an increase in the first home owners grant for purchases of existing and new dwellings, are expected to boost conditions in this sector in the coming year. On the visits I have made to a number of members' electorates, we have had very good early indications of increased interest in the residential construction area. Recently I visited the member for Longman's electorate and met builders and developers in Caboolture at a meeting that the member for Longman organised. Those builders, developers and others told me that they had certainly seen a lot of renewed interest from first home buyers, particularly in the smaller, more modest homes that they were able to build in some of those areas. I met also with builders, architects and real estate agents in Launceston recently during the visit that the member for Bass organised. Again, they are seeing very high levels of inquiries and certainly a spark of interest. In Seaford Downs in Kingston and Bianco Constructions in do so. Port Adelaide-all these places-our members of parliament have been engaged very actively with constituents in their electorates. Builders, developers and construction supply companies all report increased activity and interest, and we are very hopeful that, over time, this will translate into increased sales. We have seen on the weekend in Sydney reports that Landcom sold 46 house and land packages in Sydney recently, while in the previous nine months activity had been, as they said, dead. More recently one development in Newbury sold seven out of eight available properties in just one weekend. So we are seeing the beginnings of increased interest returning to the market. Many first home buyers are considering bringing forward purchases that they intended to make. We have seen a lot more traffic through places like HomeWorld in Kellyville, the Home Buyer Show in Sydney and in other places. All of them report a degree of increased traffic. In fact, in HomeWorld in Kellyville I spoke to a very lovely young third-generation builder there, Michael King, who told me that his dad and his grandad said to him that they had never seen a quieter time in the building industry. Yet, in the hours after we made our announcement, they were already receiving increased numbers of phone calls and, certainly in the first weekend after the announcement was made, they were seeing a lot more young couples, a lot more people going through looking at his display homes. They are very hopeful that they will see that translate into increased sales. I am very pleased to report that the legislation to support the Economic Security Strategy is being introduced today into the parliament. Diplomatic Protocol",28
59,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer again to the leak to the Australian of the conversation between the Prime Minister and the United States President. I note that, if that conversation were leaked by a public servant other than with the authority of the Prime Minister, this could constitute an offence under section 70 of the Crimes Act and, if by a ministerial staffer, an offence under section 79. I ask the Prime Minister: why hasn't the Federal Police been asked to investigate these leaks? Is it because, in truth, it was the Prime Minister who was the leaker? Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 100(d)(vii) has clearly been breached by the opening half of that question.",29

As I have made clear and the White House has made clear and the US ambassador has made clear, the reported comment was never made and was inaccurate. Any suggestion that the President was not fully aware of the role of the G20 is not accurate. And that has been my position throughout. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: the question related to the Federal Police. The Prime Minister did not even refer to the Federal Police",30

72,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the minister update the House with regard to the government's work in providing stability and certainty for Australian parents particularly in relation to ABC Learning?",30
73,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know that as a representative of a young and growing community she is particularly concerned about the circumstances of childcare provision in her electorate and around the nation. Yesterday I updated the House on the government's response to ABC Learning moving into voluntary administration last week, after which, almost immediately, a receiver was appointed by the creditors of ABC Learning. I take the opportunity to update the House today on some developments that happened yesterday. The government's childcare industry task force yesterday met with the receiver and was updated on the receiver's plans. The receiver of ABC Learning is now undertaking a detailed review of the operational data of each and every ABC Learning Centre. During this period of time the government has been assisted by members of PPB, an insolvency and corporate recovery practitioners firm. Today I can announce, as a consequence of yesterday's discussion between the government's childcare industry task force and the receiver, it has been agreed that government representatives, including members of PPB, the insolvency and corporate recovery practitioners, will be embedded working with the receiver in undertaking this work of a detailed review of the operational data of each and every ABC Learning Centre. Of course, this work is essential and necessary in order to determine the best way forward for all ABC centres. In some cases this may create opportunities for not-for-profit and for-profit entities to operate local childcare centres that were previously operated by ABC but were not viable under the ABC current business model. As members of the parliament would be aware and would have seen media reports in relation to, a number of organisations have already contacted the receiver and others have contacted various arms of government with a view to expressing their interest in potentially buying or otherwise operating individual or a number of ABC Learning Centres. It is important to note that at this stage the receiver expects that most centres will continue to operate into the new year. There is currently no sale process being conducted for ABC assets. However, the receiver will need to be as well informed as possible when making decisions about the future of each centre and the care arrangements for families. Today I can announce that an expression of interest process has commenced to ensure that the receiver has the best available range of options for considering the future operation of ABC Learning Centres. I encourage any parties, be they for profit or not for profit, to register their interest in participathis ing in the future of ABC with the receiver. Once the review process has identified the likely future arrangements for each centre, the receiver, working with the government, will map and sort the registrations of interest against the identified local need. In addition to the registration of interest process, the government and the receiver are continuing to consult with stakeholders with an interest in the provision of early learning and care. The Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Child Care, the member for Bennelong, is also in regular contact with early childhood education and care stakeholders. The member for Bennelong has been involved in discussing and consulting about the government's reform agenda in child care and early learning. Since the election of the government, she has conducted more than 50 stakeholder meetings and visited 25 childcare centres, and quality forums have been conducted in each state and territory. Earlier today, the parliamentary secretary, the member for Bennelong, attended a forum here in Canberra with around a dozen peak national childcare organisations. This forum had been arranged as part of the government's ongoing consultation processes in relation to its reform agenda in child care. Of course, the agenda of the forum included a discussion of the ABC Learning situation. This is a challenging situation for parents, communities, the government and the corporate parties involved. The government will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to maximise certainty and stability in the provision of childcare services because we understand how vital that is for mums and dads around this country. Diplomatic Protocol",30
74,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister deny that he or anyone in office leaked details of the telephone conversation with the United States President to the Australian newspaper?,31
75,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question of my conversation with the President of the United States, the Leader of the Opposition will be aware of my earlier answers-that is, that the purpose of my call to the President of the United States was to discuss the relevance of the G20 to the global financial crisis. Secondly, the President of the United States was entirely aware of the role of the G20. In fact, I would draw the honourable gentleman's attention to a statement. I think I made in this place prior to the publication of the article that he refers to where I said that the G20 meeting was also attended by President Bush, referring to a meeting which the finance minister was attending of G20 finance ministers in Washington. That was attended by the US President at the time. Furthermore, as I have said, and as the White House has said, any suggestion that the reported comment relating to the President of the United States not being familiar with the operation of G20 was never made and was never enacted. Mr Abbott-On a point of order: relevance. The Prime Minister cannot bury this with blather.",31
76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Warringah will resume his seat. Mr Abbott-He has to answer the direct question asked by the Leader of the Opposition.,32
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Warringah is warned. That is not the appropriate manner in which to raise a point of order.,32
78,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That statement was made by me in the parliament prior to the article in Australian appearing. That obviously referred to the President himself attending a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington. What I said in this House prior to that article appearing was that the G20 meeting was also attended by President Bush. I went on to say that the President, together with others, had been providing important leadership in this area by calling for appropriate coordinated international action. That was my view then, it has been my view since then, it was certainly my view following the conversation with President Bush and my view has never changed. Broadband",32
79,Mr DREYFUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. What are the benefits to small business and the service economy of a national broadband network? Are there any alternative policy perspectives on the role of the digital revolution?",32
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before calling the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, I remind the House that I do not look favourably upon the wording used in the second part of the question. It should be more specific.",32
81,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Isaacs for his question and for the opportunity to visit the South East Melbourne Manufacturing Alliance with him in Dandenong, just outside his electorate, before the last federal election, which gave me extra perspectives on the challenges facing small businesses. A high-speed national broadband network will be of particular benefit to small businesses. About 93 per cent of small businesses are connected to the internet. The government's national high-speed broadband network will provide fast broadband services to 98 per cent of Australia. The government the broadband rollout will provide real opportunities for small businesses, especially those in the service economy, to expand into new markets while also keeping upfront costs and risks to a minimum. Ms Marino interjecting",32
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Forrest is warned!,32
83,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"High-speed broadband also provides opportunities to reduce the cost of doing business by cutting administrative costs and increasing productivity through the adoption of new technologies. I was asked about alternative policy perspectives. A speech delivered to the Sydney Institute in 1999 provides such perspectives. The speech says: The fusion of computing and communications, especially through the internet, have broken the bounds of time, cost and distance. I was fascinated to see that this is a perspective shared in its entirety with the United Nations Human development report published in that same year, which said: The fusion of computing and communicationsespecially through the internet-has broken the bounds of time, cost and distance … The speech went on to observe: In biotechnology, the ability to identify and move genetic materials across species types has broken the bounds of nature, creating totally organisms with enormous but unknown implications … Now, the Human development report says: In biotechnology the ability to genetic materials across species types has broken the bounds of nature, creating totally new organtional isms with enormous but unknown implications. The speech went on to say: … both the communications technologies and the biotechnologies are fuelling globalisation, ing new markets and giving rise to new actors. I thought that was familiar, because it says in the UN Human development report: Both technologies are fuelling globalization, opening new markets and giving rise to new actors. Mr Ciobo- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. How is this possibly relevant to information technology, the nondelivery of broadband or small business? It has nothing to do with it.",32
84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Moncrieff will resume his seat, and along with the rest of us he will listen to find the relevance-because I am sure that the minister is coming to it.",33
85,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, it is coming-it is on its way. The final point that was made in this learned speech to the Sydney Institute in 1999, and it is the final point, was: … but my point is that, compared with most traditional tools forMr Ciobo- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister is ignoring your comments earlier. He needs to be relevant to the question that was asked. This is completely irrelevant.",33
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, I have indicated to the member for Moncrieff that I am listening very carefully to where the minister is new going; and I am assuming that he is coming to a conclusion.",33
87,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am indeed, Mr Speaker. The learned speech to the Sydney identify and move Institute says: … but my point is that, compared with most traditools for development, information and communication technologies can reach many more people, go geographically deeper, work faster and at lower cost. openWell, was it the author's point, Mr Speaker? Was it indeed the author's point, because in the Human development report it says: Compared with most traditional tools for development, information and communications technologies can reach many more people, go geographically deeper, work faster and at lower cost. Who is the author? The shadow Treasurerthe Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She has been caught out copying again. She is a serial offender. At that time the now shadow Treasurer was a backbencher, and she delivered that speech at the same forum on the same day with me. We did not have chiefs of staff-we were backbenchers. It was not the fault of a chief of staff this time. The member for Curtin, the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, is a serial offender and she has been caught red-handed yet again. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",33
88,Mr TURNBULL,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition from moving the following motion immediately: That this House censures the Prime Minister for failing to deny allegations that he or his leaked information about a high security telephone conversation between the Prime Minister and the President of the United States. In particular that: (1) this security breach compromises the credibility and integrity of Australia's diplomatic relationships with key international partners; and (2) the Prime Minister has failed, over numerous days, to fully explain to the Australian the details in relation to the leak and his volvement in it; and That the matter be referred to the Australian Federal Police for a full investigation as to whether there has been any breach of the Crimes Act or other relevant legislation. The urgency of this motion is very clear. We have seen a Prime Minister who has been given the opportunity not once, not twice but again and again to deny that he leaked a selfserving account of a conversation between himself and the President of the United States-an account so self-serving that it presented him as a diplomatic encyclopaedia, a font of all knowledge, and the President of the United States, the chief executive of our greatest ally, as a fool. That was the impression he set out to create; and he leaked that to the Australian newspaper, which naturally gave it great importance. Then when he got the Australian newspaper, did the Prime Minister have second thoughts? No, he was pleased with the outcome because it gratified his vanity. It made him feel clever. He thought, ‘That's good, people will know how smart I am.' He did not care that he offended the President of the United States. He did not think that around the world prime ministers and presidents, chancellors, treasurers and officials would say, ‘You can't talk to the Prime Minister of Australia-you can't have a conversation with the Prime Minister of Australia unless you want to read about it on the front page.' It was not until the White House, in an aboffice solutely unprecedented step, went on the record in the Washington Post three days later and denied it, and the issue was taken up here. The Prime Minister did not deny that he had leaked the information but sought to deny that he alone had been aware of the existence of the G20. He tried to walk away from the libel of the President of the United States but he never denied that he was repeople sponsible for that leak. Let us consider what in the Australian article said. This was not just a little bit of gossip that was picked up. It tells us: KEVIN Rudd was entertaining guests in the loungeroom at Kirribilli House in Sydney when an aide told him George W. Bush was on the telephone. It was 10.40pm on Friday, October 10. The article goes on: The Prime Minister, still clad in the suit he had worn to a business dinner in the cityhe works so hard that he had not had time to change into his black tie; he normally has dinner in formal wear, of coursewas polite and calm. “Have another drink while I take this call,”ever the gracious hostRudd told his guests as he slipped into the adjacent study. The reporter wrote: What followed was an extraordinary exchange in which Ruddthe great polymath, he who knows all, told… the most powerful man in the world that a plan to address the global financial crisis through the G7 group of leading industrialised nations was wrong. Rudd, the former diplomat and Mandarin speakerWas he speaking Mandarin to the President of the United States? It is amazing what you discover when you read these articles with great care. He: … advised Bush that the G7 plan … was out of touch with the reality of the Asia-Pacific century. The article goes on to say: Rudd was then stunned to hear Bush say: ‘What's the G20?' During the spirited 30-minute discussion that followed, Rudd continually brought Bush back to his contention that political imperatives and nomic common sense demanded the involvement of China in any response to the crisis. … … … Rudd's view on China was probably better informed than he let on to the US President. He was modest! It goes on to say: Just four days earlier, the fluent Mandarin speaker had discussed the global turmoil on the telephone with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. The Prime Minister's fingerprints are all over this. Every paragraph-every letter-is dripping with his DNA. This is his work. But we have given him every opportunity to deny it, and he has failed to do so. There has never been a more serial or more eloquent plea of guilty heard than the Prime Minister's on this charge of leaking the conversation with the US President. That demonstrates yet again that the Prime Minister's claim to be a proficient diplomat is hollow. This is the Prime Minister who on his first international outing went out of his way to gratuitously offend Japan. This is the Prime Minister who fails to recognise that the people of the United States have an extraordinary respect for their head of state; for the office of the President. Even though a president may be unpopular-and George W Bush's ratings are far from high-until he steps down from office every American will regard him as their commander in chief and as someone who demands respect. What the Prime Minister has done in his vanity, in his naivety, in his lack of trust, in his lack of professionalism and in his betrayal of Australia's reputation is offend not just George W Bush-not just one president-but the people of the United States. President Obama and presidents in years to come will, when being called by a Prime Minister of Australia, be told by somebody from the state department-the same department that called in our ambassador for a eco- dressing down; the same department whose ambassador made a personal protest about this to the Prime Minister-‘Do not forget that you can't trust those Australians; remember what Kevin Rudd did to George W Bush.' The Prime Minister has trashed our reputation. Many of the journalists watching us today have discussed this and heard the views of the diplomatic community in this city. Right around Canberra there are diplomats unbelieving that the Prime Minister could do this and repeating this comment: ‘You can't say anything to this man unless you want to read about it the press.' Confidence is a fragile thing. We have seen in the financial world how readily it has been shattered and how hard it is to restore. We have seen confidence undermined in the financial markets around the world. Just as with the world of finance, so with the world of politics and diplomacy. Nobody will speak to the Prime Minister of Australia now unless they want to read about it in the press. He has demonstrated that he cannot be trusted to keep confidential a conversation with the most powerful world leader. Every other head of government-such as the Prime Minister of England, the President of France and the Prime Minister of Italy-will say, ‘If he is going to peddle a self-serving story about a conversation with the President of the United States to denigrate the President's reputation and inflate his own sense of selfimportance then what will he do to me?' Around the world, Kevin Rudd, Prime Minister of Australia, is marked ‘not to be trusted'. This has been a shocking betrayal our nation's reputation.",33
89,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Is the motion seconded?,36
90,Ms JULIE BISHOP,PRIME MINISTER,"I second the motion. The Prime Minister has failed the fundamental test of national leadership. The Prime Minister has failed the fundamental standards expected of a Prime Minister of this country. The Prime Minister, by his repeated failure to deny it, has effectively admitted that he or his office leaked a false version of a confidential telephone conversation with the President of the United States of America to the Australian media. This has much broader implications than just a breach of trust and a breach of faith with the President of the United States. This has ramifications around the world. This conversation has been reported in newspapers across the globe: in Beijing, in the United Kingdom, across the United States, in Asia and in Europe. The false account of a confidential conversation between the Prime Minister of Australia and the President of the United States has been news around the world. What does this say about the Prime Minister of Australia and the office of the Prime Minister of Australia? What does this say to world leaders? For as long as the Prime Minister remains in this office, what does it say to world leaders about their ability to have a conversation with the Prime Minister about matters of confidence? Can they trust him not to give a version of a confidential conversation to the Australian media-and not only a confidential version but a false version of the conversation? This has implications for Australia in terms of diplomatic circles around the world. What we do know is that there was a dinner at Kirribilli on 10 October. We know that of there was a dinner and a prescheduled call between the Prime Minister and the President of the United States. What we do not know is who was listening to that telephone conversation, who was there. It was on loud speaker, so we are now told. Who was taking notes? Who was listening? Who else was at dinner at Kirribilli on that evening that could have possibly overheard a telephone conversation between the Prime Minister and the President of the United States? If we are to believe the Prime Minister and a staffer were present for the conversation and only they heard the conversation, then it narrows the field, does it not, to who could have told the Australian newspaper a false account of the telephone conversation? After 10 October we heard nothing until an article that appeared in the Weekend Australian on 25 October. As the Leader of the Opposition has explained in excruciating detail, this version of the events was the Prime Minister big-noting himself. This was the Prime Minister saying that he had to inform the leader of the free world about what the G20 was; that he, the Prime Minister, was the only one in this conversation who knew what the G20 was, and that the President, who had, incidentally, just met with the G20, said to the Prime Minister, ‘What's the G20?' This is a version of the events that denigrated the President of the United States to build up the reputation, in the eyes of the media, of the Prime Minister of Australia. We can just imagine how the Prime Minister would have gone back into the dining room and big-noted himself-he has just had George on the phone and he had to tell George what the G20 was. This version of the story appeared on Saturday, 25 October on the front page of the Weekend Australian. The Prime Minister can hardly say that he was not briefed on this one. It was on the front page of the Weekend Australian. Was there a public retraction and apology by the Prime Minister on the Saturday evening? No. Was there a public retraction and apology on the Sunday? No. Was there a public retraction and apology on the Monday? No. It was not until The Washington Post carried the unprecedented rejection by the White House of the Prime Minister's version of this telephone conversation that we heard anything from the Prime Minister, and he was embarrassed into having to admit that the version of events that ended up on the front page of the Weekend Australian was not in fact true, but not once has the Prime Minister denied-having been given every opportunity yesterday in question time, having been given three opportunities in question time today-that he or his office were the source of this embarrassing diplomatic gaffe that will embarrass the Australian tion.

Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: you have just suspended for one hour two members of the opposition. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that it would assist the management of the House if you asked the Prime Minister to respond to this motion. It looks gutless",37
99,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The member for na- Warringah will resume his seat.,37
100,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PRIME MINISTER,"I am responding to the suspension, and what a surprise that we have a stunt from the Leader of the Opposition, covering up for the plagiarism of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-the queen of plagiarism. I assume that when the Leader of the OppositionMr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, this is a suspension motion. If the minister is responding in place of the Prime Minister he should strictly deal with the suspension motion. He should show why standing orders",37
101,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"The member for Warringah will resume his seat. I will say two things to the point of order. I will use the same latitude that I allowed the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in their approach to this motion, but it would assist if members were to sit quietly and listen to the Minister for Foreign Affairs so that I can understand and be able to appreciate the points that he is making. I cannot hear him.",37
102,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PRIME MINISTER,"I assume that, when the Leader of the Opposition read the Weekend Australian on Saturday, 25 October, the reason it was not raised at all by the Liberal Party until 29 or 30 October, and not raised by him until after that, was that he assumed, as did I when I read the same paper, that the central tenet of the report could not possibly be correct, that the central tenet of the report-which was that the President of the United States did not know about the G20-could not possibly be correct. The whole conversation was about the G20. So I assumed the Leader of the Opposition's failure to raise the matter publicly for days or a week or more after the publication of the report reflected the fact that, like me, he thought there was nothing in it. What have we seen since then to bring about the high dudgeon of the opposition in question time today? We have seen the White House say, ‘The central tenet of the article is incorrect.' We have seen the Prime Minister's office say, ‘The central tenet of the cle is incorrect.' We have seen the Prime Minister himself say, ‘The central tenet of the article is incorrect.' We have seen the United States ambassador say: ‘These things happen from time to time. We've moved on from this. It's not a problem.' Mr Dutton-Just say you think the Australian lied!",38
103,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for Dickson! Mr Dutton-Just say you think the Australian lied!,38
104,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for Dickson is warned!,38
105,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PRIME MINISTER,"And it is not a problem for the Australian government's dealings with the current Bush administration and it is certainly not a problem for ing with the new Obama-elect administration. The argument of the Leader of the Opposition is that this has done damage to Australia's standing in public relations-that no leader would contact Australia with confidence. Last time. I looked, President-elect Obama had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister as one of his first 10 conversations with world leaders. Let us go to the substance of this. There are two substantive issues-firstly, whether as a matter of foreign or public policy utilising the G20 as the international financial institution to deal with this international crisis was the correct thing to do or not the correct thing to do. We are very pleased that President Bush, President Barroso and President Sarkozy effectively chose the G20. Do you know why? That was due to Australia's very strong argument, mounted by the Prime Minister when he addressed the United Nations General Assembly. We are very pleased that that was chosen and made no secret of the fact that the Prime Minister, I as Minister for artiForeign Affairs, the Minister for Trade and the Treasurer spoke respectively to various colleagues throughout the world making precisely that point. Do you know why? It was in Australia's national interest to make that point. Secondly, the assertion that this erroneous report, which the White House says is wrong, the Prime Minister says is wrong, the Prime Minister's office says is wrong and the US ambassador says is wrong and is of no consequence, has somehow damaged the framework of our relationship with the Bush administration. Let me make a couple of central points. The relationship between a government and an administration is one thing. That is not as high or as important as the relationship between nation-state and nationstate under the alliance between Australia deal- and the United States and our very strong policy position, articulated from day one. We deal with whatever administration the United States people throw up. We do not choose. We do not choose MCCain; we do not choose Obama. We deal with what the democratic process in the United States throws up. That is also unambiguously in our national interest. We have had a very good positive, constructive working relationship with the Bush administration, and that will continue until 20 January. On the central issue in respect of which we disagreed with the Bush administration in the run-up to the election and on which we were voted in by the Australian people with support for this policy position-withdrawal of our troops from Iraq-we satisfied that commitment in constructive, positive engagement with the United States and we withdrew our troops from Iraq in a very successful and positive manner, conducted professionally and cooperatively with the United States administration. So the second tenet of the assertion, that this has somehow damaged our relationship with the Bush administration, is fallacious. Let's now come to what has damaged the standing of Australia in the United States and put at risk the relationship between Australia and the United States. That is the Liberal Party saying that President-elect Obama was a terrorist. That is what happened. When you were a minister in the previous government, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was a minister in the previous government, when the former Leader of the Opposition, Dr Nelson, was Minister for Defence in the previous government and when the former Treasurer was a minister in the previous government, the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said that if President-elect Obama were elected as President of the United States that would be a red-letter day for rorists. The Liberal Party actively supported the election of MCCain and derogated and abused the President-elect. The Liberal Party's assertion was that to elect Obama was to electMr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, I appreciate your earlier statement that you would allow some latitude in this, but really he is ranging very widely",38
106,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"I know he has been warned, but I am happy to allow the minister to have his last minute in this debate.",39
107,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PRIME MINISTER,"This is what John Howard said: If I was running al-Qaeda in Iraq, I would put a circle around March 2008 and pray, as many times as possible, for a victory not only for Obama, but also for the Democrats. That is what the former Prime Minister said, and the then defence minister, the former Leader of the Opposition, went out the next day and supported it-and not you as a minister, nor you as a minister nor anyone else as a minister disassociated themselves from those remarks. That was the Liberal Party's position-that President-elect Obama was a candidate for the terrorists. Your senior senator, Senator Fifield, said on Sky in October: I do think it's a very serious matter when you have a presidential candidate who thinks it's okay to hang around with people who supported and sponsored murder and terrorist bombings. I think that's a very legitimate point. I did not see you debunking or rebuking him.",39
108,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The minister will refer his remarks through the chair.,39
109,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PRIME MINISTER,"The fact that Senator MCCain was the Liberal Party candidate was shown on their website. Here is a printout of the Liberal Party of Australia website the day before the election, with a link to the MCCain campaign. On the day terPresident-elect Obama was elected, it disappeared. Talk about damage to our standing! The government",39

114,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Wide Bay proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The impact of government policies on the physical, social and economic health of rural regional Australians I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",41
115,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The town of Bourke is one of those few places whose very name resonates in the minds of all Australians. When someone says they are going to the back of Bourke, we know they mean that place of myths and legends-the Australian outback. When Henry Lawson visited in 1893 he said, ‘If you know Bourke, you know Australia.' I have been to Bourke on a number of occasions and I found its 2,500 people to be resilient, proud and hard working. They battle through drought, the latest resulting in a loss of about a third of their population. The closure of the railway line some years ago and the decline of the Darling River as a method of transport have both dramatically changed the town. Bourke has survived almost two centuries in one of Australia's most inhospitable regions, beautiful but harsh, through natural disasters like drought, flooding and changing lifestyles which have seen people move en masse to coastal towns or to larger regional centres. However, what I see now is the Rudd Labor government, which came to power less than a year ago, trying to outdo all of those natural and demographic calamities and working hard to kill Bourke and so many of the important regional towns and communities around Australia. What this government and its state Labor counterpart are doing to Bourke and other places like it is, frankly, cruel and heartless and uncaring-but it is real. Labor's decision to change the focus and direction of the coalition's $10 billion and Murray-Darling Basin rehabilitation plan has devastated regional communities. Instead of restoring and modernising the basin's infrastructure, as we intended to do, so that there would be more water available for the rivers, for the environment and for irrigators, Labor is buying the water entitlements from drought stricken, desperate farmers. It is buying pieces of paper. It is the cheap and lazy way out. It is not delivering water to the environment, but it is hurting, permanently, many rural towns, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. There is no account being taken of the long-term social and economic impact on local communities. The promised economic impact assessments before the water purchases have simply not been undertaken. The Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, will not even talk to these people; she will not even meet the very communities that are being decimated by the government's actions. The government has no concern for these rural communities; it is interested in cheap headlines in the city. But they are just headlines. It is not actually livering any water. As one of my colleagues said, ‘It is buying air because there is no water there to underpin the water entitlements.' The decision to purchase the historic Toorale Station at Bourke and effectively turn it into a national park and to channel its water rights back into the Murray-Darling system is a classic example of this action. We saw on Four Corners just a few weeks ago the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, clearly demonstrating that she had not even been there and that she knew nothing about the property that she had bought. She was prepared to spend $23.75 million of taxpayers' money without even looking at what she was buying. She said she was going to buy water to restore the river's environmental health, but she overestimated the amount of water that was available fourfold. She did not know at the time of the purchase that Toorale had virtually no water to send back into the system. She was buying just clear air. She did not know that this vast, once productive property would have to be managed for pests and weeds if it was going to be any kind of useful national park in the future. Senator Wong and her Labor government colleagues did not know or did not care about the hundred direct and indirect jobs that would be lost in Bourke and district. That is 10 per cent of Bourke Shire's GDP. The minister did not even bother to ask what the impact would be. There was no economic impact assessment and there has been nothing offered from the Labor government for this community to compensate for the water entitlements that have been taken away. Yesterday, Regional Express airlinesRex-announced it would be stopping its air services to Bourke. Other services that are to be cut are going to include Dubbo to Cobar, to Coonamble, to Lightning Ridge and to Walgett, and Mudgee to Sydney. I know there is nothing easy about regional aviation, de- and Rex acknowledged this in its press statement, but it laid the blame for the cancellation of these services clearly at the feet of the government and the government's decision to axe the en-route subsidy program. The Labor government did not announce this decision in the budget. There was no reference to it in the budget. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government quietly wrote to the airlines concerned to tell them that this scheme was going to end and that they should start looking at whether or not any of these services could be maintained. The reality is that this scheme is going to be phased out by the Rudd government. This scheme, introduced following the collapse of Ansett and the events of September 11, provided help to 40 operators who run services to regional towns that otherwise might be unprofitable. The decision to phase out the rebate was not announced in the budget or even in a press release. The airlines were quietly told by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government that he was doing this because the routes were now in ‘a significantly stronger position'. Those were the exact words that he used. Tell that to Rex, Minister. Tell the people of Bourke, Dubbo, Coonamble, Lightning Ridge, Walgett and Mudgee that their air services are in better condition. The rebate is to be phased out over a period of time but, immediately, no new services are eligible for this assistance-no new services. So now that the Bourke services have been cut, no airline that seeks to introduce new services to Walgett or to Bourke will actually be eligible for this support. How, Minister, are these poor regional communities going to manage without air services? How are their children going to get to school? How are people going to do business in the cities without air services? How could a government in the middle of this drought, in the middle of the water buyback, be so cold and heartless as to withdraw support for people's air services, withdraw support for their connection to the rest of the country? What sort of an uncaring government do we have in these times of difficult economic circumstances in regional communities? Bourke was originally a port where paddle steamers would ply their trade up and down the Darling. That form of transport was replaced by a more efficient railway until the line was destroyed by flood and never replaced. Now the airlines are going too. The need for good transport links is surely evident to everybody. Surely, it ought to be a priority for a government that cares about people who live outside the capital cities to provide some of these basic services for these small and remote drought stricken, troubled rural communities. It seems it is too much to ask from this government. This matter of public importance also relates to the government's policies on the physical, social and economic health of rural and regional Australia. We saw a torrent of taxation in the last budget that will affect Australians, including people who live in regional areas. They will have to pay these extra taxes. The reintroduction of indexation of diesel excise for truckies and the new car tax are examples of the farcical response that this government is taking to the problems in regional areas. A farmer's top of the range LandCruiser is now going to be taxed at 25 per cent because a concession was negotiated for farm owners' vehicles, but if that same vehicle is owned by a shearing contractor he will pay 33 per cent even though he is driving onto the same farm. If he is a doctor visiting remote country patients on dusty or flooded roads, he has to pay the full 33 per cent tax. If the farmer leases the LandCruiser, he has to pay the 33 per cent. He has to pay eight per cent more tax if he leases it than if he buys it direct. What is the logic of this? What kind of sound financial advice did the Treasury give to the government that concocted this ridiculous scheme? The family Tarago still cops the 33 per cent luxury tax. A large Australian built Holden, which the government is now about to provide $6 billion worth of subsidies for, will attract the 33 per cent tax, but if you go and buy some imported Jaguar, Mercedes, Audi or BMWthe kinds of cars you will see double-parked in Double Bay-you will pay no car tax, none at all. What is the fairness in that, Minister? How do you logically defend that as transport minister? This is an example of the way in which this government cannot see through the impact of its policies and devises a new luxury car tax scheme that subsidises imported cars but taxes Australian produced vehicles. Talking about the car industry, car buyers and dealers are amongst those who have been critically affected by the government's mishandling of its support for the banking system and the financial system at the preall sent time. It has been estimated that perhaps half the nation's car dealers might have to close because of the unavailability of finance for their floor plan and finance for their customers. This issue was simply overlooked by the Rudd government in its rush to guarantee bank deposits and it has done nothing since to repair the damage. How many car dealers, how many car employees, how many workers in the workshop have got to lose their jobs before this government will take the situation seriously? Let us turn to the shameful situation of our public hospital system. In August last year the opposition leader, Kevin Rudd, was saying that, if he were elected to government, the buck would stop with him. The Greater Western Area Health Service, which administers hospitals in regional New South Wales, is so poorly funded that meat has been pulled from the menus of hospitals because the health service cannot afford to pay the butcher. Suppliers of security, taxis and fresh fruit and vegetables have been threatening to stop doing business because they are not being paid. A baby was born by the side of the road because an expectant mother was told to drive from Cobar hospital to Dubbo hospital. Doctors are paying for patient procedures out of their own pocket. Nurses are being forced to borrow bandages from the veterinary clinic. Surgery is being rescheduled because hospitals have run out of basic items like surgical gloves. What is the Rudd government's response to this appalling crisis? The Prime Minister said in parliament in answer to a question from the member for Parkes that he did not know about the situation even though it was in all of the Sydney newspapers that very day. But the government has just changed the rules which encouraged people to take out private health insurance. Treasury says that, as a result, 492,000 people will drop out of private health insurance. Those who remain in private health insurance will see their premiums rise and those who can no longer afford it will drift into the public hospitals, placing enormous new pressures on the already stretched system. I remind you again that the Prime Minister said that the buck would stop with him. Before the election, the Prime Minister used the phrase 36 times. Thirty-six times he said the buck would stop with him. Since the election, now nearly a year ago, he has used the words only once. The buck stopped with him before the election, but now it is over he has forgotten the commitments and promises he made. The services are not being delivered. The health system is worse than ever. At the last election we promised to return the management of hospitals to local boards. Local people running their local hospitals would never tolerate the kind of mismanagement that has been evident in so much of country New South Wales. We also said that there would be a fair share of the Commonwealth's hospital funding dedicated to regional health care as a condition of the next Commonwealth-state health agreement. We all know about the drought. It is the cruellest we have seen in this country's history. We all know also of the suffering, how it affects people socially and environmentally. Now Labor want to reform drought aid because they say that exceptional circumstances provisions are not appropriate for assisting those dealing with drought. The theory Labor are trying to promote is that the cause of the present drought is climate change and there is nothing exceptional about it so therefore no-one should get any assistance. They even want to get rid of the word ‘drought'. A government report has suggested it be replaced by the word ‘dryness'. Apparently, Australia will always be dry and it makes people feel bad when the word ‘drought' is used. This is politically correct nonsense. They are trying to change reality for a political purpose. The government must continue to be prepared to stand by people in regional communities. They have contributed mightily to our nation's wealth, our growth and our prosperity over the years and still do today. Do not kill off the communities that mean so much to our country. Give them a fair go. (Time expired)",41
116,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (4.01 pm)-I am very pleased to contribute to this debate on the MPI. It is quite extraordinary how weak the Leader of the National Party was-or is it the Liberal-National Party? They are not quite sure what political party they belong to, so it is not surprising that they do not know where they are going. It is clear that following last year's election herited a portfolio which for 12 long years had been overseen by a string of National Party ministers who were consistent in some things. They were consistent in their inaction, in their drift, in their nepotism and in the corrupt way they handled the Regional Partnerships program. They were consistent in that all of them failed to have any policy of reform and failed to deliver for regional Australia. The National Party ministers viewed regional programs as nothing more than barrels of pork for doling out to mates and business associates. That was the way that they saw regional administration. I have informed the House before about what went on under this program. We know about the ethanol plant at Gunnedah that was never built. There was $1.1 million of taxpayers' money funded for that project. The proponent of that project said in a Sunday newspaper many months ago that they would pay the money back to the Australian taxpayers. I took up that offer and wrote to the proponent. The department took action on this issue, but there was no response. The money has not been returned. Then there was the Indigo Cheese Factory in the electorate of Indi, which got $22,000 of taxpayers' money three months after it closed its doors. Then there was approval for a toilet in Lock-$60,000. There are 290 residents in the town of Lock, so there was $206 for every man, woman and child in that town. That was approved by the former government. Minister De-Anne Kelly, the former member for Dawson, approved 16 projects, worth $3 million, in just 51 minutes prior to an election being called. Their definition of ‘regional Australia' was very broad. Funding was given under their regional roads program to Campbell Parade, Bondi Beach, which is in the electorate of Wentworth. That was under their ‘regional' program. They had the Sustainable Regions ProI ingram that plucked out marginal seats and said that they were special and deserved funding. We know that the electorate of Macarthur was plucked out. Not Wollongong, not Goulburn, not Campbelltown and not Liverpool but Macarthur was plucked out as a sustainable region. When they defined the North Coast sustainable region, it began at the electorate of Lyne, which was then held by the Leader of the National Party-it now has better quality representation with the new member for Lyne-and went up the coast and around the electorate of Richmond. Why did it go around the electorate of Richmond? Because they voted Labor. Therefore, the good electorate of Richmond were not regarded as being part of a regional community. They also had the Darling Matilda Way sustainable region that excluded the electorate of Kennedy. It just stopped at the border of that electorate. That program is quite extraordinary. In the past couple of weeks there has been another clanger in Sustainable Regions that I have not yet had the opportunity to inform the House of. I am very pleased to have been given this opportunity. Barlil Organic Poultry Pty Ltd is a company that has recently had substantial difficulties. It is in Cherbourg in the electorate of Wide Bay, which is held by the Leader of the National Party. On 5 July 2005 this private company got Sustainable Regions funding of almost half a million dollars-$495,000. The now Leader of the National Party became the Minister for Transport and Regional Services the very next day. Notice the timing there? You get your grants out to particular seats and then you become the minister the next day so the previous minister made that decision. Indeed, the member for Wide Bay opened the project and wrote about it in his newsletter on his achievements between 2004 and 2007 to his electorate. It was a 37-page achievements document-37 pages paid for by the Australian taxpayer. In it he said that the Wide Bay Burnett Sustainable Regions program: … will leave a legacy of significant projects which will continue to have a positive impact in the region for years to come. That is what he said about this projectfunding a private company. It has now gone bust. It owes a million dollars to creditors, many of them local businesses. Dozens of staff have not been paid their superannuation entitlements. We have half a million dollars of taxpayers' money down the drain. We have a worker there quoted as saying on Channel 7 news-about the program they regard as top-notch: I did not want anything to do with it. The bacteria spores were starting to grow on the chickens and they were still quite willing to use them for human consumption. They are not talking about the bacteria growing on the carcass of the National Party. They are talking about a program in which chicken that was going green was being processed and sent out for sale, so Woolworths cancelled the contract. But what did the leader of the National Party say not beforehand but after this event? On Channel 7 news, in response to this collapse, he said, ‘It showed a lot of promise.' That was their response, but because of the way the program is structured we are unable to get any of our money back. When I say ‘our', I am talking about the taxpayers of Australia who have funded this largesse from the National Party opposite. The fact is that we had the Leader of the National Party stand up here and complain about a number of issues that have occurred. One of the issues that he raised, which is a very serious issue, is Rex Airlines closing their regional routes. That is a serious issue. What did the Leader of the National Party do? I tell you what. Do you know which airline had the highest profit ratio in Australia last year? Was it Qantas? No. Was it Virgin? No. It was Rex. The Rex airline had a 14 per cent profit. I met with the CEO in Singapore two weeks ago. He did not raise the closure of any of these routes, and I say that, if the Leader of the National Party was fair dinkum about representing regional Australia, he should join me in condemning the actions of Rex in closing these routes. It is a betrayal. The fact is that the subsidy that was there, which was introduced in 2001 in the wake of the Ansett collapse as a temporary subsidy, is being withdrawn in 2012. Yet they are shutting the routes now, and the Leader of the National Party wants to score a political point rather than represent the people of regional New South Wales and join me in calling for Rex to reconsider its decision which people in regional Australia will quite rightly be angered about. The people of Rex have good connections to the National Party. Let me tell you that the Leader of the National Party can pick up the phone and make a difference, and I call upon him to join with me in doing so. What is the contrast? Mr Truss interjecting",44
117,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is there until 2012you nong-and they are shutting routes today. I say to the Leader of the National Party that he has really lost the plot. They did nothing over 12 years to truly represent regional Australia. Now they are part of the problem-never part of the solution-as opposed to the new government, which has been moving very swiftly to put its programs in place. I met with the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia and with Regional Development Australia just on Monday. We are rolling out our commitments, which we are fulfilling under the Better Regions program. We are concluding all of the arrangements for the Regional Partnerships program. We are delivering some $1.75 billion over five years to extend the Roads to Recovery program-an extra $250 million for local roads. We are contributing $26 billion over the next six years for road and rail projects-the biggest ever infrastructure program. We are establishing the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure program. But one thing that we will not do, and it is in accordance with the report done by the House of Representatives committee, is fund private, for-profit businesses for mates. That is what we will not do. The report clearly recommended that, but we have a minority report from the National Party on that committee stating that theyMr John Cobb-Reflecting what people want. Read the evidence.",46
118,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Reflecting what National Party mates want, which is for the rorts for the private sector to continue. The fact is that we are truly representing regional Australia. The fact is that we are working with people of goodwill. Next Monday night and next Tuesday there will be mayors and shire presidents from all over the nation coming to Canberra and being treated with respect like never before from a national government. That is why they have responded so positively. But those opposite who are not quite sure what they stand for, whether it is the National Party, the Liberal Party or what have you, are so confused. The Leader of the Nationals essentially stated again that he was against the purchase of overallocated water entitlements in the Murray-Darling Basin. I say: is that the position of the coalition? They have been all over the shop on this. If you do not address overallocation in the Murray-Darling Basin, you cannot possibly provide a long-term solution. But it is not just the Labor Party that they are opposed to. They have deliberately stopped any of the three Independent members speaking in this debate. It is not just the Labor Party that they do not want to hear from. When we sat on that side of the House the Independents were given a fair go. I have raised with the Leader of the Opposition the issue of the Independents being allowed to speak in this debate. They have raised it with the Opposition Whip and they have been excluded. Anyone who is fair-minded and independent would regard the 12 years of betrayal by the National Party as a blight on regional policy development and would look towards what the new government has done in just 12 short months to correct the imbalance which was there.",47
119,Mr JOHN COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise to talk on behalf of regional Australia. We have just heard the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government spend a lot of time talking about what we did but could not really put his mouth to anything that his government was doing in a practical sense. I recall that the very first thing the Minister for Finance and Deregulation did for regional Australia-probably by January of this year, two months after they were elected and long before the May budget-was when he decided to cut $640 million worth of programs from the existing budget, and guess where three-quarters of that money came from? About $400 million of it came out of regional Australia. It is wonderful to hear the minister for infrastructure talk about all the things his government has done in 12 months. I will tell you something else his government did for regional Australia: he has been spending a lot of time talking about the National Party and Regional Partnerships. I travel a bit, and I was in Tasmania 10 days ago with Senator Guy Barnett. One of the things I kept getting asked was: how do we get the money to do a sporting thing for a school or help with a hall-whatever it might be-in a regional town? I said, ‘We can't help you now; all those programs have been canned. The Labor Party doesn't like anything that helps regional Australia.' In fact, that is something the Labor Party really did for regional Australia. It got rid of the program that did more and provided more seed money for more programs than anything that had ever been done in this nation's history. To me, it is quite phenomenal that the minister for infrastructure could stand there a few minutes ago skiting about something he knows is a terrible lie. He talks about bad programs. He has not mentioned the fact that he had to admit to David Koch on the Sunrise program that he had not realised that there were a lot of good programs for regional Australia and that he would have to have a look at them. ‘I didn't realise all good programs were there,' he said. Well, they are not there now because he cut them dead. The report he was talking about a minute ago totally ignored the evidence, totally ignored the fact that people want the same program as that which exists now. The government are saying that if they ever bring another program back it will not be for regional Australia; it will be for the whole country. And they want to have it in tight rounds, so it will only be so much money every three months, which means that Tibooburra will have to compete with Sydney. That means that Orange or Mudgee-or any country town-will have to compete with the city for money within that round. But that is doing something for regional Australia, according to the minister for infrastructure! Let us talk about communications. Today during question time we heard one of the ministers opposite talk about broadband, as well they might-but not if you live in regional Australia. Next year, in 2009, virtually everybody was going to have access to broadband under the contract this government signed with Optus and Elders, but they have absolutely canned that. Now we havewhat?-eight years before we might get something. In fact, they have done so much for regional Australia that they took back $3 billion which was targeted for regional Australia. They took $2 billion out of the Communications Fund, which was to keep regional people who were outside the competitive commercial area up with the latest, and another billion dollars from the contract with Optus and Elders which was going to provide broadband for nearly everybody by next year. Now, if they are lucky-after Sydney, after Melbourne, after Brisbane, after Perth, after Adelaide-by about 2015 regional Australia might get something. Mind you, the government does not know what it is going to do with broadband at this stage, and it these does not seem to have anyone who wants to tender for it. A short while ago you heard the Leader of the Nationals talk about water. These are more things that Labor have done for regional Australia. They are so good to us in regional Australia! They have now earmarked $3.6 billion to buy water out of regional Australia. And, yes, there will be people who will buy because, after six years of drought, a lot of them are in deep troubleand, yes, they have banks on their back. Let us talk about that for a minute-about all these wonderful things the government are doing for regional Australia and how they are going to be situated. Yes, people may sell water-and they do not want a plan. They had an opportunity to do a plan. Now they are saying, ‘Maybe in 2011 or 2012 we will have a plan for regional Australia.' Deputy Speaker, let me tell you something. They now only care about making Sydney and Melbourne once again think they are dealing with an issue of overallocation of water in the Murray-Darling Basin. They are simply buying. They bought Toorale Station-10 per cent of the turnover of the Bourke shire, four per cent of its rates. That is how good they are to regional Australia! Instead of that station being a bonus for that shire in western New South Wales, it is now a burden on everybody left to deal with it. That town has been hurt by drought for six solid years, it is in its seventh year of exceptional circumstances drought, and yet it has been totally devastated by that policy. As you heard the member for Wide Bay say a minute ago, the Minister for Climate Change and Water had no idea who she was buying the station from, what effect it might have on the town and what it would do. They are so good to us in regional Australia! They are going to buy the lifeblood of the Murray-Darling Basin. They are going to devastate towns. Instead of investing $11 billion or $12 billion to fix it, to make it better and to get savings, they are going to simply go out there and buy it and take it from people-not just the people who have the water who use it to produce the best food in the world, but everybody around them, the towns and everybody who lives there. They are so good to us out there! I just cannot believe how they are so proud of it. I remember many years ago when Simon Crean became the minister for agriculturehe had come straight into parliament from being the unions' secretary-and the then president of the New South Wales Farmers Association said, ‘It's like putting Ned Kelly in charge of the banks.' Well, I think having the current minister for infrastructure and transport responsible for regional Australia is like having Attila the Hun in charge of a nunnery. He is so good to us! And the Prime Minister and his colleague the minister for climate change are so good to us! If ever there was a time to invest in regional Australia it is now, as the world hits an equity crisis and a credit crisis. They are investing in the car industry, I notice-they found $6 billion for the car industry. Why wouldn't you invest the $10 billion in the industry, in the water, to hold the productivity? Why would you not do that? You heard the member for Wide Bay, the leader of the Nationals, talking about health, and what he said is correct. He spoke on 25 August last year and said, ‘The buck stops with me on health and hospitals.' I tell you what: not in the seat of Calare it does not; not in the Orange hospitalthe only serious medical centre west of the Blue Mountains and from May to October they did not pay surgeons and visiting specialists. Yet when asked that question by the member for Parkes, what did the Prime Minister do? That is nothing to do with me: he ran a hundred miles an hour. We are so lucky to have you taking every damn thing you are taking out of regional Australia!",47
120,Mr GRAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia) (4.26 pm)-I rise to speak on this MPI, which is on a good subject. Normally when MPIs come before us they are fairly awfully worded and read more like motions from a Young Liberal Party conference. But this is a good MPI: ‘The impact of government policies on the physical, social and economic health of rural and regional Australians'. It is an absolute pity for regional Australia and the National Party that the modern National Party is simply not up to a half decent debate on this subject. There are clearly significant issues in rural and regional Australia that need attention. But they did not get it for 12 years, they will not get it from the current National Party and they will not get it from a leadership so mired in its own past. That has been the weakness of its own public administration and its own inability to serve the needs of its own voters. Most importantly, it is not even capable of seeing the national interest, let alone serving it. As the global financial crisis tightens its grip, we must be prepared to stand by our regional communities. That is why I had some optimism that in this debate there would be substance on the table and matters debated that went to real issues concerning regional Australia, farming communities and the economic health of our regions. But, no, what we get is another limp-wristed defence of poor, failed regional partnerships and pathetic policies that were designed to do nothing more than pork-barrel their own electorates. There is a common cause: that our government, this parliament, our nation, marshal its financial resources, its intellectual capacwhich ity and deals with the current global financial crisis. It is why the government has announced its $10.4 billion fiscal stimulus package. It is why we have taken swift action to deal with bank deposit guarantees. It is why we have been accepting the advice of our prudential regulators, proceeding with skill and with speed. That is in clear contrast to the approach of those members opposite when they were in charge of the prudential regulators. When the HIH collapse came along, not only did they ignore the signals and ignore the advice of the regulators, they did simply nothing, causing massive dislocation in regional Australia as sporting events, community activities and the very fabric of regional society fell apart because of the inability simply to get insurance. It was not something that particularly bothered members opposite. Their concern was the obtaining of donations from HIH, and the prudential regulation which was cared for by those members opposite was merely the prudential interests of the Liberal Party. I learned something yesterday. Frequently you do learn something in this place. You learn by listening to what is being said. It had not occurred to me that in one of the more tragic and consequential events of the last few days-the difficulties of ABC Learning-the relationship between ABC Learning, Eddy Groves and the National Party was as close as it has turned out to be. It had not occurred to me, although it should have. Why was I surprised to discover that, at the same time the former government put its own donors on the Reserve Bank board shortly after the 2004 election, Larry Anthony had been appointed to a position with ABC Learning and shortly after that to the board of ABC Learning? What we learned yesterday in this place was the size of the donation made by ABC Learning to the National Party. In some of the documents, I will table here today, that donation is $50,000. According to Eddy Groves, it is a donation from Edmund Stuart Groves, but according to the National Party it is simply a donation from ABC Learning Centres. I make this point: the National Party-a once great political party, a party that gave us people like Ian Sinclair, a party that gave us people like Doug Anthony, a party that used to know and understand the needs and the interests of rural and regional Australia-no longer simply does not represent the interests of rural Australia but does not know what those interests are. It only knows its own interests, and it only knows its own financial interests at that. I said at the start of speaking in this debate that I was optimistic that we would have a debate that addressed some of the crushing difficulties and issues facing rural and regional Australia. We saw yesterday the launch of Diabetes Australia's online mapping facility showing the incidence of diabetes across regional Australia. There are health issues to do with stress, to do with youth suicide, to do with diabetes, to do with health care and to do with the delivery of health care in rural and regional communities. Do they get mentioned or acknowledged in this place? No, they do not. What the members opposite go back to, time and time again, is merely Regional Partnerships. In 1996, there were 18 members of the National Party in this place. By 1998, there were 16 members of the National Party in this place. By 2001, there were 13 members of the National Party in this place. By 2004, there were 12. By 2007, there were 10 members. Currently, we have nine. What does that tell you? It tells you that the people of rural and regional Australia are on to something, and what they are on to is the fact that the National Party today is not up to the task of resenting rural and regional Australia. I had a fascinating insight in the past month. It was to watch the election in Western Australia, the election which saw the defeat of the Carpenter government. What we saw in that election was a vigorous campaign by the Western Australian National Party-a campaign around regional Western Australia, a campaign under the tag of ‘Royalties for Regions'. It matters not whether you support the National Party's campaign in Western Australia or even whether you understand it. What is insightful is that following the election it became clear that the National Party would hold the swing votes in that parliament-the National Party could decide who would become a government, whether it would be Colin Barnett and the Liberal Party or Alan Carpenter and the Labor Party. So the Leader of the Western Australian National Party did the right thing. He said: ‘I will represent the interests of those people who voted for our members of parliament. I will negotiate with both major parties and get the best deal for regional Western Australia.' It was not an unreasonable proposition, not an unreasonable thought. It was a completely honourable motivation. But what happened? He got a phone call from the Leader of the National Party in this place, Warren Truss, to say, ‘You will not do a deal with the Labor Party.' What he said was, ‘You will form a coalition with the Liberal Party.' The Liberals knew that this heavy-handed approach would come. The Liberals in Western Australian knew that, when it came down to it, the National Party would not stand up for their constituency, they would not stand up for the people who voted for them and they would not stand up for the farmers and communities that need the support; the National Party would merely support the Liberal Party. That is why in this place we see a once great political party reduced to not only repa rump but a pathetic rump that knows not where it is going and only looks in the rearview mirror to see the once great members, frankly, laughing at the underperformance of the current members of the National Party. When I travel around regional Australia, I am stunned at the inability of the National Party to understand the needs of regional Australia. I am forever thankful that in just 10 months what the new Australian government has done is confirm that a new Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program will be created to help address the infrastructure needs of local communities. It will not be a pork barrel. We started rolling out the biggest ever federal investment in the nation's rail and road networks-$26 billion over the next six years. We have already delivered $1.75 billion over five years to extend Roads to Recovery and an extra $250 million for local roads. We have provided $1.9 billion this year to help councils and shires deliver important local services. We have announced the first-ever assembly of all of our mayors and executive officers from all around Australia to come to Canberra next week to speak with the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers and to engage in a dialogue that will be productive and in the interests regional Australia.

121,Mr RAMSEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In following the member for Brand in this debate, I am pleased to tell him that he should observe his home town of Whyalla-where the goodly residents of Grey have called upon a Liberal to represent them. I am sure he would be pleased with that result. It is appropriate that 12 months after Kevin Rudd committed to govern for all Australians we should look at what his commitment to regional Australia has been. It is time to match the rhetoric with the achievement. What has been done to support regional Australia in the last 12 months? Well, right at the top of the list, Regional Partnerships, as we know, have been axed. We have just listened to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government taking a broad slam at the Regional Partnerships program. But let us ask: what has replaced it in 12 months? Absolutely nothing has replaced that program. One thing that the minister can never find is supporters in regional Australia who say this was a bad program. The people of regional and rural Australia would like to see a return of the program. While I am talking about the minister, I might point out that he also took a broadside at the coalition for not allowing an Independent to speak on this motion. The Independents of course can put an MPI up at any time. On this particular MPI they did not rise to support the motion. Having said that, they approached our whip after the start of debate and asked to displace one of our speakerswhich, I might point out, would probably have been me-to speak in their place. We look forward to a cooperative relationship with the Independents. The government have axed the Investing in Our Schools Program and the Community of Water Grants program. They have raised taxes, registration and compliance costs for long-haul transport and extra taxes on farm work vehicles, such as the ubiquitous LandCruiser; and they have tightened assets test guidelines for qualification for exceptional circumstances. Peter White, the President of the South Australian Farmers Federation, or SAFF, said just the other day that South Australian farmers are facing the worse situation for 80 years-since the Depression. It shows just how attuned this government are to the needs of regional Australia when, in the worse drought in recorded history, they slash community water grants and tighten the assets test for applying for exceptional circumstances. Now we find that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is either asleep at the wheel or has no regard for those under pressure in the need to respond to the shortfalls in the exit grants program. It has just come to my attention in the last few weeks that in fact the $150,000 exit grants which were brought in last year in September, before the fall of the last government, are not quarantined from creditors. This means that, as land prices are falling and as farmers are under pressure, this incentive that was put in place to try to entice farmers off their properties so they can make a dignified exit from agriculture is in danger of being just gobbled up by the banks. The intention was never for this to be a support mechanism for the banking system; it was to help farmers make the decision to leave the farm with dignity. The previous Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry was interrupted by the election and at this stage there has been no quarantining of those grants. That means this current minister has either refused to act on this quarantining measure or he does not care. I do not know which one it is, but either is pretty unpalatable to the constituents in my electorate of Grey in South Australia. If you destroy an economy, you will in the end destroy the community. This government has signalled its intention that it is willing vest in urban infrastructure to support transport systems and to support failing state governments around Australia-to bail them out-but at this stage it has sat on its hands for the last 12 months and not lifted a finger to help rural Australia at a time when it is being challenged by the worse drought in 100 years. There is this discrepancy in the $150,000 exit grants, and I am asking Minister Burke to step up and fix that by making these grants off limits to the banks. (Time expired)",52
122,Mr TREVOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is of some interest to note that the honourable member for Wide Bay and Leader of the National Party has moved this MPI in this House. The honourable member for Wide Bay and Leader of the Nationals certainly should above all be aware of the impact of government policies on the physical, social and economic health of rural and regional Australia. The reason he should know about this is that it his party's impact-or lack thereof, I should say-that lost his party and the previous coalition government the seat of Flynn, my seat in central Queensland. Before the last election this seat was considered a safe rural National Party seat with a margin of 7.7 per cent. That was before it fell into the safe hands of Labor. The National Party abandoned the people of the bush and they paid for it in Flynn. As I move throughout my electorate of Flynn as its proud Labor member and chairman of the Prime Minister's task force, two things are clear: (1) the previous government's policies as they relate to rural and regional Australia did not work, as was shown in the last election, and (2) our policies are being welcomed in the electorate, no matter what colour jersey you wear. On a recent visit to Longreach and Winton in outback Queensland as chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force, it became clear that our policies were being welto incomed by all when it came to rural and regional Australia. The people of rural and regional Australia in that part of the world in my electorate of Flynn welcomed the government's commitment of $1 billion to the public health system since we were elected; improvements to the dental health system since we were elected; investment, finally, in infrastructure-roads, rail and ports; announcements in relation to tourism, including the western tourism growth corridor; and our Economic Security Strategy policy, which will stimulate rural and regional communities throughout the whole of Australia. What has become patently clear is that people in the bush feel that the previous government, including the National Party, deserted the bush. Lest there be any argument in relation to their belief in this regard, one only has to look to this side of the House and observe who the members for Leichhardt, Dawson, Capricornia and Flynn are. They are all Labor members and they all hold rural and regional seats. The previous government not once to my knowledge ever looked at the social impact of drought, including the physical and mental aspects and the effects on rural and regional Australians. We acknowledge the social as well as the financial impact that the drought is having on rural and regional Australians. The Rudd Labor government, my government, is totally committed to rural and regional Australia. We will forge a new direction with local governments. We will give them a seat at the table, rather than rip them off like the previous government did by cost shifting local government costs onto rural and regional Australian ratepayers. We will create a new local community infrastructure program to assist in local infrastructure needs. We will build on Roads to Recovery, roads being a major issue in rural and regional Australia. We will deliver on our rail, road and port bottlenecks, which have held rural and regional Australia to ransom for so long and cost the Australian economy billions. We will keep all our election promises. There is nothing here about ‘core' and ‘noncore' promises; we will keep all our election promises and deliver for rural and regional Australia and for all Australians. Regional Development Australia will be established specifically for rural and regional Australia. We will create Infrastructure Australia and look at giving due and long overdue recognition to the backbone of government in rural and regional Australianamely, local government throughout Australia. The previous government abandoned the bush. They failed the bush when it came to rural and regional health, ripping $1 billion out of the public hospital system. They failed the bush when it came to roads, they failed the bush when it came to climate change and they failed the bush when it came to infrastructure, water and broadband. (Time expired)",53

125,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,We thank you. It is extraordinary that people from the last government come in here and criticise the Labor Party on this issue. Be my guest; I am an expert in the field of criticising the Labor Party. But they were the government of Australia for 12½ yearsMrs May-Eleven and a half years.,54
126,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Whatever it was. I will give them 11½ years. Mr Bidgood-What did they do?,54
127,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They did things. I do not want you to think that they did not do things; they most certainly did things. I sit in my office under a picture of Ted Theodore, who built all our sugar mills and our grain silos in Queensland and sold them to the farmers. We thank him. He was a great hero of Queensland. I sit under a picture of Jack MCEwen. Jack MCEwen, as soon as he was appointed a minister, fought the battle of the pound. He got stuck straight into Menzies and said, ‘There'll be no going back to the old value of the pound, because that will cheat our farmers out of huge amounts of income.' And Menzies agreed with him because three times the Country Party had walked out of coalition over the issue of the value of the be expound. Doug Anthony, a great Australian, said in 1972 to the Australian press, ‘MCMahon will bring down the dollar or I will bring down the government.' They knew that these were not men to trifle with. These were men who believed in the people who they were sent here to look after and protect. For 11 years, the National Party sat in this place and presided over the dollar rising from 60c to 95c, and they actually skited about it. They said to us what a wonderful thing it was and that it was a demonstration of how successfully they were running the economy. Well, it was very successful for city Australia and it was very damn painful for those of us who live outside of the cities of Australia. I cannot speak for the rest of Australia, but sponsible. for 11 years we went on bended knee and pleaded with the former government, now opposition, to restrain the dollar. Do you know what was holding the dollar up? We all know now what was holding the dollar up, because the minute interest rates went down 0.1 of a per cent the dollar collapsed through the floor. It was the interest rates imposed by the last government that pushed the dollar up through the roof and deprived all of the primary producers of Australia of 50 per cent of their income. They were cheated out of 50 per cent of their income for 10 years. Even the most cursory glance at the history books of Australia tells you what wonderful and great men we were led by in the days of the Country Party under Earl Page, under Artie Fadden, under Jack MCEwen and also under Doug Anthony. They were men that made that the issue of government. If that was the issue of government, then these people, the Nationals, stand condemned. The people of country Australia once gave them 19 seats. When Doug Anthony left we started on our career downhill, where we never took a stand on anything, and we are now down-you are now down-to nine seats. We have gone from 19 seats to nine seats. But did you get the message? No. The man that was responsible for the deregulation of the sugar industry and for handing over every single sugar seat in this parliament to the ALP and to the Independents is now their leader. They rewarded him! In a way, I suppose, if you are a team of losers, you put the best loser up front. He is their chief loser. I have not got time to speak about Woolworths or Coles or the fact that, within two years of the dairy deregulation, every four days in Australia a farmer commits suicidethe great shame of our nation. Who was responsible for it? These hypocrites that are standing up over here-that is who is reTime is running out for the people on this side. You have got a chance to introduce ethanol. If you do not, then just remember those six seats went in that direction. (Time expired)",54
128,Mr OAKESHOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I also thank the member for Grayndler, the Leader of the House, and the member for Fairfax for agreeing to allow the three Independent members in this place to speak. I do note that, as a new member in this chamber, as I work my way through MPIs, committees, speeches and processes in this House in particular, I am increasingly fascinated at the control that the two major political parties have over the process of the chamber. It is a live discussion that is currently taking place with the Speaker. I encourage everyone to participate in it, to think about it and to think about the rights that individual, non-aligned private members within this chamber have as a voice for the people that they represent, as much as anyone else in this chamber. I also wanted to speak in this debate because there are entrenched matters within regional areas that are reflected within my electorate. I represent an area with some of the lowest individual household or family incomes compared with anywhere within Australia. I represent one of the highest unemployment regions by comparison with anywhere in Australia. This is why so many people, on 6 September this year, chose a different style of representation for the North Coast of New South Wales, because they do genuinely want to get out of the entrenched position that we are in by comparison with the rest of Australia. There is of work to do, both for the coalition that just gone into opposition and for the new government, the Labor Party, that is currently in charge. The three issues I want to raise that be, I guess, a test of faith for the communities of the mid-North Coast are, firstly, gional Partnerships, which we have already heard discussed in this chamber. The last 12 months in particular were a disgusting period of life on the mid-North Coast, where we saw handshakes done-the old ‘men of honour' doing the handshakes for the photosyet behind their backs and not in the photos were the crossed fingers and the broken promises that were never fulfilled. The Lake Cathie Medical Centre, the Wauchope-Bonny Hills Surf Club, Visiocorp Taree-a car industry manufacturing plant-are all key parts of life on the mid-North Coast. They are now filthy with the way they were treated over the last 12 months, and all I might say are incredibly valuable projects for life on the mid-North Coast. That is for the coalition to reflect on-the handshake with one hand and the fingers crossed behind the back with the other. But also, I say to the government, reflect on the importance of these projects to community life, because they are of value and I, as the new member, will continue to chase them. Again, I would hope that the old handshake contract is one that does mean something. Surely the last thing that professional politics needs is more cynicism towards the promises given by members of parliament, particularly ministers, even deputy prime ministers, regardless of who they are personally. As well, I would raise the issue of anomathere lies in GP services within my area. It asmidtounds me, as I try to get my head around why we are a region that struggles so much to get GPs into our area, that a GP setting up a practice in a place such as Hastings Street a lot in Noosa-one of the most sought-after has streets in Australia-receives a $60,000 incentive to do so; yet for a GP to go to my area, which has one of the lowest incomes, one of highest unemployment rates and one will of the highest ageing demographics in Australia, there is absolutely no incentive. This Re- RRMA scale is an absolute anomaly that is still alive and creating inequities and unfairness right throughout this country. It is creating winners and losers. It is creating a region against region situation-the battle of the Hastings: Hastings Street, Noosa versus the Hastings Valley on the mid-North Coast. I would hope that the government can overturn what is an outrageous GP program that was left to us by the coalition. Likewise, I have got a struggle on the ground with the Australian technical colleges. My area was one that actually did get two colleges up and running. We have had to struggle to get 350 students, 43 staff and $17 million of taxpayers' money resolved in the Port Macquarie community, and we are still unresolved when it comes to Taree. It is looking like a padlock job at the moment. There was no long-term sustainability in education from the opposition and there is no plan as yet from the government. (Time expired)",55
129,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In this matter of public importance debate I would like to give a little bit of history. Since Federation, there has not been a parliament that has been able to form a government without a country member in it. There has been a lot of preoccupation today about the fairly dismal performance of the National Party in the last parliament. I think is a message in this, and the member for Kennedy touched on it, for the current government as well. There has not been a government formed in this parliament without a country member. Some people, particularly some people in the country-and the poor old National Party are going through this problem themselves-are assuming that they are a minority and therefore can never really make a contribution to the parliament. We are in a unique period of our political history. The two sides of parliament-the city based dominant factions on both sides of the parliament-are almost identical. So this is a unique period, and I think that is one the reasons that people in the country are looking for alternatives such as Independents and some of the minor parties in the Senate. Given that unique period of our political tory-the sameness of the city based parties-the country could express itself in a different fashion. The former member for Gwydir, who has just carried out an inquiry recommending that the National Party merge with the Liberal Party, is betraying the very power that that once great party may well have had. That will be up to others. I think there is a warning to all country members in the parliament: do not ever forget that a ernment has never been formed without a country member as part of it. Another issue that I would like to touch is the hypocrisy demonstrated here earlier. I agree again with the member for Kennedy that the Labor Party is at a crossroads. You have been able to buy 12 months and there are a number of commitments out there, and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia alluded to some of those. They are all well and good-and they are particularly good in terms of infrastructure-but they have not been delivered yet. The next 12 months are going to be very important in terms of the delivery of some of those, particularly the major infrastructure items. But I point out the hypocrisy that the Leader of the Nationals and others demonstrated-as did the Leader of the Opposition in an earlier debate, if I may mention that. The Fuel Sales Grants Scheme was brought in by the former government to compensate country people for the difference in the goods and services tax that they would have to pay in relation to fuel, because the price of fuel was higher in the country than in the city and we were obviously facing a dual tax system. The Fuel of Sales Grants Scheme was brought into compensate for that and the compensation offered amounted to up to 3c a litre. That government-not the current govhisernment, the previous governmentremoved that, so now there is a dual system. Country people pay more GST on their fuel than their city cousins. When you look back at that, the hypocrisy in accusing any government about taxation and the way it is operating at the moment is stark. When he was Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, the current Leader of the Opposition promised the people of the Liverpool Plains, govin front of a television camera that went to news that night, that he would fund an independent study into the potential impact of on mining on the groundwater systems of the Namoi Valley-and then betrayed those people by giving a directive to the departmental head to do nothing. The hypocrisy of suggesting that the new government has not done anything yet when these sorts of things were going on behind the scenes is stark. The final nail was the new member for Calare. This week is the 12-month anniversary of the death of the former member for Calare. To listen to that man, the new member for Calare, and compare him to the former member for Calare-and to hear him say about the Regional Partnerships program and the absolute rorting that went on that it reflected what people want-is staggering. If that does not demonstrate a party and a philosophy that has absolutely betrayed its constituency and its integrity and any capacity to represent country people in the future, I do not know what does.",56

132,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,OFFSHORE PETROLEUM,"BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (5.07 pm)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. In agreeing to the amendments, on behalf of the government I would like to make a few comments because this is world-first legislation. Also, I welcome the member for Groom to the House, because of the constructive contribution made by the opposition in facilitating the progress of what is world-first legislation. It is important to note that those discussions were assisted firstly by the valuable work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources which involved detailed consultations with industry and all other stakeholders. Many of the amendments suggested by the House committee were incorporated in the initial legislation to be considered by the House with the support of the opposition. The bill was also referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. Could I indicate that the bill incorporates an amendment to reflect the government's acceptance of a recommendation of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee relating to the better definition of the minister's regulationmaking power. Broadly, the amendments agreed to in the Senate have the following important outcomes. Firstly, petroleum retention leaseholders are to be given a priority to apply for the grant of a greenhouse gas holding lease in relation to areas covered by the retention lease. The objective of this is to allow the retention leaseholders to consider their own need to sequester their greenhouse gases arising from petroleum operations. Similar arrangements apply to petroleum production licence holders. Secondly, the holder of a petroleum production licence will be given priority to apply for a greenhouse gas injection licence where (a) all of the greenhouse gas proposed to be injected will be obtained as a by-product of petroleum recovery operations carried out under the production licences and (b) some or all of the greenhouse gas substance to be injected will be obtained as a by-product of petroleum recovery operations carried out under any production licence and the responsible Commonwealth minister is satisfied that it is in the public interest for this to occur. This is to allow the production licensees to use a storage area in their production licence area for their own sequestration needs, but it will also provide an ability for the injector to sequester gas from their own or other petroleum operations or, potentially, additional greenhouse gas from other sources to mutual benefit. The amendments also provide for a closure assurance period of a minimum of 15 years to be established. This period commences on the issue of a site-closing certificate-a process estimated to take five years after injection ends and which ceases when the responsible Commonwealth minister is satisfied that there is, inter alia, no significant risk that a greenhouse gas substance injected into the formation will have a significant adverse impact. On the cessation of the closure assurance period, the injector's liability against claims for negligence et era ceases. This is effectively a 20-year limit on liability of the injector, with the Commonwealth assuming liability thereafter. I also address the concerns raised by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The bill has been amended to define the impacts that will be regarded as adverse impacts. The amendment will allow the regulations to set threshold criteria that may be taken into account in determining whether a significant risk of a significant adverse impact exists. Thresholds will be determined on the basis of the probability of occurrences and consequences. The facilitation of this bill through both the House of Representatives and the Senate has represented a constructive engagement between the government and the opposition, and so it should be. As we all appreciate, Australia as a nation is heavily dependent on fossil fuels for energy purposes. In actual fact, 80 per cent of our electricity comes from coal fired power stations. Whilst the government has a significant challenge in terms of our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020, the truth of the matter is that we are still going to be heavily dependent on fossil fuel for energy security in Australia. We therefore understand that the issue of technology is the key to guaranteeing energy security and our economic future. For those reasons this legislation, side by side with working with industry and like-minded governments on actually putting in place carbon capture and storage capacity, is of the utmost importance not only to Australia but also to the global community. (Extension of time granted) A recent International Energy Agency report reinforced that point and clearly indicated that throughout the global community coal fired power stations are also going to be central to energy security in both developed cet- and developing nations. For that reason the legislation that is currently before the House is being watched closely by the international community. A range of governments have actually sought briefings from my department with respect to the nature of the legislation, especially going to the complex issue of liability and also the question of ensuring closure in a safe and proper way. In conclusion I say that, on the basis of this Commonwealth legislation going to our responsibilities for offshore areas, it is now a priority that state and territory governments proceed to actually finalise consideration of their onshore legislative regime, because the issue of sequestration is not only capable of being achieved in offshore waters for which the Commonwealth has responsibility but also being closely pursued by a range of businesses with respect to onshore capacity. I say to all those involved in the debate, within the House and the Senate and from the private sector of the Australian business community: thank you for your cooperation. It is a world first and without your constructive input Australia would not be bestpositioning itself to actually confront the challenge of climate change in the 21st century. I commend the bill to the House.",75
133,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,OFFSHORE PETROLEUM,"I am going to have to tread very carefully here. It has been accused by my colleague behind me of that it is some sort of love-in every time the minister and I get to our feet. I have to say that this process is incredibly important, and it could have been overlooked as just another boring piece of resources legislation. In fact, as the minister has just said, this is world first legislation. It is legislation that I congratulate the minister on completing; it is legislation that I began in my previous life. Australia can hold its head high and be very proud with the passage of this legislation. It is legislation which, as the minister said, not only sets the blueprint for terrestrial sequestration here in Australiaand hopefully the state governments will take the lead and not fiddle around with it too much and not waste too much time-but also shows that Australia can do it better than anywhere else in the world when it comes to technology. The Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008 will ensure that the opportunity is presented for those producers of energy from fossil fuel to sequester their CO2. That is incredibly important. But, just as important, it is a partnership between the Commonwealth government and the commercial operators of these fields. In doing so, Australia will be able to offer them an alternative to emitting that CO2 into the atmosphere. There are still a significant number of hurdles to step over before geosequestration-initially perhaps from oil and gas fields but ultimately from power stations-takes place. Those challenges cannot be underestimated. There is an enormous cost associated with geosequestration and an even greater cost associated with the development of the engineering and technology to actually perform it. This legislation creates that opportunity and it is legislation which is a world first and of which Australia can be very proud. Question agreed to.

134,Ms GILLARD,OFFSHORE PETROLEUM,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (5.17 pm)-I move: That the House insists on disagreeing to the amendments insisted upon by the Senate. I hate to spoil the atmosphere of the moment generated by my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy and his opposition friend, but the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 is an important piece of legislation and the government does insist that it be passed in its original form. It has been a long-held view of the business community in this nation that the single biggest regulatory reform they seek is to have uniform occupational health and safety laws around the country. Whether you are operating a business in Townsville, Tamworth or Traralgon, the laws would be the same. In the middle of this year the government entered into a historic intergovernto opmental agreement with all states and territories to achieve just that. We are on track to the end achieve model laws, and in May next year there will be model laws available. Central to that agreement is the creation of a new body to be called Safe Work Australia. Its composition, membership, voting structures and methods of operation were closely negotiated firstly between the Workplace Relations Ministers Council members and then at COAG itself. Not everybody got everything they wanted-such is the nature of intergovernmental discussion-but everybody was prepared to sign off on this. The Liberal Party has insisted on seeking amendments to the legislation which are inconsistent with the intergovernmental agreement, thereby jeopardising the whole ability of this government, working with our state and territory counterparts, to ensure that we have this major agenda worked through and we achieve those uniform laws. Right across the country people are calling on the Liberal Party to get out of the way and to pass the safe work legislation in its original form. I would refer you in that regard to a media release from the Chief Executive of the Business Council of Australia, Ms Katie Lahey, where she said: In the current climate businesses need every help to get on with the job. The amendments sought by the Senate jeopardise moves to make business operations and employment of workers simpler across our jurisdictions … The amendments sought by the Senate in the last sitting inconsistent She goes on to talk about how business has fought hard for this reform. The Business Council of Australia, representing Australia's 100 biggest businesses, is saying clearly to the Liberal Party: ‘Get out of the way. Pass the legislation in its original form.' They are joined by the Chief Executive of the Australian Mines and Metals Association-not an organisation without consequence in the state from which the shadow minister for workplace relations comes. Steve Knott, the chief executive, has made it absolutely clear through his media release of 10 November that they want the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 passed without delay. When this matter was last before the House, the shadow minister for employment and workplace relations maintained that if the Commonwealth went to the effort of checking the acceptability of these amendments with states and territories then the Commonwealth would find that they were acceptable. Well, that view from the shadow minister is not correct. The Workplace Relations Ministers Council has met. I informed them of the amendments and they have said the following things in a joint communiqué. Whilst I would indicate that the incoming Liberal minister in Western Australia did express some sympathy with the amendments moved by the shadow minister, he joined without reservation with every other minister around the country in the following statement: Ministers highlighted that Senate amendments to the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 were inconsistent with the historic commitment for governments to uniform national occupational health and safety laws as reflected in the intergovernmental agreement … by COAG. … Ministers noted with much concern that the amendments threatened the harmonisation of national OHS legislation, thereby delaying a significant and long overdue economic reform which would enhance OHS are outcomes, reduce red tape for business and strengthen Australia's productive capacity. State ministers, including a Liberal minister, have spoken; the business community has spoken. We will return this bill to the Senate and we will say yet again to the Liberal Party: in these uncertain global economic times, do not jeopardise this reform.",78
135,Mr KEENAN,OFFSHORE PETROLEUM,"I do agree with the Deputy Prime Minister that this is an important national reform. That is why it would be extraordinarily stupid for the government to place that reform in jeopardy by insisting that they are right when everybody else is telling them that they are wrong. In the Senate every Green and Independent senator joined with us in saying to the government that this legislation was fundamentally flawed. These amendments were supported by ACCI and the ACTU, an organisation not necessarily considered to be a pawn of the Liberal Party. They joined with us in saying that these amendments were sensible and they improved on the legislation that the government has introduced into this House. It takes an incredible kind of arrogance just to turn around and say, ‘No, we're not remotely interested in looking at these amendments; we're going to insist on having our way.' I have news for the government and I have news for the Deputy Prime Minister: parliament is more than just the executive and the government. Yes, government is formed in the lower House here, but we have a bicameral system and the idea that the Senate should not have any say on the way legislation is formed in Australia is unbelievably arrogant and also flawed. The Deputy Prime Minister insists on ing about the intergovernmental agreement. The reality is that the new state government of Western Australia does not have a problem with most of the amendments as moved by the Senate. Indeed the Deputy Prime Minister herself through her own legislation has not even facilitated all of the intergovernmental agreement as agreed. For instance, she has failed to include within that legislacept tion something agreed within the intergovernmental agreement, which was that the legislation provide for the new body to supply an annual report on its progress to the parliament. That has not been included within the government's legislation but was insisted on within the intergovernmental agreement. What is so terrible about these amendments? They are actually relatively simple amendments; they improve on what the government have done. If the government insist on having their own way then they are the ones who will put this national OH&S system in jeopardy. The amendments do relatively simple things. For instance, they outline the objectives of the new body-hardly terribly controversial. They restore effective levels of representation to the employer and the employer representative bodies and they name who those bodies are. Most members of this House would agree that ACCI and the ACTU are the appropriate bodies to represent both the employer and employee groups in Australia. They also free these partners from unnecessary ministerial interference. If the chief executive of Safe Work Australia is going to fulfil their role then they should be able to do so without the threat of unnecessary ministerial interference. Freeing the CEO of Safe Work Australia from this interference is particularly important. They hardly have the freedom to do the job properly if they have the minister breathing down their neck with the threat of sacking them if they talk- do not do what the federal government wants. Finally, the amendments establish an audit committee to examine the finances and the expenditure of Safe Work Australia. These are hardly controversial things, in my view. They are relatively simple amendments that improve the government's legislation. They are amendments that every other senator exLabor Party senators can agree on as being sensible. It is quite an unlikely alliance when you team the Liberal Party with the Greens and the Independent senators. Yet the government is far too arrogant, even in the face of this combined opposition, to consider these amendments. I know that this went to the ministerial council last Wednesday in Melbourne and the reality is that there was very little discussion. I understand the discussion lasted for some 10 minutes and the view was expressed that the partners should insist on the intergovernmental agreement. We believe that this is the wrong strategy. We believe that the Senate has a right to amend government legislation. I would genuinely urge the government to consider their approach or they will be the ones that place in jeopardy this important national reform. Question agreed to. NA NA (ECONOMIC SECURITY STRATEGY) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Macklin, for Ms Plibersek. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",79
136,Ms MACKLIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (5.28 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Australian government is responding to the global economic crisis by taking strong, decisive action to strengthen the economy and provide immediate financial support for Australian pensioners and families. Four million pensioners and two million families will benefit from measures included in this bill-the key legislative component in the government's $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy. It delivers a $4.8 billion down payment to pensioners in the lead-up to comprehensive reform of the pension system to give them long-term security and certainty. The bill provides $3.9 billion to help Australian families-recognising that global difficulties are placing increasing pressure on family budgets already stretched by the rising cost of living. Payments to pensioners and families will be made over the fortnight starting on 8 December 2008 and most will be made automatically. The payments to pensioners are an immediate down payment on long-term pension reform. They are intended to give additional support before we make essential long-term reforms in the context of the 2009-10 budget. These Economic Security Strategy payments will be made to people who received one of a range of social security and veterans entitlements qualifying payments on 14 October 2008 (the date the Economic Security Strategy was announced). These include people receiving age, disability support, wife, widow B and veterans service pensions; income support supplement; carer payment; and partner, widow and bereavement allowances. For the first time, disability support pensioners will get a lump sum payment. The government recognises that they are doing it as tough as other pensioners. People who, on 14 October 2008, were of age pension age and received parenting payment, special benefit, Austudy payment or Abstudy living allowance are also eligible for payments. The payment will also go to self-funded retirees who, on 14 October 2008, held a current Commonwealth seniors health card, and to holders of the Veterans' Affairs gold card who were also eligible for seniors' concession allowance on that date. Those pensioners and seniors not actually receiving a qualifying payment on 14 October 2008 will still get the Economic Security Strategy payment if they had claimed the qualifying payment by that date and later have their qualifying payment backdated to cover that date. Similar backdating arrangements will apply for qualifying cardholders. The Economic Security Strategy payment for this group of Australians will be $1,400 for singles, $2,100 combined if both members of a couple receive a qualifying payment and $1,050 if only one of the couple does. A separate Economic Security Strategy payment will go to people receiving the nonmeans tested social security income supplement-carer allowance. People who were receiving carer allowance on 14 October 2008 will be paid $1,000 for each eligible person they care for. If the carer allowance for one care receiver is shared between two or more carers, the Economic Security Strategy payment will be similarly shared. Where receipt of one payment of carer allowance depends on the person providing care for two care receivers, the payment will also be $1,000. The bill also provides for Economic Security Strategy payments to deliver immediate financial support to around two million Australian families with dependent children. A payment of $1,000 will be made for each child eligible for family tax benefit A at 14 October 2008. The same $1,000 payment will be made for each dependent child who, at 14 October 2008, was either eligible for or received youth allowance, Abstudy living allowance or an education allowance under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme. If any of these qualifying payments for families is shared between two people under the usual rules for that payment, the payment will be similarly shared. There will be provision for payments for families to be made where the qualifying payment is not actually being received on 14 October 2008 but is subsequently backdated to cover that date. For example, the small number of families who claim their family tax benefit part A annually as a lump sum will get their Economic Security Strategy payment when their 2008-09 income assessment has been finalised and their family tax benefit lump sum is paid. The bill will make further amendments to allow payments for pensioners, seniors, carers and families to be made with no need for a claim. As well, they will not count as income for social security, family assistance and veterans entitlements purposes, and will be tax free. The payments will be 100 per cent income managed where an income management regime is in place. Lastly, the bill will allow the relevant ministers to establish, by legislative instrument, administrative schemes to provide payments in circumstances where the statutory regime does not produce an appropriate result. Through this bill the government is moving decisively to make the already strong Australian economy more resilient-at the same time supporting pensioners and famipart lies through the global financial crisis.  journed. APPROPRIATION (ECONOMIC SECURITY STRATEGY) BILL (No. 1) 2008-2009 Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Tanner. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",81
137,Mr TANNER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The global financial crisis has caused a dramatic shift in Australia's macroeconomic outlook since the 2008-09 budget. In response, the government is implementing swift, targeted and prudent policy responses to reduce the possibility of a severe slowdown in the Australian economy, and to shield Australians from the impact of the global financial crisis. As part of a coordinated response to the global financial crisis, the government has taken swift and decisive action to deliver a $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy to strengthen the Australian economy and support Australian households through these difficult times. The Economic Security Strategy is a discretionary fiscal stimulus package that is overwhelmingly focused on the first half of 2009 and tightly targeted at key aspects of the economy-household consumption and dwelling investment. The strategy also provides relief to those people in the community who have been struggling in the past couple of years to meet rising costs for housing, petrol and food, ticularly those on low incomes or with children and other family members to support. In the absence of the government's Economic Security Strategy, economic growth would have been significantly weaker than currently forecast. The strategy is expected to result in a boost to the level of real GDP growth of between half and one percentage point over the next several quarters, providing a significant boost to household consumption and supporting a recovery in dwelling investment over the forecast horizon. There are two supplementary estimates appropriation bills being introduced as part of the government's Economic Security Strategy. They are Appropriation (Economic Security Strategy) Bills Nos 1 and 2. These supplementary estimates bills seek appropriation authority from parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in order to implement a number of measures in the government's strategy. The total appropriation being sought through the supplementary estimates bills is $1.33 billion. The total appropriation being sought in bill No. 1 is $146 million. I shall introduce bill No. 2 shortly. Bill No. 1 provides for an investment of over $117 million to create 56,000 additional places in the Productivity Places Program in 2008-09. This funding for the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations is for places at Certificate II, III and IV levels. In the next two years, this government will provide for a total additional commitment of over $187 million to help job seekers develop skills in areas needed by Australian industry. This funding injection will effectively double the Productivity Places Program from 57,000 to 113,000 in 2008-09. The new parplaces will take the Rudd government's total commitment to the Productivity Places Program to more than $2 billion with over 700,000 new training places created over five years. By expanding the Productivity Places Program, we are building on a program that has already proved its worth. More than 50,000 job seekers have enrolled, and over 11,000 have already completed training in an area of skills shortage. When combined with other measures, this investment means that the Economic Security Strategy is expected to create about 75,000 additional jobs for Australians. For job seekers, it means improved opportunities for training and employment. For industry, it means better employees with the skills they need to build a more competitive and productive Australian economy-for today and for the future. As well as investing in Australia's economic future, the Economic Security Strategy provides critical measures which recognise the impact the global financial crisis is having on the budgets of seniors, pensioners, carers and families. For Australian families, the Economic Security Strategy means $3.9 billion in immediate financial support. Around two million families will be eligible for a $1,000 bonus payment for each child. The bonus payment is recognition that many Australian families are doing it tough, particularly as the global financial crisis comes off the back of rising living costs. For pensioners, the Economic Security Strategy brings $4 billion in additional payments. Those in receipt of age, disability, carer and veterans pensions, as well as self-funded retirees with a Commonwealth Seniors Health Care Card, will receive a $1,400 payment for singles and $2,100 for couples. These payments are one way the government can support pensioners during these difficult economic conditions. The legislation before the House will facilitate these payments. Funding of $17.2 million is proposed for the administrative costs in implementing the one-off lump sum payment to Australian pensioners and families I have outlined. The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will receive some $16.5 million, with almost $0.64 million going to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This funding will enable the payment from 8 December 2008 of immediate financial support to Australia's four million pensioners, and seniors and around two million lowand middle-income Australian families. The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will also receive $11.55 million to conduct a public information campaign to ensure that those eligible recipients of the one-off lump sum payment and the first home owners boost are advised of their entitlement. Through the Economic Security Strategy, we have acted swiftly and decisively to support the Australian economy. I commend the bill to the House.  journed. APPROPRIATION (ECONOMIC SECURITY STRATEGY) BILL (No. 2) 2008-2009 Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Tanner. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",82
138,Mr TANNER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Economic Security Strategy will strengthen the Australian housing market by providing $1.5 billion over two years through the first home owners boost. The first home owners boost will stimulate housing construction and provide assistance to first home buyers to give them a better chance of owning their own homes. In addition to the first home owners scheme grant, first home buyers who purchase established homes will receive an extra $7,000 to take their grant to $14,000. First carers home buyers who purchase a newly constructed home will receive an extra $14,000 to take their grant to $21,000. The first home owners boost will be available to eligible first home buyers who enter into a contract between 14 October 2008 and 30 June 2009. To implement the measure, Appropriation (Economic Security Strategy) Bill (No. 2) 2008-2009 proposes an appropriation of some $1.2 billion for the Department of the Treasury to pay to the states and territories. Those payments will cover the increased costs that the states and territories are expected to incur during 2008-09. This initiative will help strengthen the Australian economy during difficult global economic times. It will build a stronger Australian housing market and make home ownership accessible to more Australians. I commend the bill to the House.  journed. NA (EDUCATION REFUND) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 November, on motion by Mr Swan: That this bill be now read a second time.",84
139,Ms NEAL,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Robertson) (5.45 pm)Students in Australia are already being helped to move further into the digital technology revolution that is happening around us. To help achieve this goal, the government's digital education revolution allocated $1.2 billion over five years to bring computers and broadband access technology to secondary schools. This program is well underway. In my own electorate of Robertson, the computers in schools program has already seen an investment of $2.4 million for schools in my local area. This information communications and technology initiative has so far formed one of the major platforms of the Rudd Labor government's education revolution. The education tax refund is another of the government's commitments, one which will transform working families' access to quality education in Australia. By providing help for working parents with their everyday educational expenses, including the costs of purchasing computer technology, the measures contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 will ensure that kids have access to the revolution that is at hand in Australia's classrooms. The costs of quality education are forever increasing. A survey by the Brotherhood of St Laurence in 2007 found that 72 per cent of respondents could not afford items that would ‘improve the education experience of their children'. Two-thirds of these respondents did not have a home computer with internet access. About 60 per cent had difficulty paying for books and almost half reported difficulty paying for educational equipment. These figures illustrate quite clearly the difficulties encountered by lowincome families in particular when faced with the costs of schooling their children. The ETR plan seeks to address these pressing needs. Not only will the plan bring practical educational tools such as books and computers into the homes of millions of Australian students, it will enhance equity in access to quality education across Australia. While the bill before us today does not cover all educational expenses, it provides a valuable level of support for more than 2.7 million students in need of educational equipment. Under the ETR plan, eligible expenses for the purposes of the education tax refund include laptops, home computers, printers, paper, education software, school textbooks and associated materials and trade tools. This includes the purchase, lease, hire or hire-purchase costs of these items. Another significant element of the package is that expenses associated with establishing and maintaining a home internet connection are also included. The criteria for eligibility for the ETR have been made as broad as possible to include as many categories of students and families as possible. Parents and others entitled to family tax benefit part A and who have children undertaking primary or secondary school studies will be eligible for the ETR. In addition, those who would be eligible for family tax benefit part A in respect a child but for the fact that they or the child are in receipt of other payments, such as youth allowance, disability support pension or Abstudy living allowance, are also eligible. Students who are living independently from their parents may also be eligible for the education tax refund for their own education expenses. The ETR will apply to eligible expenses incurred from 1 July 2008 and will be claimable when income tax returns are submitted. Therefore, the ETR will be claimable from 1 July 2009 for the 2008-09 tax income year. With this in mind, I will be and have already been reminding the constituents in my electorate of Robertson to hang onto their tax receipts which they have already collected so they can claim the expenses in their next return. People who do not pay tax can still access the education expenses refund. Those people who are not required to lodge an income tax return will be able to claim ETR entitlements by lodging a separate form at the end of each year. As I have already mentioned, the ETR plan has been designed to allow as many families as possible to gain a tax offset under the scheme. In accordance with this principle, students living independently from their parents may also be eligible to claim a refund for their education expenses. The bill has also made provision for home-schooled students to access ETR benefits, and there are in-built provisions that cater for families that have shared care arrangements for children undertaking education. Provision is also made for situations where children leave or enter schooling during a given financial year and for those students in transition from primary school to high school. In a climate of growing pressures on working families, the Rudd Labor government's commitment to easing the burden on these families is to be commended. Access to of quality affordable education is one of the hallmarks of a civilised, equitable and productive society. By ensuring that the education expenses incurred by working families-and especially low-income families hit hard by increasing cost of living pressuresare offset by these tax refunds, the Rudd Labor government is demonstrating its commitment to strengthening and improving Australia's education system. The measures contained in this bill will do much to increase the participation of our young people in education and training. They will assist students to remain in education for longer and to participate more productively in the full ambit of learning activities provided in our schools. The benefits to students of having access to the full range of information and computer technologies-including home computers, internet access, quality books and all the other things I have mentioned-will, over time, bring great benefit to our society. The benefits to a low-income family of receiving a tax refund to offset the costs of buying and maintaining a home computer with internet access are clear and demonstrable. Such home-based educational facilities are no longer luxuries for Australian families putting their kids through school. Rather, in this digital age, they are now vital tools for full participation in quality education. In accordance with commitments given to the Australian people, it is this government's intention that every Australian family have access to these tools. The education tax refund will increase the productivity of the nation by ensuring that our students are better skilled and fully able to take their place in the education revolution. This bill is framed with participation and productivity as its major goals, but the measures provided by this bill are also a means to promote equity in access to education, a goal that is uppermost in the policy formation of the Rudd government. For the working families in my electorate of Robertson, the issue of education expenses and other cost-of-living stresses is very much a major concern. My office has dealt with many inquiries from concerned parents about the cost pressures of educating their children, and one of their most worrying concerns is ensuring that their kids keep abreast of the new developments in computing, the internet and information technology that are now so integral to school based education. The ETR scheme will ease the burden on these families. These measures will be particularly welcomed by low-income families. The bill also has the potential to break the intergenerational cycles of poverty that afflict so many families, by making it easier for families to maintain children in education. And it is education and training which provide the life pathways out of disadvantage and into fuller participation in society. The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 is legislation that puts in place a fundamental building block of the Rudd government's education revolution and therefore better participation. It is another commitment by this government to strengthening the nation's education system and equipping our students for the future. The measures deserve the full support of all members, and I commend the bill to the House.",85
140,Mr CHAMPION,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008. My electorate of Wakefield has a great many qualities and attributes, but it also has its share of problems, particularly in terms of access to education and opportunity. The 2006 Australian Bureau of Statistics SocioEconomic Indexes for Areas make it alarmingly clear that there are parts of the urban area of my electorate that are profoundly disadvantaged, and low educational qualifications are a key indicator of that profound disadvantage. At just 11 per cent, my electorate of Wakefield has the third lowest higher education participation rate in the country, which is also, I think, a disturbing indicator of disadvantage. University education is not for everyone, and that is why we are obviously putting resources into trades education and technical careers. In the north of Adelaide, my electorate is fortunate enough to have had the issue around the northern Adelaide technical college resolved and its future secured. So we know a trade is as good as a degree and that educational qualifications can be a key determinant of people's incomes and opportunities. But I know that there are many people in my electorate who are prevented from going to university or TAFE, or even year 12, and attaining educational qualifications simply due to their economic circumstances or, frequently, their geographical circumstances. Many country kids face a pretty big commute or have to leave home to do tertiary study. So geography can be a barrier to education, as can economic reasons. We know that there are many families who simply cannot afford some of the basic resources their kids need to really make a go of it at school. This bill is about removing some of those early barriers to people gaining a year 12 qualification. This bill fulfils a $4.4 billion budget commitment to create a new education tax refund, a refundable tax offset of 50 per cent of eligible education expenses for children undertaking primary and secondary school studies. As I said before, it aims to knock out the barriers that exist for some schoolchildren and their families. Eligible families will be able to claim 50 per cent of relevant education expenses, up to $750 for each child undertaking primary school, to provide a maximum tax offset of $375 per child per year. For children undertaking secondary school studies, families will be able to claim 50 per cent of their eligible expenses, up to $1,500 per child, with a maximum tax offset of $750 per child per year. The measures outlined in this bill will help about 1.3 million families-that is about 2.7 million students-to afford the basics of a good education: textbooks, stationery, trade tools, laptops and home computers. Importantly, the bill also allows for home internet connections to be claimed. This is a particularly important issue, I think. Increasingly, the divide in the future will be not just about income but also about access to information. We do risk a divide in that area, and it is one of the reasons we are so passionate about broadband. To give you an idea of how this gap is already there, one of the local primary schools in my electorate did a survey of their school population. That survey revealed that only 25 per cent of children in the school population had a computer at home and just 12 per cent had access to the internet at home. That is a figure which is staggeringly low given the importance of the internet and it obviously has a massive impact on their future opportunities and their ability to utilise the inforwill mation technology present at their school as well. This bill does go some way to address that problem. Families who may be eligible include: families who receive tax benefit part A in respect of one or more children undertaking primary or secondary school studies; those parents with one or more children who would be eligible for the purposes of family tax benefit part A but for the fact that they their child receive certain payments or allowances, for example, youth allowance, disability support pension or Abstudy; those students undertaking primary or secondary school studies and receiving an independent rate of income support payments. There are also measures which allow the refund to be taken up by families who have shared care arrangements and those families who choose to home-school their children. Particularly with the shared-care arrangements, I think that this is a really good recognition that many families now are living very differently from the way they did in the past. We now have the phenomenon of constellation families where people often have very complex shared-care arrangements often between one or more former partners and they may have arrangements that are even more different. So it is good to see the new government acknowledging that reality. In addition, students who go from primary school to high school in a single financial year can claim the full education tax refund based on the secondary school rate. For Labor, and for this government, education and access to opportunity are the foundations of any decent society. As I said before, in my electorate, there are pockets of profound disadvantage and intergenerational unemployment. After 12 years of inaction, there is great cynicism in some of these areas about government solutions, and this bill does represent real practical assistance which go directly to families. It provides also real tax assistance to those people who already do the right thing and support their children's education. The reasons behind the ABS statistics, which I talked to before, are complex. They need a concerted approach. This bill is a beginning to that, I think. But more broadly the government's education revolution will play a big role in addressing educational disador vantage in my electorate and I look forward to seeing progress in the future. So I commend the bill to the House and I certainly acknowledge that this bill will help struggling families in my electorate.",87
141,Ms SAFFIN,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I speak in support of the government's Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008, a bill that amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and, among other things, introduces the education tax refund. I have to say as a bit of a side issue when looking at the fact that it does amend the Income Tax Assessment Act, that we all know the income tax assessment acts have grown bigger and bigger over the years. This bill also makes consequential amendments to a range of other acts, but it is really to the education refund that I will direct my comments. The purpose is to give expression to government policy and government objectives on educational matters that put more resources in the hands of students and also some extra money into the pockets of families and carers. The education tax refund will provide a 50 per cent refundable tax offset for eligible education expenses up to $750 for children in primary studies and $1,500 for children in secondary studies. Eligible expenses are defined as follows: computers and computer related equipment such as printers and disability aids and also associated costs; home internet connection; school textbooks and other paper-based school learning material including stationery; and course prescribed tools of trade. And I imagine that there will be some working-out in that last area because it would be impossible to list all course prescribed tools of trade in the amending bill. That definition will become obvious as parents and carers put in their claims, otherwise the amending bill could be quite lengthy. The bill also sensibly makes provision for a transition period when a student transitions from primary to secondary education during a financial year. The education tax refund will apply at the secondary rate for the entire year, which is a really important provision. Most importantly, education expenses in excess of the taxpayer's offset limit for a financial year can be transferred to the subsequent income year, and this is a welcome provision. What I did not say at the outset was that as long as the primary and secondary studies are recognised, the tax offset will apply. This of course will include distance education such as home schooling, which is a good thing. It has to apply to all of the approved areas of primary and secondary studies. It tax also applies to families and parents and carers and also to shared care. That is important given the arrangements that we have in families these days. Again, that aspect often takes some negotiation, as we all know, but it is very important that it is provided for in this bill. Some other key features of this bill are as follows. It is a tax refundable offset, which means any part of the offset that cannot be used to reduce tax liability is paid out to the taxpayer. An approved care organisation is also eligible to claim the tax offset-that is, obviously, if a child in their care makes them eligible to receive the family tax benefit part A payments. It extends to families whose child would entitle them to family tax benefit A except that they are in receipt of payments such as youth allowance or disability support pension. Also, students in receipt of certain payments such as youth allowance and disability support pension who satisfy the independence requirement relevant to the amount of payment they receive are eligible for their own education expenses-another important provision in the bill. I would add that it is important to note that, in terms of what is eligible, there are expenses that are not eligible expenses for the purposes of the tax offset, as we would rightly expect. They include school fees, and I have a view about school fees. My view is not related to this bill, but I just do not think that school fees should exist at all because, when we are talking about inclusion in education, wherever it is, school fees can put an enormous burden on some families and cause some social exclusion. Expenses that are not eligible also include school uniform expenses and student attendance at school based extracurricular activities such as excursions. Again, my personal view on this is the same as the comment I made about school fees, but that is not related directly to the bill. Other expenses that are not eligible are tutoring costs, game consoles and school subject levies-for example, payment for consumables for particular subjects et cetera. The tax offset cannot be claimed for an educational expense to the extent that the expense is tax deductible or subject to another tax offset. That is to be expected as wellthat there would be no double dipping, as we call it. I have been listening to other members in the debate, and I listened the other day to the member for Mayo. He was talking about the importance of education and also, as a general comment, about the importance of preschool education. What I would say there is that preschool is certainly an important component of lifelong learning and education, and it is part of the Rudd Labor government's education revolution policy agenda to provide 15 hours per week in preschool for four-year-olds. That is a matter that will be worked out over the next period, and it is being worked on now by the parliamentary secretary. I just wanted to make the point that it is a key part of education and the education revolution. In my concluding comments on this bill, I would like to say that education is important, and all members agree. What we disagree about is how we achieve it. Education is what gives us individual opportunities in life regarding work, careers and the way we live, and it is what gives society and communities within society opportunities to be prosperous, productive and peaceful. Each government and each major party has a view about our education system and how it should be, and that is always the issue around which we have contestation and debate, although there is a lot that we can agree on. We disagree about the way certain things should operate. In the Labor Party there is a strong commitment to education as a means, in a sense, to achieving inclusion, equity, access to opportunities and, indeed, a better life. Education has given us opportunities to better ourselves, as many of us have done, and as I have done. We are committed, as well, to social inclusion, for reasons that are obvious, and we in the Rudd Labor government match this commitment with action. The education revolution is evidence of this. Other examples are this bill that is being debated now, computers in high school, transparency and accountability from all schools, a national curriculum, the preschool commitment and the tax offset. We are committed to making sure that families can better educate their children and provide their children with better opportunities and better access, and this is precisely what this bill does. With those comments, I commend this bill.",89
142,Mr OAKESHOTT,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to strongly endorse the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 and to put it on record that I believe that on the mid North Coast of New South Wales this will make a significant difference in many households within our region and therefore will make a significant difference in building a better Australia. In the year 2008 I do not think we can claim the title of the clever country, nor do I think that we in the region of the mid North Coast of New South Wales can claim the title of the clever coast. It is unfortunate, and I do think we have some substantial challenges before us with regard to increasing the investment and the value placed on education both for individuals within regions and within Australia and in communities in general. I say that looking at some of the figures with regard to the challenges in education for Australia, and I concur that they are a mirror image of life on the mid North Coast-issues such as Australia struggling to lift school completion rates. By comparison, other OECD countries have managed to progressively improve school completion rates, but these rates have barely shifted in Australia over the past 15 years. A dimension of this is reflected in the fact that amongst 25to 34year-olds Australia now ranks 20th amongst the OECD countries in terms of school completion. That should be a stark reminder to everyone in this place of the challenges ahead. Some other figures that are reflected both Australia-wide and region-wide on the mid North Coast are that the ABS recently estimated that 46 per cent of adults, or million Australians, had poor or very poor skills across one or more of the five skill domains of prose literacy, document literacy, numeracy, problem solving and health literacy. This means that they did not attain the skill levels regarded by most experts as a suitable minimum for coping with the increasing and complex demands of modern life and work. Early school leavers are especially likely to have lower levels of literacy and numeracy skills. They also have much more difficulty in changing jobs within a working life, something that all of us should recognise is happening more and more in the average working career. I also raise the issue of Australia's total public spending on education, which, at 4.8 per cent of GDP, is below the OECD average of 5.4 per cent and well below countries such as the Scandinavian countries, France, New Zealand, the UK and the USA. I think it is fair to say not only as the representative of a region like the mid-North Coast but also as a member of parliament contributing to the future of Australia that we have got some enormous challenges in front of us in lifting standards of education across the board. That is why I strongly endorse this legislation. I think it will make a difference on the ground in a number of different ways. I am particularly pleased to see that it provides a tax rebate of up to $750 per child for primary school families and of up to $1,500 per child for secondary school families. I concur with what the member for Wakefield mentioned: the key part of this legislation is that it provides assistance for internet connections. I have just recently been through an election campaign. I walked into a house in what was a relatively urbanised community at North Haven on the mid-North Coast. I was surprised to find the familywhich had a year 9 student at one of the local seven high schools, Camden Haven High Schoolon dial-up. That is technology which is at least 15 years off the pace. It makes it incredibly difficult for this young woman to compete in the education market and therefore to compete for jobs into the future. Compare her existence with the internet speeds which we have got in this building, for example. It is shameful that we have that inequity in places within Australia. I am particularly pleased that home internet connections are part of the tax refund and I will certainly be encouraging as many people within my region as possible to take that up. The taxpayers who are entitled to the ETR include those in receipt of a family tax benefit part A payment for a child; taxpayers or their child who receive other payments that preclude them from receiving family tax benefit part A; or taxpayers who are independent students and receive payments such as youth allowance, disability support pension or Abstudy living allowance. The ETR will apply to eligible expenses incurred from 1 July this year and will be available when income tax returns are submitted. Therefore, the ETR will be claimable from 1 July 2009. I am just flagging these for my electorate. Some of the eligible expenses include the purchase, lease or hire-purchase of equipment, including computers and computer related equipment such as printers, disability aids and associated costs; as I mentioned before, a home internet connection; computer software; school textbooks and other paper based school learning material, including stationery; and course prescribed tools of trade. This is of great value to a lot of housethen holds within my region and, I suspect, right throughout Australia. I have been in this job for seven weeks and I think that every second public comment I have made is in regard to education. I talked at length about skills based training and the importance of it on the mid-North Coast. I have some issues with regard to the future of Australian technical colleges in Port Macquarie and Taree and the role that TAFE and the school system play in delivering a better skills based training model for our region. I have talked about Indigenous education and participated in some very good and well attended Deadly Days throughout the region within the North Coast Institute of TAFE, and I have tried to get better Indigenous engagement in the delivery of education generally. I have just put my name down to go on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training. I spoke at length during my first speech about the importance of education on the midNorth Coast and the motto that I want drive home to as many young people in my area as possible: ‘study for a job, study for a job, study for a job'. I am doing this because I believe this is a critical factor in getting our region out of some entrenched disadvantage. This disadvantage sees our area as one of the lowest on income any way you look at it-whether it is individual income, household income or family income. We have very low education retention rates. We have very low post secondary education rates; therefore, to be honest, the challenges to lift the region certainly sound like the challenges of the nation. That is why I am really pleased to see this legislation come through the parliament. I will certainly be one promoting it far and wide and, hopefully, getting as many people on the mid-North Coast to benefit from a tax break from government as possible. I hope that we see some assistance for better education standards for individuals, within the region and, by logical extension, within Australia.",90
143,Mr HALE,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise today to voice my strong support for the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008. I acknowledge the contribution of the previous speaker, the member for Lyne. I sat through his first speech and he is very passionate about education. It is great to see the support coming from the crossbenches and I acknowledge as well those on our side of the House who have spoken during this debate. This bill introduces a 50 per cent education tax refund aimed at assisting families with children undertaking primary and secondary school studies to meet the costs of school education through assistance with certain educational expenses. Under the education tax refund, eligible families will be able to claim a 50 per cent refundable tax offset every year for up to $750 of eligible expenses for each child undertaking primary school-a refund of up to $375 per child per year-and up to $1,500 of eligible expenses for each child undertaking secondary school-a refund of up to $750 per child per year. Families in receipt of family tax benefit part A in respect of one or more children undertaking primary or secondary school studies are eligible for the education tax refund. Those parents with one or more children who are eligible for the family tax benefit part A but for the fact that they or their children receive certain other payment or allowances will also be eligible for the education tax refund. Those students undertaking primary and secondary school studies and receiving an independent rate for income support payments may also be eligible for the education tax refund for their own expenses. By way of my own background, education is a subject that has always been and continues to be very close to my heart. As I have said before, both my parents were teachers, my grandmother was a teacher, my sister is a teacher and I have almost finished a teaching degree myself. So collectively that is a combined teaching experience of over 80 years. I have to say though that having teachers as parents was not always good, particularly when I was growing up. I remember as a young fellow maybe wanting to be a bit slack. I remember often having early nights on parent-teacher nights just in case the teachers were not glowing in their terms when they spoke about me to my parents. But as a parent now I understand where they were coming from. One of the not negotiable issues for me as a father is ensuring my children receive a great education. I often say, ‘You cannot take anything with you when you're gone but you sure can leave a lot.' If there is one thing I want to make sure I leave my children it is the knowledge that they have received a solid education. This bill is vital to thousands of families in my electorate of Solomon because it provides very important financial assistance in this critical area. Having doorknocked extensively around my electorate in Darwin and Palmerston, I know that education is a galvanising issue that people are passionate about. It does not matter what side of politics you are from, it is one of those not negotiable issues. I have never had anyone say to me that we spend too much money on education or that education is overrated. For Labor, better education is the cornerstone of a decent society. Education is at the forefront of our government's commitment to the Australian people. An education revolution to create one of the most highly educated and skilled nations on earth is the mandate that Kevin Rudd asked the Australian people for on 24 November last year, and they gave it. During the election campaign, Labor made it clear that Australia needed nothing less than an education revolution, a substantial and sustained increase in the quality of our investment in education for Australian youth. This is required at every level of education, from early childhood education through to the education of mature age students. Just on that point, as we go through life we have many different forms of education and we never stop learning. In my background, having left school to do an apprenticeship as a greenkeeper, and having studied at the TAFE college in Brisbane as well as doing a university course to become a teacher, learning has been a lifelong exercise. Education is the platform of our economic future; our prosperity rests on what we commit to education now. One thing I have learned from my parents is that education is not something that you just go through the motions with. Education is not something that you just talk about to win an election. Education is the commitment we set for the society we want to become. We need an ambitious national strategy to improve our schools, driven by the goal of higher quality. To thrive in the future we need a schooling system which delivers high-quality education for all students, regardless of their address and regardless of their schools. During the campaign, I know this election commitment was received really well by all parents and kids that I spoke to. I speak to students, parents and teachers all the time. They tell me about their schools and their communities and I am always impressed by the quality of the young people our schools produce, the professionalism of our teaching staff and the dedication of our parents. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of all the schools in my electorate Solomon. They do a fantastic job. I am excited to speak in support of this bill because know that mums and dads and families are doing it tough in Solomon. I know that mums and dads and families in Solomon welcome the Rudd Labor government's initiative. This bill will assist with the expenses associated with providing a solid education. It will take a bit of pressure off the family budget. This bill will assist with costs of things such as laptops, home computers, printers, paper, education software, school textbooks and associated materials as well as trade tools. The Rudd Labor government is delivering on its election commitment by providing this education tax refund. Around 1.3 million Australian families will be eligible for this education refund. $4.4 billion will be invested in financial support to help working families meet the growing costs of educating their children. It will put money back into the pockets of the many Australian families with school aged children. I am sure that the eligible parents of the children in 50-odd schools in Solomon will appreciate being able to claim this rebate. In fact, it is estimated that this measure will help the families of around 2.7 million school aged children to meet the costs of their education. As a parent of kids in both primary and secondary school, I am acutely aware of the costs associated with properly equipping your kids for school. These costs are particularly evident after Christmas and during the Christmas school holidays when families need to start buying necessary items for the start of the new school year. As children progress through primary school to secondary school, the cost of schooling over those years is certainly significant, particularly in recent times. Delivery of education has changed draof matically. We all know technology plays a huge role in how we educate our children. I The Prime Minister has said on several occasions that computers are the toolbox for the 21st century. Through computers and the internet, primary and secondary students are linked to the world. Computer and internet technologies continue to evolve at a fast pace and we must ensure that the education of our kids keeps up. We have to make sure our kids are not left behind; Australian children must be computer literate. The digital economy is a fundamental component of every aspect of business and of our daily lives. ABS data tells us that around three-quarters of Australian households have a computer at home. Unfortunately, figures also tell us that less than 50 per cent of low-income households have a computer. This has been termed the ‘digital divide', a divide between those who have access to a computer and the internet at home and those who do not. It is sad that this divide means that some children in our community are disadvantaged by not having the access to a computer or the internet at home. Thankfully, this bill will help turn this sad situation around. It will help break down the digital divide by supporting lowand middle-income households with assistance to provide the educational equipment needed for their children to perform at school. That is why the expenses of establishing and maintaining a home internet connection are also included in this bill. The refund will apply to eligible expenses incurred from 1 July 2008. I would also like to take this opportunity to remind the good people in Solomon eligible for the education tax refund to keep their receipts so that they can claim them on their tax return from 1 July 2009. And those people who are not required to lodge an income tax return will be able to access their entitlement through the tax office at the end of the financial year. This bill goes a long way towards providing relief to hard working families who are struggling to pay their household expenses. Rising petrol prices, mortgage repayments and grocery bills all add up and can leave families wondering how they will pay for the necessities associated with their children's education. It is particularly important in times like today, when we are in the midst of a global financial crisis, that we continue to focus on and provide relief to families. The $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy will assist Australians who need it most. I know that pensioners and families in Solomon can now look forward to some muchneeded relief before Christmas. The Economic Security Strategy, alongside this bill, demonstrates just how committed we as a government are to helping families deal with the cost of living. I will quote what the Prime Minister said in his address to the National Press Club in August this year to demonstrate our commitment to the delivery of an education revolution. He said: … I want people to understand that our reforms are essential to Australia's future-because quality education is good for our economy, good for our community and good for individuals. It will help create jobs and higher wages, and will create better opportunities for all Australians. The Government wants the next generation of Australians to be the best educated, best skilled, best trained in the world. We don't apologise for this ambition. Today, we take one further practical step towards achieving the education revolution that Australia needs. One step further to building a stronger, fairer and more secure Australia, and one capable of handling the great challenges of the 21st century that now lie before us. I could not agree more. I commend the bill to the House.",92
144,Mr BRADBURY,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Lindsay) (6.33 pm)It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 and recognise that the contents of this bill relate to one of the key commitments that was made by the Labor Party before the last election, and that relates to the education tax refund. I wish to add my comments to the comments of those who have preceded me in this debate in supporting this initiative, one that I think will have a tremendous impact in easing the squeeze of the cost-of-living pressures that families right throughout this country are facing, particularly parents with children of school age. This initiative, the education tax refund, is very much targeted towards providing support for families on the home front when it comes to the educational challenges that students inevitably go through. The Rudd Labor government's education revolution has many facets, and I have talked about many of those in this place consistently. The education revolution includes our initiatives in relation to computers in schools and our initiatives in relation to trades training centres in schools. But this particular proposal will, if passed, allow parents to have a tax refund on some of the expenditure that they incur in relation to educational costs for their children. The maximum limit for secondary students is to claim a 50 per cent tax refund on expenditure up to $1,500 and, for primary school students, a 50 per cent tax refund on expenditure up to $750. So the total benefit in relation to a secondary school student is $750 and the total benefit in relation to a primary school student is $375. Of course, these benefits are available to parents whose families would otherwise be eligible for family tax benefit part A. In terms of the scope of this particular measure, I should note that, in commenting on the thresholds and the limits, one of the significant components that I noted in considering the bill was that those students who might be in year 6 transitioning into year 7 through the course of the present financial year will be able to obtain the benefit of the higher figure, so they will be eligible for per cent refund on up to $1,500 worth of expenditure. What types of expenditure are considered to be eligible for the education tax refund? They include expenditure on laptops, home computers and associated costs, whether they be in the form of repairs, running costs or leases, if the equipment is leased, and, significantly, home internet connection, printers and paper. It also includes educational software, school textbooks and other material, including prescribed textbooks and associated learning materials, study guides, stationery and prescribed trade tools. One of the criticisms that has been levelled by those on the other side is that the range of expenses that fall within the scope of the education tax refund is quite limited. There is an interesting observation that should be made in relation to those criticisms, and that is simply that those on the other side had a very long period of time in government-11½ years-and in that time we did not at any stage see any moves towards the implementation of a tax refund for educational expenses of any kind. In fact, it was only after the announcement by the Labor Party in opposition that, if elected, we would implement an education tax refund that the former Prime Minister, the then member for Bennelong, sought to come up with an alternative proposal, an education tax refund that was said to be much more wideranging than the one that is presently before the House for consideration. The costings at the time indicated that the coalition proposal was in the order of three times the cost of the Labor Party's proposal, but let us just put those cost issues to one side-although I note that the coalition, with their determination to block key measures of our budget over the past six months, have done their level best to erode any surplus that is at the government's disposal. Of course, that sura 50 plus is now showing its worth and just how significant it is to us as a nation as we prepare to dip into it in order to protect our economy against the emerging challenges associated with the global financial crisis and the flow-on effects that will come from that. Whilst the education tax refund is limited, it is limited in a very targeted way. The refund is limited towards direct educational expenses incurred by parents in relation to their students at home, such as the cost of a laptop, the cost of an internet connection, the cost of cartridges. It never ceases to amaze me just how expensive some of these items are. Cartridges can cost anywhere from $25 to $50, depending on the nature of the printer. And that is just for a cartridge for a printer. Printers can range in price anywhere from $150 to $500 for a fairly basic model. One of the most significant aspects of the coverage of this particular initiative is internet access. I note that a fairly basic broadband internet package with fairly minor establishment costs is most likely to cost anywhere upwards from around $650-which is probably about the cheapest package you are likely to find. So the education tax refund will allow many families to receive some tax relief, a 50 per cent refund, on expenses incurred in relation to those costs. They are key costs, vital and essential costs, in the education and development of students as they go through an education system in the 21st century. Another significant element of this proposal is that the tax offset that constitutes education tax refund is a refundable tax offset. The significance of that is that there are refundable tax offsets and there are nonrefundable tax offsets. The benefit of a refundable tax offset is that those taxpayers who do not pay tax or have not paid sufficient tax in order to get the benefit of an offset are still able to receive the offset in the form of a rebate or a refund. This design feature of this proposal will ensure that those at the lower income level, those that are least able to afford the educational expenses required to provide the necessary support to their children, will still be able to obtain the full benefit of this refund. It is significant that the benefit has been provided in the form of a tax refund rather than a tax deduction. A tax deduction will always be slanted in favour of those on higher tax rates and, by definition, those on higher incomes. So these are significant design elements of this particular proposal. I think they will go a long way towards addressing some of the disadvantage that exists within families across this country and addressing the digital divide we have heard so much about, most recently, in this debate, from the member for Lyne, the member for Solomon and member for Wakefield. I believe that the benefit of this measure will be great. I note that it relates to the rent tax year, so I hope that parents out there are keeping their receipts from 1 July this year, because at the end of the financial year they will be eligible, provided they meet the eligibility requirements, to obtain the benefit of that tax refund. It is also relevant to reflect upon the government's decisive action in relation to the fiscal stimulus provided through the Economic Security Strategy and I think it is important that we do this from the perspective that, from the first week in December, families eligible for family tax benefit part A will receive a payment of the $1,000 per child. I would like to encourage many families out there that might be in a position to take advantage of that one-off payment to utilise that payment to go out and purchase a laptop computer or some equipment that will assist their children in progressing their educational opportunities. I do that because I think it is a good deal for any parent who is in a position to do that. I know that many people will be using that money for some much more basic and necessary items that the household budget might not otherwise provide for, but I think it is important to note just how important it is that children and students have the opportunity to further their learning through the use of a laptop or a computer at home. The double benefit that will be provided to parents is that if they use that payment they receive in the first week of Decemberthat is a payment that in the household budget should be considered to be something of a windfall-they will still be entitled to the education tax refund on that expenditure. So, apart from the fact that they will be getting $1,000 from the government in the first week of December, they will then be able, provided that they qualify, to expend that money on an education related purpose for their child, and then at the end of the tax year they will get the benefit of a 50 per cent recurfund on that expenditure up to the limits. From my discussions with many parents in my electorate, I think it will be taken up by many families, particularly those families that have a couple of children. Let us assume you have two children who are secondary school students and you do not have a computer at home-and the reality is that there are still many families in my electorate that do not have a computer in their home-and you are eligible for family tax benefit part The $1,000 per child that is likely to being in in the next month or so may give you the ability to purchase a computer while the leftover money, the surplus funds, might be spent on an internet connection and the ongoing costs of maintaining that connection for the rest of the financial year. If a family were to do that, they would be taking that $2,000 windfall and spending it, and that money would be doing what we want it to do, which is provide further stimulus to the economy. In doing so, it would also be leaving that family the option of claiming the education tax refund, which would amount to $1,000 of that $2,000. So it is quite a good deal. There are a lot of people out there saying we should not be telling families how they should be spending their money and, in the end, families will spend their money as they think most appropriate. But this is something I will definitely be encouraging many parents within my electorate to consider, because I think it is a very good and very wise means by which these two initiatives of the government can be taken advantage of for the benefit of their children. Throughout the course of this debate there has been a lot of discussion about education issues more generally. I know that those on the other side have singled out a few areas of criticism of the government's approach. I wish to respond to some of those, but let me begin by saying that there has been an interesting chorus of critical comments coming from the other side in relation to the Investing in our Schools program. There is one slight difference in the approach that has been taken by most of the speakers on that side as compared to the shadow Treasurer, who in her contribution to this debate made comment on Investing in our Schools but importantly did not suggest that this government had cut that program. She did that A. because she is very aware of the history of com- that program. Whilst there are some on the other side that are prepared to turn a blind eye to the facts of this matter, it is important to reflect on that history. The history of the Investing in our Schools program shows that the former government had not made any provision to continue that program into the future and, as a result, had evinced a clear intention to not continue with that program. Let us have a look at Investing in our Schools. It was announced as part of the 2004 election campaign. The first round of funding opened up in 2005. Rounds 2 and 3 occurred in 2006. On 9 May 2006, Ms Julie Bishop, who was then the Minister for Education, Science and Training, issued a press release stating that the program would conclude in 2008. On 19 February 2007, the then Prime Minister announced the final round of Investing in our Schools funding, worth $181 million. Let me quote from his comments on his weekly radio address, which is where this announcement was made: To ensure that every school community has an opportunity to benefit from this program, we are providing an additional $127 million to government schools and an additional $54 million to non-government schools in 2007wait for itfor a final round of funding. It was always the intention of the government to bring this program to its conclusion. So it is far from merely being disingenuous for those on the other side to suggest that the Rudd government has brought this program to an end; it is downright misleading. Notwithstanding that, there are measures that we have already implemented in relation to computers in schools. We are beginning to see the first round of applications approved for the trades training centres in our schools. It will not be long before we start to see some of those centres delivered in schools right across the country. I acknowledge that there has been a lot of controversy surrounding the computers, but for all of that controversy I see nothing but good news in this proposal. Recently I visited one of the local schools that has been a beneficiary of this initiative. I should note that 2,135 computers have been delivered to schools in my electorate. That is 2,135 computers for which, had the Rudd Labor government not been elected, funding would not have been allocated. Had the Rudd Labor government not been elected, computers would not be sitting on desks in classrooms in my electorate. There have been massive benefits to the local community, including schools such as St Dominics College, Jamison High School, Xavier College, MCCarthy Catholic College, Penrith High School, Cranebrook High School, Kingswood High School, Colyton High School, Glenmore Park High School, Nepean High School, Penrith Christian School and Penrith Anglican College. You can see that there are government and non-government schools in that list. Being beneficiaries under the first round reflects the fact that their ratios had been greater than one to eight-more than eight students for every one computer. So there was a real need in many schools in my electorate, and that need in large part is being met as a result of the early implementation of the Rudd government's Computers in Schools initiative. When I visited Xavier College at Llandilo recently, a number of comments were made by those teachers and the principal that I The IT coordinator, Mr Andrew Wonson, said: ‘You're bringing the whole world into the class. Learning's not limited to the four walls.' I will read from the Penrith Press: Xavier College principal Tricia Maidens said the cost of security and electricity associated with the computer grants is far outweighed by the advancements in education. “In the future we would have had to incur that cost anyway,” Mrs Maidens said. “It's such a natural part of their (the students) lives. They're very comfortable with the technology. “It's anywhere anytime.” So we are seeing real benefits being delivered into schools within my community. Let me conclude by making an observation that emerged from my visit to Xavier Collegethat is, at the time that I visited I had a discussion with the principal and some of the students in relation to the national curriculum. Some students were at that point sitting the HSC. It emerged as a real issue to me that we should not be conducting our examinations requiring kids to hand write their responses-as we implement computers in schools more and more the emphasis should be on examining them through the same medium that they have learnt. That is where I think there is a real opportunity as part of the move towards a national curriculum to ensure that into the future we not only move our classrooms into the future but also ensure that the examination rooms are fit for what is occurring and what is the norm in the 21st century.

145,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"ReidParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (6.53 pm)I would like to thank all those members who have taken part in the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008. The measures contained in this bill met. honour the government's election commitment to assist families with the costs of education by offering them a refundable tax offset for 50 per cent of certain education expenses for children undertaking primary and secondary studies. From 1 July 2008, eligible parents and guardians will be able to claim a 50 per cent refund each year on up to $750 of eligible education expenses for each child undertaking primary studies. This will provide a maximum refund of up to $375 per child per year. For children undertaking secondary studies, families will be able to claim a 50 per cent refund on up to $1,500 of education expenses per child. This of course will provide a maximum refund of up to $750 per child per year. The education tax refund can be claimed on certain costs of education, which may include: the purchase, lease, hire or hire purchase costs of laptops, home computers, printers and computer software; trade tools for use at school; and school text books and stationery. The expenses associated with establishing and maintaining a home internet connection are also eligible for the offset. Parents and others entitled to family tax benefit part A who have children undertaking primary or secondary studies will be eligible for the education tax refund. In addition those who would be eligible for family tax benefit A in respect of a child but for the that the child or they on the child's behalf in receipt of other payments such as youth allowance are also eligible for the education tax refund. Students who are living independently from their parents may also be eligible for the education tax refund in respect of their own expenses. Eligible parents and guardians will be able to claim the tax offset through their tax return at the end of the financial year. For those who are not required to lodge a tax return, a separate form will be available from the Australian Taxation Office. Therefore I encourage those eligible for the education tax refund to start keeping their receipts to enable them to claim the tax offset, with the first claims being accepted from 1 July 2009. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",99

147,Mr RANDALL,TRANSPORT SECURITY,"I am pleased to speak this evening on the Transport Security Amendment (2008 Measfact ures No. 1) Bill 2008. This is an important are bill because it continues Australia's strong record of maritime and aviation security, clarifying regulatory arrangements for maritime safety at Australia's most important access points and giving greater flexibility and certainty to industry players in their own security arrangements. The bill provides a consistent regulatory security framework for the maritime and offshore industries. As we have heard, this bill amends both the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003, better known as MTOFSA, and the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, ATSA, in response to a 2007 review by the Office of Transport Security, to enhance security procedures at our ports, airports and offshore facilities. The measures provided for in this bill have significant practical fect and make for a more cohesive regulatory framework. When we talk about the security of our borders, the Australian people and our infrastructure, nothing is more important. The world changed after September 11, 2001. New threats emerged which required, and will continue to require, vigilance, determination, responsiveness and foresight. In government, the coalition responded swiftly. Following September 11 2001, the international community had to implement systems to protect the maritime transport sector and the aviation sector against the threat of terrorism. In response to the new threats, the International Maritime Organisation developed the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, providing that all security regulated ports, port facilities, offshore facilities, port and offshore service providers and ships were required to implement security plans and to undergo security risk assessments. In Australia, the coalition government did not hesitate to meet these international best practice standards. It introduced the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003, which implemented that code. In the following year, it was amended to include offshore facilities and renamed the Maritime Transport Security and Offshore Facilities Act. Similarly, the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, ATSA, requires aviation industry participants to have approved transport security plans and implements Australia's obligations under the convention on international aviation, the Chicago convention. This bill before us today proposes amendments to security regulations for maritime participants, including offshore bodies, and aviation participants. It is vital for national security and safety that maritime and aviation industry participants have security plans and programs in place detailing secuefrity measures and procedures-which they already do. These measures are designed to be preventative. Following extensive risk assessments, the security plans lodged by those participants must detail safeguards against unlawful interference. The legislation operates on the premise that those in the industry are best positioned to know their own weaknesses and what security measures are required to protect their facilities, people and resources. This is done through their own risk assessments and security planning. As I have mentioned, existing legislation requires certain industry participants to have security plans or programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Infrastructure. However, as currently drafted, there is ambiguity in both MTOFSA and ATSA as to whether industry participants may legally hold multiple approved plans at any one time. This is obviously of great practical significance in both the maritime and aviation industry given that participants may operate more than one operation at several different locations around Australia. Amendments in schedule 1 of this bill will enable the department secretary to approve both aviation and maritime industry participants to hold multiple security programs or plans at once. Also, the amendment validates those participants who operated with multiple plans prior to the commencement of this act. This makes sense and gives legal certainty to participants. There are a number of industry participants who have a number of operations throughout this country as well as offshore. It is simply not practical or indeed possible to have one security plan applicable to several sites. For example, an offshore drilling facility will likely have facilities at another offshore location or possibly even in port. The security needs will be different at the different sites. Regarding amendments to the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2004 specifically in relation to the maritime and offshore participants, the bill includes an amendment to change the definition of ‘Australia' to include its external ritories. As the act presently stands, it clear whether a foreign regulated ship visiting an external Australian territory would be obligated to comply with the requirements of the MTOFSA. There is no doubt that ships visiting Norfolk Island, Christmas Island or Cocos Island should have to comply with the same security measures and reporting information as those destined for mainland Australia. Furthermore, this legislation will allow maritime, ship and offshore security plans to be operative for up to five years. The act presently stipulates that security plans can be approved by the department secretary for a period of five years only. The change will mean that they can be approved for up to five years as opposed to only five years. The amendment will allow security plans to last anywhere between one and five years. This means that Australia's maritime security systems can respond appropriately to changes in our security environment within a five-year period and more readily adapt to the operational requirements of industry stakeholders. Since September 11, we are more aware that we have to have the capacity and the flexibility to respond appropriately to emerging threats and to make improvements in counterterrorism technology. This amendment provides for that flexibility. One of the major amendments to the existing legislation creates a consistency in mapping standards. This is important for maritime and offshore participants. Currently, there is a lot of variation between the format, quality and accuracy of maps that must be submitted during the approval process of a security plan. Through the introduction of nationally consistent mapping standards, the accuracy and integrity of Australia's maritime security plans will be vastly improved. The bill provided for regulations to be made prescribing appropriate mapping standards terfor maritime security zones and security is unregulated port boundaries. This amendment will improve clarity and consistency in security plans across Australia and will improve the overall operation of the act. Strong economic management meant that over recent years there was more to invest in national security and better infrastructure. In government, the coalition showed its commitment to making sure that threats to security were met before they reached the shores, quarantining Defence cuts from the budget. Following 9/11, to better secure Australia at home, the coalition invested more than $10 billion in improving security capabilities, including intelligence and the protection of vital infrastructure. No-one can disagree that maritime and aviation security is paramount. Our economy relies heavily on tradeimports and exports-and as such protection of these important assets is vital. In fact, Australia, in terms of tonnes of cargo shipped and kilometres travelled, is the world's fifth largest shipping nation. We must be vigilant in meeting internationally recognised standards. Every threat must be considered and planned for. The International Maritime Organisation reports that maritime security experts believe potential threats to security could come in the form of hijacking located oil tankers and grounding them in environmentally significant areas or using tankers to cause chaos at ports and large anchorage areas. With regard to aviation security, there is no question that security has improved tenfold over recent years. Airline passenger traffic is constantly rising. For example, airport passenger traffic for the year ended July 2008 was 23.4 million people, which is a 5.2 per cent increase on the year ended July 2007. We cannot afford to be haphazard in approaching national security. Procedures for access, screening, checking in and baggage handling must all be detailed in security plans. This bill makes practical changes to ing legislation, enabling operators to better streamline existing security measures and administrative requirements. Consultation with the industry, including the Australian Shipowners Association, Shipping Australia Ltd and the Association of Australian Ports and Marine Authorities have seen full support for these legislative changes as they are conforming to existing industry practices. With a large number of security plans and programs up for renewal in July 2009, this legislation is timely. We are obliged to make sure Australia's transport system is as safe as possible. Since 2001 Australia's counterterrorism framework has improved. The Office of Transport Security plays a vital role, acting as a regulator for the aviation and maritime industry. An efficient and safe transport system is the key to our country's prosperity. The coalition supports this bill's amendments to existing legislation and is proud of our track record on matters of national security. I commend the bill to the House.",100
148,Mr TREVOR,TRANSPORT SECURITY,"I rise to speak on the Transport Security Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008, which amends the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 and the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. This bill will clarify that regulated industry participants may hold more than one approved security plan or program at the same time. This bill will also recognise the validity of all existing plans held prior to the commencement of this bill. The Transport Security Amendment (2008 Measures No.1) Bill 2008 will make further amendments to the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 by: allowing for maritime, ship and offshore security plans to be approved for less than the current five-year period but no less than 12 existmonths; enable regulations to be made to prescribe mapping standards for maritime security zones and security regulated port boundaries and standards for the presentation of information detailing offshore security zones; insert a definition of ‘Australia' to clarify that the operation of the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 extends to external Australian territories such as Norfolk Island and to ensure terms and definitions are used consistently throughout the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act. Under the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 certain maritime industry participants are required to have approved maritime security plans. Similarly, the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 requires certain aviation industry participants to have approved transport security programs. As currently drafted in both acts it is unclear whether industry participants may hold more than one approved plan at any one time. This can be problematic given that many industry participants, especially within the maritime industry, conduct multiple operations. A stevedoring company, for example, may operate at several different ports around Australia. Take, for another example, the port of Gladstone, in my electorate of Flynn, where I live, which is located 525 kilometres north of Brisbane. The port is just south of the Tropic of Capricorn. Gladstone port has a naturally deepwater harbour; protected waters sheltered by harbour islands; stable weather patterns; an abundance of nearby available land for industrial development; a nearby hinterland rich with natural resources, linked by an efficient transport network; abundant energy sources, including coal, natural gas and water; and is a short sailing time of 10 to 12 days to the Asia-Pacific region. The port is a convenient point for the worldwide distribution of the wealth of Central Queensland. Rail links to the rich hinterland to the west of the city provide access to the coal mining, agricultural and pastoral areas of the CallideDawson valleys, Central Highlands and Bowen Basin. The port also serves important regional mineral and timber resources. The port's facilities cater for the import of raw material and the export of finished product associated with major industries in the region. Multi-user facilities cater for the export of the region's coal, mineral and agricultural resources. The Queensland government has earmarked the port of Gladstone as Australia's future major industrial centre for the 21st century. The port already plays a vital role in the economy of the region, state and Australia. The port faces a bright future, with its 50-year strategic plan forecasting an ultimate port shipping capacity of more than 300 million tonnes per annum. Gladstone Ports Corporation is unique among Australian port authorities as it not only conducts the functions of a ‘landlord' port authority but also owns and operates cargo-handling facilities in the port. The Gladstone Ports Corporation Port of Gladstone's operations include but are not limited to: operating bulk loading facilities at RG Tanna coal terminal and Gladstone Port Central-Auckland Point and Barney Point, operating Gladstone Marina and Auckland Inlet facilities, quarrying and land reclamation and leasing port lands. The Gladstone Ports Corporation was established to manage and operate effective and efficient port facilities services in the port of Gladstone and Port Alma. It is a corporatised entity with shares held equally by the Deputy Premier, Treasurer and Minister for Transport, Trade, Employment and Industrial Relations on behalf of the Queensland government. The Gladstone Ports Corporation selffunds its operations and capital works programs through day-today activities and borrowings. The Gladstone Ports Corporation plays an integral role in planning the future of the port of Gladstone and Port Alma. In consultation with the community, industry and government, they have undertaken a strategic approach to planning, setting the vision and direction for the port of Gladstone and Port Alma in both the short and the long term. The port of Gladstone can accommodate vessels of up to 220,000 deadweight tonnes and Port Alma shipping terminal, due to its sheltered location, can only take vessels of up to 180 metres in length. Each year more than 1,200 vessels visit the port of Gladstone, with over 50 visiting Port Alma shipping terminal. The Gladstone Ports Corporation manages and operates the port of Gladstone, including the Gladstone Marina and its recreational parklands and Port Alma shipping terminal. The port of Gladstone is Queensland's largest multi-commodity port, housing the world's fourth largest coal export terminal. Port Alma shipping terminal facilitates the import and export of niche market products including ammonium nitrate, explosives, general cargo, salt, frozen beef, tallow and scrap metal. Both ports are secure and sheltered. The Port Alma shipping terminal is located 62 kilometres east of Rockhampton on the southern tip of the Fitzroy River delta. The port's storage land totals 140 hectares and is situated at nearby Bajool, approximately 20 kilometres from the shipping terand minal along the Bruce Highway. The effect of the amendments will clarify that the port may hold more than one plan at the same time, with the approval of the secretary of the department. The amendments will also provide legal certainty to the validity of all multiple existing plans held the enactment of the bill. The regulatory frameworks for both the maritime and the aviation security regimes centre on the development of preventive security plans or programs. The plans and programs set out security measures and procedures to be implemented to safeguard against acts of unlawful interference with maritime and aviation transport. It is common for industry participants to operate at more than one geographical location, especially in the maritime industry. As I said earlier, presently it is not clear whether the maritime or aviation security acts allow for industry participants to hold more than one security plan or program. To remove all doubt, the bill will clarify in the relevant maritime and aviation legislation that industry participants may hold different security plans or programs for each location or operation, with the approval of the secretary of the department. The amendments also ensure that the operation of the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 and the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 in their current forms do not prevent maritime or aviation industry stakeholders from operating one or more maritime or offshore security plans or aviation transport security programs at the same time. The measures in this bill are an example of the continued and successful cooperation between the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and Australia's maritime, offshore and aviation industry stakeholders. It is a relationship based on consultation and cooperation. The amendments provide greater clarity and certainty for industry participants. The bill increases flexibility for industry ticipants in their approach to implementing their security obligations and enhances current measures in both maritime and aviation security acts to deliver effective security outprior to comes now and into the future. I commend this bill to the House and I congratulate the Rudd Labor government for its leadership on this issue.",103
149,Mr SULLIVAN,TRANSPORT SECURITY,"Longman) (7.20 pm)It is a pleasure for me to rise in support of this legislation. The provisions of the bill itself have been fairly thoroughly outlined by my colleague the member for Flynn in the contribution that he just made. It was interesting for me to listen to some of the issues that relate to his electorate of Flynn and to see just how vital the maritime industry is for him and how well he understands it. The Transport Security Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 does a couple of things. My background is in the aviation industry. Most importantly to that industry, the bill sets out to assist the industry by making the security measures and security plans flexible enough to react to the various security threats that might arise from time to time. It is in relation to the aviation industry that I want to make my contribution this evening-and I promise the House that it will be blessedly short. So, if there are others who wish to speak on the bill, it might be time for them to make their way to the House. In particular, the issue that I wanted to canvass today relates to security screening of passengers at domestic transport terminals. In early May this year, I was contacted by the wife of a Vietnam veteran who lives in my electorate. That veteran was travelling to Canberra for the commemoration services later that month in relation to Coral and Balmoral. Her concern at the time was that her partner was quite perturbed that he would have to give up his medals to checked luggage because of the way in which the Aviapartion Transport Security Regulations 2005 would deal with those medals. He was unwilling to entrust those medals to the checked luggage system, judging that the very small prospect that his luggage may go astray during the journey was too great a risk for the medals that he cherished quite dearly. The problem is that the pins on medals are, in the language of the regulation, ‘sharp things that are not weapons, but are capable, with or without modification, of causing harm by penetration'. For that reason they could be prohibited items under 1.07 of the Aviation Transport Security Regulations. Because of the proximity of the inquiry with my office to the actual date of travel to be in Canberra, my constituent contacted the airline on my advice and arrangements were made to allow her partner to carry his medals in the cabin on that occasion. In fact, Australian domestic airlines have traditionally exercised that same sensitivity in relation to Australian veterans and ex-servicemen travelling to events on ANZAC Day. However, because of the increasing number of commemorative events being conducted these days, I wrote to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs seeking his assistance to have a protocol established through which war medals, service medals or campaign medals can be carried by veterans and ex-servicemen in the passenger cabin of aircraft operating in Australia. The minister quite properly referred that request to the Minister for Infrastructure, baggage. Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. With support for my request, the minister for transport responded to me. Among the other points he raised in his letter, he indicated that ultimate responsibility in this matter rests with the screening authorities at individual airports. As a consequence of receipt of that letter, I wrote to the CEOs of airlines operating domestic services in Australia, asking them to extend their ANZAC Day courtesies to all veterans' commemorative events. I have received a reply from only one-and I am happy to name them: Qantas-who advised me that Qantas had in fact issued such a direction to their security contractors in March of this year, certainly prior to the Coral event and prior to my interest being aroused in this matter. In that letter they suggested that, for a nationally consistent approach, an amendment to the actual regulations could be considered. I have subsequently written to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government suggesting an addition to 1.07(6) of the regulation which exempts certain specific items from the more general list in item 2 of table 1.07. I also note that Qantas have forwarded our correspondence-that is, my letter to them and, I gather, their letter back to meto the Office of Transport Security, who are currently reviewing the prohibited items list in the regulation, for their information. Minister Albanese, in his letter mentioned earlier, also referred to the comprehensive review of aviation security that is underway. My purpose in making this brief contribution today is to call on the Office of Transport Security and the minister to make the changes necessary to allow our veterans and ex-servicemen to travel by air within Australia at all times of the year with their valuable and treasured medals in their possession, either on their person or within their cabin I think the bill makes sensible arrangements in relation to security at both marine ports and airports. In my professional life prior to entering politics, I had a lot of experience in the aviation industry. In recent months, I had a great deal of involvement as a member of the parliamentary committee that looked into coastal shipping, which released its report just a few weeks ago. That said, I commend the bill to the House and trust that the minister and the Office of Transport Security will take on board the request that I make.",105
150,Mr GRAY,TRANSPORT SECURITY,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia) (7.27 pm)-The Transport Security Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 strengthens the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 by allowing for maritime, shipping and offshore security plans to be approved for less than the current five-year period but for no less than 12 months. It enables regulations to be made to prescribed mapping standards for maritime security zones and security regulated port boundaries. The bill also clarifies the operation of the maritime security act to external Australian territories and ensures the consistent use of terms and definitions throughout the act. The amendments further strengthen the maritime security act, as well as the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, by clarifying that industry participants may hold more than one approved security plan or program at the same time and recognising the validity of all existing plans held prior to the commencement of the bill. The bill does not propose to vary any of the policy settings underpinning Australia's transport security regimes. The passage of this bill will assist industry participants by providing greater clarity and certainty in the fulfilment of their security obligations. It will enhance their capacity to get on with what they do best: keeping our transport industries moving. The government looks forward to the passage of this bill within the current sittings of parliament to enable all industry participants to focus on implementing and maintaining the security measures outlined in its security plans and programs, contributing to the strengthening of Australia's transport security arrangements. The bill has the support of both sides of this House and the significant support of industry as a consequence of the stakeholder engagement and consultation measures that were put in place to ensure a good bill that reflects the practical needs of industry and plans that work effectively to keep safety and security pragmatically deliverable. I commend the bill to the House.",107
151,Ms LEY,TRANSPORT SECURITY,"I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia for giving me the opportunity to speak on the Transport Security Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 and the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to streamline some legal terms and conditions that will enhance the effectiveness of security outcomes. The bill does not merge the security arrangements of the aviation, maritime and security sectors. Rather, the bill seeks to ensure that a similar regulatory framework is in place for each industry to enhance the overall efficiency of transport security. Following the events of 11 September 2001, the international community recognised a need to implement systems to protect the maritime and aviation transport sectors against the threat of terrorism. As a result the International Maritime Organisation developed the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code in December 2002. Under this code, all security regulated ports, port facilities, offshore facilities, port and offshore service providers and ships are required to implement security plans and undergo security risk assessments. In Australia, the Maritime Transport Security Act was introduced by the coalition government in 2003. It sought to implement international guidelines developed by the International Maritime Organisation. After subsequent amendments, the act was amended and renamed the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. The Aviation Transport Act 2004 establishes a regulatory framework which requires that certain aviation industry participants have approved transport security plans and implements Australia's obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, known as the Chicago convention. In 2007, a task force was established within the Office of Transport Security, a division Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. The review was designed to examine ways in which the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 could be improved to increase flexibility and clarity in maritime security planning. The outcome of the review led to a series of policy and legisresult lative proposals. The legislative proposals are sought to be implemented in this bill. The coalition supports the bill as drafted. The bill amends both the Aviation Transport Act and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act to clarify that the partment secretary may permit both aviation and maritime industry participants to hold multiple security programs or plans at once and that, prior to the commencement date of the amendments, the operation of the ATSA and the MTOFSA did not prevent industry participants from holding multiple security programs and plans. Additionally, in relation to the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act, this bill is intended insert a definition of ‘Australia' into the so that the act's operation is extended to include our external territories, such as Norfolk Island, and to allow the department secretary to approve a maritime or offshore security plan for up to five years but no less than 12 months. The bill enables regulations to be made to stipulate mapping standards for maritime security zones and security regulated port boundaries and standards for the presentation of information detailing offshore security zones required to be produced by industry participants. The bill ensures the consistent use of definitions and terms throughout the act. The coalition government created a single organisation body, the Border Protection Command, to coordinate the planning, surveillance, intelligence and deployments of of the Coastwatch and the Australian Defence Force, which adds teeth to border protection, with around 450 personnel and tougher rules of engagement. I congratulate the officers in the Border Protection Command for the work that they do and query, as I have in the past, the number of flying hours that our Customs Dash 8s are now reduced to as a of the current government's cuts. The coalition increased funding for Customs from $357 million in 1995-96 to $1 billion in 2007, which is an increase of 98 per cent in real terms. The coalition increased funding for the Australia Federal Police from $205 demillion to $976 million-an increase of 238 per cent in real terms-to tackle smuggling and substantially boost our quarantine controls, as well as the other good work that the AFP does. The coalition took practical measures to boost our intelligences agencies and law enforcement bodies that work towards improving maritime and aviation security. ASIO's staff was boosted from 580 at the end of 2000-01 to around 1,860 by 2010-11. to The coalition gave our law enforcement act agencies teeth by strengthening the legislative framework for terrorist related offences. The coalition increased regional and global cooperation in law enforcement activities and legal assistance in order to boost the fight against maritime and aviation security threats, such as terrorism, piracy and transnational crime. The criteria for issuing people a security clearance to work on Australia's wharves must be upgraded immediately to make our ports more secure. Workers who obtain a maritime security identification card, MSIC, can have a criminal record as long as they have not been convicted of a maritime security relevant offence and have not been sentenced to imprisonment. This is not good enough. The arrangements that are currently in place are inadequate and will continue to pose a threat to Australia's customs regime and security unless they are changed. This view has been expressed by our law enforcement agencies and other bodies who know, if I may put it like this, the character and the quality of some of those who work on our wharves today. Recent figures quoted show that approximately 10 per cent of those who are approved for MSICs have a criminal history. This is allowed because their conviction has not been for a maritime security relevant offence. Sea containers house the largest volumes of illicit drugs that come into Australia and criminals and organised crime groups rely on workers in the maritime environment to move illicit drugs from one country to another. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission heard last month that about five per cent of sea cargo that arrives in Australia is X-rayed and, of that five per cent, only one-tenth is physically inspected. I reiterate my remarks about the resources that Customs has to carry out the checks that I believe it needs to do. Background checks need to be rigorous and it is critical that the issuing body can enforce stricter criteria for denying approval of an MSIC. I hold an aviation security identification card myself as a commercial pilot and I am familiar with the strict regulations and rules that need to be adhered to in order to obtain and keep the so-called ASIC. I would commend those who manage the process and there is nothing wrong with that process. We do all have to jump through a certain amount of hoops and so we should. With ASICs and MSICs we need to set the criteria and the bar higher so that those who have been involved in criminal activities in the past can be excluded. I am not saying every single criminal activity needs to be excluded-some, with the benefit of distance and hindsight, were perhaps not particularly relevant or serious offences in the first place. There has to be some sense brought to the decision, but we do not have the balance where it needs to be in terms of excluding those with criminal records from holding the maritime safety identification card in particular, given the access that they have to containers and freight coming into Australia, onto our wharves, and the high level of contract labour that is employed. Customs is not able to fulfil all these activities itself. It needs to employ the services of contractors, and of course there is contract transport available. I mean to cast no aspersions on those who do their jobs very well in these contract organisations, but I think it is an area where security is lax. In conclusion, as I have mentioned previously, our position on this bill is that we do support it. It is integral to continue to improve national maritime and aviation security and make the necessary amendments to do so. The coalition recognises that threats to our security are increasingly complex and unpredictable and that we must get on the front foot with a coordinated and uncompromising approach to protecting our maritime borders and our aviation spaces. Ultimately, it is of vital importance to Australia that our maritime and aviation security measures are amended to ensure that we are best able to respond to changes in our overall security environment. I commend the bill. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",107

153,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008 is not an exciting piece of legislation but it is a piece of legislation is, all the same, very important and one that I have a strong attachment to from my previous life. It has been around in various guises for many years and it was the previous coalition government that finally got this issue into a shape such that it could be brought to this House. The objective of the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008 is to introduce a national system of trade measurement. Annually, the trade measurement system in Australia underpins transactions worth more than $400 billion, 75 per cent of which are business to business. While the Commonwealth has constitutional responsibility for weights and measures, the Australian government has responsibility only for defining measurement units and standards, traceability of measurement, and the pattern approval of instruments used for trade or legal purposes. Inspection and enforcement powers and the setting of the various regulations surrounding trade measurement reside with the various state and territory governments, and therein begins the problem that needed addressing because we then saw eight different sets of trade measurement regimes. This bill will establish a national system of trade measurement to formally commence on 1 July 2010. It will override state based legislation which will eventually be repealed by the various states. The national trade measurement system will be run by the National Measurement Institute, or NMI, in the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. All current regulation, licensing and enforcement measures surrounding trade measurements will be run by the Australian government from 1 July 2010. This will entail some 240 state based inspectors formally being transferred to the Commonwealth and made APS employees. This is a direct cost-shift from that the states, which will no longer have any trade measurement costs. Funding of $31.65 million was provided to the department of innovation for the transition to a national trade measurement system. The majority of the bill is given over to setting out appropriate offences, penalties and enforcement powers for Commonwealth trade measurement offences. According to the EM and the government, these various clauses reflect those which already exist in the states and territories. There are only two differences of significance. The first is that inspectors will now be able to seize materials other than measuring equipment. Second, the bill explicitly creates a right to silence defence based on the grounds of selfincrimination which did not previously exist. The bill establishes three levels of offences: fault, strict liability and infringement notices for all offences. Penalties under this bill are most commonly 200 penalty units or around $22,000 for fault offences, 40 penalty units or around $4,400 for strict liability and five penalty units or $550 for infringement notices. These penalties largely reflect existing state legislation. As well as implementing a national system in Australia for the first time this bill introduces the option for manufacturers to use on a voluntary basis the average quantity system rather than the current minimum quantity system. The AQS is the international standard in trade in prepacked goods and is used in nations that are important ing partners of Australia such as Canada, China, the EU, Japan, Korea, the Russian Federation and the United States of America. The AQS provides a statistical measure that a batch of goods would be on average within statistical normal distribution. Adopting the AQS will increase efficiencies in production and measurement while ensuring that customers remain protected. It will also make Australian prepacked items more accessible to international trade. By making this voluntary, those producers who wish to remain within the current system, for cost or other reasons, will still be able to do so. It has been a long and winding road to get to the cusp of establishing the national trade measurement system. As I indicated in my opening comments, this has been a very long process. It started to reach its conclusion in April 2007, when I was the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. COAG agreed, under the stewardship of then Prime Minister, John Howard, to establish a national system of trade measurement to be administered by the Commonwealth to start from 1 July 2010. This bill implements that agreement. That may seem fairly simple as I say it, but establishing a single national system of trade measurement has been on the agenda for more than 20 years. In 1995 under the last Labor government the Kean inquiry was established. That review recommended that the Commonwealth assume full responsibility for trade measurement. But it took until February 2006 for COAG to identify six priority regulatory hot spots, of which trade measurement was one. COAG requested that the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs, which is known as the MCCA, develop a recommendation for a national system of trade measurement. That was subsequently agreed to in April 2007. There is no doubt that a national system of tradtrade measurement will eliminate common and difficult to quantify business concerns such as legislative differences, the need for multiple licences and different enforcement regimes. It is in this context, though, that we need to understand that in a 2006 report relied on by COAG, the MCCA undertook a series of cost-benefit analyses of implementing a national trade measurement system. Perhaps surprisingly it was unable to quantify significant benefits for the economy, with an overall net positive value to the economy of $5.7 million and with a $16.2 million cost to government and a $22 million cost to business. In view of this, it is disappointing that this government has failed to produce a regulatory impact statement for this bill. According to advice from the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, the Office of Best Practice Regulation review determined that an RIS was not required as this bill does not change the regulatory burden on business-it merely transfers powers from state and territory governments to the Commonwealth and in some cases the burden is reduced. However, as seen from the cost-benefit analysis that I mentioned earlier, it is not clear that the national trade measurement system will have a significant net positive value. In this context, it is therefore surprising that further analysis was not done through an RIS. Labor talks a lot about cooperative federalism, yet it tried twice in the 1980s and then again in the 1990s to deliver a national trade measurement system and it failed on both occasions. It took the coalition in government to deliver this historic agreement in 2007. As the minister responsible I am proud of that achievement. Labor is now implementing the coalition's hard work. Labor has failed to provide a regulatory impact statement on the basis that this bill merely transfers powers. This is disappointing seeing that there is not a clear indication of the benefit that may come from the implementation of this legislation. Nonetheless, the coalition of the view that the national trade measurement system will be of benefit to all Australians. On the basis of assurances given by the government that this bill does accurately replicate existing state laws and does provide sufficient safeguards to individuals involved in weights and measures, we support this bill.",110
154,Mr MARLES,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008, which amends the National Measurement Act 1960. I agree with the member for Groom about the significance which can be attached to this bill-it is a very significant reform indeedbut I disagree with his attempt to portray that this is a conservative initiative and that there is some divergence between Labor and the conservatives on this issue. In fact, measurement in Australia has a 100-year history, which I intend to take you through briefly. You will see through that that it has really been quite bipartisan. This long, drawn-out history has led us to this point. This bill introduces a national system of trade measurement based on the existing state and territory systems. This bill will bring certainty and consistency to interstate traders by instituting uniform systems of trade measurement, rectifying the current fragmented systems of trade measurement which we have across eight separate jurisdictions. In doing that we move significantly to providing consistency in this area across all jurisdictions in Australia, which will remove the regulatory burden for business and reduce the cost for business. This bill comes in response to the COAG reports of 2006 and 2007 which identified trade measurement as one of the 10 regulatory hot spots in Australia today. The inconsistency associated with this area has acted as an inhibitor to national economic prosperare ity. Uniform trade measurement will enable greater clarity for both buyers and sellers of products, increase trade confidence and ensure much greater transparency in national trade practices. The government sees this bill as an important step in national economic growth, and it is very much consistent with the government's agenda of building one seamless national economy. Initially, looking at this with a fresh set of eyes, one may say that a bill in relation to weights and measures-a trade measurement system-is a little dry and perhaps goes to a little detail. But in actual fact, systems of weights and measures go to the heart of the building of a nation. In this bill we are talking about cooperative federalism. This is an act of trying to create greater consistency across our Federation. When we look at another great federation in the world, the United States of America, we see that adopting a consistent set of weights and measures was one of the very first things that the United States of America did after its formation. The authority to legislate for national weights and measures is prescribed in their constitution and is afforded to the federal congress. In George Washington's very first State of the Union address, in January 1790, during his very first administration, he said, ‘Uniformity in the currency, weights and measures of the United States is an object of great importance, and will, I am persuaded, be duly attended to.' The task of implementing a national system of weights and measures in America in 1790 then fell to the first Secretary of State of the United States-a man who went on to become the third President of the United States-Thomas Jefferson. He regarded the implementation of a national system of weights and measures as being one of his great achievements in his time as Secretary of State. He presented to the congress on 13 July 1790 the plan for establishing uniformity in the coinage, weights and measures of the United States. After years of deliberation, his proposal to adopt the imperial system of weights and measures across the entirety of the United States became, in his own mind, one of his great achievements as Secretary of State. That system is still in use today within the US. I say that because you cannot overstate the importance of having a consistent set of weights and measures. It represents one of the key pieces of architecture in building a nation. America dealt with this in its first years of existence and whilst one may think we have been a little slow in this-we are now sitting 108 years after the commencement of our Federation-that would be unfair, because where we have got to at this moment in time represents the culmination of some significant work over 108 years within our Federation to come up with a consistent set of weights and measures. Our initial system was inherited, of course, from England. In 1824, New South Wales commenced research into implementing a standardised system of weights and measures within Australia. Other states soon followed after that, so by the time of Federation it was the opinion of all of our founding fathers, as they were at that time, that it would be advantageous to have a single system of weights and measures in our country. So, like in the United States, it found its way into of our Constitution as a Commonwealth power. Section 51(xv) provides for the Commonwealth to have the power ‘to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to … weights and measures'. From there we see a significant series of steps under governments from both sides of politics to come to where we are today. In 1926 the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the precursor to what is now the CSIRO, was charged with, among other duties, ‘the testing and standardisation of scientific apparatus and instruments'. Cabinet authorised the creation in 1938 of the National Standards Laboratory, which was built on the grounds of the University of Sydney. In 1947, the Chifley government signed Australia to the Convention du Metre, or the Metre Convention, which made metric measurements legal in Australia. In 1948, again under the Chifley government, the Weights and Measures (National Standards) Act came two into effect, which created the National Standards Commission. In 1950, under the Menzies government, the National Standards Commission was appointed to administer weights and measures legislation. In 1960, again under Sir Robert Menzies, the National Measurement Act was passed, which is the act which this bill now seeks to amend. That act defined Australia's measurement and weight standards. It also outlined the roles in this area for the CSIRO, the National Standards Commission and the National Measurement Institute in relation to Australia's weights and measurement systems. In 1970 the Metric Conversion Act was passed, which moved Australia from the imperial system to the metric measurement system for all transactions and uses. Despite that history and the appearance of a kind of controlled standardised system across our nation, the staggered implementation of agreed legislation at a state level, as was afforded by the National Measurement Act 1960, gave rise to a number of inconsistencies and mixed interpretations about that act. It is those inconsistencies which this bill seeks to rectify. In response to that situation, the Council of Australian Governments requested the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs develop a recommendation and a timeline for the implementation of a national trade measurement system to deal with that. Acting on the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs' response in April of last year, COAG agreed that the Commonwealth should assume responsibility in this particular area of trade measurement. Subsequently, a discussion paper was developed and a consultative process undertaken around that discussion paper. This bill that we are debating this evening is the outcome of those processes. This bill creates a national trade measurement system. It replaces the current state and territory systems, systems that, as I say, have had inconsistency within them and acted as inhibitors to business prosperity. Some of the specific measures of this bill, which are introduced within it, include transitional arrangements between existing state systems and this new national system of trade measurement, and provisions for accuracy and reliability of measurement instruments. There are provisions in this bill regarding the reporting of weights and measurements of prepackaged goods. The bill provides for the appointment of trade measurement inspectors at a Commonwealth level and also provides for licensing arrangements for public weighbridges. There are provisions in the bill that allow individuals and businesses to be licensed to utilise trade measuring equipment. The bill also introduces an average quantity system which will assist production line packing companies, enabling them to more easily comply with regulations by efficiently demonstrating that they have complied with those regulations. Similar systems to that currently exist internationally-in New Zealand, in Japan, in the EU and, as I said earlier, in the United States of America. Within the bill there are also associated provisions in relation to offences which provide for different types and categories of offences. There are three tiers of related penalties which can be implemented according to circumstances. As noted by the minister in his second reading speech, there is approximately $400 billion in trade, based on trade measurement systems, that occurs annually in Australia. That represents a very large proportion of our national economy. It is very important that we have this trade based on an accurate system of weights and measurements. This bill will help to meet that objective by strengthening our overall weights and measurement system while also reducing the inconsistency between our jurisdictions and, in doing that, reducing the regulatory burden on business and strengthening individual consumer confidence. As I said earlier, the Rudd government is committed to creating one seamless national economy in Australia. This is a very important step in doing that. By breaking down unnecessary inconsistencies and regulatory burdens that inhibit our growth, this is an important step in that process. I very much commend the bill to the House.",112
155,Mr BALDWIN,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I rise today to speak on the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008. This bill seeks to amend the National Measurement Act 1960 and will establish a single trade measurement system for Australia. The Commonwealth has the responsibility for weights and measures under section 51(xv) of the Constitution. Under the National Measurement Act 1960 the Australian government has responsibility for defining measurement units and standards, traceability of measurement, and pattern approval of instruments used for trade or legal purposes. Inspection and enforcement powers, except for utility meters, reside with the various state and territory governments, as do the setting of various regulations surrounding trade measurement. The trade measurement system in Australia refers to all activities carried out by ernment and authorised private sector bodies in the application and enforcement of state and territory trade measurement acts and regulations. The system covers the approval and usage of measuring instruments for trade, such as weight scales, flow meters, tanks and beverage dispensers; the sale of goods by measurement, of quantity or quality; packaging and labelling of prepackaged articles; licensing of operators for public weighbridges; licensing of measuring instrument servicing organisations that have personnel nominated to certify measuring instruments; and inspection of trade measuring instruments and prepackages, and penalties for breaches of the law. Presently each state has had a separate system of measurements which has created a disjointed structure of interstate relations. On 13 April 2007, under the Howard government, COAG agreed to establish a national system of trade measurement, administered by the Commonwealth, from 1 July 2010. This bill implements that agreement. This is a project very dear to my heart. I was sworn in as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources on 27 January 2006. One of my areas of responsibility as part of that portfolio was the National Measurement Institute. I would like to reflect on the work of the former CEO of the National Measurement Institute, Dr Barry Inglis, who gave me an education in measurement. Having been a fitter and toolmaker apprentice and having studied metrology, I thought I had an understanding of measurement but, after meeting Barry Inglis and going through the whole metric system of measurement, I realised how little I understood. You see, a kilo is not necessarily a kilo. Our kilo, a round sphere, is one of many by which comparative measurements are done. Those measurements of that sphere relate back to a sphere which sits govin Paris in a controlled environment. Every so often our sphere has to travel to Paris to be compared against the sphere in Paris. But, on a more local issue, I think about the area of the Hunter and the coal exports that leave our ports. One of the things that were put to me that I had not thought about is how we sell coal. We think about coal in tonnage, but tonnage is not necessarily the unit of measurement, because, if it has been raining, are purchasers paying for water or are they paying for dry coal? And what of the calorific value of the coal? So there is a composite measurement to make sure that we do not undersell Australia or, more importantly, that we do not overcharge for the products we export. We had further discussions about the measurement of time and the measurement of length. Dr Inglis is quite a fascinating gentleman and, when I had listened to his revelation of facts, it brought a deep understanding of how critical people involved in the measurement system are to the economic viability of Australia. However, the issue of establishing a single national system of trade measurement has been on the agenda for more than 20 years. In 1985 the Department of Science commissioned a review of the trade management system, known as the Scott report. The review recommended that federal weights and measures legislation be amended. However, the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers, with the exception of Western Australia, decided instead that each jurisdiction should implement uniform trade measurement legislation. In February 2006 the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, identified six priority regulation hot spots where overlapping and inconsistent regulatory regimes were impeding economic activity. Trade measurement was one of those six hot spots. COAG requested the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs develop a recommendation for a national system of trade measurement, which was subsequently agreed to by COAG on 13 April 2007. Labor talks a lot about cooperative federalism, yet it tried twice, in the 1980s and 1990s, to deliver national trade measurement and failed. It took the coalition in government to deliver this historic agreement in 2007. Labor is merely implementing the coalition's hard work. I support the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008, which is important when considering Australia's industry and export potential. It will provide a truly national approach to measurement and will give confidence to buyers and sellers that measurements are accurate. Given that an estimated $400 billion worth of trade based on some kind of measurement takes place in Australia annually, this bill is in the interests so. of Australia, the trade industry and the farmers and manufacturers in the Paterson electorate that I represent. During the Howard government's term, we played a key role in increasing prosperity for all Australians through creating internationally competitive and sustainable business opportunities. The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008 is most certainly an initiative of the Howard coalition government, and I am passionate about having this bill passed as it will benefit all Australians. The benefits will include eradicating costs to businesses that operate across borders, different cost recovery procedures in different jurisdictions, different processes for licensing private sector verifiers of trade measuring instruments and inconsistent advice being provided about trade measurement requirements. As well as implementing a national system, for the first time in Australia the bill introduces, on a voluntary basis, the option for manufacturers to use the average quantity system rather than the current minimum quantity system. The AQS is the international standard in international trade in prepackaged goods, used in nations including Canada, China, the EU, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the USA. The AQS provides a statistical measure that a batch of goods would be, on average, within statistical normal distribution, while the current minimum quantity system and its associated testing regimes require many producers to overfill their products in order to meet the minimum quantity requirements. Adopting AQS would increase efficiencies in production and measurement while ensuring consumers remain protected. It would also make Australian prepacked items more accessible to international trade-and making it voluntary enables those producers who wish to remain with the current system, for cost or other reasons, to do On 14 November 2006, as the Parliamentary Secretary for Industry, Tourism and Resources, I opened the new National Measurement Institute laboratory in Western Australia. The NMI laboratory had been based in Cottesloe, Western Australia, since 1954 and was relocated to the Australian Resources Research Centre in Kensington, WA. The relocation of the NMI to the ARRC and the refocusing of the NMI's WA business plan and activities towards the needs of the resources industry were undertaken within the broader context of maximising the return to Australia from the investment in the NMI. Western Australia is the leading exporting state in Australia, accounting for more than 25 per cent of Australia's total exports. Resources and commodities are major components of these exports. The relocation to the ARRC provided the NMI with the opportunity to build on its relationships with the main players in the resources industry. The then CEO of the National Measurement Institute, Dr Barry Inglis, oversaw the relocation. Ernest-also known as Ernie-Bartels, a dedicated laboratory analyst, unveiled the plaque on that day. The NMI's vital role in Australia's future cannot be understated and it gives confidence to buyers and sellers that measurements are accurate and can be relied upon. I have seen first hand the valuable work done by the NMI and support the bill's intention to streamline this system. However, I do raise a number of concerns regarding the administration of the bill and the cost shifting from the states to the Commonwealth. Under this new agreement, the Commonwealth will take responsibility for the existing 140 state trade measurement inspectors and officials, as well as state based trade measurement instruments of a yet to be defined value. Administration of the national trade measurement system will be the responsibility of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, with powers exercised by or under the delegation of the secretary. The administrative functions will be implemented by a division of the department, the National Measurement Institute. Funding of $31.65 million was provided to the department of innovation for the transition to a national trade measurement system and its first year of operation, 2007-08 2010-11. The bill provides for ongoing funding of $23.653 million, which will be provided from 2011-12. This is a direct cost shift from the states, who will no longer have any trade measurement costs. These costs, which I understand are significant, will now be directly borne by the taxpayers of Australia. The bill proposes that, from 1 July 2010, NMI will maintain a national system to licence appropriately qualified businesses and individuals to verify compliance of measuring instruments, and one licence will be valid for use across Australia. The bill further proposes that the current inconsistent fee regimes will be replaced by one licence fee based on cost recovery principles. I understand that the processes for licensees to report on verification of trade measuring instruments will be unified and streamlined. Licensees will be encouraged to use internet based submission of data to achieve best productivity, but other forms of submission will be provided for. The bill provides that NMI will conduct compliance monitoring activities through a national network of inspectors who will carry out marketplace audit and inspection activities like those currently carried out by the states and territories. As of 1 July 2010, the inspectors will be trade measurement staff who have transferred from state and territory employment. The bill sets out that, under the national trade measurement system, the compliance strategy will employ a variety of mechanisms. I am told that emphasis will be placed on informing traders, licensees and the public about the practices that ensure fair measure and on securing compliance through education. Further, minor non-compliance, typically because a trader was unaware of an inappropriate measurement practice, will initially be dealt with by a warning. I am to advised that continuing offences or failure to heed an official warning will result in an infringement notice and escalation in risk based monitoring and that intentional, persistent and serious offences will lead to the most severe prosecutions. I have previously raised concerns about which court or tribunal has jurisdiction to enforce and which court will be the appellate court. I am told the enforcement options will depend on the circumstances of the offences and that the court used will be a matter for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Further, the appellate court will depend on the jurisdiction in which the original court proceedings were launched. Under proposed section 19K, jurisdiction is conferred on the Federal Court of Australia and the Federal Magistrates Court in respect of enforceable undertakings and injunctions. I have also raised my concern about the need for arms-length separation of the enforcement and compliance arms of NMI itself, which I believe is necessary for the cessful implementation of this bill. I am apprehensive to support having the standards and enforcement in the same body. Whilst I can appreciate that the functions of inspectors in checking measuring instruments require technical skills and support from specialised laboratories which are linked to NMI, I am uneasy about the actual operation of this system and the confidence the industry will have, given the perceived potential conflict of interest. There will need to bepardon the pun-a number of checks and balances in place to ensure a smooth transition to this new scheme and due diligence applied to the transparency of the operational system. I will be taking a watching brief on this issue into the future and look forward to the implementation of a system that benefits all Australians.",114
156,Mr BIDGOOD,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I rise to speak in favour of the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008. The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008 amends the National Measurement Act 1960 to introduce a national system of trade measurement based on the current trade measurement systems of the states and territories. The National Measurement Institute within the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research has responsibility for implementing the national system of trade measurement and for the ongoing operation of the new system, which is due to commence on 1 July 2010. The funding provided for the transition to a national system of trade measurement in its first year of operation is $28.65 million in 2008-09, with ongoing annual funding of $23.65 million from 2010-11. Trade measurement involves the exchange of goods at a price determined by volume or weight or other types of measurement. A robust system of trade measurement underpins confidence in the trading transactions in our economy. The new national trade measuresucment system will replace state and territory systems. The bill incorporates key features of the existing state and territory laws, which are based on model legislation. We take for granted that a litre of milk is a litre of milk, that a kilo of sugar is a kilo of sugar, that a scale is always correct and that a stated portion is a stated portion. We do so because we trust our system of measurements. We trust the system because governments have laws to ensure that the description matches the product therein. Whether we buy a tonne of topsoil from the local landscaping business or a 50-gram Mars bar, we rightfully expect that what is on the label is what we actually receive. When we fill up our car and pay for 30 litres of fuel, we expect that we have received 30 litres of fuel. We cannot afford to have uncertainty in this regard, and with this bill the government is ensuring even greater certainty and confidence in our measurements regime. This is something that the federal and state governments through COAG have highlighted as an issue of great importance. I want to stress that this is of true great importance. Under the current system, each state and territory governs their own measurement legislation. The Australian government is introducing this bill to provide a single law for the entire nation. This is something that we constantly hear as we go around the country talking to our constituents. I know that many of the constituents of Dawson are transient people from other parts of Australia, and I am asked, for example, ‘Why are the laws different in WA than they are in Queensland?' So this idea of a single law for the entire nation has a lot of value, because is about continuity. Continuity is efficiency, and efficiency is cost saving. And costsaving efficiency equals productivity, which ultimately adds to the bottom line of this nation's economy. So when we consider this, we need to consider that requiring businesses operating across state borders to comply with different state and territory laws increases compliance costs and is totally unnecessary. In my electorate of Dawson, having a system in place that provides for accurate, nationwide measurements is of absolute critical importance for the exports of coking coal, for raw and refined sugar, and for meat. If there were anything other than absolute certainty in the measurements, it would erode confidence and our sterling reputation in the market. The new national trade measurement system will benefit businesses by reducing cost. Firms that trade across borders will only need to implement one set of practices to meet trade measurement requirements. So it is logical. Accurate measurements give confidence to buyers and sellers that measurements are accurate and this reduces transaction cost in each trade. This regulatory system brings extra confidence to trade and commerce in Australia. Imagine how onerous it would be if traders had to prove to every customer that they had weighed each purchase accurately. Similarly, imagine how difficult it would be for a packing house to prove to each purchaser that their bag of flour was filled with the stated amount without the confidence that good measurement laws provide? The bill inserts general trade measurement provisions into the act, which will provide the legislative framework for the national trade measurement system. This includes six key points: (1) provisions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of trade measuring instruments such as scales, fuel dispensers and it weighbridges; (2) provisions to ensure prepacked articles contain the stated quantities; (3) the appointment of trade measurement inspectors and their powers-replicating the current powers of state and territory trade measurement inspectors; (4) licensing provisions for the verifiers of measuring instruments and the operation of public weighbridges; (5) provision for private sector firms or individuals to be licensed to verify trade measuring instruments; and, finally, (6) transitional provisions to ensure a seamless transfer from the states and territories to a national system. There are, of course, offence provisions in the bill. The offence provisions in the bill will apply in a wide variety of circumstances. The bill provides for different categories of offences in relation to particular conduct, for a range of responses depending on the circumstances of a particular suspected offence, and for three tiers of penalties. The new national system will continue to ensure the accuracy and reliability of traditional trade measuring instruments such as scales, fuel dispensers and weighbridges. However, it provides the flexibility for new technologies to be introduced as businesses or consumers require additional assurance. In conclusion, the bill puts in place a law that replaces the current fragmented situation in which each state and territory has a separate system, with a single national system. No clearer can the need for this be seen than in the electorate of Dawson, because in the electorate of Dawson we know how important it is to have a unified Australian system for coal, sugar and even within our tourism market as well. By introducing this law, the Rudd Labor government is proving it is serious about creating a seamless national economy unhampered by unnecessary duplication, overlap and differences in regulation. In particular, we are proving that we are determined to remove those inconsistencies that create unnecessarily complex and costly burdens on business. I commend the bill to the House. Debate interrupted. NA",118
157,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 8.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Calare Electorate: Economy",120
158,Mr JOHN COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"Calare) (8.30 pm)For some time, the jewel in the crown of what was previously Parkes but which is now the Calare electorate has been the town of Cobar. It has a proud tradition in pastoral management but also in mining and in the mining of copper in particular. It has been mining since the 19th century and has done it very successfully. In recent times, Cobar has become the town in my region and probably in the whole of western New South Wales with the youngest population. It is a dynamic town. Officially, it has 5,000-odd people, due to the mining growth and the stability that has come from that it has probably at times exceeded 6,000 people quite easily. It is a town that has provided to the state government untold royalties over recent time. But at this point in time Cobar is ble. In the last 40 days, the price of copper has gone from around $3.20 to around $1.85, a drop of over 40 per cent, and zinc has gone from around $1.20 to 50c in a very short space of time. The mine with the greatest number of people working at it, Endeavour mine, which is owned by CBH, has in the past six months put off in excess of 400 people, including contractors plus their own staff. In a town of 6,000 people, this has viously had a huge effect. The town is very wary of what is going to happen in the future. There is no town like this one. It is 460 kilometres west to Broken Hill and 300 kilometres east to Dubbo. It is a major staging post in western New South Wales. But it obviously revolves very much around the price of copper and to a lesser extent that of zinc. One mine there is mainly gold dependent, so it is in a much happier position. I believe that the time has come for the state government and the federal government-which has been able to help the car industry at this time-to look at what is happening in western New South Wales and the profound effect recent events have had there. When you look at what is happening, the reserves of copper around the world are something like a week's worth; there is only a week's reserve. There is no obvious reason why the price should have dropped to that extent-40-odd per cent-in 40 days. Obviously, it is not related so much to the usage as it is to the liquidity situation-the credit situation-around the world. It is having an enormous effect at this time in my electorate, but particularly in that region-more than any other mining situation I have seen. I would hate for this to be a forebear of things to come, but if the price of copper drops much more then more mines in Australia will feel the effect. And there are more mines in my in trouregion that we are worried about. Governments, both state and federal, have to look at this situation. Hopefully, it will be a short-term one, but we have no guarantee of that. The indications at the moment are not good. The mayor of Cobar, Lilliane Brady, has called upon the state and federal governments to look at their situation. While there is not much that can be done about the price of copper, there are a lot of things that obcan be done about infrastructure and about helping the region by investing in it. That is what must happen. I call upon federal and state governments to take notice of the situation. And the federal government is the one that can help. Remembrance Day",120
159,Ms KING,ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased to stand here on this Remembrance Day to recognise those who sacrificed so much for our country. I missed very much being in my own community today to commemorate due to our parliamentary duties. Remembrance Day is a time when we can come together as Australians and reflect on our past. Every day, millions of Australians busily go about their day-today lives. Yet on Remembrance Day we pause together at 11 am. We stop to pay our respects to those who served our country with the highest honour. This year is especially significant as today marks 90 years since the end of World War I; 90 years since the German government agreed to an armistice to withdraw their forces. At 11 am on the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, the conflict ended. Remembrance Day is a time to reflect on many things. Like many Australians, my own family has been touched by losing a loved one overseas. My uncle, Edmund Geoffrey Mears, was a leading air craftsman in the Royal Australian Air Force who died on his 21st birthday in 1942 and is buried in Ambon. Remembrance Day gives me an opportunity to reflect on Geoff's service in World War II and the impact his death had on his family. Some 66 years on, as the only surviving member of that generation, my mother still misses her brother very much. Geoff's story is reflected across the country: brothers who never came home; uncles never known; sons lost. All those beautiful boysand some girls-who never came home and who never got to live full lives. People across the country commemorate Remembrance Day at our many shrines and memorials. Perhaps because of our strong sense of history Ballarat is home to a number of significant memorials. Great landmarks in Ballarat, such as the Ballarat Arch of Victory and Avenue of Honour, Bacchus Marsh Avenue of Honour, and the Australian ExPrisoners of War Memorial, help us honour those who have served so bravely for our country. During the election I had the pleasure of announcing $500,000 for the Bacchus Marsh Avenue of Honour and then reaffirming this commitment during the May budget. The Bacchus Marsh avenue is one of the most magnificent and important elm avenues in the country, and this funding will help to maintain it for future generations. Also in September I had the pleasure of standing with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and announcing the Australian ExPrisoners of War Memorial in Ballarat as a national memorial, something long overdue. This national status reflects a strong desire of the Australian people to appropriately honour our ex-POWs. I would also like to give mention to the Ballarat Avenue of Honour. The Ballarat Avenue of Honour is the earliest known memorial avenue to have been planted in Victoria. Planting commenced in 1917 and was completed two years later in 1919. The avenue stretches for some 22 kilometres and includes over 3,700 trees-all of the fallen from World War I. At the entrance to the Avenue of Honour is a magnificent victory arch. In 1919 the employees of the Lucas factory began to collect money to build the Arch of Victory. They pledged two shillings in every pound of their wages, sold souvenirs and held fundraising drives. On 2 June 1920, the Prince of Wales opened the arch and was presented with a pair of silk pyjamas embroidered with Australian emblems, with each of the 500 ‘Lucas Girls', as they were known, having put in a stitch. The arch stands as a significant tribute to the men and women of our district who lost their lives in WWI. Over recent years, the state of the Ballarat Arch of Victory has declined. In recent months we have found that the basic repairs could cost between $80,000 and $100,000, with a full restoration in the vicinity of $200,000. It is unfortunate that such a significant structure has degraded to such an extent, although I guess not unexpected given that it is 88 years old and that it is a very large structure. The Arch of Victory is an important memorial and is close to the hearts of Ballarat residents. After becoming aware of the state of the Arch through the Ballarat Courier I have written to the Minister for Veteran's Affairs to see if there is assistance the federal government is able to give. Memorial funding tends to be of much smaller amounts than that required to restore the arch, but given its important status I would hope that we can as a community work together to ensure its survival for another 88 years. On this Remembrance Day we remember the fallen and the potential they never got to fulfil. We remember the families who have mourned their loss for generations. On behalf of Joycelyn King, nee Mears, I remember Edmund Geoffrey Mears-‘Geoff'-by placing his name in the historic records of this place on this Remembrance Day in 2008. Remembrance Day",121
160,Mr ROBERT,ADJOURNMENT,"The lone bugler's haunting melody of The Last Post resounded today-at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month. This is when we Australians commemorate those diggers who lost their lives for the freedoms we enjoy today. Daniel Webster said, ‘Although no sculptured marble should rise to their memory, nor engraved stone bear record of their deeds, yet will their remembrance be as lasting as the land they honoured.' In 1993 the government brought ‘home' the body of a fallen warrior. Today he rests in the Hall of Memory as the Unknown Soldier. In his prime he left Australia to fight for his country and today he represents over 100,000 of his brothers and sisters killed in war for the freedoms we enjoy. He represents over 10,000 Australian soldiers who lie in unmarked graves. Freedom is never free. It is purchased through the blood of the martyrs and maintained through eternal vigilance. Compared to many other countries Australia is still a fledgling nation but boasts a proud and rich military history. Her military any have trained and fought with pride and valour. World War I was the first time Australia had gone to a significant conflict as a federated nation. With enthusiasm and a longing to serve, over 416,000 men and women enlisted out of a population of under five million. The urge to serve meant many lied about their ages; they were boys entering a man's world. In 1914, with little training, our boys marched into battle. For more than four years they fought with allied nations, for a freedom in far away countries, on the battlefields of Europe, seeing death, hearing the dying and seeing the dead lying around. Over 60,000 Australian soldiers would not come home; over 135,000 were wounded-for a war that would end all wars. On 11 November 1918, 90 years ago, the Armistice treaty was signed at five o'clock in the morning and at the 11th hour on that same day the French and Belgium battlefields fell silent. At its conclusion the First World War had cost more Australian lives than any other war in our history. As the red poppy sprouted in Flanders field, it became a timely reminder of the blood that so freely flowed. As Eric Bogle once sang: The sun's shining down on these green fields of France; The warm wind blows gently, and the red poppies dance. The trenches have long vanished under the plow; There's no gas and no barbed wire, no guns now. But here in this graveyard it is still No Man's Land. The countless white crosses in mute witness To man's blind indifference to his fellow man, And a whole generation who were butchered and damned. After the Second World War Armistice Day was renamed Remembrance Day to include commemoration of the over 19,000 men and women who died during World War II. This day now commemorates all of our military who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. While the lone bugler trumpets the losses of war we remember the boys and men, the girls and women that left Australia to defend their nation and we honour their sacrifice. Remembrance Day is also the day that the names of the fallen are added to the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial. This morning six Australian heroes were added to the Roll of Honour: Private Dennis Michael Millane, who died in Borneo during confrontation; and five brave soldiers who died in Afghanistan-Sergent Matthew Raymond Locke, Private Luke James Worsley, Lance Corporal Jason Paul Marks, Trooper David Ronald Pearce and Signaller Sean Patrick MCCarthy. Today at the 11th hour we added these men to our thoughts as we stood like the guns of the Western Front, silent and still. As a former Army officer I feel a special affiliation with these men and their families. My family has fought in most of our wars, starting with the ultimate sacrifice when a cousin, a young lieutenant, led his men to their death at the Nek in Gallipoli in August 1915. Likewise I am very conscious that, of the six names added to the Roll of Honour, two of these heroes have families in the electorate of Fadden. Trooper David Pearce, loving husband to Nicole, father to Stephanie and Hannah, was tragically killed by a roadfiring side bomb in Afghanistan on 8 October 2007. Signaller Sean Patrick MCCarthy, loving son of David and Mary, brother of Leigh and Clare, was killed by a roadside bomb in stand Afghanistan on 8 July 2008. Their families should be very proud and our nation is forever grateful for their courage. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten. It will be remembered. I acknowledge the men and women who are today overseas serving their county. They help those who cannot help themselves. Today, just as they did 90 years ago, regardless of the danger, our military men and women risk their lives. We will remember them. (Time expired) Ms Emma Mary Griffin Her Excellency Maria Theresa Lazaro Blacktown Hospital  Sunday I did a couple of things that were absolutely delightful. I visited the home of Emma Mary Griffin. Her family had organised a wonderful birthday party and invited family members, of course, and neighbours. Emma has lived at Rooty Hill for 30 years and prior to that lived on a farm at Marsden Park. On Sunday, Emma turned 100 years old. I think it is a wonderful accomplishment not only to turn 100 but to be still living in your own home at that wonderful age. I asked Emma what the secret was to her longevity, and in a flash she said, ‘Hard work,' as family members chorused, ‘Hard work,' so obviously it is a philosophy that is well imbued in her family. I also attended a farewell party organised by the Sydney Australian Filipino Seniors. President Elvira Gacis said that I must attend because they were honouring the service of our Philippines Consulate General, Her Excellency Maria Theresa Lazaro, who will shortly complete more than five years service as the consul general in New South Wales. She has been an outstanding success. It is no secret, of course, that the Blacktown local government area in my electorate has the highest number of Australians of Filipino descent who call Australia home-something like 11,500, or 7.5 per cent of the electorate. I am pleased to say that my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa and I, together with the member for Lindsay and the member for Parramatta, hosted a lunch for the consul general and the ambassador. She is a marvellous lady who dedicated herself to the community she sought to serve. I am pleased to say that her service has been recognised by the government of the Philippines and that she is ambassador-elect to Switzerland. I am looking forward to the opportunity of perhaps catching up with her there next year. Not so happily, I want to talk about Blacktown Hospital because I am really concerned about a series of distressing statistics. Blacktown LGA has the highest number of early adult deaths, 637, in New South Wales, which is higher than rural Australia. For people aged below 75, the potentially avoidable deaths table provided by the New South Wales Chief Health Officer identifies Blacktown as having the worse smoothed estimate of standardised mortality, at 121.1. Blacktown has the highest heart attack, or acute myocardial infarction, rate in New South Wales at 560, which is double the number of Nepean. The Blacktown rate is approximately 50 per cent worse than the New South Wales average. Blacktown has the worse cardiovascular disease death record and the highest number of smoking or alcohol related hospital separations. The number of heart patients having to be transferred to Westmead Hospital because of the unavailability of cardiac catheterisation at Blacktown has increased by 67 per cent. The delay associated with transfers is unnecessarily increasing the amount of heart tissue being damaged. Blacktown Hospital is the only major metropolitan level 5 or 6 hospital which does not have immediately available nuclear medicine services. In 2005, 27 per cent of patients from Blacktown LGA had to be transported to Westmead to have non-tertiary services because of the lack of facilities that should be at Blacktown, and that number will increase to 40 per cent in a decade. I certainly hope that the state Minister for Health and our federal Minister for Health and Ageing will sympathetically review measures to rectify this situation. Swan Electorate: Underground Power Program",122
161,Mr IRONS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to talk about current developments with underground power in my electorate of Swan. I appreciate that within our system of government underground power is considered to be constitutionally a state and a local issue. However, the volume of constituents that contact me regarding the issue makes me feel that I must raise this in the House. The constituents of Swan often remind me that they do not mind which level of government I am in; they just want some help in getting answers and ideas on where they stand on these issues. I have had inquiries on this issue as well as on the underground sewerage program since the day I was elected and I will continue to provide updates and information as they become available. According to the Office of Energy, the government of Western Australia has a long term goal to have at least half the houses in Perth supplied with underground power by 2010. Forty-seven per cent of the metropolitan area is now serviced by underground power and the Underground Power Program has reached round 4. In a city bursting seams due to an influx of people who have come to WA to work, including in our resource sector, it is vital that we continue provide the necessary infrastructure to keep our city up to date with essential services that are as reliable as possible. Underground power is preferable not just on aesthetic grounds; underground powerlines are more reliable and less susceptible to failure after weather events. In fact, the state government's policy was developed following an inquiry into the May 1994 storms. These storms were widespread and caused significant power outages throughout the metropolitan and outer metropolitan areas of Perth. Eighty per cent of the damage to powerlines was caused by trees, and therefore a program to introduce underground power was promoted. As I previously stated, the program is now in round 4-it has operated in a series of rounds and all Western Australian local governments have been invited to submit expression of interest proposals for funding. The program has proven popular with areas of my electorate. The scheme has led to plans for major residential projects in Como, which was round 1; Rivervale, South Perth and East Victoria Park-Carlisle, which was round 2; Victoria Park south and Como east, which was round 3; and Wilson west, which was round 4. Additionally, the scheme has led to plans for localised enhancement projects in Albany Highway, Victoria Park and Belvidere Street, Belmont as part of round 4. Today I want to update the House on the information I requested and have received from the WA Minister for Energy, the Hon. Peter Collier MLC, about this program in Como East and Wilson West. In round 3, the City of South Perth submitted a proposal for the Como east area, which was short-listed for further development as part of the detailed proposal stage, with a view to approval at the and eventual implementation. Part of the condition of state government funding is clear evidence of substantial supto port from the ratepayers within the project area. I am informed by the minister that a City of South Perth survey conducted by a reputable research firm demonstrated that almost 80 per cent of the respondents chose to replace the overhead powerlines with an underground system. I would like to inform concerned members of my electorate that the City of South Perth is offering discounts on the rates of those eligible for a pensioner or senior discount. One of the most common concerns I receive from my constituents is that seniors will not be able to afford to pay the council charges. Despite the City of South Perth's survey indicating that a higher proportion of pensioners, 82.8 per cent, than nonpensioners, 79.6 per cent, would prefer to pay for underground power, we must remember the minority who have been particularly affected by the global financial crisis. I therefore would urge local councils to provide as significant a discount as possible to pensioners who are struggling at present. Councils can provide a discount to pensioners of up to 50 per cent under this scheme. Next I want to mention the City of Canning's proposal for the major residential project in Wilson West, which has been shortlisted and is currently undergoing further development through the detailed proposal stage, with a view to approval and eventual implementation. Further development will determine the scope, budget, community support and other essential aspects of the proposal. In conclusion, the installation of underground power has been a goal of successive governments in WA. Although it is a necessary development for the local area, it is important to ensure that vulnerable groups like seniors, pensioners and disabled pensioners are properly subsidised. I will continue to provide support to those who need it. Adelaide United Football Club",124
162,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to pay accolades to and congratulate one of Adelaide's, and South Australia's, favourite institutions: the Adelaide United Football Club, which has been participating within the Asian Champions League. The Adelaide United Football Club is based at Hindmarsh Stadium and it has reached the finals. Over the past eight months we have seen something quite remarkable in the progress of club sport within Australia. Commencing what at times has been a gruelling procession of travel and play, Adelaide United has managed what I think no other Australian club has done to date: making the final of this prestigious international event. At the Hindmarsh Stadium in Adelaide tomorrow night, Adelaide United faces the Gamba Osaka team of Japan in the second leg of the final. After the first leg of the held in Japan last Wednesday, Gamba Osaka has a 3-0 lead on goal aggregate. To get to this point alone is truly remarkable. Adelaide United, or the Reds, faced six teams from around the region. From early March this year, they faced and were victorious over Korea's Pohang Steelers, 2-0 and again 1-0; they defeated Vietnam's Binh Diong, 2-1 and 4-1; and they drew with Changchun Yatai of China twice. Being at the top of their group's table at that point, Adelaide United proceeded to enter the knockout stage in September. Adelaide United succeeded over Japan's Kashima Antlers, scoring two goals to one on aggregate. The semifinal saw Adelaide United defeat Uzbekistan's Tashkent by three goals to one on aggregate, leading to the competition in which the club is engaged at this point, facing Gamba Osaka in this week's final. Tomorrow night's competition at Hindmarsh Stadium is sold out, with an anticipated 17,000-strong crowd expecting to see what is being dubbed in today's Advertiser as ‘one of the biggest sporting matches in the state's history'. The success of Adelaide United Football Club in reaching this final is more than enough to put pride in the heart of any Australian football fan. The achievement of this Adelaide team in playing this final is enough in itself to command the respect of all Australians interested in sport and the success of Australian teams in international events. I would like to congratulate the team, coach and support staff on what they have already achieved and what they have proven to all Australians, retired players and juniors alike: Australian teams can make the grade. The Australian club environment is, of course, totally different to that of the teams Adelaide United has faced in this competition. For instance, within the Gamba Osaka final, team two players earn a combined income from their club of $7 million per season. Yasuhito Endo earns $4 million per season and Lucas earns $3 million per season. Australian teams simply do not compare due to the nature of the Australian club environment and the competition within which they compete. While Gamba Osaka spends an estimated $24 million per season on the wages of its senior team alone, Australian teams have a salary cap of $1.9 million per club per season. Adelaide United as a whole has a salary cap that is less than half the price commanded by just Mr Endo himself. With the capacity to pay very big money, clubs naturally have the capacity to attract the brightest talent from around the world. This puts the achievement of Adelaide United Football Club even more sharply into focus. United needs to beat Gamba by four goals, or at least achieve a score of 3-0 at the conclusion of ordinary time to give itself any chance in extra time. I think this could quite reasonably be considered a big task. I am sure that, in front of a crowd of screaming Adelaide United supporters and well-wishers pouring in from around the country, the Reds will do very well. Irrespective of the outcome tomorrow night-to again put the success of Adelaide United into context-the fact that they have made the final automatically qualifies them for the Club World Cup to be held in Japan in December. In this competition we have the opportunity to play against Manchester United as the Continental Club Cup winner and other clubs that have won the cup in their continental region. This proves just how far these players have come. Again, I would like to take this opportunity to wish the coach and each of the team members all the best for tomorrow night's deciding final. I am sure they have already succeeded and will continue to achieve great things in the months and years ahead. Adelaide United Football Club has fielded the following players during this remarkable campaign: the coach, Aurelio Vidmar, who has done an outstanding job and is one of the best coaches in Australia; the goalkeepers, Mark Birighitti, Daniel Beltrame and Eugene Galekovic; the defenders, Cassio, Robert Cornthwaite, Angelo Costanzo, Sasa Ognenosvki, Scott Jamieson, Daniel Mullen, Michael Valkanis and Richie Alagich; the midfielders, Fabian Barbiero, Diego, team captain Travis Dodd, Lucas Pantelis, Kristian Sarkies, Paul Reid, Jonas Salley, Jason Spagnuolo and Nathan Burns; and the forwards, Cristiano, Paul Agostino, Robert Younis, Bruce Djite and Dez Giraldi. Good luck to all of the team tomorrow night. Win or lose, they have done all South Australians, and Australians, proud.",126
163,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9 pm, the debate is interrupted.
