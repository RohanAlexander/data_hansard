2,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"In view of the buoyancy of Commonwealth revenues, and the extent of unemployment, will the Acting Leader of the House bring beforo the Cabinet the question of making a vailable a certain sum for relief work prior to Christmas?",12
3,Mr ARCHDALEPARKHILL,Unknown,"The able members. Prime Minister was asked a similar question during the last week or ten days, and I refer the honourable member to the answer which was then given. I shall, however, advise the right honourable gentleman of the reiteration of the request.",12
4,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Recently , answer to a question, the Minister for the Interior stated that there was no present intention of making money available for thy relief of unemployment in Canberra, but that, in his opinion, the schedule of works already provided for would furnish all the employment necessary. Has the Minister given consideration to the possibility of speeding up some of tbese scheduled jobs so that full-time employment may be given, between now and Christmas, to all who need it?  ceiving consideration, and it, is hoped that, during the Christmas month, continuous employment will be provided from the funds already voted. SALE STAXONFLOUR .",12
5,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"H as the Acting Leader of the House noticed the statement in the press by those who are qualified to judge, that, the imposition of a sales tax on flour would have the effect of increasing the price of bread by 2d. a loaf? If such action is contemplated, will the . honourable gentleman impress upon his colleagues the necessity for the fullest consideration of the matter, so 83 to ascertain exactly what the effect may be upon the consumers of bread?",12
6,Mr ARCHDALEPARKHILL,Unknown,I realise the significance of the question raised by the honourable member. He may rest assured that all the possible effects of a sale3 tax ou flour will be full y considered before a decision is made.,12
7,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Will the Acting Leader of the House extend the inquiry into this matter to embrace the effect upon wheat-growers generally of that most extraordinary tariff schedule introduced by the honourable member for M a r i ister for Trade and Customs?,12
8,Mr ARCHDALEPARKHILL,Unknown,I think that that question may be safely left to the intelligent judgment of honor,12
9,Mr NAIRN,Unknown,"In the event of a sales tax being imposed on flour, will the Government consider having an inquiry made by royal commission, or otherwise, into the cost of bread in Australia, with particular relation to the price of wheat?",12
10,Mr ARCHDALEPARKHILL,Unknown,"I in am unable to give the honourable member an assurance in that respect without consulting with the Prime Minister. He may rest assured, however, that the fullest consideration will be given to every aspect of the matter, and that the interests of the consumers and of others affected will be conserved if , or when, a sales tax is imposed. NA BELGIUM.  Leader of the House noticed in the press the serious report that, reprisal tariffs are being operated by Belgium again3t the importation of Australian cereals, meat, and other primary products? What action does the Government propose to take to avert the disaster which will be caused to Australia by such a policy?",12
11,Mr ABCHDALEPARKHILL,AUSTRALIANEXPORTS TO,"The Government is full y cognizant of the circumstances to which the honourable member refers, and realizes their importance. The steps taken by the Belgian Government are general in character, and are not directed solely against Australia. The position is being closely watched by the Government; and, as was intimated a few days ago, representations are being made to the Belgian Government by the High Commissioner in London, with whom this Government is in constant touch. IMPORTATION OF SHEET GLASS.",12
12,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIANEXPORTS TO,"The Melbourne Star yesterday published the following message from Canberra:It is believed that the Tariff Board's will recommend modification of the ban on the importation of sheet glass from Belgium, which is thought to be the cause of the Belgian War Office refusing to take Australian frozen meat. The report will be ready in a fortnight. The Government will probably accept it as a preliminary step toward removing the serious trade difficulties. Are newspaper paragraphs of this nature the propaganda of importing interests, or of the Government, and are they designed to influence the Tariff Board and anticipate its decision?",13
13,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIANEXPORTS TO,"I have not seen the press paragraph to which the honourable member has referred, but I thank him for directing my attention to it. I assure him, and the House generally, that it is nothing but pure speculation. I cannot say by whom it is inspired. No such statement - has been made by the Government. The Tariff Board has completed its investigation of the glass industry in Sydney and Melbourne, and its report is expected shortly. When it is received, the Government will consider what action shall be taken upon it. PAY OF DEFENCE FORCES.",13
14,Mr JOHN LAWSON,AUSTRALIANEXPORTS TO,"Is it a fact that, after due consideration, the GovernLeader ment has decided to increase the pay members of the different arms of to defence, as well as of workers in munition and harness factories?",13
15,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIANEXPORTS TO,"In connection with the Financial Emergency Act, a comand communistic propaganda? mittee was appointed to advise the Minister on this matter. That committee has made certain recommendations, which the Minister is now considering. A statement ment of the Government's intentions will be made at a later date. FIRING PRACTICE. Mr E. J. HARRISON - In view of the wholesale destruction of property, and the grave disabilities suffered by residents of Vaucluse in the past, due to the firing of the gun at Signal Hill , will the Assistant Minister for Defence postpone the proposed filing practice which, I understand, is to be held on the 8th November, to allow a deputation to state a case on behalf of those sorelyafflicted residents, who, I believe, oan report make a suggestion that would materially contribute to their relief?",13
16,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIANEXPORTS TO,"I cannot allow to pass unchallenged the suggestion that there has been wholesale destruction of property; that is not borne out by the facts. Such an important port as Sydney must be adequately defended, and that is not possible unless gunnery practice is given. However, I shall be pleased to place the representations of the honourable member before the Minister for Defence. NA EAST.",13
17,Mr RILEY,TRADE COMMISSIONERS INTH E,Is the - Minister for Commerce yet in a position to make an announcement regarding the appointment of trade commissioners in the East ?,13
18,Mr STEWART,TRADE COMMISSIONERS INTH E,"Many applications for the position of trade commissioners have been received, but no progress in the direction of making appointments can be made until the enabling legislation, which will afford honourable members ample opportunity to discuss every phase of the matter, has heen placed before this House. UNLAWFUL ASSOCIATIONS.",13
19,Mr JENNINGS,TRADE COMMISSIONERS INTH E,Can the Acting of the House state whether the of New South Wales Government proposes introduce legislation designed to effect co-operation with the Commonwealth Government in the policing of the Crimes Act in relation to unlawful associations v,13
20,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,TRADE COMMISSIONERS INTH E,"I have no knowledge of any intention on the part of the New South Wales Governto introduce specific legislation along the lines suggested by the honourable member; but I do know that the Attorney-General's Department of the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales co-operate fully at all times in the enforcement of the law relating to this most important matter. the honourable member that that co-operation will be maintained in the future. DRY BATTERIES.  for Trade and Customs say if, and when, the Government proposes to implement the report of the Tariff Board on dry batteries, which was presented last April?",13
21,Mr WHITE,TRADE COMMISSIONERS INTH E,"The honourable gentleman will no doubt remember that when the item dealing with dry batteries was before this chamber, it was agreed that it should be referred hack to the Tariff Board for further consideration. That action was taken. Delay has occurred because further information was required from Great Britain. The board is obtaining particulars from the British Trade Commissioner and other sources, and its inquiry will be held next January. As soon as the report of the board is received by the Government, the matter will be finally dealt with. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr AECHDAXE PARKHI.LT,) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn Wednesday next at 3 p.m. NA AGREEMENT. RUSSIAN EXPORTS.",14
22,Mr HAWKER,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Can the Minister for Commerce inform the House of the approximate provision made by the International Wheat Conference for the export of Russian wheat this year, when allocating the 560,000,000 bushels which the conference estimated would be the maximum requirements of importing countries? Can the honourable gentleman also' say whether, in the subsequent negotiations provided for hy the agreement, any progress was made towards the fixing of a definite figure for Russian exports, and if those exports to date have exceeded or fallen short of the quantity stipulated ?",14
23,Mr STEWART,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Ii i the original proposals, no specific figure was mentioned regarding Russia, that matter being left for subsequent negotiations between I assure Russia and the other signatories to the agreement. The latest advice is that the extent to which Russia shall participate in the export of wheat will be finalized at the November meeting of the standing committee appointed by the conference.",14
24,Mr BEASLEY,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Las t week I asked the Minister for Commerce whether he was aware of reports which had appeared in the British press regarding negotiations between Russia and the other wheat-exporting countries, in regard to the international agreement for the restriction of exports, and the Minister said that he would look into the matter. Is he yet able to say whether any information has been received from Australia's representative at the conference on this subject?",14
25,Mr STEWART,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,I have no further information beyond the fact that the degree of Russia's participation in the agreement will be determined at the meeting of the committee appointed by the conference. This meeting is to be held on the 27th November.,14
26,Mr HAWKER,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Are we to understand that the Wheat Conference, when allocating the importing countries' requirements of 560,000,000 bushels, among until the countries which have wheat to export, did so without taking possible Russian exports into consideration; and are we to assume, therefore, that any exports from Russia will represent a surplus over and above the requirements of the importing countries?",14
27,Mr STEWART,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"The conference, after making specific allocations to the major wheat-exporting countries, provided for a quantity of about 46,000,000 bushels to be supplied by other exporting countries, including Russia. The allocation of that 46,000,000 bushels is now awaiting determination.",14
28,Mr FENTON,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Has the Minister for Commerce noticedi in the press that there have recently been considerable importations of Russian wheat into Great Britain? Has the Commonwealth Government no power, through its High Commissioner, to protest against this breach of the agreement?",14
29,Mr STEWART,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"If any reliable evidence is forthcoming that Russia, or any other country, is breaking the terms of the agreement, the Commonwealth Q-overnment will very quickly make the necessary representations. As I have said, the agreement provides for the export by Russia of some wheat, and we have no evidence that she is not adhering to the terms of the agreement.

"" Upon which Mr WHIT E had movedThat the requested amendment be made as on and from 5th October, 1933, with the modification that the duties be reduced to 20s.",15
30,Mr WHITE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.48] - This is merely an adjustment, to put into effect the budget proposals to reduce the excise duty on whisky from 2Ss. to 26s. a gallon. At the same time, a proposal regarding the blending of whisky is incorporated in the motion, providing for Scotch whisky to be blended with Australian whisky. The excise item requires to be altered to permit this to be done. The excise item, as now proposed, limits to 20 per cent, the quantity of imported whisky in the blend, which must also contain a minimum of 25 per cent, of barley malt whisky, of which 15 per cent, miist be Australian. The purpose of the proposal is to permit distillers to blend in bond, and to pay the difference in excise when they withdraw the whisky from bond. Motion agreed to. Item 2By omitting the whole of sub-item (J ) anil iiiHorting in its stead the following sub-item:"" (J ) (1) Spirit for fortifyin g Australian (2) Spirit for fortifyin g Australian And on and after 25th May, 11)33(.))

The duties imposed by this sub-item apply to the spirit whether, at the time of entry lor home consumption, it is mixed or not with wine. If the spirit is mixed with wine, the quantity for duty is the total quantity of spirit which has been added to the wine.",15
31,Mr WHITE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.50] - I move That the requested amendment be made with the following modification:(.i) Spirit for fortifying Australian wino or used in fortifyin g Australian wine, subject to regulations:(I ) Spirit used in fortifyin g wine and entered for home con' sumption on or after that date:(«) Distilled wholly fromr the fresh juice of doradillo grapes, per proof gallon, Cs.

(3) Spirit used in fortifvin g wine on or after 13th Mareli, 1930, and entered for home consumption on or after 25th May, 1933, and prior to 5th October, 1933, per proof gal* Ion, 9s. (-1) Spirit for fortifying wine or used in fortifyin g wine on or after 13th March, 1930, and entered for home consumption on or after 5th October, 1933, per proof gallon, (is. 6tl. The duties imposed by this sub-item apply to the spirit whether, at the time of entry («.) Distilled wholly from the for home consumption, it is mixed or not with fresh juice of doradillo wine. If the spirit is mixed with wine, the grapes, per proof gallon, 5s. quantity for duty is the total quantity of (b) NJ3.T... per proof gallon, Gs. spirit which has been added to the wine less any allowance for waste, including evaporation waste, which may be prescribed by Kegulations. The reason for amending the request is to give effect to the recent reduction of (a) Distilled wholly from the fresh juice of doradillo the duties on fortifying spirit for wine grapes, per proof gallon, as provided for in the budget proposals, 10s. which reduce the duty from 9s. to 6s. 6d. (6) N.KT., per proof gallon, l is . per proof gallon. A further departure from the Senate's request is that provision is made in the motion for such an allowance for waste, including evaporation, as may be proscribed by regulation. It is usual with spirits to pay the duty on the quantity which is cleared for home consumption. Spirits are kept in bond until they are actually required for sale or redistribution; and any waste, including evaporation, which occurs in bond, is .not subject to the duty. In the case of fortifying spirits, however, although the duty is not paid until such time as the wine goes into consumption, the users of the wine are debited with the amount of the duty which would be payable on the quantity of spirit which prior to 13th March, 1930, is mixed with the wine, and, consequently, any loss due to evaporation or other waste is not only a loss of the actual spirit, but also a further loss of the duty which is charged upon it. In order to place the users of fortifying spirit on approximately the same footing as the users of other spirits, it is proposed to make an allowance of 2^ per cent, to cover the waste. This allowance represents approximately 2d. a gallon on the spirit used. After investigating the wine-making industry in South Australia, I found that one of the obstacles to the return to better times was the high duty which had to be paid on fortifying spirit. The reduction of duty has been very well received in the wine trade, and expressions of approval have come to hand from both the wine-makers and the growers.",16
32,Mr LANE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,What about the conisumers ?,17
33,Mr WHITE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"No doubt they will benefit too, if the remissions are passed on to them. Honourable members may remember that a deadlock occurred over the price of grapes during the last vintage; but that has now been largely overcome, the wine-growers, in most cases, having decided to pay the price approved by the Government. Motion agreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted. Ordered That the bill, amended accordingly, be returned to the Senate. TARIF F PROPOSALS 1933. CUSTOMS TABIFF AMENDMENT (No. In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from the 4th October (vide page 3246) on motion by",17
34,Mr WHITE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"vide page 3223)That the schedule to the Customs Tariff proposals introduced into the House of Representatives on the thirteenth day of October . . . as amended in the House of Representatives subsequent to that date, be further amended as hereunder set out, Item 1 (AB ) (Beer, porter, & c ) .",17
35,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Capricornia) [11.4] These alterations of duty are i u accordance with those provided for in the budget. As corresponding reductions are being made in excise duties the degree of protection enjoyed by our Australian industries concerned will not be affected. The Treasurer (Mr Lyons) has expressed the opinion that the reductions of duties now provided will lead to an increased consumption of the goods affected, and that, therefore, the revenue will not be seriously reduced. Some evidence is available to show that traders are passing on to the public by way of reduced prices the advantage of the reduced duties. If I could be assured that revenue from higher duties would be used by the Government to benefit the unemployed and invalid and old-age pensioners, I should not agree to these reductions, but we have been shown quite definitely that the Government intends to use any surplus revenue that it has to benefit wealthy taxpayers, in which circumstance, I shall not oppose these reductions.",17
36,Dr EARLE PAGE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Cowper) [11.5] If the Government is of the opinion that the reduction of duties in these instances will lead to the increased consumption of goods, and therefore not affect the revenue, I ask whether it will consider the application of the same principle to import duties generally, and not limit it to the goods covered by this schedule. Item agreed to. Item 3By omitting the whole of sub-item (A ) and inserting in its stead the following sub-item:"" (A) Brandy(1) When not exceeding the strength of proof, per gallon, British, 40s.; general, 41s. t (2) When exceeding the strength of proof, per proof gallon, British, 40s.; general, 41s.""

47,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Hon. G. H. Mackay). - I assure honourable members that the usual procedure is being adopted on this occasion. The schedule has already been circulated, and copies are at the moment on the table. In such circumstances it is customary to accept the schedule which is in the possession of the clerk as the one which has been circulated. Honourable members should make an endeavour to file their papers when they receive them, otherwise much additional expense will he involved in unnecessary duplication.  have a copy of the schedule printed with the bill in addition to any that might been circulated previously ?",19

52,Dr EARLE PAGE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Cowper) [11.28]. - I wish to raise the whole principle of the failure of the department to refund duties which have beeu paid at higher rates after reductions have been approved by Parliament. The Customs Act provides that derjosite shall be paid by importers, hut in actual practice they are final payments, because they are never refunded. I urge the Minister, if he has not already given the matter his attention, to endeavour to devise a scheme whereby reduced rates of duty shall apply promptly instead of remaining in abeyance, as at present, for periods which extend in some instances to two years.",19
53,Mr GREGORY,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,Swan) [11.30] - The special provision in clause 5 is not embodied in the Customs Tariff (No. 2) to which the House has just agreed. Will the Minister state why this provision is applied only to the Excise Tariff (No. 2)1.,19
54,Mr WHITE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Balaclava-Minister for have . Trade and Customs) [11.31Q - The question raised by the right honourable in member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) is a pertinent one. It relates to a practice that has been in vogue since federation. When tariff proposals are tabled reduced duties those duties do not become operative until the schedule embodied in a bill and ratified by both Houses. Until that stage is reached ferenceimporters are required to pay the difbetween the higher rates already ratified and the lower rates still awaitI ing ratification. The difference is generally referred to as a deposit. No governhas yet taken steps to adjust the matter. I have been giving attention to this undoubted anomaly, and shall enI have already pointed out that the exchange and primage deductions more than outweigh this temporary inconvenience, - which will now last only until the present schodule is ratified by the Senate. even that delay should be obviated if possible. In reply to a question asked the other day by the honourable member for Calare (Mr Thorby), I stated that, when tabling tariff proposals, I would endeavour to insert a validating clause, so that the full extent. of any reduction of duty would apply in the same way as au increase now operates when tariff resolutions are tabled. I point out to the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) that the reason why this clause is not to bo found in Customs Tariff (No. 2 ) , which has just been passed, is that no higher duties than those contained in the schedule are at present being collected.

CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION ) BILL (No. 2) In Committee of Ways and Means: Motion (by Mr WHITE ) agreed toThat, in lieu of the duties of customs which may be levied in pursuance of section eight of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921-1922 there be collected duties of customs in accordance with the following provisions:(1) If the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry and report hy the Tariff Board, that the exchange value of the currency of the country of origin of any goods has depreciated in relation to Australian currency, and that by reason of such depreciation goods have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at prices which will be detrimental to an Australian industry, the Minister may publish a notice in the Qaaette specifying the country as to the exchange value nf the currency of which he is so satisfied, and the goods originated in that country to which in his opinion the provisions of this resolution should apply. (2) Upon the publication of the notice, there shall he charged, collected and paid to the use of the King, for the purpose of the Commonwealth, on all goods specified in the notice and produced or manufactured in thp country specified therein, a special duty ascertained as follows:(a) From the nominal par value origin of the goods there shall be deducted the value in Australian currency of the same unit at date of exportation of the* goods. (5) The amount ascertained under the last preceding paragraph shall be divided by the value in Australian currency of a unit of the currency of the country of origin of the goods at the date of exportation of the goods. (c) The figure ascertained under amendment; the last preceding paragraph shall be multiplied by the value for duty of the goods assessed in accordance with the Customs Act 1901-1930. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended.",19
55,Mr WHITE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [1.1.40] - I move That the resolution be adopted. It was decided that the fourt h recomme;idation of the Tariff Board, regarding exchange and primage, should bo em1933. bodied in the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act so as to have a specific instead of a general application towards countries with depreciated currencies. In the course of the debate in Committee of Ways and Means, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), submitted an amendment providing that any recommendations' by the Tariff Board, when proposed by the Minister for gazettal, should be treated as a regulation that must be laid on the fable in both Houses, and be subject to disallowance by either House. The Government accepted the honourable menv ber's proposal, but when it was embodied in the resolution on which the bill was founded, many complications arose. The honourable member for Swan expressed his willingness to. withdraw his, amendment, but it was found necessary that the order of the day be discharged, and a new bill submitted. There were,two main objections to the honourable member's proposal-the House might be in recess at the time of the gazettal, and a. notification might be disallowed in another place. Another reason for the .withdrawal of the first bill is that the amendment would apply to only one specific section of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) ini sterling of a unit of the Act, . . .',' currency of the country, of  principal reason.",20
56,Mr WHITE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Yes ; the Senate or the House of Representatives could reject a recommendation of the Tariff Board and the Minister relating to currency depreciation, but could not deal with a proposal relating, perhaps, to a dumping - duty, a consignment duty, or to some - other feature of the act. To obtain uniformity in this regard, the Government has decided to give a sympathetio consideration to an amendment inserted in the Customs Bill, which, after passing the Senate, is now waiting to be dealt with by this House.",21
57,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Capricornia) [11.43] When the proposal was made by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), aud accepted by the Minister, I remarked that I thought the Minister had acted too hurriedly, without realizing the difficulties with which his department would be confronted, and the impracticability of the whole proposal. The fact that after more mature consideration, the Minister has found it necessary to withdraw the bill shows how unwise it is to accept amendments because of anxiety to satisfy the idiosyncrasies of an honourable memher.",21
58,Mr GREGORY,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Swan) [11.43] - I have always contended that the other branch of the legislature should have the right to determine whether taxation imposed under the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act should continue in operation. When I gave notice of my amendment, I was under the impression that it would become part of the principal act and apply generally. I agree that when goods are imported into Australia from a country that has a depreciated currency in relation to tralian currency, the government of the day should have power to impose extra duties to ensure fair competition. My amendment, however, conferred a very small power ou either chamber in comparison with the enormous power given to, the Minister under the act. When I made my suggestion, I hoped that it would be embodied in the principal act'; hut as it has been found that that couid not be done, I am content with the Minister's promise to amend the principal act in a way which will meet the situation. I have no desire to embarrass either the Minister or the Government. My contention all along has been that Parliament should have the power to disagree with the action of a Minister or a Government. When the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) was Minister for Trade and Customs, deferred duties were isiposed without any report from the Tariff Board having been obtained.",21
59,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,The honourable gentleman's amendment had nothing to do with deferred duties.,21
60,Mr GREGORY,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"It was never intended that the Executive should have the power to impose deferred duties or 'Dmbargoes, and I have always contended that either House of the Parliament should have the right to say that sucb action shall not be taken without legislative authority. I am content with the procedure adopted by the Minister, and willingly fall in with it. I shall support the bill in its present form.  - The remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) suggest that he has not fully grasped the reason for the withdrawal of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory).",21
61,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"I am fully aware of the reasons, for the matter came before me when I was Minister.  there was nothing impracticable about the amendment, but that its insertion in this bill would mean that the principle embodied in it would apply merely to that part of the act which relates to this particular resolution, whereas the Minister has promised a more comprehensive amendment. By adopting Aus- the cotirse now proposed, the honourable member for Swan will thus obtain more than he would have obtained by his original proposal.",21
62,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Darling Downs) [11.50] - I have some responsibility in this matter, for it was I who pointed out to the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) that his proposal, as framed, would embarrass the Minister and the Government, and suggested that the debate be adjourned with a view to redrafting the amendment. At the same time, I said that I Was not coiavinced that his proposal was a wise one. I am inclined to think that the Minister accepted it without realizing its full significance. Acquiescence in the pro-, cedure now proposed will not seal member's lips when the main issue comes before us again. The procedure which has been followed hitherto should not be varied without the fullest investigation of the eifect of any alteration. Executive should be given ample powers in oustoms matters to deal with any emergency which might arise. In the interests of the nation a discretionary power must be vested in the Minister. Parliament cannot be expected to deal with matters which arise from day to day in the administration of its legislation. But emergency powers should be exercised only in case of emergency, matters of policy being reserved for the decision of Parliament. In pleading for the supremacy of Parliament, the honourable member for Swan has really put forward a case for the supremacy of one House. of the Parliament.",21
63,Mr GREGORY,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Onl y as against Executive. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - But executive is responsible to the people; worded; and it must be remembered that governfavorable ments are made and unmade in this House, and not in the Senate. In these matters We must proceed carefully.",22
64,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,Hon. G. H. Mackay). - The whole of this debate is somewhat irregular. It has arisen from an explanation given by the Minister in the House.,22
65,Mr FENTON,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Maribyrnong) [11.55]. - Fearin g that my silence may construed as giving consent to the arrangement made between a Minister and a private member, I wish to voice my objection to one House of the ParGovernment liament-and that the Senate-bein g needed, given extreme powers in tariff matters. The honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) may not be aware that in England the Treasury has greater power in tariff matters than is the case in Australia. In the Old Country there is an advisory board, which, if it finds that resolution. British industries are being unfairly assailed, can recommend to the Treasury that action be taken, whereupon the ment or debate. Treasurer may impose a duty of, say, 20 per cent, or 40 per cent, against the competing foreign product. In order to protect the revenues of this country, certain powers must reside in the Executive, which, a3 the honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom) pointed out, is responsible more to this House than to the Senate. Another place The should not have the power to fly in the face of the Executive without this House being consulted. I protest against the tendency of the Government to accede to requests from the Country party to the detriment of the nation.",22
66,Mr WHITE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.57] - I appreciate the advice of the honourable member for Darling Downs (' Sir Littleton Groom) to act with caution in this matter. My thanks are due to him for having pointed out the difficulty which would confront any government which tried to implement the proposal framed by the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory). I wish to make it clear to the honourable members for Gippsland  Government is not necessarily acceptthe ing the amendment as at present it willj however, give consideration to a similar provision. Another bill which has reached this House from the Senate provides that prohibitions of imports must be brought before this House within six months, but whether the Government will apply that principle throughout the whole range of the Industries Preservation Act I do not know. . >",22
67,Mr GREGORY,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,That is what the be Minister said would bo done.,22
68,Mr WHITE,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,"I said that it would be wrong for this regulation to apply to some industries and not to others. The realizes that something is but it does not wish at this stage to conunit itself to the details. Motion agreed to. Resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr White and Mr .Guy do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing Bill brought up by Mr WHIT E and passed through all stages without amendNA (NEW ZEALAND PREFERENCE) AGREEMENT BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 25th October, 1933 (vide page 3923), on motion by Mr. WHITEThat the bill be now read a second time.",22
69,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"Capricornia) [12.2] As I appreciate the difficulties which confronted the Government in arranging a satisfactory trade agreement between the Commonwealth and the dominion of New Zealand, I do not propose to indulge in any carping criticism. When Minister for Trade and Customs I arranged for inquiries to be made into our trade relations with New Zealand, as at that time it was evident that a feeling of distrust existed in New Zealand, largely owing to the high duties imposed some years ago upon imports from that dominion to protect Australia's primary industries. Had the Scullin Government remained in office a representative would have been sent to New Zealand to endeavour to negotiate an agreement satisfactory to both countries. The ex-Assistant Treasurer, Senator Massy-Greene, who visited New Zealand, was an able representative of the Commonwealth, and in the difficult circumstances which confronted him did all that was possible in the interests of Australia. Some years ago the Government imposed a duty of 6d. per lb. on New Zealand butter, which had the indirect effect of depriving Australia's secondary industries of a substantial portion of their t . trade with the dominion. The embargo placed ou the importation into Australia of New Zealand potatoes, together with the fact that a number of other primary ]) rod nets required fully 100 per cent, tection, was also responsible for the srrained relations between Australia and New ZeaJaud which undoubtedly caused a substantial falling off in our exports to New Zealand. An agreement between the two countries has now been adopted, and I consider it preferable to give concessions item by item, rather than to undermine our whole fiscal policy in a general way, as was done at Ottawa. Under articles 10 to 14 of the Ottawa agreement we have given away the rights of Parliament to increase duties on certain commodities which can now be done only on the favourable recommendation of the Tariff Board. The system adopted under this agreement is more satisfactory. As there has been a steady falling off in Australia's exports to New Zealand since the 1922 agreement was adopted, it was necessary to send a representative to New Zealand to bring about a better feeling in matters of trade between the two countries. Some years ago the late Mr. Pratten, when Minister for Trade and Customs in the Bruce'-Page Administration, visited New Zealand with that object; but he found that, in consequence of the action of the Commonwealth Government in imposing an import duty of 6d. per lb. on New Zealand butter, it was impossible to come to a satisfactory arrangement Our exports to New Zealand since 1922 has been as follows:£ 1921-22 .. .. 4,620.000 1927-28 .. .. 3.856.000 1931-32 .. .. 2,604,000 Thus during a period of ten years they have dropped to almost one half. Of New Zealand's exports, totalling £37,000,000, approximately £32,000,000 worth are shipped to Great Britain. In these circumstances, New Zealand is anxious to maintain friendly trade relations with the Mother Country, as a first consideration, and in view of the substantial reduction of exports from Australia, does not look too kindly upon the' Australian market. In 1927-28, New Zealand's imports into Australia, exclusive of bullion and specie, were valued at £2,945,000; in 1931-32 the value had decreased to £702,000, or a drop of pro- £2,243,000 in four years. Fully 70 per cent, of our exports to New Zealand consist of secondary production and our manufacturing industries have suffered in consequence of the benefits afforded to primary industries. I do not wish it to be inferred that I am opposed to the protection given to the primary industries. I support it. It is, however, pleasing to note that even during the depression there has been an increase of certain exports to New Zealand, such as iron and steel products, the value of which increased from £12,303 in '1930 to £147,178 in 1932. The other increases wereHosiery . . 901 40,535 Leather hoots and shoes . . .. 1,260 24,680 Fencing wire 596 13,698 Barbed wire - 10,722 Wire iron .. 1,543 23,784 Wire-netting .. 5,955 24,884 I trust that the present rate of export will not only be maintained but also increase. Those engaged in the citrus fruit industry of Australia have, however, cause for complaint, because of the hibition imposed 'by the New Zealand Government upon importations of citrus fruits from Australia. I was sorry to learn from the Minister's speech that is £7,750,000. Senator Massy-Greene's efforts to induce the New Zealand Government to remove the embargo were unsuccessful.",23
70,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"The embargo was lifted as regards exports from South Australia, and we hope that that is the beginning.",24
71,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"It should have been possible to lift the embargo completely. I"" hope that the Government will continue its representations with a view to having the embargo lifted:, as it means a loss of £500,000 a year to those engaged in the industry.",24
72,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,The Government has arhad ranged for fresh pineapples to enter Zealand.,24
73,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"I trust that a.3 the result of this agreement Queensland producers will be able to supply a substantial proportion of the £30,000 worth of pineapples imported to New Zealand from annually. It seems to be a short-sighted policy on the part of the New Zeato land Government to continue the prohand hibition of a large portion of Australia's because of depressed prices. exports of citrus fruits, and I hope the embargo will soon be lifted. New Zealand duty on Australian canned pineapples was 35 per cent., and on imallied ports from tihe Malay States 25 per cent., but Australian exports of pineapples are now to be dutiable at 25 per cent. Ausfor tralia should be on a better footing in respect.. The Minister admitted that - some instances our representative was successful in arranging for Australian ports to be dutiable at the British preter ferential duties. I trust that the Ministhis ter will arrange for the department to ment. keep a record of these items, which should be the subject of further investigation and 1030. 1932. negotiation. £ £ Mr WHITE - We have an exchange advantage over Great Britain.",24
74,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"Yes , but we ought to be on the same preferential basis as Great Britain. The embargo upon citrus fruits has caused a loss of £200,000 to our external trade. The loss to the industry, based on an average of 2s. a case on 5,000,000 cases due to a glut in the local market, will proamount to £500,000. The number of actual growers affected, apart from their dependent employees, is 10,593. The capital value of the orchards concerned In addition to the loss sustained by those directly engaged in the industry, the embargo also affects the following industries: Shipping, railways, timber, paper manufacturing, printing, implement makers, spraying materials, waterside workers, motor transport, box-making, fertilizers, nails and tie wire suppliers, and packing houses.",24
75,Mr JOHN LAWSON,CUSTOMS TARIF F,Our exports of citrus fruits this year constituted a record.,24
76,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"The operation of the embargo has depressed local prices to such au extent that the Commonwealth to make a grant of £30,000 to assist New the citrus fruit-growers to secure new markets.",24
77,Mr NOCK,CUSTOMS TARIF F,Muc h of the exports did not return one penny to the grower.,24
78,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"The embargo in New Zealand caused our trade to be diverted that, country to other countries, and as a result there was little or no profit the grower on shipments; on the other there was a loss of about £500,000 The that loss on our export trade is detriThe mentally affecting not only the citrus fruit industry, but also the industries which I have mentioned. In addition the Government's revenue will also suffer, because it will be impossible many of the growers, especially rethat turned soldiers who have been settled on in irrigation areas, to meet their commitunments. This is a large primary produciming industry and I hope that the Miniswill lose no time in again taking up matter with the New Zealand Govern The agreement is very disappointing lo the Australian wine industry. The producers asked that Australian wines should at least be placed on the same footing as South African wines in the New Zealand market. Eor many years South African wines have enjoyed a preference which has been denied our wines, but fortunately the margin is not so great as it used to be. The duties on South African wines are-stil l wines 3s. 6d., and sparkling wines 9s. a gallon; while the duties on Australian wines are-stil l wines 4s., and sparkling wines 10s. a gallon; so that South Africa enjoys preference over Australia of 6d. a gallon on still wines, and Is. a gallon on sparkling wines. The duty on Australian brandy was recently increased from 36s. to 40s. a gallon. When the Wine Export Bounty Act was passed, New Zealand threatened to impose a dumping duty on Australian wines equal to the export bounty, and as a result our exports to New Zealand were exempted from the operation of the act.",24
79,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,In the New Zealand trade Australia has an exchange advantage over South Africa.,25
80,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"There is a small exchange advantage, but I am assured by those engaged in the wine industry that it is not sufficient to enable them to compete against South African wines. They consider that their case was not sufficiently stressed before the New Zealand Government. It has always been a sore point with Australian wine-makers that New Zealand should give a preference to Soutli African wines, in the production of which black labour largely enters. The wine industry in New Zealand is small indeed, and will never be large owing to climatic conditions, so it cannot be said that that country has imposed duties in order to protect the local industry. Recent press cable announcements are to the effect that Great Britain has extended its trade treaty with Portugal until 1941, and, uncier that treaty, Empire wines cannot bear the name "" Port"" in Great Britain. That, of course, is a great handicap to the Australian wine industry, and it has been the subject of many representations. It is another matter in which the Minister might interest himself. I notice that under the treaty vacuum pumps for milking machines are to be admitted from New Zealand free of duty instead of having to pay a duty of 25 per cent, as formerly. Eor many years Scott and Son Proprietary Limited, of Melbourne, and seven other firms in Australia, have been producing this class of equipment. They have been exporting vacuum pumps to New Zealand and also supplying the Australian market. Now they are faced with the competition from New Zealand, where wages and other production charges are lower than in Australia. Therefore, the proposal of the Government to admit these pumps free of duty from New Zealand is most unfair.",25
81,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,The cost of freight should counterbalance any disparity in wages.,25
82,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"The firms concerned consider that they will lose substantial business as the result of the agreement. Of course, other secondary industries in Australia will benefit from it. Some industries must be disappointed. I commend the agreement, but I realise it has many weaknesses. Although Australian vacuum pumps may now enter New Zealand free of duty, the lower costs there prevent Australian manufacturers from competing in that market. The Australian firms that are manufacturing these pumps have recently drawn the attention of the Customs Department to the fact that New Zealand vacuum pumps are being incorrectly admitted free of duty, because of which the tendency is for pumps made in New Zealand to be shipped to Australia. The reduction of the duty from 25 per cent, to free, will, therefore, have a serious effect on our local' industry, and the Australian firms cannot understand the reason for this further attack upon them. The growers of dried fruits will undoubtedly benefit under the agreement, as Queensland probably will in respect of the export of canned pineapple. New Zealand has imposed, on foreign raisins, a duty of £9 6s. 8d. a ton, which should lead to increased exports from Australia. Last year, our exports to that country were valued at £180,000, while the value of foreign imports was £70,000. It is hoped that this agreement will enable the Australian dried fruits industry to capture a substantial proportion of that foreign trade. Dried apricots and peaches are also being placed on a favourable footing compared with similar fruit from other countries. Australia's close proximity to its sister dominion should lead to the exploitation of her market to a much greater degree. At present, South African dried fruits are admitted into New Zealand free of duty, while Australian dried fruits have been subject to a duty of 2d. per lb. That anomaly has been removed under the agreement, and my only regret is that other anomalies affecting the wine industry and citrus fruit industry have not also been removed. The industries of New Zealand are in many respects similar to our own. I realise that the agree- be like taking coals to Newcastle. ment will meet with the criticism of certain secondary industries of our sister dominion, because of competition from Australia, but, on the other hand, there is bound to be criticism in Australia in respect of other aspects of the agreement. It should be the aim of whatever government is in power to promote the most friendly relations between Australia and New Zealand. The two countries have much in common, and it is essential that they should act in close co-operation in order to safeguard their position in the Pacific.  - I welcome this agreement which is an extension of, and perhaps some improvement upon, previous agreements with New Zealand. I realise that tremendous difficulties faced this Government in attempting to negotiate an agreement of this kind, particularly with a country the products of which are in most cases very similar to our own. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Eorde) has said, New Zealand is geographically in close proximity to Australia; in fact, it is a great deal nearer to the eastern States than is Western Australia. For that reason, it is only natural that we should trade with each other as freely as possible. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to the production of butter in Australia, and said that our attitude with regard to New Zealand butter had raised difficulties between the two countries. At the present time, New Zealand would gain nothing by having free access to this country's ports in respect of its butter. There was a time some years ago when Australia exported butter only during a comparatively small part of the year, and when we were short of supplies this market was of some advantage to New Zealand. That position does not obtain now, because throughout the whole of the year we are exporting butter from one State or another. If our ports were open to New Zealand butter, for every box imported here an additional box of our own production would have to be exported to compete with New Zealand butter overseas. Therefore, it would really be of no advantage to New Zealand to sell butter in this country. It would It seems to me that the principal advantage which we are conferring upon New Zealand is the concession of entire exemption from primage duty. I suppose that primage was one of the few things which the Government had to bargain with, and I am glad that it has granted this concession. We have really gone a little further with New Zealand than we have with Great Britain, inasmuch as we have only reduced the primage on British goods from 10 per cent, to 5 per cent., whereas we have wiped out primage altogether so far as New Zealand goods are concerned. The list of New Zealand goods with respect to which some concession has been granted is much longer than the list of Australian goods on which New Zealand has given some preference; but, on the other hand, among the list of New Zealand goods involving concessions are many items in connection with which no importations take place.",25
83,Mr SCUXXIN,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"That might encourage importations.  some increase of trade. Specified items enter both countries at the concession rates set out in the schedule, and, we are told, all items which are not specified have the advantage of entry to both countries at British preferential rates. No alteration can be made of the specified items at specified rates without six month's notice. As regards the unspecified items which, in both countries, enjoy the advantage of the British preferential rate, the duties may he altered without notice. Wc simply impose on imports of those items from New Zealand whattreaty ever happens to be the British preferential rate in our tariff, in accordance with any variation which may be made from that time to time. I am particularly pleased that we have socured concessions for the marketing Australian dried fruits in New Zealand, and I should like to know whether word ""raisins"" covers sultanas as well goods. as lexias.",26
84,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"Yes .  will be of great advantage to the Austhe tralian dried fruits industry. New Zealand has agreed to impose a duty of Id. per lb. ou foreign raisins, while the Australian product will be admitted duty free. Hitherto, in the dominion market, our growers have had to meet even terms competition from California, Greece, Turkey and other countries where production costs are much lower. Now, with an advantage over foreign competito tors of l d . a lb., our trade in dried fruits with the sister dominion should inthere crease substantially. There has been remarkable development in this industry during recent years, due largely to acNew tion taken by State governments to put returned soldiers on suitable areas for the production of this class of fruit. I 1919 the Australian production of sulducts, tanas totalled about 14,000 tons, and as the local market absorbed 12,000 tons, the exportable surplus was only about 2,000 tons. To-day we are producing between 70,000 and 80,000 tons, and as the AusZealand tralian market absorbs only about 13,000 tons, the surplus available for export is approximately 60,000 tons. preference now given to Australia by New Zealand will bo of real value to us, following as it does the generous preferin ence given by Canada to us, and the more recently granted concession by Britain. I hope that this agreement-will lead to a substantial increase of trade between Australia and New Zealand also to a better understanding between have the two dominions.",27
85,Mr HAWKER,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"Wakefield) [12.35] I support the motion and also congratutralia late the Government, and particularly the former Assistant Treasurer (Senator Massy-Greene), for having made this trade agreement with New Zealand. The in itself does not indicate much progress towards the extension of reciprocal trade, but it is of great value in it. prevents the drifting apart in trade relations of the Commonwealth and the dominion. Reciprocal trade arrangeof ments are always extremely difficult to make, particularly between counthe tries producing similar classes of That is one reason why some trouble has heen experienced in making this treaty between Australia and New Zealand. As the Deputy Leader of Opposition (Mr Eorde) has pointed out, the exclusion from the Australian market of New Zealand butter and potatoes has done something to mar the good understanding which should exist between British dominions in the Pacific. That on state of affairs was, of course, most regrettable because we must all realise the necessity for British peoples in this part of the world coming closer together maintain their own standards. It is, therefore, very gratifying to know that, is now a better understanding-bea tween Australia and New Zealand, and that at, last we have been able to persuade Zealandcrs that, as regards the principal products of both countries, oach can expect to retain its market for local n producers and that, as regards other proeach country will give to the other the fullest possi ble measure of preference. Australia, being to some extent an industrialized country, has a much wider scope for exporting to New Zealand than New has for exporting to Australia. It, is only in respect, of a few luxury products that, so far as I can glean from the The schedule, it is possible for Australia to give New Zealand substantial concessions. First on the list of these is preference the Australian tariff to New Zealand Stilton cheese, which, in future, will bo Great duty free, as against a former tariff of 6d. per lb. New Zealand produces excellent Stilton cheese which and is in much favour with those who acquired a taste for it. Another item is Toheroa soup. It is in respect of items of this sort that Auscan satisfy the requirements of epicures with products from New Zealand rather than with chowder from the United States of America aud other foreign countries. Apart from the limited number of items of this sort, the other really major concessions given by Australia to New Zealand arc the exemption from sales tax of New Zealand products which compete with Australian products that are on the exempted list-this concession, I feel sure, is much valued by New Zealand, and is one which it is well worthwhile for Australia to make-and the removal of primage duty from New Zealand goods, a concession which Australia can well afford to make, and which will he of genuine benefit to New Zealand. On the other hand, by far the greatest concessionto Australian trade is the general benefit that Australian manufacturers and certain other Australian exporters will derive from the undertaking, on the part of Now Zealand, not to impose dumping duties or exchange adjustments which would affect Australian trade adversely, as against British trade with the sister dominion. The fact that it is a concession in relation to thing which does not exist at the moment does not in any way detract from its value to Australian trade. An outstandingly important concession to Australia is the imposition by New Zealand of a duty of Id. per lb. upon foreign dried fruits. This should secure to Australian producers the hulk of that part of the New Zealand market which, hitherto, has been supplied by the United States of America.",27
86,Mr NOCK,CUSTOMS TARIF F,Does that concession apply to other dried fruits ?,28
87,Mr HAWKER,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"Yes . The secretary of the Australian Dried Eruits Association has informed me that, because of the difficult position confronting the dried fruits industry at the present time, the association welcomes the treaty, which will be particularly valuable, not, only to the producers of sultanas, but also to the producers of dried tree fruits, such as apricots, grapes, nectarines, peaches, plums, &c. Every extension of a sheltered market is of value to the dried fruits industry out. of all proportion to the apparent figure of the extent, of the new market. The dried fruits industry has a particularly complete marketing organization. If the export of Australian dried fruits is assured at a fair price to a sheltered market, such a3 Canada, New Zealand, or the Mother Country, the industry can make its marketing arrangements ahead, with the result that it is required to sell, on the world's market at the best price offering, only a limited proportion of its crop. In some years they may be supplying these sheltered markets at a lower price than is ruling in the outside unsheltered market; but the organization of the industry is strong enough to take the long view that the assured or sheltered market, which has been given to it by substantial preferences, is of more value, and should be kept supplied even at the cost of some temporary profit which may be obtainable for a short period in the outside market. I again congratulate the Government on having made this trade agreement, and I commend the bill to the favourable consideration of honourable memberB. someSitting suspended from 1845 to 2.15 p.m.",28
88,Dr MALONEY,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"Melbourne) [2.15] It gives me pleasure to be privileged to witness this gesture of goodwill between the dominions of Australia and New Zealand, and I hope that it will be repeated in every possible way. I look - back to a largely attended meeting that, 44 years ago, was held in the Melbourne Town Hall, under the auspices of the Australian Natives Association, to advance the claims of Western Australia to the rights of self-government. The  Victorian lawyer of that day. In a speech that I made, I likened the five mainland .States of Australia to the Southern Cross constellation, and Tasmania and New Zealand to the "" two pointers,"" to that astral group. I believe that that was the first occasion upon which that simile had been employed. Australians and New Zealanders speak the one language, and are of the same parentage. I should like the friendly relations of the two dominions to go so far as to embrace the minting of similar coinage. Such a bond would be beneficial to future generations. New Zealand is perhaps more bountifully endowed by nature than any country other than Japan. The Japanese people are more artistically inclined, and improve their landscapes and seascapes with beautiful designs of plant growth, and in other ways. Both New Zealand and Japan have hot springs, but the famous pink and white terraces of our sister dominion .are buried 80 feet below the surface of the soil, whereas those of Japan are still visible. I should like Australia and New Zealand to unite in the firmest bonds of friendship. Slight differences sometimes become big rifts, which frequently are subjected to the arbitrament of war. In the matter of defence we should be so united that no important change of policy would be made by either without consulting the other. I have been informed on the most reliable authority that, when a vessel from Australia is due to arrive in the port of Auckland, some hotels, but particularly one of them, display notices warning their habitues to be watchful. That is almost inconceivable. I hope that the time is not far distant when the hands of Australia and New Zealand will be so firmly clasped, that the knuckles will whiten in the grip.",28
89,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"Maribyrnong) [2.20]. - It is a pleasure to find Australia and New Zealand being drawn closer together by this trade treaty and in other ways. Three years ago, L met in Auckland, a Minister in the New Zealand Government, and discussed with him the question of reciprocal trade. Although that conference lasted only two and one-half hours,. I was convinced that considerable antagonism towards Australia existed in New Zealand, on account of action by Australian governments against Dominion products, principally butter. Victorians will remember distinctly that On one occasion a shortage of butter supplies, due to drought conditions, led the importation of a large quantity from New Zealand to make good the deficiency, and the imposition of a duty of 6d. per lb. on New Zealand butter when it was sought to continue the practice was regarded as a distinct rebuff. That feeling, however, was gradually smoothed away. I urged the promotion of a better understanding, the frequent interchange of views, and, if possible, the making of a trade agreement. I realise that any agreement must be somewhat difficult to operate. Already, in certain quarters in Australia, the complaint has been voiced that the competition under this agreement will be fairly lively. There must, however, be give and take, and I am not prepared at the present juncture to take up the cudgels on behalf of any Australian industry in opposition to the ratification of the agreement by this Parliament. But if it be correct, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) has asserted, that in respect of some commodities South Africa enjoys greater preference than Australia in New Zealand markets, that anomaly ought to be removed. Many Australians have made a permanent home in New Zealand, and these two dominions are more closely knit than are any other portions of the British Empire. I pay my meed of praise to Senator Massy-Greene for having consummated such an admirable arrangement as that which we are now considering. Some readjustments may be found necessary, but 1I have no doubt that they would readily be sanctioned by this Parliament. I am rather sorry that New Zealand withdrew from the Australasian conventions, for at one time it seemed likely that New Zealand would enter the Australian federation. I regret that New Zealanders are uot represented in this Parliament. The people of the two dominions are one in their aims and aspirations, and there must be unity of action by them in the settlement of questions of mutual coucern. It is pleasing to note that a number of New Zealand cadets are being given training at our naval college, and that the visit of our warships to New Zealand was greatly appreciated by that Dominion.",29
90,Mr NOCK,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"Riverina) [2.25] - I join with other honourable members in supto porting the ratification of this reciprocal agreement, and I am pleased that further facilities are to be provided for the admission of Australian goods into the. Dominion of New Zealand. I regret that the Government has not been able to secure the complete removal of the embargo on oranges. It has been partly removed so far as South Australia is concerned, but the provision might quite well have been extended to the Murrumbidgee irrigation area, which is practically isolated from otlier fruit-growing districts. Fruit from outside, second hand fruit cases and seedlings are a!! excluded from that area. Every possible precaution is taken to prevent the introduction of disease, and an certificate could be given to show that the. area is free from fruit fly, the pest thuf i "" so much dreaded by the Niw Zealand growers. I feel sure that the failure of the Government to secure the complete removal of the embargo on citrus fruits is largely due to the fact that no satisfactory arrangement was come to with the New Zealand Government for the admission of New Zc-land potatoes to the Sydney market. It has been said that the quantity of oranges exported this year from Australia is greater than during any previous year. That may be so; but the growers have not uecessarily benefited as a result. Consignments of oranges have been sent to England, but the price received has been so low that the growers have not received in return even as much as l d . a case for the fruit which they have picked, packed and exported. The entire return on the fruit has been swallowed up in freight, transport and selling charges. This merely demonstrates how important to Australia is the New Zealand market. Not only the citrus-growers are affected, but also the growers of cherries and other fruits. In the past large quantities of water melons used to be sent to New Zealand every year, but at the present time there seems to bo an embargo on the entry of all Australian fruit and vegetables into New Zealand. I observe that Australia is to receive some advantage in regard to raisins on the New Zealand nin.'. it, as well as in respect of pineapples, prunes and other dried fruits. I hope that the Government will continue to negotiate with the New Zealand Government with a view to obtaining still further concessions and securing the removal of the orange embargo.

Otherwise, no alteration is made in the existing position. Progress reported. NA (ADMINISTRATION) BILL. SECOND READING.  ter for the Interior) [2.39] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. When the Northern Australia Act 1.926 was in force, the North Australia Commission performed certain functions and duties particularly connected with development in North Australia, and a government resident had charge of the general administration. Provision was made in the Northern Australia Act for officers appointed by the North Australia Commission from the Public Service or Railway Service of the Commonwealth or a State, and from the Public Service of the Northern Territory to retain their existing and accruing rights, but no provision was made in that act for the preservation of the rights of a person within the categories mentioned appointed to the position of Government Resident. Colonel R. H . Weddell, the present Administrator of the Northern Territory, was appointed to the position of Government Resident of North Australia under the Northern Australia Act. Prior to his appointment, he was an officer of the Commonwealth Public Service. Owing to the fact that there was no provision in the Northern Australia fol- Act for the preservation of the rights of an officer appointed to the position of Government Resident, Colonel Weddell stead has lost all his existing and accruing rights as an officer of the Commonwealth Public Service. When it is considered that the rights of junior officers appointed by the North Australia Commission were preserved, it is anomalous that Colonel Wed'lt-'.l's rights should not also be preserved. The object of this bill is to restore to Colonel Weddell the rights as a Commonwealth officer which he lost when appointed to the position of Government Resident of North Australia. It will be observed that the bill has been made retrospective to the date of commencement of the Northern Territory Administration Act 1931, or in other words, from the date of repeal of the Northern Aus ' : tralia Act.",31
93,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Capricornia) [2.41] - I have not studied the provisions of this bill, but as I am assured by the Minister that it contains nothing contentious, I offer no objection to its immediate passage. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second, time, and reported from committee without amendment or debate; report adopted. Bill-by leave-'rea d a third time. OFFICERS' RIGHTS DECLARATION BILL. SECOND READING .  ter for the Interior) [2.43] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. Various acts of Parliament make provision for the preservation or retention by officers of their existing and accruing rights. The Officers' Rights Declaration Act 192S, defines the rights which are preserved or retained by officers. The act applies to the acts and sections thereof mentioned in the schedule. The object of this bill is to add to the schedule of the Officers' Rights Declaration Act 1928, the words "" Northern Territory (Administration) Act, 1910-1933, sections 17, 17A and 17B. "" ' Section 17 of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act provides for the transfer to the Public Service of the Northern Territory of all officers of the Public Services of Nort h Australia and Central Australia, and for the preservation of the existing and accruing rights of such officers. Section 17A of the Northern Territory Administration Act provides for the retention of existing and accruing rights by members of the North Australia Commission or officers of that commission who were continued in the service of the Northern Territory after the abolition, of the commission. None of the members of the commission was continued in service, but a few officers of the commission were retained. Section 17B of the Northern Territory Administration Act provides for the retention of existing and accruing rights by the officer appointed to the position of Government Resident of Nort h Australia. This section was placed in the act by the bill to amend the Northern Territory Administration Act which has just been passed. Mr..PORDE (Capricornia) [2.44] - As this bill deals with non-contentious matters, I shall not delay its passage by asking for the adjournment of the debate. Mr A . GREEN (Kalgoorlie) [2.45] I should like to know whether the Government can make provision in this bill for members of the Commonwealth Public Service engaged in the Northern Territory to obtain transfers at regular periods to positions in the south. In the past, these officers have had considerable difficulty in getting away from the severe climate of the north to the more agreeable climate of the southern States. The tendency has been to regard those who live on the coast in the more temperate parts of Australia as ""coast, guards"" who resort to every subterfuge to avoid being transferred to remote districts. As a result, those serving in remote and uncongenial areas are continued in this form of exile year after year.  ter for the Interior) [2.46] - No provision is made in the bill to meet the' circumstances mentioned by the honourable member, but I agree that some such change as he has suggested will eventually have tn be made. Frequently, when a man joins the Service, and is sent to a remotely situated district, he is left there for the re3t of his life. Already an endeavour is being made to bring about an interchange of police officers between Canberra and the Northern Territory. Question resolved in the affirmative.

94,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Maribyrnong) [2.49] The following paragraph, which is taken from a letter written by Clifford, Love and Company, places in a better light statements that were made by certain honourable members last week on the subject of cornflour. It readsWe are the proprietors and owners of the name of Brown and Poison in Australasia, having paid for the rights and interests of same in good hard cash. You also stated that Brown and Poison's cornflour was quoted in the Australasian Grocer at the retail price of 8d. per lb. Brown and Poison's cornflour can be bought in most retail shops in Melbourne, Victoria; Adelaide, South Australia; Perth, Western ""Australia; and Tasmania at 7d. per lb., and in some instances as low as 6+cl. per lb. There is no price arrangement made with the Scottish firm and therefore this statement is also not correct.. Tho following paragraph proves that the wages paid in Australia compare favourably with those which obtain overseas:In New South Wales employees in the cornflour industry are paid a living wage. Does the Government wish these people reduced to the level of the black coolie? The award rates in New South Wales range from £<! 14s. to £3 18s. per week, but manufacturers pay £4 4s. and to tub-men £4 9s. per week. Are they to be condemned for doing this? In justice to that company and the industry generally, I think it only right to point out that the figures which were quoted by honourable members in opposition to a reduction of duty are correct, and that cornflour is sold in Australia for as little as 5d. per lb.",32
95,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yarra) [2.51] - Some weeks ago, I and other honourable members waited on the Postmaster-General  posal by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to bring a British military band to Australia as we believe that many highly qualified musicians in this country are out of work. I now learn from the press that it is the intention of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to form an Australian military band. I am very glad of that, for at no other time has there been greater need to give practical encouragement to Australian musicians.",33
96,Mr STACEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Adelaide) [2.52] - As Christmas 'is approaching, and there are many unemployed in Australia, the position being particularly acute in South Australia, I urge the Postmaster-General   portion of the profits made by the Postmaster-General's Department shall be appropriated for the purpose of renovating the Adelaide post office, which is in a sad state of disrepair. I point out that at least 50 per cent, of the expenditure would be for labour.",33
97,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"West Sydney) [2.53]. - I take the opportunity of urging the Acting Leader of the House (Mr. Parkhill) to forward a request to the Loan Council, now in session in Melbourne, to supplement the efforts that are being made by State Governments to provide extra relief employment before Christmas. The matter has been brought forward by other honourable members at question time, and it was referred to this morning by the honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley) who sought information in respect to the provision of relief for the unemployed in Canberra. For a couple of weeks I have been considering whether I should move the adjournment of the House, in order that representative members might express themselves on the subject, and urge the Commonwealth Government to take the necessary action. Previous Governments have made special arrangements to provide additional employment, prior to Christmas time. I may be told that this Government has provided a sum of money in the Estimates for additions, new works, and buildings, which will absorb many of the unemployed, but these votes are more or less earmarked, and are not likely to be expended immediately. For instance, one projected undertaking is the building of a sloop in Australia, but some time must elapse before this and other public works can be commenced. The various State authorities are providing relief work on a ration basis, and in some cases men work for food alone. It is most desirable that the Commonwealth Government should directly supplement the funds of the States, so that more constant employment may be given. I do not intend to labour this matter, because I am sure that every honourable member takes a sympathetic view of it. The Government may say that the responsibility rests with the States; but I contend that this Parliament cannot escape its obligations to the unemployed. v",33
98,Mr NAIRN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Perth) [2.57] - Whole sale merchants are put to a great deal of trouble and expense in preparing their returns, and in doing otlier things that are required of them under the Sales Tax Acts. To a large extent the wholesalers act as collectors of sales tax for. the Government, and the proportion of the tax collected by them is substantial, amounting in the case of some wholesale houses to thousands of pounds a year. In New Zealand the wholesalers received a discount of 5 per cent, upon the total amount of sales tax paid by them. Details of the extra amount of work which the Sales Tax Acts have thrown upon the wholesale merchants have been supplied to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey). I do not expect the Acting Leader of the  a reply today, but I urge him to ask Cabinet to consider whether some compensation can be paid to these merchants. In many parts of the back country of Western Australia no schools are provided, but education is given by means of private correspondence. State school teachers have taken this work up enthusiastically, and a considerable amount of correspondence passes between them and children residing in outlying districts. At one time this correspondence was post free, but now the concession is confined to the set papers and the teachers' comments upon the pupils' work. The request is that the teachers should be allowed free postage on personal letters to the scholars. Personal letters are of great value, because they often afford help and encouragement to the pupils. It is claimed that, if a concession is given, should be complete. I urge the Post favourable consideration to this request.",34
99,Mr R GREEN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Richmond) [3.0] - I recently brought under the notice of the  need for rebuilding the post office at Bangalow, and the Minister informed me that he proposed to make arrangements for the Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs to report on the matter. Has Mr Kitto yet visited Bangalow; if not, when is he likely to do so ? The residents desire that a decision be made without delay.",34
100,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"South Sydney) [3.1] I associate myself with the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr .Beasley), and urge the Postmaster action can be taken at the current meeting of the Loan Council to afford extra relief for the unemployed between now and Christmas. Any additional employment that may be given will amount to only a few crumbs, and something far short of what was promised by the Government at the last election. Nearly two years in the life of this Parliament have passed, and very little of a substantial character has been done by the present Government to provide work. It is most disappointing to find that large bodies of unemployed have the same sad story to tell week after week, and no hope of their deplorable position being improved. I suggest that, in order to expedite the provision of employment, the general budget debate should he postponed until after the consideration of the detailed Estimates.",34
101,Mr MAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hindmarsh) [3.5] - I cordially support the remarks of the honourable members for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) and Cook (Mr Riley). All honourable members, irrespective of party, desire that something shall he done to provide relief for the unemployed before Christmas, and I ask that the Commonwealth Government will supplement the assistance which the States m i l render to them. A soldier pensioner who is dissatisfied with the assessment of his pension, or with a decision regarding his eligibility it for a pension, has the right to appear before the Entitlement Tribunal to present his case, but a similar right is not accorded to the dependants of deceased returned soldiers. In their case the final court of appeal is the Repatriation Commission. This practice operates harshly in many instances. A case came before me recently in which the pension of the widow of a' deceased soldier was cancelled, because it was alleged that her mode of living made her ineligible. I was able to produce evidence of her good character from a clergyman and others associated witjh the mission conducted by him, as well as from a local storekeeper, a justice of the peace, and even from the police themselves. These persons described as "" vile suggestions "" the allegations concerning the woman, yet she has been deprived of her pension and has no means of securing redress. So desperate is her position that she is now in receipt of destitute ration relief. Living with her is a son in his 'teens, whose presence in the home surely disproves the accusations levelled against his mother. The department has treated this woman most harshly, and she should have the right to state her case before some independent tribunal. Obviously, I cannot, from my place in this House, give details of this case, but there should be some independent body to hear and determine her appeal against the decision of the department. I ask the Minister to give this woman an opportunity to appear before the Entitlement Tribunal.",34
102,Mr GANDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Reid) [3.7] - A few evenings ago Mr Edwin Lang Kelly, a returned soldier employed by the Commonwealth in the Census Department, was killed in a motor car accident in Canberra. Before coming here, he resided at Belmore, in the Reid electorate. His death has left his wife and family in a most precarious financial position, and I ask the Acting Leader of the House to make some grant to 'his widow to enable her to meet her husband's funeral expenses and other incidental outgoings. I do not know whether or not Mr Kelly was insured under the Workmen's Compensation Act, but I urge that somo immediate assistance be given to his widow.",35
103,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Parkes-Minister for Repatriation) [3.13] - The honourable member for Hindmash (Mr Makin) was not correct when he said that the' dependants of deceased returned soldiers could not appear before the Entitlement Tribunal. The widows of returned soldiers' may appeal to the Entitlement Tribunal. In the case of a soldier whose death, in the opinion of the Repatriation Commission, was not due to his war service, his widow has the right to approach the Entitlement Tribunal and to endeavour to prove that the man's death was, at least, in part due to his war service. Tho honourable member for Hindmarsh mentioned the case of a woman who had lost her pension because of her mode of living. Such cases are dealt with under section 37 of the act, and are always difficult. I am sure that no Minister, or officer of the department, desires to cancel the pension of a widow unless the case against. her has been proved beyond doubt.",35
104,Mr MAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I know of one officer who is only too willing to cancel pensions.,35
105,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member perused the file dealing with the case he has mentioned, and had no further comment to make.",35
106,Mr MAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I said that I was not satisfied.,35
107,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Instruction s have been issued that no further pensions are to be cancelled under section 37 until after the pensioner has been notified of the action proposed to be taken by the department. Another member of the party to which the honourable member for Hindmarsh belongs brought a similar case under my notice, but after a thorough investigation, it was proved beyond doubt that the charge was fully justified.",35
108,Mr MAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will the Minister give this person the right to appear before the Entitlement Tribunal?,35
109,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have not that power under the act. Parliament has provided that persons who claim to be entitled to pensions shall have the right to approach the Entitlement Tribunal, and if their claimis granted, to appear before the Assessment Tribunal. The act must be amended before I could do what the honourable member suggests.",35
110,Mr MAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will the Government consider the necessity of amending the act in that respect?,35
111,Mr MARE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At present Cabinet is considering similar requests made by organizations representing returned soldiers, and I am hoping that beforo Parliament adjourns for the Christmas vacation some decision will be reached.",35
112,Mr WHITE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.17] - The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) quoted from a letter from Sir Clifford Love, in an endeavour to iustify the action he took when the Senate's request on the item covering maize products, which includes cornflour, was under consideration. Yesterday, without mentioning any name, I a aid tLat a correspondent Lad complained because I bad presumed that his firm was working under an arrangement with iirown and Poison in Australia. Later T ""orrected that by pointing out that he had purchased the Australian rights and interests of the name Brown and Poison. I regret that copies of a conimunif.ation sent to me have been circulated to honourable members. Honourable members will agree that a Minister for Trade and Customs is always open to criticism by vested interests or by the representatives of an industry which may bo affected by changes of customs duties. The department extends every courtesy, aud provides every opportunity for representations to be made on behalf of any industry, however small, but I deprecate »ny attempt to exert pressure upon the Minister or private members. I am accused by Sir Clifford Love of making an attack upon the maize products industry. Nothing of the sort occurred. A. Minister for Trade and Customs dopends largely upon the advice tendered to him by the Tariff Board which hears evidence and makes its recommendations accordingly. ""While I am controlling the department, I shall not be influenced by any person or persons, but will deal with each case on its merits. I say, most emphatically, that whatever criticism may be levelled at me in communications sent direct to me or in anonymous letters to the press. I shall not deviate in the least, but shall adhere to the Government's policy, and do what I consider right in every case.",35
113,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,North Sydney) [8.80]. - I rise to correct an impression which must inevitably have been created by the statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) that Sir Clifford Love circulated among honourable members copies of the letter to which he referred.,36
114,Mr WHITE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He sent a copy - to the honourable member for Maribyrnong with another communication.,36
115,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know Sir Clifford. Love well. I took part in the discussion on the subject of cornflour, and I hope that I did so in an entirely proper manner. Sir Clifford did not send me a copy of the letter, and I know nothing of its contents. To that extent the statement of the Minister is incorrect. If copies of the communication were circulated amongst members, I did not receive a copy.",36
116,Mr WHITE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,At least one honourable member did.,36
117,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am merely correcting the statement of the Minister because it is calculated to reflect upon the character of Sir Clifford Love.,36
118,Mr WHITE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Not at all.,36
119,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Ye s it is. That gentleman has as much right as any one else to bring his case before Parliament, and I do not think that it would have been improper had a copy of the communication been sent to every honourable member. The only information I received came from the Chamber of Manufactures.",36
120,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I desire to make a personal explanation. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr 'White) referred to a. portion of Sir Clifford Love's letter to him which I did not quote.,36
121,Mr WHITE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I did not hear it all.,36
122,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The only portion I quoted was that dealing with the retail price of cornflour. 1 quoted a paragraph from another letter giving the wages paid in the industry. The points mentioned by the Minister were not quoted by mel t is not unusual for those interested in customs duties to communicate with honourable members. I have received many such letters, iind the communication to which I referred supports what I said about the low prices charged in Australia for cornflour.",36
123,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Swan) [3.24] - I direct the attention of the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Marr) to the fact that the repatriation department in Perth reduced an ex-soldier's pension without a proper oflicial examination. Subsequently the pensioner approached the department, which recommended that an additional pension be granted- Payment at the higher amount should be made retrospective to the date on which the pension was"" reduced. Anonymous letters have been sent to the department which have reflected upon this man's character, and which he claims have influenced the department. I communicated with the Minister on the matter some time ago, but up to the present have not received a reply. Anonymous letters should be immediately removed from the files and the Minister should make an authoritative statement to that effect. I ask him to look into this matter to ascertain whether some further compensation cannot be given to the person concerned.",36
124,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Warringah-Postmaster-General ) [3.36] I assure the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) that the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Marr) will, if he has not already done so, give full consideration to his representations and communicate with him on the subject. Every member of this Hoiise, irrespective of the party to which he belongs, is keenly and deeply interested in the provision of additional work for our people, and I shall, without delay, convey to the Prime Minister, who is at present with the Loan Council, the various requests of honourable members. I join with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) in expressing pleasure that the Broadcasting Commission has apparently-judgin g by the newspaper reports-adopte d the suggestion made by a deputation consisting of the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway), and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), that instead of engaging a military band from the United Kingdom, such an organization should be formed in Australia. There is, of course, much unemployment among musicians in the Commonwealth, and knowing their efliciency, I am sure that the commission will give serious consideration to the possibility of utilizing their talents in the way suggested. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Stacey) proposed that work should be found for the unemployed in Adelaide by renovating the general post office. The Estimates provide for work of that nature, and the honourable member can - rest assured that this means of engaging the unemployed on work of a reproductive character has not been lost sight of. I remind the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn) that the administration of the sales tax is under constant review. I understand that various interests and organizations are bringing under the notice of the Commissioner of Taxation most of the matters which he has raised this afternoon. In any case, I shall bring them to the attention of the Treasurer. The other matter which the honourable member raised, with respect to which there has been a great deal of - correspondence, relates to the assistance which the post office is asked to render to the education authorities of Western Australia in respect of correspondence schools. Every State in the Commonwealth carries on education by correspondence, particularly to the country and outback districts, and the Postal Department has gone so far as to permit set papers and corrections thereof, which ordinarily would come under the heading of commercial papers, to pass between teachers and pupils free of charge. That concession is accepted by all the States as a reasonable contribution to their education system. But one particular section in Western Australia has constantly urged that the Postal Department should also frank personal letters from the teacher to the pupil. That request is scarcely reasonable, and could with more justice be directed to the 'State education authorities who should pay for the service. This concession, if given to one State, would have to be given to the others and, consequently, become a matter of major importance. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) has referred to the Bangalow post office, and I admit that he has a case for consideration. The building was destroyed by fire, and the local people are, quite justifiably, agitating for the replacement of the building, so as to obviate an unsightly interval in the main street. I informed the honourable member that I would arrange for the Deputy Director of Postal Services in Sydney to visit Bangalow to inquire into this matter, but that officer took his leave some three weeks ago, and will not return for about ten days. While I am in Sydney this week-end I shall ascertain the exact date-whic h will be reasonably early-whe n an inquiry can be made by Mr Kitto. The honourable member for Reid (Mr. Gander) has referred to the tragic death of Mr Edwin Lang Kelly, which took place a few days ago. Mr Kelly was employed in a temporary capacity on the Census staff, and, I understand, that under the Public Service Regulations, there can be no claim for special - compensation. However I shall have further of inquiries made and the House can rest assured that the matter will be sympathetically dealt with. Everybody naturlian ally sympathizes with the widow and are as follow:children in their bereavement. It is tragic that the breadwinner of the family, after having at last obtained temporary employment, should now be taken away. I shall bring this matter before the Treasurer to ascertain whether some compassionate allowance can be made. The honourable member for Cook (Mr 3 per cent. 1938 Riley) has suggested that the detailed 3} Estimates might be discussed before the 4 per cent. 1938 general debate on the budget is continued, but I do not think that, by that procedure, we would save much time. shall, however, look into the proposal. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.35 p.m. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS - This security The following answers lo questions were circulated:NA RAILWAYS.",37

129,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALT HLINE OF,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. What portion of the £100,000 which the LOANS. previous Government made available for the employment of coal-miners in New South Wales and Queensland is still unexpended? 2. Has the committee appointed by the previous Government consisting of the Honourable John Gunn, representing the Federal Government, Mr Hamilton Knight, M.L.A., cent., representing the New South Wales Government, Mr Thomas Leahy, representing oil si ml a deposits, nnd Mr 13.

Treganowan and Ohamberit for the purpose of exploiting the Newnes oil shale deposits: if so, what hag been the result nf this company's operations? 5. Will the Minister inform the House of the future intentions of the Goveniment in connection with this very important work?",38
130,Mr LYONS,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALT HLINE OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. A balance of approximately £48.000 remains in the trust account which was established for the repatriation of surplus coalminers. 2. The company known as Shale Oil Development Committee Limited, the directorate of which includes the Honourable John Gunn, Messrs. Hamilton Knight, T. Leahy, and D. Duvics, is now in process of liquidation. 3. Subject to a satisfactory report being made by a technical committee appointed by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales, which is at present conducting investigations into the economics of the Newnes shale oil undertaking, it is intended that the balance remaining in the trust account shall he used for the promotion of the development of the shale nil industry. ^ 4. Acting upon a recommendation made by Shale Oil Development Committee Limited, the Government accepted a tender from Messrs. Treganowan and Chambers in respect of the exploitation of the shale oil industry in the locality of Newnes, but Messrs. Treganowan and Chambers were not able to procure capital requirements necessary to implement tlieir offer. 5. As indicated in 3. a technical committee appointed by the Governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales is at present conducting investigations into the economics of the Newnes shale oil undertaking, it is expected that the report of the committee, which is known as the Newnes Investigation Committee, w i ll he available during December, and, if the report is favourable, both governnunits have undertaken to encourage the formation of a public company to carry out large-scale operations at Newnes. Further, the Governments of the Couunonwealth and New South Wales have agreed, subject to the formation of such company, jointly to make available by way of loan to the company, a sum of £80,000.

Trade and Customs, upon noticeIs he prepared to arrange the same tariff, primage and sales tax concessions to Canadian timbers as are being accorded to those of British North Borneo?",39
133,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALT HLINE OF,This matter will be considered when the tariff agreement with Canada is being further discussed with the Canadian Government. RANDWICK DRILL HALL .,39
134,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALT HLINE OF,"On the 1st November, the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Jennings) asked the following question, without notice:Is the Assistant Minister for Defence aware that the lst/19th Battalion, Randwick. are requesting public assistance with respect to necessary drill halls, and that the defence vote has heen reduced to such an extent that officers are defraying the cost of transport of the battalion bandsmen? Will the honourable gentleman have t l m serious position inquired into, with a view to the speedv adjustment of it? I am now in a position to inform the honourable member as follows:On the ICth October, 1.933, the Commanding Officer, lst/19th Battalion, located at Randwick, addressed a letter to the Randwick, Vaucluse, Wnollahra and Waverley Councils seeking the interest and active assistance of , these councils in the welfare of the regiment. The letter was the outcome of a personal conversation which the Commanding Oflicer had with the Mayors of Randwick and Waverley at a church parade at Clovelly. The Mayors asked the Commanding Officer to put forward some concrete proposition as .to how they could help. In the letter referred to, the Commanding Officer pointed out that the close proximity of the beaches in the area and the wealth of sports available made it very difficult to obtain the right stamp of recruit. The Commanding Officer thought that, if he could get assistance from public bodies such as the councils mentioned, he could make great headway with (lis unit. He pointed out that, although he could provide the necessary attractive training if he could jret the recruits, he wag handicapped by lack of funds to make the d r ill hall an attractive social centre for the troops. The Commanding Oflicer stated that, briefly, lio considered the councils could assist-(a ) by arranging a public meeting with u view to organizing a citizens' welfare association; l o ) by the aldermen taking a definite interest in the u n it ; (c) by such financial aid as providing sporting equipment for the d r ill hall from funds raised at socials, dances and such functions organized with the co-operation and assistance of councils und citizens committees. The Commanding Oflicer also Tofened tn a recent address by the Chief of ths General Staff, when that' oflicer stated that in Melbourne the councils were of the greatest assistance to various units. As regards the fares for bandsmen, this qiiestion was acute prior to the recent increase in the allowances for fares, as most of the bandsmen were out of employment, and it was always a difficult matter to get the bandsmen to parade. This haa now been alleviated by the increase in the amount of money which he's recently been made available for the payment of fares for militia .",39
