7,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"On the ioth.inst., the honourable member for Yarra asked me' a aeries of questions-Hansard , page 4519 - regardin g certain allegations contained in a letter published in the Argus on the _3oth August. An interim answer was given, but I am now furnished with detailed replies, which are as follow1. Yes. 2. It is reported that 40 are now required as against 30 in 1903. 3. Thirteen. 4. The number of hands asked for was reduced by the Treasurer, because lie considered it. undesirable to largely increase permanently staff required to deal with the business in a time - of great activity, which might not be constant, and because he thought that the pressure could be adequately, met by the employment of temporary hands, for which he was willing to make'provision, vide his statement in Parliament (page 3310 of Hansard). 5. Yes, but officers eat their lunch while on duty, and it is reported that since ist January this year no officer has so worked on an average more than two and a-half times per month, and that telegraphists were offered as an alternative to work 7^ hours continuously only when this special extra duty was required of them, but they preferred the g-hour arrangement to being called upon to work extra duty more frequently. In . no case, it is said, do these officers exceed the limit fixed by the Public Service Commissioner of 84 hours per current fortnight. 6. See answer to No. 5. been given that will prevent working for long periods without an interval for a meal; also that telegraphists are not to be utilized for relieving in purely clerical branches, and temporary hands will be employed to meet requirements, vide answer to No. 4. 7.

8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Parramatta) [2.45] - I intend to take advantage of this motion to make a statement which' I might perhaps call a personal explanation. Last night I said across the table that the Gp : vernment, in connection with the framing of the Tariff schedule, has acted towards certain firms in a manner which has constituted a species of political favouritism. That statement wits resented, I believe, by the Minister of Trade and Customs. I further said that, - some days ago, in reply to a similar statement concerning the firms the referred to, and their machinery, the Treasurer had misled, or sought to mislead, the immediate leader of the Opposition ",15
9,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I pointed out to the honourable member last evening that there can be no debate in anticipation of another debate which must take place in Committee of Ways and Means on the Tariff. Of course, it is my duty not only to be fair, but to make my fairness perfectly clear to - the whole House. The question raised by the honourable member for Dalley, and replied to by the Minister of Trade and Customs last night, was one which had no necessary connection with the Tariff. It was a mere question of administration, whether the Minister of. Trade and Customs Instructions have ought or ought not to declare certain items of imports duty free for any special purposes, under a law which is on our statute book. That was the question raised by the honourable member for Dalley, and the question to which, after one or two objections, I permitted the Minister to reply. But the honourable member for Parramatta raised quite another matter-as to whether, under the' Tariff, undue preference had been shown to certain industries or to certain persons. The honourable member clearly showed that he was dealing with the Tariff by holding up a copy and turning to a certain .page; and, under the circumstances, I had only one duty, and that was to require that no debate should take place on that issue. The ruling I gave then is precisely the same as the ruling I give now, namely, that there can be no debate in anticipation of a discussion which must take place on a future date.",15
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Not on grievance day ?,16
11,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Not even on grievance day. If the honourable member desires, however, to make a personal explanation, which does not involve a discussion on the Tariff, he is at liberty to do so.",16
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I was about to explain the remarks I made last night. I do not intend to discuss the matter, though it is one of such importance that it ought to be discussed before these items on the Tariff are reached. I understand that a great deal of machinery is on the water, and injustice may be done as between importers unless some action be taken prior to the items being reached in ordinary course in the Tariff.",16
13,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,There i9 no. way in which that can be done.,16
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Ver y well, then, I shall confine myself to a personal explanation. The remarks of the Treasurer to which I referred last night are to be found in Hansard, and are as followsAs I have already shown, the alteration was merely a departmental ' matter, made for the sake of clearness. 0 That is the alteration in the arrangement of the Tariff schedule. The meaning of the provision is the same as that of the exemption in the old Tariff. I had nothing to do with the alteration, and it was not fair for the honourable gentleman to try to fasten upon me something which was done' by the Department for convenience. The same arrangement was made under the old Tariff, but the form of words in the new Tariff is clearer than that formerly adopted. It is quite clear that what I said last night was perfectly accurate; and if the Minister will direct his attention to Tariff item 166 he will see that machinery, which was before exempt, has been made dutiable; and that the only two items of machinery which are exempt are used in the felt hat industry and the woollen industry. Clearly, therefore, in defining the special schedule, the Government have excluded all other items ? and what they have done is to impose a duty of 20 and 25 per cent, on machinery which was previously exempt.",16
15,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [2.47]. Mr Speaker,16
16,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,What does the Minister propose to do?,16
17,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I propose to make a statement regarding the information which was asked for by the honourable member for Dalley last night. That honourable member last night made a statement which was supplemented, by interjection, by the leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Parramatta, that hat leathers had been placed on the free list as minor articles of manufacture for reasons of our own as a Government.",16
18,Mr REID,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I never referred to hat leathers, but to machinery. . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I accept the honourable member's disclaimer. But the honourable member for Parramatta emphasized the statement that this was a clear case of favouritism. As these decisions are given by the Comptroller-General, I asked that gentleman for a report, which I have received, and which I wish to read, so that honourable members may know the exact circumstances. The document is as followsThe exemption of leather hat bands used in the making of hats as "" minor articles "" was an ordinary departmental act of administration, and was made without reference to the Minister in the usual course of business. The reason for including this article in the list was because it was judged one which should be so included on its merits, and further because it was included under the old Tariff, and its omission under the present Tariff from the list was entirely accidental. There was not the slightest thought of specially favouring the hat industry in the matter. This will be evident when it is mentioned that there are already about 300 minor articles specified in the free list, which are used in over forty manufactures, and that of these only eleven minor articles used in hat and cap making appear in the list, such as braid, bindings, galoons, vents, ventilators,' &c. It will thus be seen that no exceptional treatment has been given to the hat and cap manufacture, e.g., about fifty articles are specified for vehicles, thirty-three for attire, and so on. It may be added that more than twenty-five other articles have been added to the minor articles list since the new Tariff for manufactures other than hats. L IST of goods which have been exempted minor articles, under item 429 of the Tariff, and of other goods, the similar emption of which is under consideration :GOODS ADDED TO MINOR ARTICLE LIST .

I think For Apparel. the honourable member for Parramatta will admit that he was mistaken when he said that the circumstances showed some f a voritism on the part of the Government.",16

20,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"If that is what the honourable member desires to show, he is at perfect liberty to do so.  subject by referring to the machinery used in the case of fibrous material. I cannot understand why the same machinery should be admitted free in Victoria and New South Wales, and charged the duties I have mentioned in Queensland. I admit that the ways of the Customs Department are very peculiar; in fact, there seems to be a different duty for different States-it all depends on the sort of dose the public are prepared to swallow. If there has to be any. differentiation, I do not think it should be iii connection with the machinery used in the primary industries. I cannot see the difference between a wool-washing and a wool-drying machine; as a matter of fact, they are part and parcel of one industry.",17
21,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Dalley) [2.55] - The Minister of Trade and Customs has apparently misunderstood the position. make the statement which the honourable gentleman attributes to me. words I used wereI t is a significant fact that hat-making has again received preferential treatment. that the Customs Department have the power to do what they have done, but why did not the Government, when they discovered that exorbitant duties had been placed on other articles, such as chairs, use the same power to reduce duty, say, from 7s. 6d. to 2S. 6d. per chair? I thanked the Minister last night for his courtesy, and I thank him today for the further information he has afforded. We are told now that it was the Comptroller General who gave this decision without consulting the Minister; and if that be so, I regard it as a most dangerous practice^-as a most dangerous power to place in the hands of any Comptroller-General. Of course, we know that for whatever the Comptroller-General does the Minister must take.the responsibility; and I asked the question last night because I found that hat leathers had been treated in' the way described a few days after the lodging of the Tariff. The Minister informed me that the discovery was made that there had been an omission; and I now ask, how do we know that similar omissions have not been made in other directions? I did not accuse the Minister of Trade and Customs of favouring any indus ry, but merely alluded to the significant fact that the hat industry enjoys two kinds of preferenceone in regard to leather bands, and another in regard to machinery. Had T or any one else thought that the Minister had been so neglectful of his duty as to favour any trade or occupation, not merely a auestion would have been asked, but I think thf leader of the Opposition would have tabled a vote of censure. I take this opportunity' to make clear my reasons for asking the question last night.",18
22,Mr REID,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"East Sydney) [2.58] Without imputing anv personal or improper interest of any kind on the part of Ministers-whic h I admit would"" be a matter not to be dealt with except in the most formal way- I deliberately repeat that the conduct of the Government has amounted to an act of favouritism to two particular industries. I desire to prove that, and, in proving it, I refer to the Tariff which is now the law of the land. In that Tariff there is no schedule of any kind like the schedule of which I spoke a few days ago. In the Tariff' Act of 1902 there is not a schedule like that to which I am now referring- a schedule which, whilst professI did not ing to make machinery liable to duty, enables those who pay that duty to get a reThe exact fund. There has never - been such, a schedule in connection with Commonwealth Tariff legislation. A further point is, I admit that whilst machinery used in woollen and hat mills was exempt under the old Tariff, that exemption was a straightforward one,, such machinery being included under the the heading of ""special exemptions."" A num- ' ber of other exemptions were covered by the same clause. But whilst woollen and hat-mills' machinery have this special favour under the new Tariff, the other machinery, which appeared in the same clause in the old Tariff, has been made liable to duties ranging from 20 to 25 per cent. This is the exemption in the Tariff of 1902Machinery for scouring, washing, carding, spinning, weaving, and finishing the manufacture of fibrous materials. Under the new Tariff, machinery for scouring and .washing wool, which under the old Tariff was free, is liable to duties ranging from 20 to 25 per cent., whilst, on the other hand, importers of machinery for hat and woollen mills, who pay duty upon it, subsequently get it back. Surely the primary industries in connection with the washing and scouring of wool are entitled + to the same treatment as is - extended to the woollen and hat-mill industry. The wool which we grow receives no protection, ' and is not benefited under the protective system. There has been a deliberate cutting up of the exemption of 1902, under which washers and scourers of our own wool'will have to pay upon their machinery, a duty of from 20 to 25' per cent, whilst woollen and hat-mill machinery appears in a special schedule, and every penny paid by. way of duty upon it will be. returned. A number of other industries were covered by the special exemption - in the old Tariff. for. the manufacture of felting-the rest of these special exemptions under the Tariff of 1902-ar e now made liable to ahigh duty. Soap-cutting machines, printing machines, and presses, and a lot of other machinery, which was exempt, is also liable to duty under the present Tariff. My complaint is that woollen and hat-mill machinery has alone been taken out ' of the old list of special exemptions, and placed in a new schedule, whilst a heavy duty has been imposed upon other machinery in that list. I call that favouritism. Clearly it must be favouritism, unless there be some special justification; which I cannot at present see, for the action of the Ministry. Their action is the less excusable, because machinery used in other industries, even if it cannot be reasonably manufactured in Australia, may not be brought in free of duty. In such cases the importers have first of all to obtain from the two Houses of Parliament a declaration that it cannot reasonably be manufactured in Australia. .",18
23,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I think that the honourable member will clearly recognise that he is trying to evade a ruling-although , if I may say so, he is doing so very cleverly-whic h I gave a few minutes ago, and that I could not allow even him to do - so. . . Mr Reid - I plead guilty, sir.",19
24,Mr CROUCH,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Corio) [3.4] - I wish to bring under your notice, Mr Speaker, the' fact that this building has not yet been sewered. The present state of affairs is simply disgraceful.' I am today suffering from a sore throat, which has become almost chronic, through my attendance in this House, and it is scandalous that, although the Victorian Parliament has allpwed us to occupy this building for nearly seven years, and we may be occupying it for some time longer, we are not prepared to incur the cost of sewering it. If the delay in undertaking the necessary work is clue to a desire on the ipart of some one to hasten the settlement of the Capital Site question, it certainly is improper. It seems to me that it would be the acme of meanness on the part of the Federation to refuse to incur the expense of .carrying out the work. I - Mr SPEAKER - If the honourable member will pardon me, I shall make a statement which may possibly curtail Machinery debate. I thought the House was awaro paper and of the ' fact that after some negotiations, not unduly prolonged, an ar J rangement was arrived at some five or six months ago between' the Commonwealth, and State authorities by which the whole of the sewerage work was to be carried out, and all the conveniences we desire provided. Subsequently it was pointed out that blasting operations would be necessary to enable the pipes to be carried through the foundations of this building, and also in making some adjacent excavations, and that this work could not be conveniently undertaken whilst Parliament was in session. That being so. it has been found necessary to allow the work to stand over until the close of the session, .when I have no doubt it will be speedily completed. The only reason for the delay is that portion of the work necessary, in the opinion of the engineers, could not be carried on during the sittings of the House.",19
25,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Coolgardie) [3-8] - The affairs of the Postal Department in Victoria are so disorganized as to entitle the House to some statement on the subject from the Postmaster-General. For nearly twelve months the office of Deputy Postmaster-General in Victoria has been vacant, and so far, apparently, no successful step"" has been taken to fill it. In certain circumstances a temporary appointment might bn desirable, but I think it is generally admitted that the Department in this Stale requires an immediate overhaul, and the supervision of a vigilant and capable administrator. It is common knowledge that the Public Service Commissioner nominated for the position Mr Betheras, senior inspector in Victoria, but I understand that that gentleman was held to be ineligible because of the position he fills in the service. Being required to report to the Commissioner on the qualifications of every applicant for avacant, office, he certainly occupies a delicate position in re ; spect to other competitors' for this post. In excluding him I think the Government have established a - salutary rule. In other spheres men are not permitted to be the judges of their own cause, and the prohibition of it in this instance is sound and wholesome. These inspectors are virtually supervisors of the rest of the service, with statutory security both as to salary and tenure of office. That being so, it does seem scarcely, proper for them to be reaching out for every chance of promotion that presents itself. If that is a good rule, and I think it is, it should be capable of extension, and unless there are strong reasons to the contrary it should apply to those in the central administration, . who have, so to speak, the ear qf the Minister. I have nothing to say against the officers of the central bureau-the y are excellent men-bu t in applying for promotion they undoubtedly enjoy an advantage over others. Other officers have apparently to wait for a vacancy in their own particular branch before securing promotion, and very special circumstances are required to warrant any departure from the tacit arrange. ment in favour of those who are brought into repeated personal contact with the Minister.",19
26,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The officers own claims uppermost?,20
27,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"They have no power to do that. The duty of the Commissioner is to see that the right man is selected for every office, and justice meted out. It appears, however, that the Government have rejected Mr Betheras' application, and that the Commissioner, has nominated Mr Springhall for the position.",20
28,Mr THOMAS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Why have they rejected Mr Betheras?,20
29,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Because , as I have said already, he has to judge of the qualifications of other applicants, and therefore cannot enter the lists as a competitor for any vacant position. That, I understand, is the position taken up by the Government.",20
30,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,It is the legal position.,20
31,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"It is certainly a just and common-sense position. I understand that the Commissioner nominated for the office of Deputy Postmaster-General of Victoria Mr Springhall, who is the senior officer in this branch of the Department, and is also a Victorian. He was born in 1849, and entered the service in 1867, so that he has had some forty years' service. When transferred to the"" Commonwealth service .he was receiving a salary of ^ 6 0 0 per annum, and that is the remuneration which he enjoys today. He is superintendent of the mail branch, yet his nomination has not met with the' approval of the Government, who are now bringing from Queensland an officer' to act as Deputy Postmaster-General in this State.",20
32,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,It is to be a temporary appointment ?,20
33,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Yes .,20
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,It seems a pity that there is no man in the service in Victoria fitted for the position.,20
35,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,It would be a pity were it actually so; but it happens that the Victorian service contains several highly capable men.,20
36,Mr WATSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,It is a very good thing to obtain from other States officers necessary to overhaul a Department.,20
37,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"We l l , the much vaunted officials who were sent to Western Australia to reorganize the Department have accomplished nothing very startling. .",20
38,Mr WATSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"That may be, but an outsider is necessary to reorganize an office.",20
39,Sir JOHN FORREST,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I have said all along that Western Australia has been there put their made a dumping ground.,20
40,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"It is remarkable that an officer who has been connected with the Department for forty years, and who is still in the prime of life-bein g under sixty years of age",20
41,Mr LIDDELL,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"That is a good age for a man to be in "" the prime of l if e . """,20
42,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"At sixty years of age some men are virtually in the prime of life. But even if Mr Springhall is not qualified to fill the position, I should like to learn from the Minister why the acting Deputy Postmaster-General of Victoria is not capable of filling it . It is a curious circumstance that the Government, whose hesitancy implies a doubt as to the capa city of Mr Crosbie, should have allowed him to fill the position of Deputy Postmaster-General for a period of eighteen months within the past three years. Mr Crosbie has acted for that term within the past three years whilst Mr Outtrim was absent on leave, and since his retirement .from the service. He has thirty-seven years of service to his credit, and I believe that he thoroughly understands the requirements of the Department. If he does not he ought not to have been permitted td occupy his present position. I have brought this matter forward with a view to affording the Government an opportunity of stating what they propose to do in this connection. It seems to me that thei action in bringing an r officer from Queensland to reorganize the Victorian Postal Department requires some justification.  men in Queensland.",20
43,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Until the last few years the officer whom it is proposed to temporarily appoint to the position was merely a senior inspector.,21
44,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,He must be a good man or he would riot have obtained promotion.,21
45,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"If he is such a superior person it is a curious thing that there should be so many complaints made in reference to the conduct of the General Post Office, Brisbane.  being made?",21
46,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"In another place, a number of questions have been asked upon the subject. Although this gentleman is now Deputy Postmaster-General at Bris-' bane, his experience of the practical work of administering a Department is comparatively brief. I imagine that there ought to be a man in the Victorian service capable of fulfillin g the duties of Deputy Postm aster-General.",21
47,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,They must be numskulls here if there is not.,21
48,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Probably the Victorian representatives will-have something' to say upon this matter, because it so intimately affects their own State. But as it also affects the whole community, it is not improper for me to ask the Postmaster General to make a statement upon the subject.",21
49,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Melbourne Ports) [3.20] - I address myself to this question with a feeling of great humiliation. Apparently we cannot produce officers in Victoria who are capable of discharging the <luties which they have been trained to perform. The honourable member for Maranoa has said that we have been a long time in discovering that fact. But he mus : remem1 ber that we have to learn. ' I have no desire to pit State against State, but I am of opinion that the Postal Department of Victoria contains officers who are ouite as capable of managing it as are those from any other State.",21
50,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,More so.,21
51,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I will not sav that. It has been said that the General Post Office. Melbourne, is in 3 state of chaos. But we should recollect that similar complaints have been made retrardinqr ""the General Post Offices in the other .States. My own belief is that the chaotic condition of the Department is due to the oenurio""s-ness which has been observed in its administration-.. I believe that funds have been meted out in a most niggardly fashion, so that it has been , quite impossible to administer the Department in the way in which i i ought to be administered. I protest against an officer being brought from Queensland to take charge of the General Post Office in Melbourne. In filling the vacancy which has been occasioned by Mr Outtrim's retirement, surely those who have been connected with the Victorian office for years past ought to have a strong claim for consideration at the hands of the Government. I have had no more experience than other honourable members of the two Victorian officers to. whom reference has been made, but I do say that whilst age may bar one of 'them from filling the position of Deputy Postmaster-General in this State it cannot bar the other. It is with a deep feeling of humiliation that I find that we have not men in Victoria who are considered qualified to discharge the duties attaching to the position of Deputy Postmaster-General. . Mr Webster (Gwydir) [3.23] - I do not know whether we ought to be pleased with the opinions which have been expressed by the two previous speakers in regard to the administration of the Postal Department. In my judgment it is not a wise thing to interfere with the selection of officers by those i;n authority. They ought to know what men are best qualified to discharge particular duties, and the less therefore that we have to do with the selection nf officers the better will it be for the Department. Reasonable criticism can be indulged in only at the cost of sowing the seeds of discontent amongst those engaged in the service. At the same time, I do desire. to say a word - or two upon another aspect of this question which does not infringe upon the prerogative of the Public Service Commissioner. I wish to draw attention to the "" tangle"" which exists throughout the Postal Department today. As honourable members are aware, I have asked a number of questions in this House with a view to ascertaining the exact conditions which prevail. Needless to add, I am far from satisfied with the replies which have been supplied to the Postmaster General by those who are responsible for the existing condition of affairs. It has been admitted by the Postmaster-General that the Deputy Postmaster-General in New South Wales reported that the employment of no less than 600 additional hands was necessary to enable the Department to be conducted efficiently, and to dispense with the overtime which is being worked throughout that State. But, notwithstanding that report, we find that provision has been upon the Estimates for the employment only 267 additional hands. Further, the Department has issued circulars to the postal officers throughout New South Wales practically forbidding them to employ porary hands. When I asked the Minister how he proposed to allow permanent officers "" time off "" he said that the Treasurer had over and above what they were engaged informed him that if any rush of business was experienced, or if the circumstances warranted.it, temporary hands would be ployed. Here is a body of men who have worked 32,000 hours overtime, and Whose "" time off "" under the terms of their ment is in arrears to the tune of 306 weeks.* ployed. Yet it is proposed to appoint only 267 ditional hands. How the Government going to redeem their promise to allow their best in these men the "" time off "" to which they entitled, passes my understanding. The existing condition of affairs is a scandal the Department. It is scandalous to work men as' they have been worked in New South Wales, and it is an aggravation of the scandal to continue that system. The Postmaster-General has informed me that the Treasurer thinks it is not point a large number of hands, because the present rush of business is not likely to continue. That is a very lame excuse indeed. Sincethe Department was taken over by the Commonwealth, experience has shown thatits revenue has inorable creased in an equal ratio year by year. The Department is not being fairly adDeputy ministered when it is sought to prove that it is not necessary, to make provision for the removal of the present abuses, inasthe much as the rush of work vyhich causes to so much overtime mav be merely temporary. If Australia progresses as, according the Treasurer, it will do, the business of the Post Office must increase every year, and the number of officers employed six years ago cannot be sufficient to deal with the increased'volume of work. If are not taken to relieve the pressure oh the New South Wales Department, stronger action must be taken in Parliament. A strict and searchinginquiry into the ministration of the Department must be inaugurated if the Government cermit the present evils to continue. The PostmasterBetheras General, when in Sydney recently, heard the complaints of the persons affected. Deputation after deputation laid before facts and figures by which he was almost paralvzed, or; at any rate, he left behind tary's branch. Mr Webster. the impression that he was greatly affected made by the statement of the position given to of him by those who understood it. Why does the Government play with this question ? Why is not something done to give relief?' I have asked whether the men are to be-, tempaid for 'the overtime which they have honestly worked-othe r institutions would pay their employees for services rendered 1 to perform-and have been told that overtime will not be paid, but that "" time off "" emwill be allowed. This, I have shown, is impossible, seeing that 600 men are. needed' to efficiently discharge the work of the Deengagepartment, while only 267 are to be emI f the present position is ad- 'allowed to continue, men who ought, are to be happy and contented, doing the interests of the are Commonwealth, will lose heart, and become discontented. If these evils arc to not remedied before they assume still moregigantic proportions, an. inquiry which wilf loosen the tongues of men who are not now in a position to speak will have to be made, so that the public may know how the Commonwealth is treating those who are giving; wise to apit honest and good service.",21
52,Mr SALMON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Laanecoorie) [3.35]-Whilst I am anxious that the Tariff discussion shall be proceeded with, I crave a few moments in which to refer to a mattpr brought forward this afternoon by the honmember for Coolgardie-the contemplated appointment to the position of Postmaster-General in.

I hope that the Postmasterfering General will not carry out what has sioner in this respect. been publicly stated to be his intention, namely, the appointment of a Queensland officer as Acting Deputy Postmaster-General for six or twelve months, and the sending of an officer of the central administration to Brisbane to get sufficient subsequently justify his permanent appointment as Deputy Postmaster-General.

78,Mr HUTCHISON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,We ought to know' the reason for such a promotion.,24
79,Mr SALMON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"My grievance is, not that a particular officer is being appointed, but that competent officers are being passed over in favour of an officer who, in my opinion, because of the nature of the work which he has been doing, should not be a candidate for appointment. Therefore, as a Victorian representative, I have felt bound to refer to the subject. I hope thaf we have heard the last of statements as . to the incompetency of Victorian officers. My experience, which extends over fourteen years, is that in the Victorian service there is a large number of mien who, by loyal, ungrudging, and self-sacrificing work, have fitted themselves for the highest position that could be offered to them in the Department.",24
80,Mr HUGHES,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"West Sydney) [3-44] A week or two ago I called the attention of the Postmaster-General to the sweating practised in connection with the delivery of letters in New South Wales. That having been brought under his notice, I feel sure that the honourable gentleman will take steps to put an end to it. The Postal Department, which is a very large one, has been forced, or has fallen,' into the practice of getting its employees to work for as little as possible. It has screwed the very heart's blood out of its contractors. That is particularly the case in regard to country contracts; and I know of one man who has been for some years past engaged to paint pillar-boxes, write signs, and so forth, and who now is quite unable to collect from the Department some ^ 3 5 owing to him. In some cases, the proper authority is not given for the work to be done, and when the work is done without the authority there is delayin payment or repudiation of the informal procedure. Some months have elapsed since this money became due. and the man is quite unable to get it. I should not mention the fact in this public way were it not that this is by no means an isolated case. I do not object to business like principles being observed; but throughout this Department there is a tendency to take advantage of the helpless position in which public servants find themselves, after years of experience in a public Department, perfectly useless as competitors outside. Two other cases occur to my mind, one of which I mentioned in the last Parliament, and which has since been referred to several 1 times by the honourable member for Gwydir, who, in my absence, was kind enough to take the matter up. The case is that of a postal official who, after thirty years' faithf u l service, died at his post. He had been a contributor for many years to the superannuation .fund , and yet his widow and family have not as yet received one fraction of a farthing in the way of compensation for their loss. The reason given by the Department is that the State is liable, while the State retorts that the Commonwealth is liable; and between the two the family get nothing. There was another case of a postmaster in one of"" the Sydney suburbs who also died at his' post after about twenty-eight years' service; arid.yet the Department made absolutely no effort to compensate his family in any way.",24
81,Mr WEBSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"There was another similar case of a man who had been forty-three years in the service. Mr ' HUGHES - As I say these are by no means isolated cases; and in each the cold-blooded .answer is that the liability is some one else's. But the liability cannot be some one else's, seeing that these men were servants of the. Department. Such treatment is most inhuman, and, moreover, it is not good business, because any lack of consideration on the part of the Department does not tend to good service; for if a man knows that those who depend on him will be looked after, he does his best. If a private employer treated his employees in a similar way he would be hauled into a Court in no time. In the case of the PostalDepartment, however, it is too much to expect these people to take action. In one case the Department pleaded that it was not legally responsible, and the law had to be altered, the claimant having to suffer considerable delay and expense. The because painter to whom I first referred ought to beat once paid what is due to him. The honourable member for Gwydir recently"" drew the attention of honourable members to cases which are typical of the methods of the Department in regard to overtime, the employment of boys, and of lower grade officers to do higher grade work, at, of course, lower grade pay. Then, again, we have the employment of so-called temporarv hands, who, with the exception of the statutory interval, are kept engaged year after year at lower salaries than would otherwise have to be paid.",24
82,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Thos e temporary hands have been paid higher wages since I took over the administration.,25
83,Mr HUGHES,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"If so, they are quite unaware of the fact; at any rate, I know of many cases in which the pay has not been increased.",25
84,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"1I have issued an order that, wherever it is possible, these temporary hands are to be paid the current rate of wages outside, and in some cases they are paid more than the permanent hands.",25
85,Mr HUGHES,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I have in my mind boys who have been put on to men's work; and also men at .£150 a year who are called upon to do work for which others have been previously paid ^200 per annum.,25
86,Mr WEBSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,That is a common occurrence.,25
87,Mr HUGHES,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,So common is it that it has almost ceased to be a ground of complaint. I shall be happy to supply privately to the Postmaster-General the names of the officers to whom I have referred.,25
88,Mr KNOX,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Kooyong) [3.52] - In regard to the matter referred to by the honourable member for Coolgardie, I may say that I felt very great surprise when I saw the announcement in the press that it was proposed to bring from another State some officer to fill a position of responsibility and control in Victoria. Such an appointment is practically an inference that there is no officer in Victoria competent to fill the position. I believe there have been difficulties and complications in this matter. First-of "" all, Mr Betheras, as capable an officer as any in Victoria, was recommended by the Public Service Commissioner, but representations were, perhaps properly, made that he was, from his position, immediately associated with' the Public Service Commissioner, and that this was likely to create some objection. Why the subsequent recommendation of Mr. Springhall made by the Public Service Commissioner has not been acted upon is a question to which, probably, the representative of the Government will at a later stage refer. As the name of this officer has been mentioned, I may say that, in my opinion, his record in Victoria is such as ought to commend him to the Department. He has held the position of Deputy Postmaster-General in the past, and no one can say that he did not perform: the work excellently. We all recognise that the Minister has the power of veto; but I am sure that, on the grounds of long service and priority, this gentleman deserves consideration at the hands of the Government. It is becoming more and more apparent that, in the enormous Public Service of the Commonwealth, the work of the Departments will fall into the hands of the senior permanent officers; and, therefore, it becomes essential that there should not be the slightest suggestion of preference for any officer who happens, accidentally or otherwise, to be <so near the centre of authority as to secure special consideration. The honourable member for Laanecoorie referred to a rumour, for which I hope there is no ground, that a comparatively junior officer has a chance of appointment to the position. I should be the last to interfere with a Minister's prerogative, or to advocate promotion irrespective of merit; but I must protest against the appoint-ment of a relatively subordinate officer, when there are others more eligible and equally capable. I do not attach much importance to the fact that the officer recommended is from another State, because we must regard the service as bne great whole. I do say, however, that no man brought from Queensland canbe more fully aware of the ramifications of the service in Victoria than are the officers already located in that State. To say that in the large staff in Victoria there is no man capable of filling the position is contrary to fact.",25
89,Mr EDWARDS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,No one has said that.,25
90,Mr KNOX,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"No one has said so, but the fact that an officer, is being brought from a distant State, while there are equally or more capable officers in Victoria, speaks more emphatically than any words.",25
91,Mr EDWARDS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,It is only a temporary appointment.,25
92,Mr KNOX,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"That may be so, and perhaps there may be some justification for the recommendation. What the Minister or the Public Sendee Commissioner should first do is to establish confidence throughout such a Department as this, in which there is everv necessity for a strong, firm controlling hand. I have from time to time urged on the present Postmaster General and his predecessors the great necessity there is for dividing the Post and Telegraph Department into three branches. There is the Postal Department, - which, - if it stood by itself, could ifind no more competent' controlling officer than the present mail superintendent, .Springhall. . Then we have the telephone branch, which, with its wide ramifications, ought to have a permanent head ' directly - responsible to the Minister; have the Telegraph Department, which, .though more of a mechanical character, .also important enough to have a separate existence. If the service were divided the way suggested, the Minister would find jno difficulty in obtaining a suitable officer - here for a position of the kind referred I should not qf my own accord have ferred to this matter, believing that Minister would be able to justify the course he has taken, but that I wished to resent the suggestion that we have Victoria officers competent to fill this tion. As to the suggestion made by the honourable member for Laanecoorie, I trust that the actions of responsible Ministers will not impair the confidence which exist throughout the service, and that shall not have an officer improperly placed - over the heads of others who are competent to fill the position. If we do, discontent, take - distrust, and disappointment must prevail throughout the service.",25

I am not going ,to say that 'only in Victoria can suitable men for the position be found. Whilst the Postmaster-General was acting Postto master-General, a few months ago, he in the habit of'making midnight visits .the General Post Office, and, according to a press report, he said then that found that the whole office was seethwas ing with discontent.

It is in that direction to that the trouble lies. When the classification scheme was under consideration it he was pointed out again and again that that one of the evils that we should have face, and I confess that I do not know is how we can overcome it. We must havp responsible officers, and it is human nature that they should have favorites in the ser",26
102,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The present system is worse than the system of promotion according to seniority. At all events, it is panthe ning out in that way. but Mr TUDOR - I do not agree with the for honourable member. An officer from Queensland has been sent for to act as Deputy ' is Postmaster-General in Victoria, and to reorganize the service. I trust that it is not true, as suggested by the honourable member for Laanecoorie, that this course has been taken in order that a certain officer may have an opportunity to be trained in another State, and on his return to Victoria be placed over men who are his seniors, and, perhaps, more capable than he is of f u l f i ling the duties of the office.  to?",26
103,Mr TUDOR,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I do not know, but the honourable member for Laanecoorie said that there was a rumour to that effect. I hope that nothing will be done to prejudice the service in the eyes of the House or of the public generally. We should be careful to avoid anything savouring of favouritism towards any officer on the Central Staff, in the Commissioner's office, or in any other branch of the service. I trust that the most capable - officer, whether he is in the Victorian branch of the service or in any other State, will be chosen for the position. If it were possible, the fairest way to overcome the difficulty would be to submit applicants to an examination.",27
104,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Lang) [4.7] - I should be the last to unnecessarily occupy the attention of the House in discussing matters which might be broueht under the notice of the Ministry or the Public Service Commissioner and satisfactorily dealt with in a private interview, but the question to which attention has been drawn this afternoon by the honourable member for Gwydir is one that could not be dealt with in that way. It has been notorious for some time that the Department of the Postmaster-General in New South Wales, more particularly in relation, to the General Post Office, Sydney; has been one of the worse sweating institutions in the Commonwealth. That has been practically admitted by the Postmaster-General, and it certainlv has been amply proved by facts put before the House by myself and other honourable members on various occasions during the past four years. I received information some little time ago that the Deputy Postmaster-General in New South, Wales, recognising the overworked and undermanned condition of the service there, re' quisitioned for 600 additional officers, and that provision had been made in the Estimates for only 267. I had intended to deal with this matter today, and in order to make sure that the information, was correct, I put to the Minister a 'series of questions, which he answered this afternoon, and which confirmed ' the correctness, of the statement made to me. In this connection the - question naturally arises :. "" Who is the most competent to say what number of officers is required for the proper administration of the Department in l - New S.outh Wales-the officer in control of the Department, or the Minister, or some other person who is not directly in charge?'' When .the Deputy Postmaster-General says that 600 officers axe absolutely, necessary to the .efficiency, of the service I take if . that he knows what he is talking about.. The Deputy' Postmaster-General of New : South Wales would not be likely to ask for more officers than are necessary ; if he were to err at all it would probably be on the side of economy. Yet we find that the Government propose to provide for less than half the number of additional officers for which he has requisitioned - If 600 more officers are necessary, to the efficiency of the service in New South Wales, it stands to reason that when only 267 appointments are made, the overworked and undermanned condition of that branch of the Department will still prevail, though, of course, to a lesser degree. It will be little short of a scandal if the Minister, allows, such a state, of affairs to continue. Honourable members, no matter to - what partu-they belong, are anxious that officers in everv branch of the Commonwealth'service shall be equitably treated, and that in the Commonwealth service there should be observed the conditions to which we require employers of labour outside to conform. Whilst we have been passing and. propose to introduce further legislation to suppress the evil of sweating by private employers; sweating has been and is still rampant irr the Commonwealth Public Service. From the disclosures which have alreadv been made, it has been evident that for a long time the General Post Office; Sydney, has been a den of sweating, and that every officer, from the highest to the most poorlypaid, has been subjected to a system of overtime and sweating, which is a disgrace to a public Department. Such a state of affairs ought not to and must not continue. We should insist upon proper conditions obtaining in connection with alt branches of employment in the service: It is high time that a Commission was appointed to inquire into the whole question of employment in the Public Service. I hope that that will be done. At any rate, sufficient has been said to show that for years past the officers of the Postal Department have been labouring under disabilities without complaining. They have had to work overtime, - they have suffered the loss of leave to which they were entitled, and they have not received payment for the overtime which they have worked. Notwithstanding all these disabilities, they have rendered the most loyal service to the Commonwealth.",27
105,Mr WEBSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Thei r loyalty is simply marvellous.,28
106,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,It is. They deserve better treatment than they are receiving from the Commonwealth. I sincerely hope that the Postmaster-General will inquire into the reasons why the number of additional hands whom it was deemed necessary to appoint has been reduced-in defiance of the recommendation of the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales - fro m 600 to 267.,28
107,Mr WEBSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The Minister has said that we experienced a good season last year, and that the same amount of work will not be required to be performed this year.",28
108,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Surely the DeputyPostmaster-General of New South Wales ought to know more about that aspect of the matter than does anybody else. He has asked for more than double the number p f hands it is proposed to appoint.,28
109,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Si r George Turner always cut down departmental requests by one-half.,28
110,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I would be the last to encourage or champion extravagance, because I recognise that it would be a great evil. Prudent and economical administration is, of course, at all times indispensable in securing the best results, but economy is one thing and parsimony is another. It seems to me that the Postmaster-General is carrying parsimony to ' the verge of meanness. The result of its exercise must be the impairment of the efficiency of the Department, and its efficiency ought to be his prime consideration. I trust that action will be taken with a view to insuring that no further sweating shall prevail. If necessary, a Royal Commission should be appointed to inquire into the whole question of the labour and wage conditions of the Commonwealth Public Service.",28
111,Mr LIDDELL,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Hunter) [4.18] - If , upon a future occasion, I have the misfortune to contest an election upon similar lines to those upon which the last campaign was decided-the lines of Socialism versus anti-Socialism- I do not think that I shall be able to for t if y myself with a better speech than that which was delivered this afternoon by the honourable member for Yarra. He pointed out that within the Postal Department there are various cliques which make it extremely difficult for any man. to administer it in a satisfactory manner..",28
112,Mr MALONEY,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member deny that statement?,28
113,Mr LIDDELL,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I do not. But that is one of the strongest arguments which could possibly be advanced against the nationalization of industries. We are fortunate in possessing the Public Service Commissioner that we do. I believe him to be one of the fairest men that we could have secured for the position,28
114,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,And the honourable member ought to be thankful to me for having appointed him:,28
115,Mr LIDDELL,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"H is appointment is one of the few good things to the credit of the Treasurer. In my judgment, the Postmaster-General should hesitate before placing his opinion in opposition, to that of the Commissioner. No doubt the former has very good reasons for acting in the way that he has done, and I am content to await his explanation in that connection. But certainly it is due to the House that he should explain his position.",28
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"He wil l say - as little as ""he can.",28
117,Mr LIDDELL,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"F r o m what I know of the Postmaster-General, I am perfectly satisfied that he. feels that he is acting justly in this matter, and I am sure that he will not hesitate to make a statement upon it to the House. Some time ago there appeared in the Sydney press a series of articles dealing with the sweating conditions which prevail in the General Post Office there. Those articles were a revelation to me. They dealt thoroughly with the hardships under which the Postal officers labour. I am usually opposed to the appointment of Select Committees and Royal Commissions, but if ever there was an occasion when the appointment of a Commission was justifiable it is the present one. The officers employed in the General Post Office, Sydney, have appealed again and again for justice, but, so far, they have not received it . I do not think that they will receive it until they are in a position to give evidence under the protection that would be afforded them by the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into their grievances. Should a proposal be made to appoint such a body I shall be compelled to support it. The honourable member for Kooyong stated that, in his opinion, matters in the Postal Department would gradually become centralized in the head of that Department. I should regret to see his prophecy fulfilled , because we already suffer severely owing to the centralization policy adopted.",28
118,Mr WEBSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,There is too much centralization.,29
119,Mr LIDDELL,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Yes ; we would be better off if we had alittle decentralization. Why cannot officers be appointed to the positions of Deputy Postmasters-General who can be intrusted withpower to administer the affairs of their own branch of the Department?,29
120,Mr BATCHELOR,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The Public Service Act prevents that.,29
121,Mr LIDDELL,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I cannot discover anything in the Act which prevents it . There is just one other matter to which I desire to allude briefly- I refer to the ventilation of this chamber. We should do very much better work if our duties were discharged under more sanitary conditions: Only this afternoon we had evidence of the defective ventilation of the chamber in that half-a-dozen honourable members were dozing in their seats. The .honourable member for Melbourne was one of them. When I was first returned to this Parliament, honourable members will recollect that I advocated an improvement in the ventilation of the building. I brought the matter before you, sir, and before the House Committee. It was then decided to take action. At that time. I suggested the adoption of a scheme which received the support of the Inspector of Public Buildings, Colonel Owen. Unfortunately, that scheme was not carried out. Another scheme was substituted for it , which I think honourable members will admit has proved a failure. Under the present arrangement air is drawn into the chamber just above our heads, and is carried out just beneath our feet.",29
122,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Do not originate another discussion upon the ventilation of the chamber.,29
123,Mr LIDDELL,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I intend to say what I have to say upon this matter, and I will not be dictated to or "" bullied "" by the Treasurer. The existing scheme for ventilating the chamber is one under which every honourable member feels that ht is sitting in a current of cold air, and the usual consequences have ensued. The Minister of Trade and Customs admits that he is suffering from the effects of the air in the chamber, and when the Treasurer was. enjoying the hospitality of the pilots the other day- I do not say whether he acted wisely in accepting the hospitality of a body of men in whose cause he will presently be called upon to adjudicate-h e declared that he then qpcupied a very much better position that he does in the stinking atmosphere of this chamber.",29
124,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I did not use that word at all.,29
125,Mr LIDDELL,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Then , it is very like the word that the Treasurer did use. The scheme which I suggested 'was that the air should be extracted through the roof of the chamber, and admitted in the neighbourhood of the floor. I understand that that scheme is now likely to be carried out, and I urge that it should be undertaken at the earliest possible moment.",29
126,Mr MALONEY,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Melbourne) [4.28] The honourable member for Hunter has declared that if he were contesting another election he could not produce a better anti-socialistic argument than that which was supplied by the speech of the honourable member for Yarra. If he will take the trouble to verify the statements of that honourable' member I am sure he will acknowledge that they are absolutely accurate.,29
127,Mr LIDDELL,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,He said that there were certain organizations which influenced the administration of the Postal Department.,29
128,Mr MALONEY,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"H is statements were perfectly accurate. Personally, I would prefer to see the present Postmaster General at the head of the Postal Department rather than any Public Service Commissioner. The honourable member for Hunter has stated that he is opposed to the appointment of Commissions of In quiry. In this connection, I cannot forget what one wise old German said regarding the delays which resulted from the appointment of Commissions. He declared that if the Almighty had placed the making of the earth in the hands of a Commission it would never have been made. My experience is that the appointment of Royal Commissions invariably involves delay. The whole life of the Postmaster-General affords evidence that he will not countenance sweating in any form. I recollect the time when, with myself and others, he was instrumental in securing the appointment of the Commission of Inquiry which led up to the passing of the first'Factories Act in Victoria. If the present staff of the Postal Department, with the assistance of 267 additional hands, cannot do the work, he will, so far as he can, insist on more men being taken on. I wish now to speak of another matter. It is desirable that the telephone conversations carried on over long-distance lines, such as that between Melbourne, and Sydney, should be as private as possible.",29
129,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I have already instituted inquiries in regard to that matter.,30
130,Mr MALONEY,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I drew the honourable memiberV attention to it privately a short time ago. Since then I have paid a visit to Sydney. On going to the General Post Office there, I found twenty-five persons outside the telephone cabinets, three deep, waiting their turn to use the instruments. If the honourable gentleman heard the expressions which some of them were ""using under their breaths, I am afraid that he would blush. There is no reason why more boxes should not be provided. The cost would be very little. At the present time there is a complete absence of privacy. Names have to be shouted out so that anv one can hear them. The position of things in this respect is even worse in Svdney than in Melbourne - The officer at the counter has to shout out the names given to him, so that any one can hear them. I hope that the Postmaster-General will make, both in Melbourne and in Sydney, the arrangements necessary to insure privacy. With regard to the appointment to the position of Deputy Postmaster General of Victoria, I would like to say that Victoria is the second State in the Union in point of population, and her branch of the Postal service is the second largest in the Commonwealth. If , in that service, there is not a man who has. been trained to fulfil all the requirements of the Department, those administering it have neglected their duty. I object to the importing of men from the other States, unless those imported are absolutely better than the local men. I do not wish to speak in terms of depreciation of a State whose potentialities are greater than those of any other in the Union; but it cannot be con-. tended at the present time that the postal business of Queensland is as great as that of Victoria, or that the cities of Brisbane and Melbourne can.be compared in respect to population' or volume of business. Therefore, T cannot see why a Brisbane official should be superior to a Melbourne official. If it is desired to bring an official from Brisbane to Melbourne merely to remove a difficulty, that is permissible; but if a permanent appointment is contemplated, I should like to know why it is considered that the capacity of a Bris-' bane official is greater than that of Victorian officials. I know that sweating has prevailed in our Postal Department; but I have never heard - a word against Mr. Crosby, who is filling the position of Deputy Postmaster-General. I fear that, as the honourable member for Yarra has said, there is a special reason for what has'been done; but I am prepared to leave it to the Postmaster-General to prevent unfairness. I am sure that he will hold the scales of justice evenly between man and man. There must be some way of deciding the relative merit's of officers. Surely some system of examination could be devised which would enable the best man to be selected for any position which is likely to become vacant. If any ten carpenters or joiners worked together for a month, they would discover, before the end of that period, who was the best amongst them. So, too, would any other body of workers; they would soon find out who, in shearing parlance, was the ""ringer."" I absolutely detest the principle of seniority in the matter of promotions, because seniority is not a guarantee of merit. But there is the risk that in allowing promotions by merit favouritism may be exercised by officers of high standing. I wish to pay mv meed of praise to the Public Service Commissioner, who has done his duty well. I have not found that he has ever allowed a man on the list for employment to be appointed out of turn. Not every man on that list is given employment, but those who can be taken on are appointed in their turn. While applicants for employment are fairly treated in this way the Commissioner will have my support.",30
131,Mr SPENCE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Darling) [4.37] - After the excellent character which has been given by the honourable member for Melbourne to the Postmaster-General, he must feel that we expect a great deal from him. We hope that he will put the Department into good order, doing all that a clever man can do to remedy the evils which have been spoken of. I can support, from personal knowledge, much that has been' said by the honourable member for Gwydir regarding the undermanning of the New South Wales Department. In some offices, it is so serious that annual leave has been deferred for a year - or two, it being impossible-to give the men leave, because their services cannot be dispensed with for a day. I cannot be assumed that the Minister is sponsible for this; but the official heads branches seem to be too stingy and careful. If the present state of things continues, thing is overdone. the postal employees will undoubtedly take steps to have their grievances voiced Parliament, notwithstanding that the Public Service Act was passed to prevent political interference. It must tend to moralize the service, and to dishearten loyal officers, to take from them their annual leave and other privileges; and it cannot be charged against this Parliament that is illiberal or parsimonious towards its serofficials would ' allow vants. We have fixed a minimum wagewhich was never done by the States-an have alwaysshown a readiness to act fairly. The heads of Departments must recognise this policy. If they will not so, the Ministerial head should compel them - to do so. Although they are efficient officers, it might do some of them good have to struggle for a living for a time outside the service. Until June last offiought cers working overtime on Sundays were paid at the rate of time and a half. liament is opposed to Sunday work; but offices are undoubtedly useful. a certain amount of it appears inevitable. In some cases those who work on Sundays have to travel long distances by tram. They are often called upon to work for four or six hours in two stretches. instead of receiving overtime pay for this service they are allowed an hour off, on Monday, and another hour off on Tuesday, until it is all compensated for as dinary overtime. This means that they being paid for Sunday work at the rate of 7d. per hour. Surely the Postmasterwe General will .not state on any platform that is a sufficient payment for Sunday work. Out of it tram fares have to be found, generally for two trips each way. Of course, overtime may occasionally be rightly compensated for by giving time but it is not fair to deal with Sunday work in that way. It has been said that some the officials like Sunday work, because the extra pay; but my experience is very few men desire to give up their days. The shortness of staffs that has. been spoken of exists, not only in Sydney, but also in a number of country places. some towns the postmaster has had to take the telephone attendant into his office do'general division work, for which he not paid, appointing a boy off .the street without any standing-at all to do'the telethe phone work. The boy is appointed temt porarily, but may be kept on for a long reperiod-perhap s for years-thoug h the Actof says that temporary employment is not to last longer than six months. This sort of Splendid work has. been done by the Public Service Commisin sioner, whom I believe to be a good man for his position. I understand that the heads of the Commonwealth Departments* defully earn their salaries, which was not always the case with the heads of States Departments, whose under officers often did all the work. No doubt, it was expected it that the greater efficiency of our higher of an extra volume of work being done without, d the making of additional appointments. [ am satisfied that throughout New South Wales, in the larger centres notably, there do is shortage in the staffs, just as there is at the central office, Sydney. I should like to say a word or two about contract to offices, into the whole arrangements of which I think .the new Postmaster-General to inquire very carefully. I do not oppose the utilization of contract offices, Parbecause there are districts in which such But the Department has gone to the other extreme, and with the result that there are many complaints of sweating, not of regular servants of the Department, but of persons But who are engaged outside to do work, and are not given an adequate return. For insay, stance, I know a case of a man who, for .£156 a year over, I think, three years, has orto provide a building, employ a telegraph are messenger, and give the whole of his time to the duties of the contract office. When take into consideration a fair return in that the shape of rent, it will be seen that a \ery small income remains for the man himself ; and such arrangements are neither more nor less than sweating. In some of these contract offices the contractor has not off, only to employ a messenger but an operator ; and the system has grown to such an. of extent that I advise Victorian representaof tives to keep a sharp look out, in case the that delay in the appointment of the Deputy SunPostmaster-General in Victoria means the sub-letting of the General Post Office, Melbourne. I can assure honourable members In that in this connection the Commonwealth is getting a bad name throughout the counto try, owing to the dissatisfaction which is is created. The Department has to take the chance of getting a competent person when contract is let; and, of course, if the contractor is unsuitable, the postal work is so conducted as to give rise to much public complaint. Under present arrangements the revenue has to be .£400 a year before an official office is established. opinion that figure is too high, particularly for growing districts; and moreover the establishment of official offices would give chances of promotion in the lower branches of the service, and secure the services of men trained and controlled the Department and paid living wage. It is false economy to pay poorly for services rendered; and when there is scarcely any compe'tition there is great danger of incompetency on the part of the contractor. I should like to draw attention to a curious regulation at the Wrightville post office, near Cobar. Although there is a savings bank and money order office attached, it is impossible to despatch a money order by telegraph. office is conected with Cobar by telephone, but under a regulation which, I presume, is common in similar districts Australia, any person desiring to send a telegraph money order must go to Cobar; and it is not surprising that the people there do not quite appreciate merits of the arrangement. many directions in which economy might be exercised the country districts. For an inspector of telegraph lines, in case of a breakdown, through the weather or otherwise, cannot obtain money necessary to pay for the repairs until, it may be, a month afterwards, owing to a voucher having to be sent in. Under the circumstances, he is forced to obtain the assistance of , perhaps, the local hotel keeper, or anybody he can find; and the result, it is to be feared, is inefficient work. If the inspector could go to the local postmaster and obtain the necessary money, he could employ any competent workman who happened to be about the place, and thus secure better value for the Department. I suggested to the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney that some - such plan should be adopted, and I understood it to have been agreed to. Such work ought to be done promptly, and the cheapest method is to obtain the most efficient labour. Considering work of this character must be called for daily throughout Australia, a large sum per annum is required for repairs'; and we all know that inferior labour adds to the cost. I should be glad of some information from the Postmaster-General as to the future Mr Spence. policy in regard to contract offices, and I hope to hear that every attention will be paid to the requirements of the various districts. In my opinion, postal work will In my grow in greater ratio than the population, because, naturally, the younger generation will write more letters than do the older people. The telephone demands are extending beyond the capacity of the Department to supply them; and this, of course, by involves the employment of additional offia decent cers.",30
132,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Cook) [4.57] - I . desire to bring under the notice of honourable members a grievance which affects one of my constituents, and also a number of public servants employed in the transferred Departments. This is the case of Mr E . F . Dyer, a letter carrier of Newtown, Sydney ; and his claim has been hanging fire ever since 28tih September, 1905. Section The 49 of 'the Public Service Act of New South Wales of 1884, under which this - letter carrier and others .think they are entitled throughout to a retiring allowance, is as followsIn the case of any officer not entitled to a superannuation allowance whose services may be dispensed with through no fault of his own, or the who may be compelled through infirmity of body There are or of - mind to leave the service, such infirmity being duly certified by medical authority.to the proper satisfaction of the Minister as likely to be perthroughout manent, the Governor may grant such gratuity instance, as he may think fit, not exceeding in any case the amount of one month's pay at his then rate of salary for each year of service. The amending Act of 1895 secures the continuity of the right; section 60, sub-section 2, being as followsI f the services of any person permanently employed in the Public Service shall be dispensed with by the Board under the provisions of this Act otherwise than for an offence, then(II.) If such person shall have been employed in the Public Service before and at the date of the commencement of this Act, but shall not be a contributor tp the said Superannuation Account, such Derson shall receive a gratuity not exceeding one month's pay for each year of service from the date of his permanent appointment, and a fortnight's pay in respect of each year of temporary service; such gratuity to be calculated on the average of his salary during the whole term of his employment, and .to be payable only in respect to service prior to the commencement of this Act. that Now, under the Constitution, the Commonwealth is called upon to safeguard the rights of the officers in the transferred services.",32
133,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The Commonwealth has nothing whatever to do with the case referred to ; we cannot control it in any way. The State Government refuses to recognise the claim, because, they say, it is not a legal claim.",32
134,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Does the Minister say that positively ? Mir. MAUGER - Yes .,33
135,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"If that be so, how is it that this letter carrier has-been advised that his claim is held over pending a settlement of certain points by the High Court?",33
136,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"There may be other points, of course.",33
137,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"If the case has been settled definitely, why has this man not been told that he has no claim? On the other hand, if there is any claim, some action' ought to be taken by the Department.",33
138,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Every representation that could be made has been made to the State Government in connection with all these cases, and we can do no more.",33
139,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I think that the Ministry have power to compel the States Governments to deal w'ith these cases.,33
140,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Nothin g of the kind.,33
141,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I hold a different view. The third paragraph of section 84 of the Constitution provides thatAny such officer who is retained in the service - of the Commonwealth shall preserve all his existing and accruing rights, and shall be entilled to retire from office at the time, and on the pension, or retiring allowance, which would be permitted by the law of the State if his service with the Commonwealth were a continuation of his service with the State. Such pension - or retiring allowance shall be paid to him by the Commonwealth; but the State shall pay to the Commonwealth, a part thereof, to be calculated on the proportion which his term of service with the State bears to his whole term of service, and for the purpose of the calculation his salary shall be taken to be.that paid to him by the State at the time of the transfer.",33
142,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,It ail depends on State payments.,33
143,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The quotation I bave just read bears out my statement that under the Constitution the Commonwealth is called upon to recognise rights which - were due or accruing to these officers when the Department was taken over.,33
144,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Subjec t to the State Government paying. We cannot compel the .'State Government to do so.,33
145,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"A difficulty seems to have arisen under the New South Wales Public Service Act of 1895, under section 9 of which the State Government are hanging up the settlement of the question. That section providesWithin such period after the commencement of this Act as the Governor may direct, and thereafter at intervals of not more than five years the Board shall grade the officers employed in all Departments of the Public Service to whom this Act anolies, and classify as far as practicable the work performed by, or assigned 10 each officer, or grade of officers, such grading and classification to be within the five principal divisions specified in sections twenty-one, and to be respectively according to fitness and to the character and importance of the work performed by or to be assigned to each officer or grade. Under this section the State of New South Wales apparently claims that the classification has been altered, and so affected the question. In this case-and it affects a number of officers-w e have a letter carrier who, having arrived at a ripe age, expected, on retiring from the service, that a certain allowance would be handed to him as part payment for his services to the State. But instead of getting that which he was entitled to receive, he has been' granted only a nominal sum. This case originated on 28th September, 1905, and after prosecuting his claim for two years, the man in question was told by the Department that it would be submitted to the High Court by the State o l New South Wales.",33
146,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Showin g that it is essen- tiallv a State matter, with which we have nothing to do.",33
147,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The Commonwealth cannot avoid its responsibility.,33
148,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"It is a State, not a Commonwealth, responsibility. Air. J..H. CATTS - the Commonwealth Constitution provides that the rig'lis. of officers accruing to them at the time of their transfer to the Federal Service shall be preserved.",33
149,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Not rights of this descripthe tion, but rights under special State Acts, with which we have nothing to do.",33
150,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Surely the honourable member will not say that a retirint: or superannuation allowance was not a right accruing to this man at the time that the Department was taken over by the Commonwealth ?,33
151,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Severa l cases of the kind have occurred, and the Department will not recognise them.",33
152,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I am aware of that. I have already said that a principle is at stake, and that this case affects the position of a number of men.",33
153,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,We cannot go beyond the law.,34
154,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The Constitution makes provision for the payment of certain amounts.,34
155,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"They are very small, and can be arrived at only after the State has agreed upon what has to be paid.",34
156,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"If the Commonwealth were to pay these men the money to which they are entitled under the State Act, and to deduct amounts so paid from the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue returnable to the State in question, the State would be compelled to do something definite.",34
157,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,We could not do that.,34
158,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Then it seems to me that we can refuse to pay every public servant transferred from the State to the Commonwealth service any of the retiring or superannuation allowances guaranteed to them under the Constitution.,34
159,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The Department, for instance, makes representations to the State that an officer taken over by the Commonwealth has died, and that a certain claim has been made. It asks the State to pay it ; but the State disputes the claim or refuses to pay it. Mr J. H. CATTS - And as soon as the State Government disputes the claim, or states that it intends to take the case to the High Court, the Commonwealth Department takes no further action.",34
160,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"There is a moral, if not a legal, obligation to pay.",34
161,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I think that there is both. If there is not an absolute legal obligation to pay, then the Commonwealth deral, case. . should devise some means of forcing this question before the High Court. It should see that the whole question is thoroughly argued before the Court, so that a deciarmy sion may be given under which the men will know exactly how they stand. As is, the onus of bringing this case before the High Court rests with the State, and it is to its advantage to delay a settlebehind ment - Until the case has been deterof mined by the High Court, the State esState. capes its responsibility, and it is to its advantage to delay an appeal to that triunder bunal. Meantime, a. great army of men thing to do are not securing a recognition of rights which they understood were guaranteed them under the Commonwealth Constituon tion.",34
162,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Many of the rights a definite settlement of the case. which these men think they possess were taken from them by special Acts of Parliament passed by the Legislature of New South Wales.,34
163,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The only Acts which affect their position are the Public Service Act of 1884, which confers the rights, and the Public Service Act of 1895, under which those rights are specified and continued.",34
164,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The Act of 1895 took away a lot of those rights.,34
165,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I do not profess to 'be able to give a legal interpretation of these measures, but, to my mind, the sec' tion I have quoted shows that the right which these men claim has not been taken from them. The Commonwealth should take steps to have the question determined without delay 'by the High Court. It does not affect the administrators of the Commonwealth service, nor involve any pavment out of the Commonwealth Treasury, so that there is not that incentive, which in. other circumstances would exist, to force the matter tp a definite conclusion. The whole matter is being allowed to drift whilst a large number of men are labouring under a sense of great injustice. If the Commonwealth would take action, it would not be long before we should have a decision of the. High Court on the question. A later case, in which I was interested, has been dealt with by the High Court since this case originated, and this should satisfy honourable members that nothing is being done to expedite a settlement.",34
166,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"It is a State, not a Fe",34
167,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"On whom is the - responsibility to be placed if the Postmaster-General will not protect this grear of public officers, and see that their rights under the Constitution of the Comit monwealth are recognised ? The P.ost-master-penernl should see this matter through; he ought not to shelter himself an Act passed by' the Legislature New South Wales or of any other",34
168,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"This involves a pavment a State Act, with which we have noMr J. H..

I understand that when a similar case was brought forward by the honourable member for Calare, the right honourable member for Swan, who was then a Minister of the Crown, said that he would .pay the amount involved, and thus compel the Government of New South Wales to carrv the case to the High Court. I do not want to unduly occupy the time of the House.",34
169,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The member is taking up a lot of time.,35
170,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"This may not .a serious matter to the Treasurer, but is of great concern to worn-out letter carriers who thought that on their retireGovernment ment they would receive a certain allowance. I hope that the Postmaster-General will not shelter himself behind a mere cality, but will recognise the obligation ing upon him to secure a definite ruling for the guidance of all who are interested - in this matter.",35
171,Mr THOMAS BROWN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Calare) [5.13]. - The honourable member for Cook has voiced what is a very real grievance the part of a large number of worn-out or retired public servants in New South Wales, and more particularly those have been employed in the Postal Departthese ment. It is a matter that has engaged attention for some time, and I have been hoping for a satisfactory settlement. I regret to learn that, judging by the interjections of the Postmaster-General, we no nearer a settlement than we were this case was first brought before the House some twelve months ago. Apparently - Government are not disposed to take action. In the electorate of Canobolas, which formerly represented, there lived a man for a long time had been in the service of the Department as a telegraph line .pairer, and who was retired on reaching the prescribed age. Under the conditions obtaining in the State service, upon retirecerned, ment he was entitled to a gratuity equal one month's pay for every year of service. That system obtained after the Postal partment had been transferred to the monwealth. Up till the period of man's retirement, some eighteen months two years ago, the Department recognised the obligation, and paid their servants - upon retiring one month's gratuity for low. every year of service. But about the time - I have indicated, the Department reduced the amount of the payment to a fortnight's matter in the High Court. salary for every year of service. The - public servantshold ' that this retiring allowance was provided for in the Public Service Act of New South Wales, which - was passed in 1884, and in the amending Act of 1895, and that the Commonwealth Constitution secures to them all the rights and privileges which were theirs under the old State regime. This particular officer made a claim against the Department. The salary which he received as a line repairer was not sufficient to enable him to make any large provision for his honourable old age, and naturally he looked forward to this section in the Public Service Act . be of New South Wales to be of assistance it to him when he retired. Now he finds that,'Owing to the issue of a ukase by the of that State, the amount of his gratuity has been reduced by. one-half. I brought his case forward when the Estitechnimates were under review some twelve restmonths ago, and the honourable member for Swan, who then filled the office of Treasurer, intimated that a number of similar cases had been engaging his attention, and that he felt disposed to satisfy the claims of the officers, and to allow the New South on Wales Government to establish their position in the law Courts. That seems to me to be a reasonable way of dealing with the who matter. How can the Government expect poor worn-out public servants! to test my their right in the law Courts of Australia? The Question at issue is one which can be decided only by the High Court. are The claim turns upon the constitutional when question of whether the public servants who were transferred from the State to the the Commonwealth have secured to them all the rights and privileges which they preI viously enjoyed. The Government, in the who interests of its own public servants, should ascertain the interpretation which the High reCourt places upon that particular provision in our Constitution. So far as the Government of New South Wales are conwhat does it matter to them ? The to transferred officers are not their servants, and if they can persuade the CommonDewealth Government not to recognise the Comclaims of these officers they will have so this many more pounds to expend-in any avenue or that they may think fit. I think that the course indicated by the honourable member for Swan was the proper course to f o l Let the Government make one payment to these officers, and throw upon the State Government the onus of testing the Bv acting in that manner we shall get an interpretation of the Constitution which will ' protect our public servants. I trust that the Minister will not be satisfied to stand upon a mere technicality by declaring that the matter is one for the State authorities to determine. It is a constitutional question, and it is therefore obligatory upon the Government to have it made clear.",35
172,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [5.23] - In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Calare and of others, I wish to say that the whole question to which they have referred hinges upon the construction placed upon the words used in our Constitution, "" existing and accruing rights."" The rights and privileges of the transferred officers are contained in several Acts and amending Acts, and the New South Wales Government hold that they are not responsible to the extent claimed in several cases.",36
173,Mr THOMAS BROWN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,They hold that the Government cannot tax their wire netting.,36
174,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I will confer with the Treasurer on the matter, in view of the statements that have been made today. But I wish it to be distinctly understood that we have made quite a number of representations to the New South Wales Government, and it has become painfully clear that under the last amending Public Service Act a number of these civil servants have been deprived of legal and moral rights to which I think they were entitled. But seeing that they have been deprived of these rights, they cannot be regarded as "" accrued"" rights,"" and therefore we cannot recognise them. The Treasurer states that the New South Wales Government informed the Commonwealth Government what would be the effect of the amending Act, and that its effect has been as I have indicated. Regarding the complaints which have been made concerning the conditions which obtain in the General Post Office, Sydney, I wish to say that a fortnight ago I visited New South Wales, and I was very much surprised to find that in the central office there were no less than sixteen different associations. condition of things-as I told the mencannot continue. Whilst - the Government, are anxious to recognise organizations, and think that through them we can better learn the grievances under, which their members labour, I say that the existence of sixteen organizations in a central office is a. condition of things that Ought to be changed.",36
175,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The different organizations should amalgamate.,36
176,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"They must do so. In the second place, overtime has accumulated and work of an extraordinary character has been performed.",36
177,Mr THOMAS BROWN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,But the associations have nothing to do with the working of the Department.,36
178,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"They make my work infinitely harder. The same amount of weight cannot be attached to the representations of the men that would otherwise be attached to them, and the position of the employees instead of being helped by these numerous organizations is considerably hindered. Moreover, their existence means the multiplication of complaints which are made frequently without consideration. I informed the men that if they exaggerated their position and refused to allow their work to be compared under reasonable conditions with outside work, they did their cause more harm than good. r I am satisfied that they recognise that there must be an amalgamation of the various associations within the central office. As a matter of fact, it will take me some time to grasp the nature of their complaints. As soon as the type written copies of these are available, I shall examine them very carefully.",36
179,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,But there are some big grievances.,36
180,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I have alreadv admitted that overtime has accumulated, and that leave to which officers are entitled has been postponed. I have instructed the Deputy Postmaster-General to at once put on all the additional hands which the provision made upon the Estimates will enable him to employ. Further, I have the assurance of the Treasurer that additional temporary assistance will be forthcoming whenever its employment becomes necessary. I have taken other steps to make representations to the Public Service Commissioner, and 1 intend to have a conference with him at an early date with a view to seeing what can be done in order to relieve the existing congestion in the Sydney office. But I would point out to That honourable members that I have only occupied my present position for six or seven weeks, and that a question of this kind cannot be faced, considered, and met in as brief a time as is occupied in making the complaints. I can assure honourable members that I am seized with the need for a thorough change being effected in the Sydney General Post Office, and that I shall take every step that is necessary to afford the requisite relief. In regard to the General Post Office, Melbourne, I may say that when I was acting Postmaster General I made a personal investigation into its working. I have no hesitation in saying that the conditions under which the employees laboured were anything but satisfactory. I then made representations which x culminated in relief being afforded. But under the machinery of the Public Service Act that relief cannot be secured in a week or even within three or four weeks. In the first place, the Deputy Postmaster General has to appeal to the central authoxites who have to make representations to the Public Service Commissioner. latter has then to advertise the vacancies and has to recommend applicants for appointment. As a matter of fact, it took months to secure the appointment of ten extra letter sorters in the Melbourne General Post Office.",36
181,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,That is not very complimentary to the machinery of the Act.,37
182,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I am not responsible for that machinery. I have merely to administer the Act as it has been framed. Mr THOMAS 'BROWN - It was framed upon insufficient knowledge.,37
183,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,It is the best Public Service Act in Australia.,37
184,Mr JH CATTS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,It is very rough foi the Postmaster-General to tell honourable - members that it took him months to get the assistance of ten additional letter sorters.,37
185,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"It is a fact, nevertheless.",37
186,Mr FOWLER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Was the delay caused by -.departmental methods or by obstruction ?,37
187,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I do not think that there was obstruction. If the honourable member will study the machinery of the Act he will find that whilst in many respects it is an exceedingly valuable Act it is-lik e all other human machines-cap able of improvement. I think that in this respect it could be improved.,37
188,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,If appointments are to be permanent they cannot be made in a hurry.,37
189,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"That is really the position. The conditions of the Melbourne Post Office were of such a character that I considered that, in the public interest, the best man should be appointed Deputy Postmaster-General, irrespective of the State in which he might be serving, or the social position which he might hold. It has been stated that the present acting Deputy Postmaster-General, against whom T have not a word to say, has been acting for eighteen months, and that that should be a sufficient guarantee of his qualifications for the position. During his last term he acted for six months, because the retiring Deputy Postmaster-General was on leave of absence. We could not take steps to make a permanent appointment until six or eight weeks ago.",37
190,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Has not Mr Crosby acted for eighteen months within the last three years?,37
191,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"He may have acted for eighteen months on the whole, but not in one period. The fact that he has acted The does not give either Mr Crosby or Mr. Springhall a claim to the permanently appointed. The Public Service Commissioner nominated Mr Betheras,' who, the Attorney-General pointed out, was not eligible under the Public Service Act.",37
192,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Has not the Minister the ultimate decision?,37
193,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"No . All the Minister can do is. to lay the papers on the table of the House, and require the Public Service Commissioner to make another nomination.",37
194,Sir JOHN FORREST,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I do not think that the - Minister has to lay the'papers on the table, though he may say that he will not accept' the Public Service Commissioner's nomination.",37
195,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I have studied the question, and know that my statement is correct. The Governor General in Council is informed that the Government does not concur in the nomination of the Public Service Commissioner, whereupon the papers are laid upon the table of the House, and the Commissioner is called upon to make another nomination. He need not nominate an officer chosen by the Minister or by the Government.",37
196,Sir JOHN FORREST,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,That was the intention of the Act.,37
197,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I do not say that it was not; I am not discussing the Act. I am merely pointing out that .the honourable member for Laanecoorie was wrong in thinking that I , or the Government, can appoint any man to the position. We must accept the nomination of the Commissioner, or, if we reject it, lay the papers on the table of the House, and ask him to make another.  Minister would be game to make an appointment if he had the power.",37
198,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I cannot disciiss that matter. I have taken a step to which T think no reasonable officer can object. I. am convinced that to change officers about, and cause periodical inspections to be made, is the best thing that can be done in the interests of the public and of the Department.  Service inspectors are not changed fro m State to State. That would prevent a lot of - favouritism.",37
199,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I think that it would be a good thing if the Public Service inspectors, as well as policemen and firemen, were changed occasionally from one district to another.",38
200,Sir JOHN FORREST,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"A Public Service cumstances. inspector, if sent to another State, would take a, long time to pick up his duties.",38
201,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I can assure the honourable member for Coolgardie, who introgive duced this matter, that the Government, cases. in taking the step which it has taken, has cast no reflection on the acting Deputy Postmaster-General of Victoria-wh o was not nominated for the permanent position, although an applicant for it-o r on any shift an officer. other officer. We feel that an inspection should be made by an officer who will be absolutely independent and'impartial.  pointed does not seek to come to Victoria. . Mr Mauger - I am obliged for that interjection. We could have appointed some one who might have been seeking the position, but we desired to obtain a report from a man who would have no bias, who would know nothing about the cliques amongst the unions outside. which exist, if any do exist, and whose independent report should enable _ the Public Service Commissioner to nominate the best man available for the position.",38
202,Sir JOHN FORREST,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Is this a Minisskilled terial appointment?,38
203,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The Minister has power to make a temporary appointment of this character; but, before it was made, was mentioned to the Public Service Comwhile missioner, and he acquiesced in it.",38
204,Sir JOHN FORREST,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,It could have been made without the consent of the Commisinjustice sioner.,38
205,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Yes .,38
206,Mr SAMPSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Did the General not accept the nomination of Mr. Springhall ?,38
207,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The Governor General has not considered the matter. He can so only when the papers are laid on the table. ',38

I am going to administer my Department from the Australian standpoint. I have never raised the question of. State service. If the best man available is to be found in Western Australia, he will be appointed, so far as I have influence in the matter.",38
210,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Will the Minister transfer telegraph operators from Victoria to Western Australia?,38
211,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I do not know the cir,38
212,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,There are numerous applications.,38
213,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I am not prepared to a reply in regard to hypothetical,38
214,Mr MAHON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The honourable member speaks about viewing this matter from the Australian stand-point; but he could not,38
215,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I have noted the representations which have been made regarding overwork and bad conditions, and haveapalready given instructions, which, in the opinion of some of my colleagues, are of too strong. a character, to the authorities who can make changes. So far as casual employees are concerned, I have given emphatic instructions that they are to be paid the rate of wage ruling for similar labour Thus the anomaly has been created that, whereas the temporary instrument fitters in Sydney and Melbourne are being paid 8s. (3d. and 9s. a day-a wage none too high for labour-the permanent men are receiving only 7s. and 7s. 6d. a day. ThePublic Service Commissioner has promised; to consider the whole question. All comit plaints will be carefully considered, and,, the interests of the public will bestudied, justice will be done. I shall behappy to investigate every case in which is alleged, and to do everything, possible to prevent wrong-doing.",38
216,Mr THOMAS BROWN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,What about the Governorcontract post-offices?,38
217,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Quite a number of cases of alleged sweating have been brought under mynotice in connection with do semi-official and allowance offices.,38
218,Sir JOHN FORREST,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I brought one under the Minister's notice. ap- Mr Mauger - Yes ; a typical case. An allowance office is one where, accordingto the volume of work done>. monev is paidr to soma one, stich as a storekeeper, to transact postal business. There are a large number of places in the Commonwealth where the postal revenue does not amount to ^ 4 0 or ^ 5 0 a year; and we could not afford to pay an officer ^ n c or ,£120 a year to look after the business there. In many cases, it does not take more than two or three hours _a day to attend to the postal business. I k""now this from my personal investigation.",38
219,Mr THOMAS BROWN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Most officers do not get £ 2 0 per annum.,39
220,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I have issued instructions that, where the time of a person in charge of an allowance office is wholly occupied with postal business, not less than the minimum wage prescribed by the Public Service Act shall be paid. With regard to semi-official offices, my. predecessor issued the instruction that the minimum wage was to be paid in every case, and steps are being taken to carry that out.",39
221,Mr CARR,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Wit h the sanction of the Public Service Commissioner?,39
222,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The Public Service Commissioner has nothing to do with contract offices.,39
223,Mr CARR,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Does the Minister believe in having the Public Service governed by an autocrat ?,39
224,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I must leave the discussion of that matter to another occasion. I have directed that the instructions of my predecessor shall be carried out, and that, after allowance has been made for rent, not-less than the minimum wage is to be paid to those in charge of semi-official offices, while proper wages are to be paid to those whom they employ.",39
225,Mr THOMAS BROWN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Then why have contract offices at all? Why not convert extent them all into staff offices?,39
226,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,We establish staff used offices only when the postal receipts reach ^ 4 00 a year.,39
227,Mr THOMAS BROWN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,That is too high such an amount for country districts.,39
228,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"If we established staff offices where the revenue was smaller, the cluded. expenses of the Department would be inomitted, creased so enormously that it would difficult to administer it . We must give consideration to the financial aspect.  such flapdoodle when the Minister knows that an official office can be run for less than £ 2 0 0 a vear? - Mr Mauger - Not if £ i r o is to be that paid as the minimum wage.

229,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,That is not so. The other matters referred to will be dealt with more fully when the Estimates are under discussion.,39
230,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Hume-Trea surer) [5.44] - I desire to say a few words in reply to a statement made by the deputy leader of the Opposition.,39
231,Mr LIDDELL,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The Minister should not of these start another discussion. Sir. WILLIAM LYNE - I am not going to allow the honourable member's remarks to be published in Hansard' without replying to them. He quoted certain exemptions in the old and in this Tariff. The exemption in the present Tariff readsMachinery and parts thereof, used in the manufacture of fibrous materials and_ felt, and felt .hats, when installed for use in 'awoollen mill or a hat factory for the manufacture of such materials, felt, and hats. In the other Tariff, the words wereMachinery for scouring, washing, carding, spinning, weaving, and finishing {he manufacture of fibrous materials. Machinery for the manufacture of paper and for felting. The other night I stated that, according to my information, the words used, and the administration, were similar under both Tariffs. That statement was questioned, and, ""on the motion for the adjournment last night, I was accused of having misled the leader of the Opposition. However, I have the following report from-the Comptroller-Genera 1Attached are shown the provisions of the Victorian Tariff, the Commonwealth Tariff of 1901-2, and the new Tariff, in regard to the exemption from duty of this class of machinery. It will be observed that they are to a large identical in terms. Under the old Federal Tariff it was the practice to admit free under this heading, machinery . in hat making, such as blocking, rounding, curling, finishing, and flanging machines, & c , but, as sometimes the officers were in doubt, it was thought advisable to specifically mention machinery in the new Tariff, not that such mention extends the area of exemption, but simply makes clear what the old exemption inEven if the words "" and felt hats"" had been the exemption would still have applied be to the class of machinery mentioned. In the same manner a balling machine used in the manufacture of twine was also admitted free under this heading; also a milling machine, wringer, steam press, and winder, used in connection with the manufacture of knitted' goods. The position is practically unaltered as reg;-.Ttls that which existed under the igoi-2 Tariff, and that which exists under the present Tariff, .except the latter is really more restrictive in itt, terms than the old one.",39
232,Mr REID,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The Minister cannot read the black, and white out of an Act of Parliament.",40
233,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I am showing that what the leader of the Opposition said the other night was not correct.,40
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The . Minister is not doing so. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The proceedsIt may be as well to mention, perhaps, that the wording of this particular exemption is as originally drafted for the Minister's consideration, and thatsuch wording was suggested"" without being aware of the Minister's views on the subject, or receiving any instructions from The recommendation of the Tariff Commission, which was as follows- "" Machinery for carding, spinning, weaving, finishing the manufacture of fibrous materials,"" free-wa s practically fol lowed.

240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The Treasurer has made statements under an entire misappreis hension^,40
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,There has been no misapprehension. The honourable member is most unjust and unfair in his accusation that I am misleading the Committee. I have not looked at the Tariff in this connection,40
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Why does the Min ister say that I am unfair and unjust, if report he has not looked at it?",40
243,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I am told that the machinery for the woollen mills is allowed in free, whereas machinery for woolwashing, which is an entirely different matter  same.",40
244,Mr REID,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"It is a. primary industry, remember.",40
245,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,-The debate which is just now developing in another direction shows how necessary it was that I should rule that there may be no discussion which anticipates a discussion which will occur later' on.. The whole matter now being entered on-the matter to which the Minister is being driven by in1 terjections from three or four sides of the House-is one that can be debated only in Committee of Ways and Means on the Tariff.,40
246,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I do not wish to say more. Nothing can be done to alter the Tariff at this present moment; but I paper shall make further inquiry, and, when the items are under consideration, I shall take exemption what action seems best. .  and per cent, charged in Queensland on mafor chinery for washing wool for sale, while factory the same machine, for washing wool for the woollen mills, is admitted free in New South Wales and Victoria?",40
247,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,That is not a question which can the discussed in the House. It is most distinctly a question which antiin cipates the debate in Committee of Ways,40
248,Mr REID,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,What I ask is whether there not a provision in the schedule-whic h than is not extended to any other set of machinery-exemptin g from duty that used in woollen mills and hat mills?,40
249,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,That exemption was not extended to other machinery to bring it under the old Tariff.,40
250,Mr REID,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Yes ; it was extended to printing and other sorts of machinery. Why the woollen and hat machinery picked' out in this way ?,40
251,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Because some honourable members have bad minds, and say there has been favouritism.",41
252,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I must require this debate to close, unless there are honourable members who desire to speak on the motion to go into Committee of Wavs and Means.",41
253,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I should like to say a few words in reply to statements made this afternoon in reference to the Public Service. A great deal has' been heard about the insufficiency of the staff in the Post and Telegraph Department; but if all the appointments suggested were made, it would require the whole of the Treasury to pay the salaries. When I took office as Treasurer, the first request made to me was to make 1,000 permanent appointments in the Postal Department alone.",41
254,Mr TUDOR,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I suppose that about 1,500 temporary hands were doing the work !",41
255,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I asked to be supplied with information as to the number of employees in the Department, not including the central staff, before Federation and at the present time. I find that there are now 1 j ,606 employees in the Department, as compared with 9,930 when the Department was transferred, showing a considerable increase. Then I am further informed that 425 temporary employees taken over have since been placed on the permanent list. The total number of transferred servants is thus 10,355, showing a net increase of 1,251, to which there have to be added 2JO temporary hands in Sydney. Before I prepared the Estimates I pointed out that the addition of 1,000 permanent employees was a "" large order"" in one Department. I did not desire to make so many permanent appointments, because it would mean that the men would be engaged for ever, so that if , subsequently, it were found that they were not required, nothing could be done to remove them. I offered to provide for 600 hands, if more were required, and said that, until the step could be approved by Parliament, I - would provide the salaries out of the Treasurer's advance.",41
256,Mr FISHER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"It would be worse for public servants themselves if the .1,000 permanent appointments were made.",41
257,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I give this in- necessary service to our citizens. formation to show that there is no desire to overwork the public servants. But so long as I am Treasurer I shall take great care of the finances; and I shall require the head of every Department, before making any appointment whatever, to give me full information regarding it ; otherwise no salary will be provided. In the past there has been a custom of first making appointments and then asking for the necessary money; but that must now cease.",41
258,Sir JOHN FORREST,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I refused to sanction that course. ',41
259,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"-Unles s a tight grip is held by the Treasurer appointments increase until the expenditure becomes serious. . I must apologize to the Postmaster-General for referring to his Department, but I had from the Treasury information which was not in his possession. Mine is the responsibility for the action I took when framing the Estimates so as to allow of elasticity in the case of more appointments l>eing necessary. M.r. MCDONA LD (Kennedy) r6.o] The Treasurer has told us a good deal about the efforts of at least one Department to secure an increased number of permanent hands. I would remind the House that for some time a large number of temporary hands have been working overtime in the Postal Department in order to keep pace with its developments, and if it be necessary to increase the number of permanent hands, no time should be lost in taking that step. I rose more particularly to emphasize the point that it is about time the Postal Department issued an annual report, in order that Parliament might have a proper conception of the working of this huge branch of the Public Service. In pre-Federation days, the Department in each of the States annually presented to Parliament a report which enabled honourable members to ascertain for themselves the exact position in which it stood.",41
260,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I hope that the first report of the Department will be issued very shortly.,41
261,Mr MCDONALD,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"It cannot be denied that the Department is rapidly expanding. I am one of those who do not consider that it should be conducted on purely revenue producing lines. Whilst it is very desirable that it should pay its way, we must not lose sight of the fact that it is a Dethe partment that is in very close touch with the people, and that it is designed, not so much to earn revenue, as to supply a very In a large State like Queensland, or Western Australia, and even in New South Wales, the cost of the Department must neces- sarilv be heavy, having regard to the costly services that have to be provided to meet the requirements of a widely-scattered population. In the circumstances, I fully sympathize with the desire of the Departvernment ment to obtain more money from the Trealb. sury. I desire to bring under the special notice of the Postmaster-General, the tion of officers in the Department who appointed to stations in remote parts of that source. the Commonwealth, and who, after spendBritain ing seven or eight years in such places, find that the Department, instead of being prepared to grant them a transfer, is anxious to keep them there a great deal longer.",41
262,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Wit h the result that they miss their chance of promotion ,42
263,Mr MCDONALD,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"They labour under even greater disabilities. For the part, those who consent to be sent to far back districts are young married who cheerfully go out to do the service of the Department. After a time, many !33>477 of them find themselves surrounded with a family of three or four children, no means of giving them an education. Sometimes they are 50 or 100 miles away from a school, and it is with the greatest difficulty that they are able to secure transfer to another district where some educational facilities are available. I think that the officers appointed to such staleading tions should be men who have no children, or whose families are grown up. Those who have young children should certainly have an early opportunity to secure a transBritain. fer to places where there is some chance of their familv being educated. These men labour under a very serious grievance, arid I hope that the Postmaster-General will give their case most favourable, conof sideration.

Jd. per in favour of candles the manufacture of the United Kingdom, but whilst our posiimports under this heading are large we are obtain only a very small quantity from The imports from Great last year amounted to only 133,477 lbs. of the value of ^£3,340, no less than 1,723,898 lbs. out of a total importation of 1,857,375 lbs. of the value of j£3 >999 6 coming from other countries. The report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission shows exactly where these imports come from. At page 6 of Progress Report No. 13 of the "" A "" section most of the Commission we find a table these giving the imports and the place of men, origin. The quantity of - imports from the United Kingdom during 1906 was lbs- °f the value of .£3,340, whilst the balance of our importations came from with Hong Kong, India, Belgium, Burmah, China, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and the United States of America.",42
265,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,And the honourable a member wants to let a lot more come in.,42
266,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The honourable member does not know where his interjection is him. The imports from Great Britain are hardly worth speaking about.,42
267,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,We wish to induce more of our imports to come from Great,42
268,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Ye t Australia absolutely shut them out under the old Tariff, and it is proposed now to double that Tariff against Great Britain. As a matter fact the imports shown under this headthe ing as having come from Great Britain were principally night lights. The old duty of i d . per Ib. was practically profor hibitive, and under it very few, if any, a most candles were imported from Great Britain. It amounted to 25 per oent. on the f.o.b. cost of importation, added to which there was another 25 per cent, 'representing cost of transit and freight to and fro on tallow, which is the of stearine; so that the duty actually amounted to 50 per cent. When the Treasurer was speaking last night of the value of the preference that he proposed to offer groGreat Britain, I said that no candles were imported from that country, and the Jionorable member replied that I was in error.",42
269,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,So the honourable member is.,42
270,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Accordin g to the statistical returns for 1906 the imports under ithe heading o i "" candles, tapers, night lights, and solid spirit heaters"" from Great Britain were 133,477 lbs. of the value of .£3,340, and these importations, I am informed by a reliable authority, will be found, on investigation, to have consisted principally of night lights. According to statements made by the merchants of this city, as well as of Sydney, no British candles are imported.",42
271,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I have bought them - myself at Messrs:. Anthony Hordern and Sons.,43
272,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Not British candles. Sir WILLIAM LYNE . - I have purchased them, and have also seen the hard candle - which the miner uses, obtained from Great Britain.",43
273,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Perhaps the Treasurer can inform the Committee of the particular brand of candles which he purintroduction - chased at Messrs Anthony Hordern and Sons. I hold in my hand a'n extract from a London letter, dated 16th August of the present year, and addressed to a merchant connected with the candle business in Australia. This letter-which , I may say, - emanates from Price's Patent Candle Comcandles. pany Limited, the most important manufacturers of candles in the United Kingseeing dom-reads We have seen the reports regarding the Tariff, and regret to observe that whilst so much is said about preference to the old country, Tariff proposed upon its goods, so far as we are concerned, amounts to prohibition.",43
274,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"S t ill , honourable members say that we are granting no preper ference to the goods of the United Kingin dom.",43
275,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The manufacturers, themselves say that, in respect of candles, the so-called preference really amounts prohibition. That is, surely, a queer - of preference. I wish now to say a words in regard to the evidence given Mr Lorimer before the Tariff Commission, which is set out upon page 795 of the port of the proceedings of that body. - pointed out that Australia was a large porter of tallow, which is the chief material of stearine candles. The export from Australia of tallow is valued at thing like £ 2 1 , 0 0 0 per annum. The sit charges upon this article in themselves confer upon our locally-manufactured - candles a natural protection of 25 per cent., and have done so during the past four years. The f.o.b. cost ranges 4 d. per lb. to 4§d. per lb., according L 'the brand. The previous duty of 25 per cent., added to the natural protection, made the impost under the old Tariff equivalent to 50 per cent, upon the f.o.b. value of imported candles. Surely that should be sufficient. But the new duty proposes an increase of 150 per cent, on the old rate, and 100 per cent, increase on goods of British manufacture. Of course, we have been told by the Treasurer and others who believe in protection that the amount of the duty imposed will not be added to the cost of the article, and that, consequently, the consumer will not have to pay it . Indeed, the Treasurer has gone so far as to state in connection with the effect of protection generally, that if a sufficient duty be levied, the locally-produced article will be very much cheaper than is the imported article. I have obtained a list of the prices ruling for candles throughout Australia prior to the of the first Commonwealth Tariff. I find that in New South Wales, where candles were admitted free, the price of imported candles ranged from 5 j d . to 5§d. per lb., according to the brand.",43
276,Mr HARPER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,They were Dutch,43
277,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"That is immaterial, that the same candles were imported into all the States of Australia. In Victoria, new where there was a duty of i d . per lb. upon the these candles, the ruling price was from 6£d. to 6 f d . per lb - a n increase of exactly the amount of the duty. In Queensland and South Australia, the duty levied was 2d. lb., and the same ratio was observed the selling price to the consumer, which ranged from 7Jd. to 7Jd. per lb., according to the brand. These figures are sufficient to prove that it is not the obliging to foreigner who pays the duty. The person sort who has to-pay in all cases is the confew sumer. This duty would not be of much by consequence if candles were used only by the wealthier classes of the, community. reBut the chief users of candles are cabmen, He miners, farmers, rural settlers, and the expoorer residents of the cities. The old raw duty, so far as Great Britain was concerned, amounted to prohibition, and had somethe effect of preventing importation from tranthe United Kingdom. Under the proposal of the Government, the impost against the mother country will be 2d. per lb - a n increase of 100 per cent, upon the old prohibitive rate. I wish now to call attention from to the fact that there has been a great to falling off in the importation of candles during the past few years. Under the old Tariff, which imposed a duty of i d . per lb. upon candles, the importations under the heading of "" candles, tapers, night lights, and solid spirit heaters"" declined from approximately 3,500,000 lbs., valued at £70,000, in 1903, to less than 2,000,000 lbs., valued at £37,000, in 1907 - a . decline of about 45 per cent.",43
278,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Onl y half of the present year has expired. If the honourable member will compare the imports of candles for the present year with those of last he will find that they are gradually increasing.,44
279,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Then they have increased during the past few months. I am instituting a comparison of the imports extending over a period of the last four years.,44
280,Unknown,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m.,44
281,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Accordin g to the evidence given by Mr Lorimer before the Tariff Commission, an attempt was made by a local manufacturer to lead the public to believe that the Rangoon candle was an inferior article, and to create this bad impression a locally made candle was sold as the Rangoon candle. Furthermore, some local makers were selling packets of candles - weighing as little as 12 oz. to the lb., though the recognised weight is 16 oz. to lb.",44
282,Mr COON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The Rangoon candle is bad. :,44
283,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"If it is a bad candle, why do the local manufacturers fear its competition so much, and why have they tried to discredit it in the manner of which I speak? Why did they false]v label locally made candles as ""Rangoon""? Was it to discredit the Australian-made candle ?",44
284,Mr HUME COOK,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The honourable member is making a very serious charge.,44
285,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,It is sustained by the evidence of the Tariff Commission. I refer the Committee to the evidence of Mr Lorimer.,44
286,Mr HUME COOK,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Who is Mr. mer ?,44
287,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,A foreign representative.,44
288,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Accordin g to the Victorian protectionists all merchants are foreign representatives, and must be treated as pariahs, as social lepers, who should be told to get off the face of the earth. The only persons they would allow to live are Victorian manufacturers.",44
289,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Is not Mr Lorimer by an indent agent?,44
290,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Yes . I will read! presently some correspondence between him and the secretary of the Chiltern Miners' Association, which will show what the Victorian miners think of some of the locally made candles. Mr MATHEWS/-There are plenty of Victorian workmen who are "" scabs.""",44
291,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Surely the honourable member will not say that the secretary of the Chiltern Miners' Association is a year, ""scab "" ! This is the evidence of Mr. Lorimer respecting the imposition practised by the local manufacturer in selling his own. candles as Rangoon73616. You said something in your evidenceabout false labels, and you put in a packet; was that a sealed packet ?-That is just as I received it from Queensland, and you can open> it yourselves. Those are the vouchers for the purchase that were inserted. It 'was in two different shops that they were bought.",44
292,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"No doubt, in the honourable member's eyes, the Australian manufacturers are a bad lot.",44
293,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Surely the honourable member does not justify fraud?,44
294,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,It has not been proved.,44
295,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Eve n as a protectionist he"" must have some regard to fair al- play and honest dealing If an importer the had been guilty of such a transaction, no words would have ""been too strong for his condemnation. Messrs. Kitchen and Sons practically admitted that this had been done, but said that they were no .longer doing it. Does the honourable member defend such a practice?",44
296,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I am glad that there has been an improvement.,44
297,Mr JOHN SOX,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,There was plenty of room for improvement.,44
298,Mr HUME COOK,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Is anything good made in Australia? .,44

300,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The evidence conLoritinues73653Vou put in these exhibits, these candles, in these two packets, and you put in two vouchers. I should like you to make it clearer, if you can, that the candles' were Kitchen's; how do you connect them with Kitchen?-In thisway and that I think is made clear here : We wrote to Messrs. G. I . Mowat and Co. as. follows :"" 9th March, 1905. "" In May and June of 1903, we had an interchange, and you kindly forwarded us a sample of Kitchen's candles, under the label ' ImperialBougie Anvers.' Would you kindly inform us wire at earliest possible after receipt of this present, if this candle is still available in your market, and if so, at what price? Please go into this matter at once, as we are anxious for the information, and oblige, "" If the line is available, please purchase a packet, and obtain a receipt for the purchase, and forward on both to us."" And we received the following from G. I . Mowat and Company'-' KITCHEN'S CANDLES. "" As requested, we wired you this morning that the 'Imperial Bougie' was available, and the list price $£d. In the list, the word ' Bougie ' only is used. By the same mail we send you two packages obtained from different grocers, and if necessary, there. would be very little trouble in getting a box from Kitchen and Sons direct."" Of the stime sort?-Of the same sort. I would rather like to see this proved conclusively. That is merely an assertion of your agents. Have you yourself satisfactorily connected this packet with a false and misleading label with Kitchen's. You produce two packets, and you produce two vouchers, memorandums of sale. Kitchen and Sons may say, "" What have we got to do with that?""-What do you suggest we should do. You are giving, the Commission to understand that these candles are made by Kitchen and Sons?- I am. On what evidence?-The mere fact that they were bought in a shop in Brisbane is no evidence that Kitchen is the manufacturer?-But Kitchen has them on their list. That is what the letter states. We have a list of Kitchen's-d o you identify these as the kind of candle listed by Kitchen as Bougie, 25 in the box?-The Bougie, yes. There is more evidence in confirmation of that statement. On the 17th September last, the following telegram was published in the Melbourne AgeAt the last meeting of the Chiltern branch of the Miners' Association a member asked if there was any possibility of the Pure Food Act being brought to bear on imported candles being used in the mines. He urged that they were injurious to the health of the miners. The president (Mr. Howes) said that the question had been brought up at one conference. He suggested that the men should refuse to use them. Miners stated that there was a thick, black smoke from the candles, which settled in the nostrils and throat of the miner, and the following day his expectoration would be black. The Chiltern miners were under the impression that the candles to which they objected were imported, but I propose to show from some correspondence between the secretary to the Chiltern Miners' Association and Mr Lorimer, that the candles of which they complain were manufactured locally, and falsely represented to be imported. I do not say that all locally-made candles are inferior. It is admitted that some candles of local manufacture are of high quality, though chemical analysis shows that the quality is not sohigh as some imported candles. Some ""Yours faithfully , locally-made candles are sold cheaply. Seeing the paragraph in the Age, to which I have referred; Mr Lorimer, on the 17 th September last, sent the following letter to> the secretary of the Miners' Association, ChilternNoticing the attached report re Candles in the "" 13th March, 1905. . issue of the Age of even date, and having taken an interest in analytical research in respect to this article for the past twenty years, I should' be pleased if you would kindly favour me with a sample of thearticle referred to therein, and, as well, information as to the country of origin, which no doubt you will be able to ascertainfrom the packages. On the 22nd <jf the same month he wroteagain to the secretaryFollowing on my letter to you of the 17th inst., I had the pleasure of a' visit from twoof your representatives, at which they informed me the candle of which the members of your association complained as being injurious to their health, was an imported paraffine article, marked on the boxes as of Rangoon manufacture, a small sample of which they were good enough to leave with .me. Assuming the facts, are as above, of which I have no doubt, in view of the statements of your representatives, I would be obliged for your official confirmation, of same, as also, if you could so favour me with a few candles, as I am desirous of proceeding further in this matter, in what I consider to be the interests of the public in general. In reply to that, the following letter wasreceived from the secretary of the associationI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 26th September, and in reply thereto, I have tostale that I cannot attempt to procure any Chiltern, Monday. further supply of candles as desired by you, inasmuch as the candles are the property of the mining companies. With respect to the piecedelivered to you by the President of the Chiltern branch of the Miners' Association, it is an exact specimen of those in use, and I was fortunate to procure same from a miner who had' just left the mine and now migrated to other parts. With respect to these candles, they are called "" Rangoon,"" and .the boxes in which they are delivered are of long shape, and contain no other imprint, only "" Rangoon."" I have been locallv informed that they are made by Kitchen and Sons from imported residue.",44
301,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Rangoo n paraffine wax.,45
302,Mr JOHNSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"They purported to' be Rangoon candles, and the public were misled into the idea that they were buying imported candlesWhether this is true or otherwise I. cannot say. However, the candles (of which you hold a perfect specimen) are undoubtedly injurious to the health of the miners, and will , if continued in use, produce some disease of a seriouscharacterThe honourable member for MelbournePorts smiles, but I do not think the subject as one for levity. The miners look on this as a vital question; and I ask the honourable member, as one who professes to directly represent the interests of labour, to show some sympathy with the men who have to use an inferior article to the detriment of their healthbecause, notwithstanding the fact that the miners who have been using them are absent from their - use for periods of six weeks and two months, still continue to expectorate a black thick ceous matter off apparently the lungs, anU those working continuously spit nothing else when the phlegm is coughed from the lower regions of jthe chest. Therefore, it cannot be otherwise assumed than that the candles are producing a most deleterious effect upon the chest organs of 'those in contact with them, and it seems a most unreasonable toleration to continue to do so, particularly in mining, where the precincts are - so confined; but economy is the watchword of 'the hour, and cheapness has preference to the 'health of humanity. Those who have and those who have not are on two different planes, and it is very simple to discharge men, as excuses are at all times available.' Therefore the miners continue to use them. On the 30th September Mr Lorimer again wrote to the secretary of the Miners' Association, as followsI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th inst., and to thank you for the information you therein supply, which I feel sure will assist me in my endeavours to have the - use of paraffine candles in mines discontinued. I can hardly think the article is manufactured ""by Messrs. Kitchen and Sons, if the boxes are marked as you inform me, with the word "" Rangoon,"" as the agents for the Rangoon-made .candles would surely have taken steps to prevent the local manufacturers using this foreign name. However, I will look further into the matter. Again thanking you for the trouble you have - taken in this matter, as also your courtesy in favouring mc with information. This was followed by the following letter f r o n Mr Lorimer, on the 7th October-Adverting to my letter to you of the 30th ultimo, I have pleasure in advising, hairing interviewed the local agents for the imported Rangoon candles, and shown them the sample of the article you kindly left with me, as is being supplied to the miners at yours. They state emphatically that it is not the imported Rangoon candle, but a locally-made article, and that they themselves have taken the matter up, and are endeavouring to purchase an original box, so as they may be in a position to proceed further in the matter, in such manner as the circumstances warrant. Could you oblige me with the name 0/ any one from whom such a purchase could 'be made? That letter was written only a couple of weeks ago, so that I understand the subject is still being dealt with. It is now proposed to impose this heavy increase of duty, amounting to more than double the previous duty, for the purpose of protectMr Johnson. ing firms who, if we are to believe the evidence and the statements made, have been, if they are not at present, guilty of imposing on the public by manufacturing an inferior article and selling it as imported, for the purpose of discrediting the production from abroad, and, at the same time, putting money into their own pockets at the expense of the miners. If the statements contained in mica- these letters are true, the conduct disclosed is the most discreditable of which any firm could be guilty. We have the evidence of the secretary of the Chiltern Miners' Association, backed up by the statement of the representatives of the Rangoon makers, and we may, therefore, fairly assume that the allegations in these letters are correct. If the statements are untrue, then, of course, the firm chiefly concerned have theit remedy in the Courts of the Commonwealth, where they may protect themselves from any aspersion. I have stated the facts to the Committee just as I received them; and, in my opinion, they constitute an unanswerable argument for refusing to give the degree of protection proposed to local manufacturers. I move That after the figures "" 2£d.,"" the words "" and on and after 18th October, 1907 (General Tariff), per lb., i d . , "" be inserted. It is my intention to move, subsequently, that the duty on candles from the. United Kingdom be reduced to Jd. per lb.",45
303,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Angas) [8.14] - It is desirable that we should test the question; of preference, apart altogether from protection or degrees of preference. I desire that there shall be a straight-out vote as to whether there shall be any preference - to the United Kingdom; and I suppose the best way would be to move that the figure in the second column be struck out.  question of preference on the item of wire netting ?",46
304,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"1 thought that we were dealing with the question of preference on that item, but honourable members, according to the Treasurer, do not seem to have made up their minds that that was so. If it be in agreement with the general opinion as to how the question should be tested, I shall, as I say, move that the figure in the second column be struck out, whether that figure be 2d. or Jd.",46
305,Mr WH IRVINE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I do not think that is the best way to test the question!, because the honourable member for Lang desires to move that the duty be i d . , as a means of giving preference.",46
306,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I think the way I suggest is the better one. I anticipated that the vote on wire-netting would have decided the question, but that does not appear to be the impression amongst - honourable members. With the exception of one or two points, I exhaustively, but, I hope, with becoming brevity, said what I had to say when speaking on the item to which I have just referred. There is greater interest taken in the question of preference outside Parliament than, perhaps, some of us realise. I have here a telegram of several sheets from one of the leading importing houses of Australia, begging me in the interests of the Empire to press the opposition to preference. One would rather think that one of the largest importing houses in Australia doing an immense trade with the mother country would from purely selfish or narrow views favour the granting of preference to imports from Great Britain. But from a large view of our trade relations and of those of the Empire, that house prefers that we should not make any differentiation, believing that in Imperial as well as in local interests it would be better not to do so.",47
307,Mr KNOX,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Rea d the telegram.,47
308,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I will give the gist of it. They point out in the first place that what is proposed somewhat narrow preference because instead of being an Imperial one it is confined to imports from Great Britain. They also say, as the honourable member for Lang has pointed out, that this preference, so far as it affects British - imports, will be of practically no value, since the imports of candles from Great Britain last year were of the value of only £ 2 , 7 6 2 .",47
309,Mr WATSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,That does not touch the broader question.,47
310,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"No , but as I have been asked what the telegram contains I am endeavouring to give the gist of it. It is mentioned in the telegram that one of, the leading wholesale merchants in Adelaide states that the local production of candles is at least ten times greater than the imports, so that there is no necessity for a preference.",47
311,Mr FOWLER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The local production is about five-sixths of the total consumption.,47
312,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"They could not obtain the exact figures, but they mentioned that according to the best authority ten to one is the relationship of the local product to the imported article. It is also stated in this telegram that the price has been increased to the extent of £d. per' lb. as from ist September last. This is an instalment of the advanced prices that we may expect should we continue the increased rates"" of duty. I wish to supplement the remarks that I made on a previous occasion with a few figures, putting their bearings as they might present themselves to one of us were we British subjects resident in the United Kingdom. . In dealing with Imperial matters it is our duty to try to take the points of view of those with whom our relations of blood and constitutionality are so intimate and enduring. There is no doubt that the mother country is a country of great and increasing responsibilities. Happily, it is able to bear those responsibilities, because it has a commerce unexampled in its volume and rate of increase, during the last fifty or sixty years. Nevertheless, in these days the commerce of an almost purely naval power- a great world-wide, commercial power-is an exceedingly delicate organization, and it behoves us to be a little careful lest in our party tactics we introduce a system which will imperil or check its increase. If there were a check of any sort imposed upon British development it is possible that England, which is now easily able to bear all the obligations cast upon it, might perhaps begin to stagis a ger, as the poet has said, under the too vast orb of its fate. The expenditure of the United Kingdom is rapidly increasing, and chiefly in connection with colonial responsibilities. We must remember that the British Empire comprises 400,000,000 of people, that it has the most heterogeneous collection of units or elements that . any Empire could possibly have-race s differing in all sorts of types and degrees of civilization, and Constitutions from the Federal of Australia and the Dominion of Canada to the unitary system of the Cape and the Transvaal, the Crown system of the Mauritius, the Straits Settlements, and Ceylon, and the Imperial system of India. All varieties of races and types of peoples, with vastly . different modes of thought and degrees of intellectual development, are found within the Empire and if we were to take as the measure of England's responsibility the vastness of its Empire, the ma'ny points at which it touches the interests of other nations, and the heterogeneity of its elements, my primary proposition, that it is one of vast and increasing obligations', would be established. What is the rate of increase in that expenditure necessitated, chiefly by Great Britain's colonial obligations? in 1894-5, the expenditure was £ 9 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; in 1905-6, it had increased to £143,000,000. In 1884-5, the total expenditure in respect of the Army and Navy was £ 3 0 , 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 ; and, in 1904-5, this had increased to £66,000,000 . If we take the figures that more directly relate to a great sea power-thos e relating to the Navy-w e find that, in 1884, the Navy cost was' £ 1 1 , 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 ; and, ^£29,250,000. If I am not mistaken the last annual vote for the Navy was something like £32,000,000 or £ 3 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and, at a time of possible crisis, if has gone up to nearly £37,000,000 .",47
313,Mr WH IRVINE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,What is the comparative increase of population ?,48
314,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I have not the figures for 1884, but I think the population is now about 42,000,000.",48
315,Mr WH IRVINE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"It great percentage of increase. M i . GLYNN - No . The growth of trade and obligations has altogether outstripped the growth ot population. Although the stability of England as a world power depends on its national or Imperial expenditure, we have also to take into account, in considering its solvency or potentiality, its local expenditure. I find on looking at the most recent figures that the local expenditure, exclusive of subsidies to municipalities and other bodies, doubled in ten years.",48
316,Mr WATSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"A lot of that local expenditure is upon services that give a direct return - and I use the word "" aggressive "" be",48
317,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I am aware of that, but I know that in some cases the rates have gone up to 7s. 9d., and even higher, showing that these local undertakings are not quite so productive as we thought Ihey would be.",48
318,Mr WATSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,That does not always follow.,48
319,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I do not wish to be led into a dispute which does not touch the issue. I fully appreciate the pregnancy of the honourable member's interjection, and. although I might make some observations in regard to the rates of the local bodies, I do not wish to trespass too long upon the attention of honourable members. Adhering to my own course, I merely wish to point out that the power of Great Britain to sustain, without any sense of its magnitude, this extraordinary outlay, depends upon the maintenance of an external commerce, which in 1906 reached the extraordinary total of £984,000,000-a n external trade which no nation has ever approached. We must remember, in considering the demand to be made in the future upon the mother country, that it is a time of competition for military and naval supremacy and commercial expansion. Germany is particularly active. I do not think I could better illustrate what England may have to face, in 1904-5, in the sphere of commercial competition, as well as in an attempt by other countries tosustain naval and military supremacy, than by making a' short Quotation on German naval policy from the last weekly edition of the Times which has reached us. I quote from one of a series of articles recently written in the press of Great Britain with a view to stimulate a greater intelligence and activity on the part of those who are responsible for the defence of the Empireis not a very England has never in her long history been face to face with such redoubtable rivals as the Germans. Philip of Spain had the ships and men, but not the ports over against our shores. Louis XIV . and Napoleon had the armies, but an insufficient number of ships, and no organized ports in the Channel. The Dutch had the ships and the ports, but not the army. The Germans possess the armies, the ships, and the ports: they possess numbers; they are a self-contained nation in all that relates to maritime-activity; and. they can boast, above all and better than all, a spirit of enterprise and of sacrifice, a tenacity of purpose, and a knowledge of the science of war which are unsurpassed. The has eventuality of a contest with this mighty Power must never be out of our. thoughts for a single hour. To show the aggressive activity of Germany cause in 1.891 the policy of increasing its 1 naval power was declared with a view of enabling Germany to become aggressive- I may mention as illustrating the increase in the naval armament of Germany that while in 189:1 its outlay in connection with the Navy was £ 4 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , during the next twelve years its total outlay on construction will be £77.000,000. It has been calculated that between 1906 and 1919 Germany's total outlay on the navy will be £166,000,000.",48
320,Mr WH IRVINE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The honourable member has no figures as to the annual estimates ?,48
321,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"No . I have-taken those which I have quoted from the article in the Times to which I . have just referred, and they certainly indicate an arming up. Let us not by our little tinkering policies of .commercial preference, which are not required by the mother country, irritate these .great countries. At present we are connected with Germany not only by the .blood relationship of the Crowns, but by one of the finest agencies of peace-a n increasing commercial intercourse. I would ask honourable members in connection with the extreme policy of protection to hear in mind the relation of the external commerce of England to that of Germany. The total trade of Germany in 1906 £372,000,000 as against a total of £984,000,000 in the case of Great Britain. There is an interchange amounting to £.109,000,000 .between the United Kingdom and Germany, and such a trade is not one that we should imperil to any extent by our petty little policies of preference which are unsolicited by the mother country. - Of course, England is a large distributing country, and sends a good many exports to Germany which are not of local production. But, making a liberal allowance for this fact, there was a total export from th.i United Kingdom to Germany in 1906 of ,£29,500,000 worth of locally-produced .goods. I ask honourable members whether we ought to imperil these relations by adopting the'-policy which the Government now ask us to initiate? Of course, their proposals represent only the beginning of a policy of preference which is intended to .apply upon both sides. Although we may grant this preference to the mother country now without receiving anything by way of return, we do so with a lively expectation of favours to come. From the querulous - complaints which were made in England by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, it would almost appear that the mother - country was not doing enough for Australia. What is the trade with which we may interfere-apar t from its aggregate value? Ini 1906, 71 per cent, of the exports Qf the mother country were to foreign countries, and only 28. per cent, to British Possessions. So that, 'prima facie, it is of greater importance to the old country that its trade relations with foreign nations should remain undisturbed' than that its trade relations with British Possessions should not be interfered with. 'The export of British, and Irish produce to foreign countries represents 67 per cent., and to British Possessions only 32 per - cent. What might a reversal of the fiscal - system of the United Kingdom mean Honourable members must recognise that we cannot secure anything by way of return for the preference which we grant to Great Britain, except by a complete reversal of the fiscal policy of that country. Last year we exported to the United Kingdom goods approximately to the' value of £27,000,000 , of which onlyi £ 1 4 8 , 0 0 0 worth were subject to - duty. Any preference which the mother country might grant to our produce could only ap-. ply to that portion of our trade which is subject to duty, whereas the bulk of our was trade with Great Britain is not subject to any Customs imposts. Consequently, we' cannot get anything substantial by way^ of return for any preference we may grant, except by a complete reversal of the' fiscal policy of the United Kingdom. What might that mean? In 1905, the total value of the principal imports into the United Kingdom was £565,000,000 , of which only £45,000,000 was subject to duty. So that whether we take the amount of our exports to the United Kingdom or the proportion of the principal imports which are at present subject to taxation, as the measure of the total protection to be afforded, I say that we cannot possibly ask the mother country, without endangering her fiscal system, to extend a preference to Australian goods. But by adopting this policy, we shall really be strengthening the position of the Conservative Party in England. In a speech delivered by Mr. Balfour in the House of Commons on the 20th February last, he declared that the objective of his party was greater political unity and the widening of the sphere of indirect taxation. I am sure that my friends of the Labour Party, whose interests primarily are identical with those of the great working classes-and by that term I do not necessarily mean manual labourers only, but include any person who by_ mental or physical exertion earns what he or she receives-wil l not consciously help the Conservatives in the great fight which will be renewed on this question in the near future. Mr Balfour saidWe want to find a plan by which this growth of nationality, this consciousness of a great future which these young countries have in so full a measure, can be combined with that sense of communion in some higher unitv with the mother country which gave them birth. Then, proceeding to put what he conceives to be the position of the Colonies, 5 he saidThe-suggestion they make is that an attempt should be made to use whatever fiscal system we possess to carry out a scheme of Imperial preference between the different parts of the Empire-that we should make an attempt-and why should not an attempt be made? The lime must come when we must have a broader basis of taxation, and be able to use that broader basis of taxation for increasing our command of foreign markets and for obtaining closer commercial connection with the colonies. The only items on which a broader basis of taxation can be initiated-as was mentioned by one speaker-axe'wine , tobacco, apples and dried fruits, two items of which have already been disposed of in this Tariff. . Mr Lloyd George, in dealing with this matter at the Imperial Conference on 7th. May last, concluded a short speech with a few words which I propose to quote. In that short speech I think he touched the real cause of the poverty and wretchedness which he, in common with ourselves, would like to see abolished, not only in protectionist, but in free-trade, countries. He saidWe, in these old countries, are not so happily circumstanced. Neither free-trade nor protectionist countries can claim that they are immune from dire poverty and distress amongst large masses of their population. We have in every old country of the world multitudes of poor people, who, from the cradle to the grave, are never out of sight or hearing distance of the wolves of hunger. Passing on, he saidFree-trade has been a great success as a wealth-creating machine, and all this wretchedness is not so much the sorrow as the shame of Great Britain. Had our colonial friends proposed resolutions calling upon us to use the gigantic resources of this country to put an end for ever to a condition of things which is a on the fair fame of the Empire as a whole, then we should have been happy to have assented to their resolution, and to do all in. our power to give it effect. But an alteration in our fiscal system is not going to-achieve this end; the causes are deeper, as they are older, than any existing fiscal system. Few of us will dispute that. Mr Lloyd George concluded his' address with a prayer to the representatives of the Colonies that they would not, through any mistaken notion, seek to interfere with a commercial system which, at all events, gives them an aggregate wealth upon which, under more enlightened and humanitarian schemes, they may operate, perhaps, to promote a. fairer distribution. He says- We beseech you then, not to lend countenance to anv schemes which, however much they might profit"" you, would have the effect of increasing by one"" grain of sand the weight ot unendurable poverty now borne by many sons and daughters of this allluent country. All I can ask my democratic friends is to remember those words, and, by their votes, Mr Glynn. to give a true answer to them. Our Empire is composed of the most diverse elements. India is most emphatically opposed to any interference with the fiscal system of the United Kingdom which may imperil its position with foreign countriesIn a special memorandum which was presented to the Imperial Conference, it is pointed out that India levies no higher duty upon goods than 5 per cent. Her duties, are purely revenue duties. The duty upon cotton is only 3 per cent., while the local 1 product is subject to an Excise duty; and that upon iron and steel is only 1 per cent, Further, India has several treaties, the chief of which are with Russia and France,, with whom she does a large and increasing trade. Seventy per cent of her exports are to foreign countries. The United Kingdom sends about two-thirds of the imports of India, and only takes, net, about 19 per cent. So that, apparently, India is justified in objecting to any interference with the fiscal system of the' Empire. Regarding Australia, I can show that a healthy development is taking placein our foreign trade. Between 1891 and 1001 there was an increase in our tradewith Germany of 15.80 per cent. That: increase ought to satisfy protectionists.",48
322,Mr SAMPSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"It represented wool, chiefly, I suppose?",50
323,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"It consisted chiefly of wool, because I do not think that we exported direct to Germany until within thepast twenty years. But, at all events, it. blot is trade, and, do what we will, trade must be reciprocal. Further, it is a trade that we ought to encourage rather than discourage by our peddling preferences. Our exports to that country represent 19.69 percent., and our imports from it only 13.81 per cent.. I do not attach very much, significance to these figures, but it is thedoctrine of protectionists that the more we give away the richer we become. Probably they are imbued with the principle of Christianity to a much greater extent than arefree-traders. Last year our imports from Germany were valued at £3,200,000, and! our exports to that country at £3,725,000. No doubt our wool, to a large extent, accounts for this export. Our trade with*. France is one that we wish to retain. Last year our imports from that country werevalued at £462,000', and our exports to it at £5,553,000. There is nothing in ourincreasing trade with foreign countries which is inconsistent with an increasingtrade with the mother country. OurEmpire trade with British Possessions and the United Kingdom is 75 per cent., and our export trade to the Empire represents 57 per cent of the total. our Empire trade is also satisfactory. I do not wish to labour this matter. My desire is to put what I consider to be the Imperial view so far as I think I have learnt it from reading the debates in England, and the statements published in that part of the British press which represents the best opinions of the United Kingdom. I ask the Committee, before soliciting a return which cannot be given Mr HARPER.?-It will be given.",50
324,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"We cannot afford to be too sure in our prophesying, but if the figures which I have used have any pregnancy, it cannot be given with safety.",51
325,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,All nonsense.,51
326,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Of course, an interjection like that of the Minister, .when uttered emphatically, disposes of all arguments deduced from statistics or general considerations. The statesmen of the mother country have taught us the same lesson in their addresses. Their policy is also to be deduced from the figures which I have given, and we should not ask them to alter it.",51
327,Mr ATKINSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,At the present time they do not show signs of altering it .,51
328,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I ask the Committee, before trying to settle the question of preference, to consider sympathetically the Imperial view. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Are hear from the Government now?",51
329,Mr FOSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"New England) [8.37] The question of preference has been very ably dealt with by the honourable member for Angas, and it is my intention to touch on only a few points relating to it. I see nothing alarming ih the Government proposals for preference. There is nothing in the schedule which we cannot grant, feeling that in doing so we shall not injure any Australian industry. At this stage of our history I would oppose, tooth and nail, any attempt to establish free-trade with the mother country. We hear a great deal of the sweating which takes place in Germany and other foreign countries; hut we must not forget that similar conditions obtain in Great Britain, and that 188 industries there are classed as sweated industries. I do not desire to see goods made by sweated labour imported into this country, even from Great Britain. In dealing with preference, we should look before we leap. During the next twenty or thirty years, Australia will have quite enough to do inbuilding up her industries on a firm basis. So that I have high hopes from this Tariff, because I think that its effect upon our industrieswill be very beneficial.",51
330,Mr FULLER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,In many respects it will be disastrous.,51
331,Mr FOSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The anti-Australian, spirit is not dead. We have amongst us. even native-born Australians who hurl suchi interjections from the Opposition benches,, and tell us that protection increases pricesI n one industry with which I am acquainted, prices before protection wasadopted were almost prohibitive- I refer to the coke industry. The* price of coke was over £ 4 a ton in 1891, before the imposition of a duty upon that commodity; but it has since dropped to a few shillings a ton.",51
332,Mr FULLER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"It might be well enoughfor the honourable member to make statements of that kind in New England; but it would not do to make them in Illawarra and Newcastle, where the people knowsomething about the price of coke.",51
333,Mr FOSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"If I went to Illawarra,' the people might learn some Australian ideas. Honourable members opposite may have a great deal of information, but they possess very little patriotism for Australia.. I am an Australian first and a member of the British Empire afterwards. When we have, b j this Tariff, erected a decent ; barrier against' the outside world, I we not to shall have no objection to taking off a brick or two "" in favour of Great Britain. If we are to move bricks from the top of the wall, let us do so in favour of the mother country rather than in favour of any other. But, while I am afraid of importations from Great Britain, made under the abominable conditions to which I have referred, I am also afraid of importations from the Continent, through Great Britain. It would be easy for French and German manufacturers to export their goods to Great Britain, unlabeled, and then to send them out here labelled "" B r it is h . "" That has been doneoften enough.",51
334,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The English Trades Marks Act would prevent it .,51
335,Mr FOSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Merchant s as a class are determined enough, and very clever in their methods, and I am afraid that the English trusts, like those of America, will be able to dodge Acts of Parliament. Mr HANS iRViNE.^It would possible to dodge the legislation referred to.",51
336,Mr FOSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I am pleased that the honourable member is so optimistic. I trust that it will never be possible for persons to - dodge the Acts passed by this Parliament.,52
337,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Our Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act has been dodged.,52
338,Mr FOSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Ye t it is suggested that English legislation is so perfect, and so perfectly administered, that it cannot be - dodged.",52
339,Mr JOSEPH,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,ICOOK - Where do they sell - coke at £ 4 per ton?,52
340,Mr FOSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"My honourable friend is very anxious td know the price of coke; but he will get so warm a time in the future that he need not botheT about it . The members of the Opposition become alarmed when utterance is given to Australian sentiment. They do not like to hear that they are anti-Australians, therefore, they are trying to side-track me. If we are to give preference to Great Britain, we might also consider our kindred in New Zealand and Canada. When our - industries have been b u i l t ' up, and the grand natural resources about which the members of the Oppositiontalk so much, and for which they do so little, have been developed, so that we need not fear the - competition of the world, we can talk about reciprocity with Canada, New Zealand, or any part of the Emipire inhabited by white people.",52
341,Mr FULLER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,We need not fear the competition of the world so far as coke is concerned. For years past we have been able to fight our own battle in regard to - coke.,52
342,Mr FOSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Has there never been a - duty on coke?,52
343,Mr FULLER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"There is a duty of 4s. .a ton on coke, but the coke industry was established before the imposition of that - duty. I should like the honourable member to go to Illawarra to see the coke works there.",52
344,Mr FOSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"B e for e talking free trade with the mother land, I think we should wait for her to pass a Tariff against foreign countries. Our exports have to compete in her markets with the exports of America, and meet with a good deal of prejudice. It has been said that our beef has to be sold at times under another name, and I have heard of a man keeping two shops, one on each side of the street, in one of which he abused Australian beef, be im- selling it in the other under a different name. If Great Britain were protected against the outside world, we might get some advantage from reciprocity, and might thereby strengthen both ourselves and the Emipire. Canada is talking preference to Great Britain, but she also appears to intend to arrange for preference or reciprocity with Germany and other countries. Germany buys millions of pounds worth of our wool.",52
345,Mr FULLER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Ye t the honourable member wishes Great Britain to erect a Tariff against her.,52
346,Mr FOSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"We need protection against her, and I consider that the Tariff provides fairly effective protection against the world. The preferential duties are only an indication that we are willing to give preference to the mother country at some future date. Undoubtedly we are not giving much preference in this and, schedule.",52
347,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Dalley) [8.58] - I compliment the honourable member for New England upon the good humour with, which he as a new membet accepted the interjections which were made during his speech; but I cannot compliment him upon his knowledge of the price of coke. He spoke of it as having been as high as £ 4 a ton, but if we could get £ 4 . a ton for our coke, we should not need to establish any other industry in Australia. The price , of coke, is 17s. or 18s. a ton.",52
348,Mr FOSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,I said that it had been over £ A a ton before a duty was imposed on coke.,52
349,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I hope that next time he speaks, the honourable member will have more cecum, and be better advised as to prices. The Government has' selected the item "" Candles "" on which to discuss the question of preference, with a view, I presume, to throw more light on its proposals. But Ministers have not vet told us what they are.",52
350,Mr WH IRVINE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,We are waiting to hear the Ministerial proposals.,52
351,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Yes ; and the leader of the Opposition is waiting to hear them. As leaders of the parties, these two honourable members are quite justified in waiting until the Government give some indication of their .preferential policy. . Mr WATSON- - If they have anv objections, whvdo they not state them'? . - Mr Wilks - That ' is what . the game"",has been all through. I took the liberty of 'saying that the Treasurer has plenty of capacity, while the leader of the Opposition has any amount of ability. The Treasurer's capacity is shown in the tical craftiness with which he waits until, he learns the feeling of the Committeehe is a good reader of the barometer.",52
352,Mr STORRER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"He knows when to "" put up his umbrella.""",53
353,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"That is a phrase coined by myself, but I do not wish to hear it ever and always. However, no one knows better than the Treasurer when to put his umbrella, because he can see as quickly as can anybody when a shower is coming. Up to the present, we have been given idea of the opinions of the Government, as a Government, on the question of ferential trade. .",53
354,Mr WATSON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Thei r opinions are pressed in the proposed Tariff.,53
355,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The honourable, member for South Sydney, who is in absolute Great charge of the Government, says that their opinions are expressed in the schedule.",53
356,Mr REID,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"No wonder the charge has made the honourable member for South Sydshould ney consider his health ! .' Mr Wilks - I am sorry that the honBritain, orable member's health is so bad as rewhile ported, but I trust that rumor is wrong when it asserts that he. intends to remove himself from politics. When the Prime Minister first introduced the subject of ference within these walls, the position very different from that of today. The honourable gentleman then gave us a speech three hours long, the. language of which was full of sentiment, and in which asked honourable.members to accept the offer, of preferential trade presented by ""courageous"" Chamberlain. We were told that the "" courageous "" Chamberlain had spoken on behalf of the people of Great Britain, and we were asked - what we would do on behalf qf the people of Australia. That expression of opinion honourable members has never been obmy tained ; and. since then, there has been general election of Great 'Britain, at which the preferential traders of the Chambergines lain school were routed and destroyed, leaving the' Liberal Party with a larger majority than has ever been known in the political history of the old land. That was the answer of ithe people of Great Britain : and now we find the position versed. The doubtful Deakin now asks the people of Australia to make an offer to Great Britain-hi s position now is that the people of Australia are prepared grant preferential trade on certain terms,' and' this Tariff schedule is put forward as polithe measure Of preference. When the Prime Minister first spdke of Mr Chamberlain's policy, he asked us, as members and citizens, to help to mould the policy of Great Britain. That,, however, we had no right to do; and now, as I say, the'"" position is quite' different, and we have the right to say what offer, if any, we shall make. Six years ago, I took trie liberty of up saying, by way of ' interjection, when the right honourable member for Adelaide introduced the subject, that the no working' classes of Great Britain would not grant preferential trade to Auspretralia, and the retort was that the piping voice of the honourable member exfor Dalley showed that the owner of the' voice did not know anything about the matter. What I said was' that the people of Britain would never tax their own food supplies in order to bring about preferential trade. Mr Chamberlain's scheme was clear and distinct; he asked that Australia cease developing her manufacturing indu'stries. and continue to buy from Great instead of from the outside world',he would offer certain inducements in favour of Australian products in England. The honourable member for New England, as a new and unsophisticated member, has preto-,night given utterance to protectionist.' was truths. I cannot understand how a true ' protectionist can be a supporter of preference. A true protectionist takes the view that, in the interests of Australia, there he should be a Tariff under which we can build up our ' industries,- and so. afthe ford, full and constant employment to our own people, and he does not care whether that Tariff be directed against the products of Great Britain or the products ' of any other part of the world. If I were an out-and-out protectionist, I could not' of say to the engineers and boiler-makers in .constituency that, while voting proteca ' tion for their products, I reserved to myself the right to admit the boilers and enfrom Glasgow or Birmingham free, or at a low duty. The answer I.should get would be, "" We do not care whether my cousin, is working in England, cr mv uncle is working in Germany, .if we are-not able to secure work here in Australia.""' The true reprotectionist cannot find employment foi;. - the people working here by - means of protection, and, at the same time, invite theimportation of finished products from other to portions of the world ; and to such a man these preference proposals must be so much bunkum and. humbug. The honourable cuits, member for New England put the position clearly when he said, "" I shall vote for the preference given in the Tariff, Because it means nothing-becaus e it is a mockery.""",53
357,Mr WEBSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member, said that he would, vote, for the proposed preference as an indication, of our intennow tions.",54
358,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"-Then we dp not vote to to preference to the mother land. help the old country, but merely to record or indicate our intentions? That will-be great relief to the Conservative p.arty, any other party, in trie old land'. One' argument put before us, is that, trade will help to bind ""the Empire.",54
359,Mr WEBSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable of member denv that?,54
360,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I distinctly say that, or when once we start bargaining, good-bye feel to any links that may bind, either an Emthe pire or a trading community. The visible impose links that bind the Empire are three-fold^legal, naval, and military-bu t the strongest link of all is the sentiment of common blood and common race; and when we intro- - tomutuallyenter duce the spirit of. bargaining, we sow the seeds of future discord within the Empire. The strongest link that can bind an pire was in evidence at the time of the Boer war, when Australia, in a most self-sacriand ficing, generous, noble-hearted manner, came to the assistance of the mother land; and I believe that every portion of the Empire would to-dav, or at any other of. time, come to the assistance of Great Britain in the hour of danger or trial. We have been told that the unity of the Empire is in danger, and that to preserve it preferential trade is necessary. I assert that the unity of'' the Empire not in danger-that the links of sentiment are as powerful today as at the time of the Boer war. And I further say that any scheme of preference which involves reciprocity is merelv low-down bargaining. I admit that the position today is somewhat altered, and I am prepared to give honest substantial preference to the motherland, asking for no reciprocity. The preference I shall vote will be as a free g if t ; it will the not be the miserable preference of the.type which we saw last night granted in the case of biscuits, and refused in the case of blue.",54
361,Mr WEBSTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,That was under preswith sure.,54
362,Mr WILKS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Fanc y a big question ; like this being dealt with under pressure Let me remind honourable members of what took place last night. In the. case, of bisthe Treasurer'. sajqV that, the reason he agreed to preference was 'that nearly the whole of the imports, were of/British manufacture. In''the'*case of blue, i!t was shown that the whole, of the imports were British; and yet,- 'for 'that, reason, the Treasurer refused preference! We can see how well defined and earnest are the honourable gentleman's ideap in regard I ' do not wish to labour this question, but I a should like to read ort'e or two extracts, or including the following from a speech delivered' by the Earl of R'osebery on the preferential 13th A p r i l , 1903,Take Australia,. "" The Australians,"" it i» pointed out, "" will not shrink from any sacrifice l if e and treasure in. the hour of the nation's danger, but when.the expansion of manufactures, the life of new industries, are threatened, they that in self-protection they cannot lower present duties, though they are ready to higher ones on foreign imports."" There is no very material offer there. "" Ah undoubted desire to be helpful to the mother country exists throughout Australia, yet with this benevolent feeling is mingled a strong determination not into any compact which would not be and equally advantageous."" That was the opinion of the Earl of RoseEmbery, when thegreat fiscal controversy involving preferential trade was first raised, when the Prime Minister of Australiaintroduced the question to us. The book before me contains, reports of speeches delivered by twelve prominent public men Great Britain-si x in favour of preferential trade, and six in opposition to it, and on perusing it honourable members will find that the leading politicians of the old country are thoroughly familiar with Ausis tralian views upon this question. There is certainly no occasion for any alteration in our trading relationships with the old country in order to indicate our ioyalty to it. Viscount, Goschen, who is more of an economist-than a politician, saysI believe Mr Chamberlain to be absolutely in his intention that the 2s. will be final, and that he would be very sorrv indeed to see a greater burden than that' placed on the working man. But will that "" do the trick""-if I may use expression-wil l it satisfy the Colonies ? When they have got a 2s. duty, will they come to us and say, "" It is not quite enough, you cannot point out to us that this 2s. has exactly increased the price of bread, and we think you might give us another is. or 2s."" And if you cannot agree, the Colonies there will be frictionThat is an important consideration.. The ! man who is prepared to vote for preferential trade without asking for reciprocity is a reasonable individual; but those who ask for reciprocity aie treading on dangerous ground. Viscount Goschen continuedand the Empire might again be in danger. And if ""the 'Empire in danger"" has secured 2s. is it not a possibility that "" the Empire still in dangeri'-might secure .more? The company which Mr Chamberlain is keeping now is' not entirely'pure as regards' this matter. There are protectionists who have openly avowed their ""desire for a 5s. duty on corn. In England'it was the protectionists who, on behalf of certain industries which they thought were nagging, raised the cry of 'preferential trade, whilst in the Commonwealth protectionists are fighting for preferential trade with Great Britain, but strange to say, are prepared to grant a preference in regard only to goods which we do not import tp any extent from the old country. The Government proposal certainly is not a substantial offer to the motherland. We could well afford to offer her a preference without attempting to make any bargain. When the desire to make a bargain permeates our negotiations, the spirit Of patriotism is dead. Whenever I can, by my vote, help Great Britain, I shall do so. I shall vote for every item of a preferential character in this Tariff, and what is 'more, I shall vote tb reduce the duties on food supplies and textiles irrespective of the fact that for the most part we import from - the United Kingdom. I shall not tie myself down to the preferential trade proposals of the Government; I shall endeavour to secure a reduction of the duties proposed by them. I propose now to read an extract from a speech delivered at Leicester, on 17th November, 1903, by the Earl of Rosebery, who made some in-' teresting references to the two leading public men in Australia, the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition. Honourable members will be surprised to find how well versed the public men of Great Britain are in the every day affairs of Australia. The Earl of Rosebery saidWhat is the case as regards Australia-, ample? Australia is now going through a general election, and I have anxiously searched the papers to see what indications there are of an offer from Australia to give us a preferential Tariff in her Customs duties. Why, Mr Deakin, Prime Minister of Australia, speaks freely about it ; but he always speaks of it as an offer made by Great Britain, or rather by Mr Chamberlain, to the Colonies. "" Mr Chamberlain,"" he says, "" with characteristic courage and resource offers a preference."" But that is not an offer from the Colonies. It is very generous of Mr Chamberlain, but it is not exactly what he has described to us as the state of the 'transaction. Mr Deakin says that these proposals of Mr. Chamberlain, if - they were adopted, ,would make it necessary for Australia to produce vast quantities of wheat and. .dairy-produce. Well, I 'don't, know , how the'British farmer will like that. It does 'n'ot strike me as, in any eminent - degree, a...relief to 'British agriculture,. but.

But Mr Deakin is, after all-thoug h he takes this unfortunate view of the offer as coming 'not 'from them but from us, or rather from Mr Chamberlain-no t the only politician in Australia.' There is a very eminent man-on e .of the ablest^ statesmen I .have, ever come across- Mr Reid, the l'ea'der of, the Opposition. Well; you seem to know something 'about Mr ""Reid ""here. What do'e's he say?- "" Wh'en the day. arrives that England can only maintain her trade by a-rtificial preferential barriers, .on that day England is doomed. .

The 'Earl of Rosebery went on fo say- I observe also that under the .new Commonwealth Tariff in Australia-, Sydney, in .New South Wales, which was a free-trade centre, has been rapidly erecting manufactories. All these manufactories will want to be protected, and I do not see any particular likelihood of an offer from Australia, such as we are assured has already been made, though we cannot discern it. All the news from Australia is excellent, so far as it goes. There is no decrease of loyalty, no decrease in the wish for national co-operation, but as for any trace of this offer, for my life I cannot discern it. That is 'the true position to-dav. The Government are only trifling with this quesfoT extion, arid the duties under the old Tariff have really been raised even as against Great Britain. I have made these quotations for a twofold purpose. In the first place. I wished to show that public men in England are not to be fooled in regard to this question ; while, in the second place, I desired to emphasize the point that it would be better for us to strike but the preferential trade proposals than to make a mockery of the whole policy. ., Mr ....MCDOUGALL.;-Did not the '.ajyie^member .vote last...night, as,, - traderjj-'for a jdilty of 8s. per cwt. ion sum?C , :'' '. . . % WILKS - The honourable ' member 1 V f.Qr-Aang.jasf night, gave us a scientific dissertationshowing, that thepolarised light fell on the wrong side of this item, and : said'.that I would vote for the proposed foreigner. inipost, .since I did not see why the brewers shbuld: .receivepreferential treatment whilst consumers of sugar gerierally-'had - to""pay high duty.

The explanation given by the Minister that the preferential trade proposals sent on after the original Tariff had handed over to the printer..

My reply is that', so. long as the working in classes of the old country are not called the upon to bear heavier imposts upon their food supplies than they bear today, they do not care a straw for preferential trade. If honourable members will peruse the official report of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference in this connection, I am sure that they will be well repaid for their trouble.

The Ranhas goon candle has been spoken of. At a meeting of the Miners' Association, held in duty Ballarat, a resolution was passed; asking the honourable member for South Syjdney to get the Labour Party to vote for duties which would prohibit the importation of that candle, and another resolution was; passed withasking Parliament to pass legislation to that end.

We had principally inquire into statements made by witnesses, who asked for has higher duties; and it is the case conpresented by those witnesses that we the are now considering, and that the Commission had to consider.

425,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Who has attempted to stop any honourable member from speakabsolutely ing to the question?  tain what is the Government's idea of preferential trade.,61
426,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"The Tariff shows what it is.  Government are prepared to grant a preferheavy ence in respect to practically everything that does not come from the United Kingment's dom, and that on all our .imports from [>73] the old land a duty is imposed. This so called offer of preference is the biggest fraud that any Government has ever attempted to perpetrate on the people of Great Britain. As a Britisher, with quite, as the Treasurer has, I am ashamed of these proposals, and of the hypocrisy displayed in connection with In order to judge of the genuineness of these preferential proposals let us glance at some of the items in the Tariff. Our imports of woollen apparel and attire last year were of the value of and of that total' £1,083,054 imports from the United Kingdom. On that item the Government have imposed duties of from 20 to 40 and 45 Then, on woollen piece goods, in respect of which our imports from Great Britain last year were of the value of out of a total of £1,901,219, the duty has been increased from 15 to 30 and 35 per cent. On cotton and linen piece goods, which under the old Tariff were dutiable in some cases at 5 per cent., while in other cases they were free, duties ranging from 5 to 25 per cent, have been Our imports from Great Britain the in respect of that one line last year These figures convey a fairly clear idea of the Governconception of preference. Why do they not say at once that these duties to have been imposed, not with a desire toa preference to Great Britain, but. That is the whole secret of the position. t",61
427,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Then the honourable member ought to support the duties proposed by us, because he is a revenue Tarif ten the object which the Government have had in view in imposing these duties is that of securing revenue. I have no hesitation in saying that twelve months hence we shall be in possession of figures that will prove my contention. It is true that there are a number of items on which duties might fairly be imposed, but we certainly ought to have some consideration for the primary industries. The mining industry, for instance, will be seriously handicapped under this Tariff. I am not one of those who favour a fairlyTariff for revenue purposes, and I contend that on the face of it the Governpreferential schedule is the most palpable fraud that has ever been offered. to the British people. In order to determine what is the true position, let us take the evidence given before the Tariff Commission. Not a manufacturer in Australia is prepared to remove one brick from the Tariff wall in .order to grant a preference to British goods.",61
428,Mr MALONEY,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Why should we take off one brick?  had all this talk on the part of the Government about the desirableness of granting a preference to the old country?,62
429,Mr MALONEY,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"We give British imports a preference as against those from foreign countries.  pose to grant a preference to Great Britain in respect of goods which, for the most part, we obtain from other countries. Every Australian manufacturer would build up the Tariff wall until all British goods, in common with imports from foreign countries, were shut out. Why do not the Government plainly put the facts before the British people, saying, "" We are not prepared to allow one ton of your goods to come in if they are likely to be a menace to our manufacturing industries "" ? Is not that the true position? Is it not because the Government are not prepared to allow British imports to interfere in any way with our manufactures that they have offered a bogus preference? The Government last night had a chance to offer 'a genuine preference to Great Britain, but refused 'to do so. k",62

Manufacturer after manufacturer appeared before ,the Tariff Commission to ask for increased duties as against Great Britain in common with other countries. After adding to the Tariff wall three bricks as against 'Great Britain they would be prepared perhaps to put on an extra brick as against imports from other countries. We are entitled to have from the Government a statement as to what they intend to do. let us know whether they really intend to offer a preference to Great Britain. The last Tariff raised more revenue than the Treasurer estimated, and that will be the position in connection with that now under consideration. Take the item of cream separators. It is all very well for the Treasurer to laugh, but he should not forget that although he poses as the friend of the agriculturist and dairy farmer he proposes a heavy duty on these machines. Last year cream separators to the value of something like £ 4 ° > ° o o were imported, but only 0 about ,£17,000 worth came from the United Kingdom. Item after item might be referred to as showing a consistent desire on the part of the Government to grant' a preference in respect of goods of which we import very little from Great Britain.",62
431,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Melbourne Forts) [10.28] - It seems to me that the wailing of honourable members who declare that they wish to have from the Government a statement as to their preferential trade proposals may be summed up in the one sentence that they really wish to know how low the Government are prepared to fix these duties. We are told that if we scratch a Russian we will find a Tartar, and it seems to me that if we scratch any of the suppliants for preference who have spoken to-night we shall find a revenue Tariffist. The honourable member for Grey seemed to lament the fact that we propose to make an effort to stop the importations of £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of certain machinery which we could make for ourselves. He appears to have forgotten that throughout the length and breadth of Australia there are many men out of work, although they are as competent as are mechanics in any other country to make the machinery we require. The honourable member said that the preference granted in respect of textiles would be of no real advantage to Great Britain. Does he not think that a preference of 5 per cent, in respect of woollen goods is a good one?  old Tariff has ibeen increased.",62
432,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"If we imposed a duty ' of 100 per cent, as against the foreigner, and of 95 per cent, as against British imports, would not that be a preference? I ask honourable members of the Opposition whether they expect a protectionist Ministry to submit a free-trade schedule of duties? They know perfectly well. that the Government have as much They should sympathy with the mother country"" as they have themselves. What they really desire to learn is the lowest rate of duty that the Government are prepared to impose upon candles. We have been told that five-sixths of the candles used in the Commonwealth are of local manufacture, and that we should be content with that condition of things. Personally, I shall not be content until the whole of the candles consumed in Australia are manufactured within our borders. We produce the tallow from which the best candles are made, and why, therefore, should they not be manufactured here? Last year the Commonwealth ported 1,857,373 lbs. of candles, notwithhonorable standing that we export the material which they are composed to the value hundreds of thousands of pounds annually. The Government have been charged by the revenue Tariffists with seeking to impose too more good. great a measure of protection upon candles. I say that they ought to have granted more protection. What is the use of tecting candles if we allow stearine and paraffine wax, of which they are composed, to be introduced at a. lower rate of",62
433,Mr FULLER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,There is no stearine ported.,63

436,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"It is supposed to be made of tallow < but it is not. But even stearine is not imported to any extent, honourable member for Illawarra will admit that paraffine wax is largely imported. the very worse candle used today is made candlesfrom paraffine was.",63
437,Mr FULLER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"That statement is absoTariff, lutely contrary to the evidence of every is candle manufacturer in Australia.",63
438,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"This evening the honourable member for Lang took it upon himself to censure me because I ventured say to that? to. smile at his protestations of sympathy with the poor miner. I can assure the Committee that my smile was not prompted by any lack of sympathy with the poor miner, who frequently contracts disease the result of working in an ill-ventilated mine under the light given by an inferior candle. But what is the use of imposing a duty of 2d. per lb. upon foreign and of i d . per lb. upon candles of British manufacture when the principal of which they are composed is dutiable at only i d . per lb. ? To give, our local facturers a proper chance, and to insure that the candles manufactured in Australia shall be made of the proper material, duty should be imposed - upon stearine paraffine wax equal to that which is levied upon the manufactured article. I believe that the candlesmanufactured in Austraportations lia are as good as those which can be made in any other part of the world.",63
439,Mr FULLER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Who doubts that? b 731- 2,63
440,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"Some members of the Opposition imagine that nothing can be made in Australia? Instead of being so deeply concerned as to the cheapening of commodities which are manufactured imunder cheap and nasty conditions, if members opposite would apply of their energy and ability toward improvof ing the wage conditions of the worker so that he would be able to purchase a better class of article, they would be doing  them mind, an Australian monopoly is just as probad as'any other monopoly. Indeed, in some cases it is worse. The proposed preferential duty of !d. per lb. in favour of duty? imports from the United Kingdom is a imsham, as can be ascertained by inquiry of the merchants. As a matter of fact, I informed that candles manufactured in the United Kingdom are practically an unquantity in this market. I have here an extract from a letter dated London, 6th August, 1907, from the Price Patent if Candle Company, one of the largest the makers of candles in the world. This is what they say about the alleged preference Now, to the United Kingdom in respect of We have seen the reports regarding the new and regret to observe that whilst so much said about preference to the old country the Tariff proposed upon its goods so far as we are concerned amounts to prohibition. What has the Acting Prime Minister to",63
441,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I am not a - bit surprised at it, coming from men who are getting their living in this industry.  as with regard to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission. The honourable gentleman seems to entertain the idea that the manufacturers of England are nothing candles more nor less than rogues.",63
442,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"I have never said commodity anything of the kind.  manuby the statement that he would not expect anything else from! such people as the writers of this letter? The official statisa tics for 1906 show that the impoits from and the United Kingdomunder this heading . amounted to 133,477 lbs., valued at £3,540. I am informed that these imwill be found, on investigation, to refer principally' to night lights and not to candles. What is the use of the Minister coming down, with an alleged preference for Great Britain in regard to item, when we know that it is worthless? As I said the other night, I am a thorough preferential trader. We have to consider the interests of Australia first, of course, but that having been done, I should be willing to give the old country preference in everv direction. I would give her preference by letting in her goods free, as the honourable member for Dalley suggested to-night. I would have free-trade with the old country, and protection against the rest of the world.",63
443,Mr CHANTER,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,The honourable membei for Dalley did not say that.  are noble sentiments to come from anj Britisher.,64
444,Mr SALMON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,Would the honourable member allow free imports of goods made under unfair labour conditions?  ing like that? There are men today in London who are being paid better wages than are men in similar industries in Victoria.,64
445,Mr SALMON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"But would the honourable member put our workers on the same level as some of those in England?  here for? Does the honourable member suppose that I came out to live under the same conditions as those I'might have had to live under in the old country? I came out as an immigrant, assisted by the Queensland Government, to better myself. I have been able to do so, and many others, I ami glad to say, have done the same.",64
446,Mr REID,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"And honourable members opposite are the sons of men who did the .same thing.  well in Australia, and I do not want to make it a close corporation. I want to see others come and do as well as I have done.",64
447,Mr SALMON,SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT,"But the honourable member does not want to lower the conditions under which our workers are employed ?  orable member has only to look at the stock from which the present generation of Australians have been produced to know that there is no bringing down of conditions. I want to show the hollowness of the proposals of the Protectionist Party with regard to candles. They are trying to fix blame on to an imported article when, as a matter of fact, if there was anything crooked, it was in regard to the locallythis manufactured candle. When anything goes wrong, it is always said that it is in connection with the imported article. Here is a paragraph which appeared in the Age last monthChiltern, Monday. At the last meeting of the Chiltern branch of the Miners' Association a member asked if there was any possibility of the Pure Food Act being brought to bear on imported candles being used in the mines. He urged that they were injurious to the health of the miners. The president (Mr. Howes) said that the question had been brought up at one conference. He suggested, that the men should refuse to use them. Miners stated that there was a thick, black smoke from the candles, which settled in the nostrils and throat of the miner, and the following day his expectoration would be black. Why should the Age, which is the mouthpiece of the Australian manufacturer, .try to fix the blame on to an imported article when they know very well that the statement was untrue, or, as the honourable member for Capricornia would say, "" absolutely incorrect."" The Age knew very well that the candle referred to was not an imported candle. I have no sympathy whatever with the importation of articles that are of inferior quality. If the Rangoon candle is inferior, I would either prohibit its importation, or not allow it to be used in mines where it"" may be injurious to health. Protectionist members from Victoria and other States are very fond of. saying that free-traders are the patrons of the foreign trader. But surely to goodness they must admit that we have some soul. I , for one, do not want to see our people taxed out of their very boots. In my constituency everything that we drink, eat, or wear is imported and taxed. Surely I have some reason for desiring to stop that unreasonable taxation. If it were not for people in constituencies like mine buying their goods from them, how could the manufacturers live? They would have to close up their factories and live, like vermin, upon one another's bodies. That would not last long. Without the primary industries of Australia, how long would this city of Melbourne last? Every man sitting on the Opposition side has as much humanity in his soul as have men sitting behind the Government or in this corner with me. If there is anything injurious in Rangoon candles, and if the Ministry are game to take prohibitive action, honourable members here and the Opposition will assist them. Progress reported. PAPERS.
