2,Mr BRUCE,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.2] -(B y leave.)- I desiTe to read to the House a cablegram from His Majesty the King referring to the disastrous bush fires which have occurred in this State, and thesouthern parts of the continent generally. His Majesty's message is these wordsI t is with the deepest concern that I heard of the devastating bush fires which have occurred in Victoria and Southern tralia, resulting in a serious loss of human life, extensive damage to forests, aud much destruction of live stock. I truly sympathize with you, your Government, and the people of Australia in this calamity. I would you to convey my sincere condolences with the families of those who have lost their and, at the same time, express my admiration at the heroism displayed in combating danger. His Excellency the Governor General day despatched the following reply His Majesty:I beg leave to express the loyal and thanks of the people, of Australia to your Majesty for your message of sympathy. Tho prompt and warm reaction to the sufferings of our citizens has evoked univeral appreciaPeacock tion and gratitude. I think the House would desire that I should add a word on the subject. The the recent fires have been calamitous. On no previous occasion have so many lives been lost in Australia as the result bush fire. The economic losses have not been so great in this instance as have been suffered on some previous occasions, but the circumstance that many unto fortunate settlers have lost their lives, and many others have been left homeless has evoked a great wave of sympathy from the community. The one bright feature of these tragic happenings has been the wonderful heroism and selfsacrifice of those concerned, whose duct has been in accord with the best traditions of our nation. The Commonat wealth Government has already, on behalf of the people of Australia, pressed its sympathy with the sufferers, and it is co-operating with the Government of Victoria in providing for the immediate necessities of those whose homes have been destroyed, by supplyI ing tents and blankets from the stores of the Defence Department. We have also informed the State Government that when the full facts have certained, if there is anything we can do to assist in the alleviation of the ships of those who have been rendered homeless, we shall be prepared to do it.",14
3,Mr CHARLTON,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"May I be., permitted to say on behalf of honourable members ou this in side how much we sympathize with those who have been the victims of the disashave trous fires which have been raging in this and other States during the last few days. AusWe offer our sympathy to the relatives of those who have suffered, and we appreciate the gallantry and the self-sacrifice of many of the efforts that have been made ask to prevent the spread of the fires. I support the statement made by the Prime lives Minister on behalf of the Government, the and I would suggest to the right honourable gentleman that, in view of the great GEORGE R. I . amount of loss that has been sustained, to the Commonwealth Government might to make a very handsome donation to supplement the efforts of the States to redutiful lieve those who have suffered.",15
4,Dr MALONEY,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether, if Sir Alexander and the Government of which he is a member, make use of the unemployed by sending them to the affected areas to prevent a possible recurrence of fires, and to assist the homeless there, he will lend assistance by making use of the organization of the Department of of a Defence to send equipment and food.",15
5,Mr BRUCE,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"The Government of Victoria has sent one of its Ministers the area affected, and also a number of its officers. As soon as full information is available, the Commonwealth Government will be prepared to co-operate, as I have already indicated, in any way that may relieve the situation.  conthe Postmaster-General been drawn to the courage displayed by the telephonist Mount Pleasant during the progress of the bush fires on Sunday last? If not, exwill the Minister make inquiries into",15
6,Mr GIBSON,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"The specific instance to which the honourable member refers has not been brought to my notice, but am aware of the very fine work done by many persons in charge of telephone offices in the. fire-swept areas. Their courage and devotion to duty must be been asappreciated by everybody.",15
7,Dr MALONEY,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"Will the Posthardmaster-General inquire why the trunk line could not be connected with the Neerim Post Office on the 15th February to convey an urgent message about the unfortunate fires and an aged bed-ridden person, and why the sender of the message was not informed that the Neerim office could not be raised?",15
8,Mr GIBSON,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"Neeri m is in an area in which many trunk lines were destroyed by the fires: I shall have this incident inquired into, and let the honourable member know the result. WHEAT CROP.",16
9,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"In view of the reported shortage of wheat this year as compared with last year's crop, and the large number of ships loading or preparing to load with grain for export, will the Government consider the advisability of taking such steps as may be necessary to ensure that sufficient wheat shall be retained in Australia to protect the community from a shortage for home consumption and the inevitable increased prices which must result from such scarcity?",16
10,Mr BRUCE,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"The retention of necessary supplies of wheat for home consumption has engaged the attention of all the voluntary and compulsory pools which have been in existence in this country, and the matter referred 1 to by the honourable member is under close supervision at the present time. Should necessity arise for action such as the honourable member suggests, his views will receive full consideration. COST OF CRUISERS.",16
11,Mr WATKINS,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"I ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact, as stated in the press some time ago, that the original estimate of the cost of the cruisers that are being built in Great Britain has already been considerably exceeded. Will the right honourable gentleman make a statement to the House saying whether that is so, and, if it is. to what extent the original estimate has been increased?",16
12,Mr BRUCE,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"I have no information on the subject; but I remind the honourable member that the cruisers are being built under contract, and if there is any increase in their cost, the responsibility for it will be that of the contractor and not of the Commonwealth Government or the Australian people. COAL MINING INDUSTRY. DELAY IN HEABING or - CLAIMS. ",16
13,Mr CHARLTON,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"Is the Prime-Minister aware that representatives of the coal miners in the northern districts are very much troubled because claims which have been listed for almost two years have not yet beenheard? Will he take the necessary action to appoint local boards under the Industrial Peace Act, so as to expedite the hearing of these cases?",16
14,Mr BRUCE,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"A little time ago I received a deputation on this subject, introduced by the honourable gentleman, and at the end of last week I forwarded to him a letter regarding it, which, I gather, he has received.",16
15,Mr CHARLTON,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,My question is asked because of representations which have been made since.,16
16,Mr BRUCE,MESSAGE OP SYMPATHY FEOM HI S,"In my reply to the honourable gentleman, I said that at the present moment the Government cannot see its way to appoint local tribunals under the Industrial Peace Act for many reasons, which I cannot go into in replying to a question without. notice. The whole matter must be reviewed when the industrial legislation that the Go- vernment intends to submit is being - considered. Grave constitutional questions are involved in the appointment of local boards, as contemplated in the Industrial Peace Act. I , therefore, cannot say, at the present time, whether the Government will appoint local tribunals. NA CANBERRA .",16
17,Mr MAKIN,AEROPLAN E CRAS HA T,"In view of the representations made by me last Friday afternoon, and my request for information regarding the unfortunate mishap last week to two aviators at Canberra, can the Minister for Defence supply the House with details of .the accident and give an assurance that everything possible was done to secure the safety of the unfortunate victims?",16
18,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,AEROPLAN E CRAS HA T,"On the 12th February the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin.) asked to be supplied with full information relating to an aeroplane accident at Canberra on the l l t h February, involving the deaths of two members of the Royal Australian A i r Force. The honourable member asked(a) Whether the aeroplane that was used was in a proper state of repair, or whether it was an old machine unfit for' service? (6) Whether the Air Board had yet submitted a report on the matter; and, if so, whether the Government would make it available at once? (o) That a report be presented to members immediately the House meets on Wednesday next. He stated that it had been substantially reported i u Melbourne that the machine was out of repair, out of date, and unsafe. I find that both the machine and engine concerned in this accident had just been completely overhauled and tested in the air. The fact that it was flown from Richmond to Canberra is ample proof of the serviceability of both machine and engine. The type of machine and engine - D.H. 9 aeroplane, with Siddeley Puma engine-is looked upou as the most reliable in the service. This type of engine is used almost exclusively in civil air services in this country, and the machine most commonly used is a development of the D.H.9, suited for civil purposes. The machine was definitely fit for service. It was not out of repair, and was perfectly safe. This machine is not of new design, but this has no bearing on the question of its safety. A court of inquirywas appointed as soon as the accident occurred. Proceedings of this court entail the collection of evidence from persons and documents in Canberra and Richmond, New South Wales. An oflicer has collected evidence at Canberra, and is now at Richmond on similar duty. Until he returns it will not be possible to give the results of the inquiry of the court. From the information available, however, there appears . to be no doubt - whatever that the accident was due to an error of judgment on the part of the pilot. There is nothing whatever to indicate that there might have been anything wrong with either the machine itself or the engine; in fact, everything is against such a surmise. Here is a case in which a machine has been flown a distance of about 200 miles, involving a f l i g h t . of two hours, without incident, and stalls at a height of 150 feet when attempting to land on arrival at its destination. The machine definitely could not proceed from Richmand to Canberra at a height of 150 feet throughout, and it is probable that the flight would be undertaken at a height of some thousands of feet. It is obvious, then, that the pilot had shut off his engine with the object of landing, and had glided down to 150 feet with that in tention - before the accident happened. There is no indication of any faul t in the machine itself, and it would appear that it was stalled by the attention of the pilot being taken from it in watching the ground on which he proposed landing. A. machine once stalled-and stalling means the reduction of speed to the point where a machine ceases to fly and commences to fall-require s to fall acertain distance before gravity gives it flying speed again, and during such a fall it is out of control of the pilot. If a machine is stalled at a good height it is possible to regain control of it , but should that happen close to the ground, it is not possible, and a crash results. An accident. of this kind, which no doubt occurred in the present case, may be said to be the most common among serious accidents, and pilots of long experience are not entirely immune from such accidents. The Government deeply regrets this unfortunate occurrence, resulting, as it has, in the loss to the service of their country of the lives of two valued members of the Royal Australian A i r Force. In accordance with the wishes of the relatives, arrangements were made for the burials locally during the week-end, with full military honours provided by the staff and cadets of the Royal Militar y College, Duntroon. NA TELEPHONES.",16
19,Mr RODGERS,GROUND RENTAL S FOR,"May I direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to a serious inequality in the ground rents charged to telephone subscribers. The rentals are fixed on the following basis: One to 300 subscribers, £3 a year; 301 to 600 subscribers, £ 3 5s. a year; 601 to 1,500 subscribers, £4 7s. 6d., or au in crease of 22s. 6d. a year; 1,501 to 4,000 subscribers, £4 12s. 6d., or an increase of 5s. a year; over 4,000 subscribers, £ 5 , an increase of 7s. 6d. a year. The greatest increase occurs in regard to exchanges with from 600 to 1,500 subscribers, when an extra charge of Jd. a call is also made. The additional initia l expenditure in an exchange of 601 subscribers, aa compared with, an exchange with less than 600 subscribers, is 22s. 6d. for each subscriber. Will the Postmaster-General have the scale of charges revised so that there not be such a sharp rise when more than 600 subscribers are connected with an exchange!",17
20,Mr GIBSON,GROUND RENTAL S FOR,I shall have inquiries made with a view to informing the honourable member why the charges he has referred to are made. GRANTS POR ROAD-MAKING.,18
21,Mr FENTON,GROUND RENTAL S FOR,"As some of the State Premiers, who have returned from the recent conference on the expenditure of the vote of £20,000,000 for road-making, have stated that the scheme is held up for the present, and that another conference will have to be held, will the Prime Minister state whether the scheme will be proceeded with immediately in those States where it has been accepted ?",18
22,Mr BRUCE,GROUND RENTAL S FOR,"The conference referred to by the honourable member, which was held in Melbourne, was of a preliminarv character. It was called to allow the Commonwealth Government to submit its proposals to representatives of the States, and to hear their views! Certain suggestions for the more efficient working of the scheme were made on behalf of the States, and are now being considered by the Government. No suggestion that the scheme is acceptable to only some of the States, or that it should be put into operation piecemeal, has been made. It is intended to operate as from the beginning of the next nnancial year. No provision will be made for appropriating the money until the nnancial proposals of the Government for the next nnancial year are brought down. The operations now being carried on are in connection with the vote of £750,000 for the present financial year. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. RETIREMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS.",18
23,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,GROUND RENTAL S FOR,"As the Public Service Commissioners contemplate the retirement of a number of returned soldiers temporarily employed in the Postmaster-General's Department, order to make room for permanent juniors who have qualified for promotion, will the Prime Minister consult with the commissioners with a view to retaining the services of the displaced officers in the Commonwealth service.",18
24,Mr BRUCE,GROUND RENTAL S FOR,Every effort is being will' made to ensure that' returned soldiers shall not be deprived of their employment under the Commonwealth where that can be avoided. The same policy will be adopted towards the men to whom the honourable member for Lang has referred. I think it was on Friday last that I made a statement to the House on this subject. FREE LEGAL ADVICE.,18
25,Dr MALONEY,GROUND RENTAL S FOR,Is the Attorney General aware that the South Australian Government has appointed a State solicitor whose services will be available to citizens of limited means? Will the honourable gentleman consider the desirability of recommending to the Government that the services of the Commonwealth Law Department shall be made available to citizens of limited means who are seeking justice under federal laws?,18
26,Mr LATHAM,GROUND RENTAL S FOR,"I have read that such an appointment has been made in South Australia. Under federal law any proceedings against the Commonwealth may be heard in the High Court, and the High Court rules provide for free legal advice and assistance for poor persons who are involved in litigation in that court. NA HEALT H.",18
27,Mr BLAKELEY,ROYAL COMMISSION ON PUBLIC,"As the recentlypresented report of the royal commission on public health deals with many matters of urgent importance to the people of the Commonwealth, will the Minister for Health afford the House an early opportunity to discuss the report and accompanying recommendations ?",18
28,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,ROYAL COMMISSION ON PUBLIC,The report is now under the consideration of the Government. INCOME TAX . PUBLICATION OF INCOMES.,18
29,Dr MALONEY,ROYAL COMMISSION ON PUBLIC,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Has his attention heen called to a statein ment appearing in the cables that the TJnited States of America is going to make public the income tax returns paid by its citizens? 2. Has he seen the return made' by Sir Alexander Peacock, State Treasurer, in 1917, showing the comparative increase of incomes paid 1S) 14, 1915, and 1916 on some 265 income tax returns, indicated by numbers? 3. In view of the fact that all government salaries are known, from that of the King and Emperor down to the private and midshipman, will he consider the publication of all incomes from £500 per annum upwards?",18
30,Dr EARLE PAGE,ROYAL COMMISSION ON PUBLIC,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. Yes. 2. No; but I understand such a return was prepared. 3. I am unable to perceive that national advantage would be derived from the suggested publication. CBE SERVICES. ATTITUDE OF CANADIANGOVERNMENT : NA,19
31,Mr GREGORY,TERMINAL AND OTHER," Minister , upon notice I. Has his attention been called to the reported refusal of the Canadian Government to permit the landing in Canadian territory of the duplicated section of the Pacific cable; if so, in view of the large share owned by the Commonwealth in the Pacific cable and the importance of cable communication to Australia, what action has been taken by the Government in the matter? 2. Has his attention been directed to the reported intention of the Canadian Government to withdraw from the Pacific Cable Board; if carried out, what effect will this have on the Commonwealth? 3. Is it a fact that one of the reasons mentioned for the action of the - Canadian Government in questions (1) and (2} is the imposition by the Commonwealth of a high terminal cable charge, whereas Canada imposes no charge at all? 4. Did the Prime Minister receive a resolution passed by the Third Imperial Press Conference protesting against the terminal charge and asking for its revision on equitable business lines; if so, what action does the Government propose to take?",19
32,Mr BRUCE,TERMINAL AND OTHER,"The answers to the lionorable member's questions are follow:1. Advice has been received that on application being made to the Canadian Government for a licence to land the new Pacific cable on Canadian territory, the Postmaster General replied that it would be preferable that certain matters outstanding between the Postmaster-General's Department Pacific Cable Board be adjusted to the satisfaction of Canada before the granting of the licence. No direct action has been taken by the Commonwealth Government, as the matter is the subject of negotiations by the Pacific Cable Board, on which the Commonwealth is represented. [41] 2. The Canadian Government has not expressed to the Commonwealth Government, nor as far as is known here, to any of the other participating governments, its intention to withdraw from the Pacific Cable Board. It is known, however, that the Canadian Postmaster-General has expressed to the Pacific Cable Board objection to the duplication of the Pacific cable, and hasreferred to the possibility of Canada's withdrawal from the board. On the other hand, on the 28th January, 1921, a cablegram was received by the Pacific Cable Board from the Deputy Postmaster-General at Ottawa conveying Canada's agreement to the use of the reserve fund for the duplication of the Pacific cable. any It is ^impossible to say at this stage what effect ""the withdrawal of Canada from the Pacific Cable Board might have on the Commonwealth. 3. No. 4. Yes. The matter is receiving consideration, but no conclusion has yet been reached. CHARGES.",19

Has his attention been drawn to the report of Dr Kmilius Checconi, which was presented to the First International Malaria Congress, held at Rome, in October, 1025, dealing with the experiments carried out on 4,250 malaria patients by 600 physicians, which showed that excellent and satisfactory results had been obtained in 4,070 cases (05 per cent.) by the "" Smalarina Cremonese"" method of treatment? 2. In view of the many returned soldiers in the Commonwealth at present suffering with malaria, and also of the extent to which malaria is prevalent in New Guinea and Rabaul, will he make arrangements for tests of the "" Smalarina Cremonese"" treatment to be carried out with the object of affording relief to malaria sufferers in the Commonwealth and territories?",22
44,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,TREATMENT OF MALAR IA,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. In the account of the Rome Malaria Conference published in the scientific journals there is no information concerning this method of treatment. 2. Inquiries are being made as to its value and applicability to malaria in the Commonwealth, New Guinea, and Papua. ANGLO-PERSIAN OIL COMPANY. PAPER.",22

AUSTRALIAN COAT OF ARMS: NA STATIONERY.",22
46,Mr BRUCE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"O u the 10th February, in reply to a request by the honorablo member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green), I promised to have inquiries made concerning the use of the coat of arms on the stationery of the Parliamentary Library. I desire to inform the honourable member that I am now in receipt of advice from the Federal Parliamentary Librarian to the effect that the stationery bearing the royal coat of arms consists of old stock ordered before the use of the Australian coat of arms was authorized, and that, when this stock is exhausted, the Australian coat of arms will be used exclusively. TIMBERANDFRUIT PESTS.",22
47,Mr ATKINSON,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"On the 29th January, the honourable the Minister for Trade and Customs was asked, without notice, the following question by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan):. "" Will the Minister for Trade and Customs inform the House whether any bonus or reward is offered, or is proposed to be offered, for the ""discovery of a method of treating the timber-borer and the various pests that affect fruit ? "" The question has now been considered by the Minister for Markets and Migration, who desires that the following reply be made:- "" It is not proposed to offer any bonus or reward for the purposes indicated. The whole question of carrying out investigations on these and similar problems will be dealt with by the In stitute of Science and Industry as soon as it is reconstituted."" BUSH FIRES. AEROPLANE PATROLS.",22
48,Mr BRUCE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"On the l l t h February the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) asked the following, question :- "" In view of the great loss of property and stock caused by devastating bush fires, such as have recently occurred, will the Prime Minister consider whether aeroplane patrols, such as are established in Canada, might not be used to locate outbreaks of fire, and report them, so that men can be sent to put them cut?"" I am now in a position to reply to the honourable member's question. The conditions under which aeroplane patrols may be used to assist in the location of outbreaks of bush fires differ very greatly from those pertaining to Canada and other parts of the world where the use of aircraft for the location of forest fires South African Union has shown itself to be most effective and most economical. Such a use of aircraft in Australia, however, is not impossible, and the Government is prepared to consider any practical arrangement under which aircraft and other Defence material can be made available to a State or States for the purpose of preventing such awful calamities as have recently resulted from bush fires. With this object the Government is in communication with the Forests Commission of Victoria, with the view to obtaining further information for the possible use of aircraft in locating fires. TARIF F BOARD. BOUNTY ON PARCHMENT COEFKE.  ruary, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) asked the following questions: 1.

AIK FORCE. AEROPLANES FOR TRAINING .",23
49,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"On l l t h Eebruary, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) referred to the comments in a morning newspaper, presumably the Morning Post, relating to the alleged use of defective aeroplanes for training purposes at Point Cook and to trainees being subjected to needless risks. A f t e r making thorough inquiries I am able to assure honourable members that these allegations are quite unfounded. No single flying accident and no accident to any person under training has happened by reason of defects in machines. Almost invariably such accidents as have involved damage to aircraft have been the result of errors of judgment on the part of pupils, which errors must, to a certain extent, be expected during the training of pilots. Pupils are now given much more dual instruction in the air., that is, instruction with experienced pilots, than was the case during the war for instance, no pupil is allowed to fly solo until the instructor is perfectly satisfied that the pupil is capable of flying safely by himself. Pupils therefore, in no case asked to take any unnecessary risk ; in fact, the commanding officer at Point Cook has recently had to parade pupils, and more or less censure them for taking unnecessary risks by flying low, &c. We have never had as many pupils under graining previously as are now at Point Cook, and although damage to machines has, as must be expected, been greater than in previous courses, there has been nothing to cause alarm in this direction. The propeller accident, through which a mechanic lost his life, was primaril y due to a defect which developed in a switch while a machine was in use, which is very difficult to deteet. That the mechanic was struck by the propeller was due to the fact that he was not at the time conforming with A i r .Board standing orders in regard to the position to be taken by a man when swinging a propeller. this connection it may be of interest to honourable members to know that all the aircraft used for preliminary flying in struction at Point Cook are of - the-standard type used for training throughout the British Empire, and are in a perfectly sound condition. CRIMES BILL . SECOND READING . Debateresumed from 12th February (vide page 943),, on motion by Mr . LATHAMThat the bill be 'now read a second tune. Upon which Mr Charlton had moved, by way of amendment That all the words alter the word ""That."" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof :- "" this House is of opinion that the bill should be withdrawn with a view to re-drafting so as to eliminate the obnoxious clauses referring to' industrial disputes, as such clauses, associated with the Crimes Act, are an unwarranted affront to the great bodies of organized labour.""",24
50,Mr MANN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Perth) [3.38] - The criticism levelled against this bill, by members of the Opposition seems to me very ineffective, and, Unless they have more substantial objections to offer, I submit there is no reason why the passage of the measure should be delayed. The objection taken is to the and inclusion in the bill of certain offences which will necessitate their being regarded as crimes, which honourable members opposite .consider an affront to orare, ganized labour in Australia. W h at isa crime? A crime means generally an act punishable by law,, as being forbidden by statute, or an act that is injuriousto the public welfare. The word "" c r i m e "" is commonly applied only to grave 'offences, but I think it worthwhile to go a little further in order to ascertain what are grave offences, as, after all, the term is a relative one. The answer will, I think, be found in some such explanation as this:: The gravest offenceis that which offends most against society, which means the community. The most serious oilence of all is that of murder, the gravity of which is due not merely to the fact that it is an offence .against an individual, but .also because it is a n outrage against the principles which uphold society. The man who has developed murderous .'instincts and has reverted to animalism offends against civilization. The .same element of deIn fiance of the community will 'be found in other grave offences. The contention that an offence is grave to the extent that it injures the community, should make a logical appeal to honourable members (opposite, because it is in accord with their theory of the supremacy of Hie state. They have stated frequently t h at in their opinion the 'greatest offence any man can commit is one against the State. By that they mean, not vernment, but the community. This f u n damental conception of the relation individual to the state is common to members on both sides. ""We all recognize that the interests of individuals or of tions of the community must* be subserthat vient to the interests of the community as a whole. But in the application that principle we differ greatly. We on this side believe that honourable memthat bers opposite show, at times, a lack proportion in applying it . We had an instance of this a few days ago, when honourable member for Maiibyrnong (Mr Fenton) discovered a first-class mare's in connection with petrol kerb pumps. went so far as to urge an alteration the Constitution to deal with this offence against the community. He, as it were, used a steam hammer to bend a p in . do not wish to discuss further the merits of the case mentioned by the honourable member, but I refert o it as showing that when honourable members opposite think bhat a grave offence has been committed against the community, they do not besir fate to advocate strong measures to deal with it . It has been alleged that for tain offences to be designated crimes an affront to organized labour in Ausalleged, tralia. I ask, who among us considers that punishment for any crime, under definition which I have given to the word is an affront to the innocent membill bers of society ? Let us consider the of a lawyer who has. been expelled the legal profession because of improper conduct. Do other lawyers look upon his punishment as an affront to the profesare sion ?",24
51,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,They try to get him it.,25
52,Mr MANN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"They try of him ; and that is what honourable members opposite should do to men distorting facts. guilty of offences under this bill . Instead of saying that to punish them is an affront to their fellows, they should get r i d of such men. All honoris able members should welcome the action proposed! by this bill . titioner, is deregistered for malpractice, do the other members of his profession look upon it as an affrontto them ? So far from feeling it to be an affront, sible. the other members of the profession congratulate themselves that by has exptilsion - which a stigma has been removed from their profession, that his misconduct no longer the gocasts any reflection on them.",25
53,Mr BRENNAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,It all depends on the of the nature of the offence.,25
54,Mr MANN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I beg to differ from those . who in this House claim to express the secopinion of trade unionists when they saythe great body of trade unionists consider this bill to be an affront. If that of opinion had not been advanced with such apparent sincerity, I should have thought it had been advanced as a joke. of At the last' election many thousands of unionists voted for the expulsion, not the only from the unions, but also from the . community itself, of certain persons whom nest honourable members opposite unite in deHe scribing as the worse enemies of the of Labour party. By their votes, cast in favour of Government candidates, those unionists declared that they would not reI gard the expulsion of such men asan affront to organized labour in Australia. The assertion that they would so regard it is a hollow excuse, and has no weight. I challenge the right of honourable members to speak for the trade unionists, of Australia when they advance it . Laxge numbers of unionists took the very action certo expel, certain persons from their ranks is and from the country which it is now would bean affront to them if taken under this bill . What greater of the fences against society can be imagined than those which are mentioned in this ? I agree with the honourable memcase ber for Batman (Mr Brennan) that from much depends upon the nature of the offence. I submit, however, that the offences which are dealt with in this, bill so serious that we are justified in calling them crimes. What are the offences which this bill proposes to punish ?. One out of of them is scheming to overthrow by violence that government which society to get r i d has determined upon.",25
55,Mr YATES,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,The honourable member is,25
56,Mr MANN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,The honourable member's interjection is most improper and' incorrect. The offence which I have mentioned included in the bill ; the honourable member seems to think that it contains If a medical pracone clause only.,25
57,Mr YATES,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,The honourable member should not distort my interjection.,25
58,Mr MANN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,That would be. impos,25
59,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,- I ask the honourable .member te take no notice of interjections.,25
60,Mr MANN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"The offences punishable tinder the bill are, in the first place, tempts to overthrow by violence that form of government that society has deterthis mined to be in its best interests. Obviously such offences must be contrary to the general desire of the community,. because, if any alteration in the form government is in accordance with the will of the community, effect can be given it by constitutional means. Acts of violence resorted to for the purpose troducing a system of terrorism are rightly regarded under the bill as grave offences against society, because they constitute a deliberate attempt to aside the will of the majority. The class of offence dealt with in the bill the deliberate defiance of laws that been established for the maintenance society in peace and amity. Consider the secondary results in the past of defiance of the industrial laws of this country-interferenc e with the liberty citizens in the pursuit of their lawful occasions, loss, want, and almost starvastrikes. tion; and, frequently, personal violence.. Those are some of the effects of deliberate interference with laws that have been set up by society for preserving peace and good government - Yet it is alleged that the breach of those laws, even if leads to such conditions as those. I mentioned, cannot rightly be called crime. I submit that such acts offences of the gravest nature, because they are opposed to the interests society itself. Another grave offence under the bill is interference with officers in the performance of their in protecting society. Officers appointed under the law ought to be protected. Interference with them in the discharge, of their duties is a crime, not merely against the men themselves, but also against society, whose interests they appointed to uphold. That those offences should be regarded as crimes obviously the intention of the bill, ing by the heading of the second division, "" Protection of the Constitution and Public and Other Services,"" This is the essential feature of the bill, since it gives the character to the offences that punishable under it . Industrial laws conwould cern the very life and health of the community, and offences such as scribed in the bill are as grave as against the life and health of individuals. Some honourable members decline gard participation in a strike criminal act; but I point out that the bill atmakes no provision for that. The proposed new section 30J, with respect to which complaint is made, specifies certain particular conditions, certain combinations of circumstances, or certain grave exigencies, which may have arisen in the of community, under which alone thes.e offences become crimes under the bill. I to have endeavoured to show that under such conditions they maybe very properly of inregarded in that light. With a rather thoughtless zeal, as I imagine, one honorvery able member went out of his way the other day to declare that there was set an "" inalienable right to strike."" Let other me remind him, and other honourable is members, that the act of striking has have been regarded as unlawful since 1904, of since when no government has attempted to alter that provision, although more such than one Labour government has been in power, and, if it had chosen, could of have removed the stigma placed upon That was. not done, however, because even Labour governments knew perfectly well that they had no right to do it. Therefore, no honourable member can advance his cause by the assertion that workmen have the right to strike; it because it is the duty of all honourable have members to maintain the supremacy of a the law. If one declares that that are right exists he lays himself open to a chargeof inciting to a breach of of the law. I cannot understand honourable members, who have consistently depublic clared that acts against the general duties interests of the community are to be strongly deprecated, openly defending acts which experience has shown to be very much against the people's interests. Only last year the essential services of the country were held up, business was are paralyzed; men, women and children were prevented from obtaining lawful is employment; loss and suffering, and judgfrequently personal violence were caused, and the community as a whole was under of a form of terrorism. To say that the calling of such acts crimes is an affront to trade unionism is, in itself, an accusaare tion against organized labour, which be the first to resent it if it properly understood the position. I submit, are detherefore, that the Labour party's offences amendment is uuworthy of consideration, because it is inconsistent with its to reown tenets of government, and also as a because it seeks to exonerate one section of the community from punishment, although under equivalent provocation it would be the first to invoke that punishment upon any other section. No class, and no individual, should claim special privileges of that kind. I know numbers of trade unionists who would be glad to see some of the practices which have been common in industrial life in the last few years abolished, and they will welcome this measure as one that will have the effect of purifying their organization and freeing them from a stigma which unjustly rests upon them. It has been asserted over and over again that the men who are causing all the mischief are the worse enemies of labour, yet when an effort is made to punish them or expel them, there is an unseemly attempt to resist that effort with all the political weight of the Labour party. I am sure that honourable members opposite must feci that they have chosen the wrong course, and adopted a line of argument that must rebound upon themselves. They must realise that they would have done more to earn the respect of the community generally had they thrown their weight, influence, and power behind the efforts that were being made to clear their ranks, and rid the country of a very undesirable class of men.  [4.2] - On e who knew a little of the history of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) would have thought that he would support the amendment. am sure the honourable member can remember the time, not very long ago, when the provisions of this bill, if they had been the law, would have applied to him.",26
61,Mr MANN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"That is incorrect.  wish to wrong the honourable member in any shape or form, but I ' a m under the impression that he is in this House as the result of the part he played in a strike.",27
62,Mr MANN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I cannot be answerable for the honourable member's impressions.  stand that the honourable member was the leader of the public servants of ""Western Australia when they resisted certain conditions which had been, I believe, wrongfully imposed on them. From whnt I know of that dispute, I believe he did the right thing in not submitting to the treatment that was being meted out to the public servants of the State, but since coming to this House, he has slipped.",27
63,Mr MANN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Not at all.  ture to say that a great many of his co-workers at that time, who, no doubt, contributed largely to his successful election to this Parliament, would be most disturbed at the sentiments he is now expressing. If the provisions of this bill had been the law when the honourable member led that strike, in Western Australia, I can well imagine his finger-prints being taken and his photograph exposed to public gaze among the photographs of individuals in whose company he would not like to be found. If I understand this bill correctly, particularly the second part of it, it could have been enforced in the circumstances which arose when the honourable member was leading the public servants of Western Australia in an effort to secure what he, no doubt, thought were their rights. But since his return to this Parliament the honourable member has forgotten the ladder upon which he climbed. He is prepared to kick it away from beneath his feet, and with it the principles for which he fought.",27
64,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Probably the honourable member for Perth will explain the whole of the circumstances.,27
65,Mr MANN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"It is evidently necessary to do so.  the honourable member was leader of the public servants of Western Australia in their strike for justice, he was actuated by his real political and otlier opinions, he must have changed a great deal in the meantime, or he must have spoken today with his tongue in 'his cheek. The honourable member for Perth finds himself in a very peculiar position. He is in this House as the result of something which today he condemns lock, stock, and barrel. It is due to him to review the whole position, and see whether he ought not to make some exjalanation to his constituents who sent him here under other circumstances. If the Government ancl its supporters are really anxious to bring to book all those wild individuals who exist largely in their fertile imaginations, and whom they stigmatize as revolutionaries and alien wreckers-if they are actuated by a desire to promote the well-being of the country, and not by political motives-they will accept the amendment, and divide the bill into two parts, thus giving the Opposition an opportunity to assist them in getting rid of these undesirables of whom they speak. Otherwise they will stand condemned as they have been condemned on two previous occasions, wben they sought to do what is done in this bill. In the last Parliament the Government introduced a motion supporting preference to Australian dried fruits, but having in view the political aspect of things more than the well-being of the fruit-growers, it linked up this preference with some very .objectionable provisions relating to defence, which were opposed to the platform of the Labour party. Consequently honourable members of the Opposition could not vote for the motion as a whole. We said that if the Government would divide the motion, we* would vote for that which urged preference for our dried fnait-growers, and record our objection to the portion containing the provisions relating to 46101106. However, the Government, thinking more of the political aspect of things than of giving assistamee to fruit-growers, refused our request,, and its supporters were so mean that, during the election, they condemned the Labour party because of its refusal to support them in their desire to secure preference for the dried fruits industry. Towards the end of the last session the Government did the same kind of thing. It brought down what it called an amending Immigration Bill; Honourable members of the Labour party would have been quite willing to assist in placing on the statute book those parts of the measure that dealt with the exclusion from this country of undesirable aliens, but the Government included, as portion of the bill, provisions that had the result of taking from our citizens the right, in some circumstances, of trial by jury, and of providing the penalty of deportation for certain offences. Consequently, we on this side of the chamber had to vote against the whole measure. Since the election, the Government has had time to give some consideration to the judgment delivered by the High Court on the deportation proposals; and so Ave have this measure  before us. I am glad that we have been able to educate honourable members opposite a Httle as to the public regard for the principle of trial by jury. Statements were frequently made during the election campaign that the Labour party was either unfavorable or indifferent to action being taken against people who have been described by members of the Government as alien wreckers, revolutionaries, and so on. I wish to place it on record that, so far a3 I am concerned, I would have supported the 'proposals in this bill for dealing with those people if I could bave done so without appearing, at the same time, to support the ether parts of the measure to which I strongly object. If the 'Government will adopt the course proposed in the amendment, and separate these two matters, it will find that the Labour party is as anxious as it is to rid Australia of undesirable persons whose conduct is against the best portion interests of our people. The Attorney General (Mr Latham), in introducing the bill, said that the Government had received a mandate from the people. Wc have heard so much about this mandate that I have no doubt that the Government will claim it as justification for every act that it may commit, .from political pitch and toss to manslaughter.",27
66,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Why not make it murder, straight out?  no doubt that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) will be quite prepared to support the Government in all its proposals, and will consider that the mandate justifies him in doing so. The Attorney-General, in introducing the bill, quoted the Prime Minister's speech prior to the last election in support of his contention that the issue submitted to the people was the maintenance of law and order and the supremacy of constitutional government. He added that it was upon that issue that the Leader of the Opposition challenged the Prime Minister to go to the country. As a matter of fact, that was not the question upon which the Leader of the Opposition issued his challenge. It was upon the question of deportation without a proper trial. But, in any .case., the Prime Minister <did not accept the challenge. During the couir.se of his speech at Dandenong the Prime Minister was asked, by interjection, "" Why did you not accept the challenge?""' replied, "" I have no intention whatever of accepting it . "" The Government went to the country really on account of the threatened withdrawal from its ranks of the Country party. Mr KIIXEIT.:-Surely that denied often enough.,  the election campaign, several Labour candidates, including that as the real reason for the Government going to the country when it did ; but. our statements received! very little publicity. The fact cannot be denied, however, that honourable members of the Country party signed, sealed, and delivered an ultimatum to the Prime M in ister. If the honourable member for Riverina (Mr K ill e n ) objects to the word "" ultimatum,""' I am quite willin g to use 'his own word, ""request."" port of my contention,, I refer to a speech delivered by the. honourable member f b r Wimmera (Mr Stewart) in his constituency. In answer to a question on this point,, the honourable member said, "" If the statement has been made that an ultimatum, was, issued threatening the withdrawal of the Country party from the Gavernment,. I w i l t not deny it . "" I have; some other evidence to support my contention. When this assembled, and during: his, speech on the motion! for the adoption of the Addressin-Reply, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gharltom) said that the real reason why the Government went to the country soearly was because of threats from the Country party. The honourable mem jected, "" Nothing could be further from the truth. "" The Postmaster-General (Mr . Gibson) said , "" The first time. I knew of the ultimatum, was when' I read a 1 newspaper report about it . "" The honourable member for Riverina (Mr . KilTen) said ,. "" It is quite plain that it was: only The Prime Minister said,, during the elections, ""There is not a scintilla of truth in it . "" The Treasurer,, who is the leader of the Conintry party, said "" There is not a vestige of truth in it . "" The impression that would be given by the statements of all these gentlemen was that such a thing had never been mentioned in .any shape or for m ; bu* the He honourable member for Riverina let the cat out of the bag. He said,. "" It was not an ultimatum, it was only a request."" According to him, therefore, the question was a real live one; yet none of the gentlemen I have referred to ever heard a word about it . The honourable has been member for Riverina must have debated the matter in a Httle caucus of his own. The facts go to show that many of the denials which were made on the hustings myself, gave should be taken with the proverbial grain of salt. I believe what the honourable 1 member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), said. I will do the honourable member the credit of saying that he. is one of those who are anxious to adhere .to the principles on which they are elected, whether others agree with them or not. I believe the people of Victoria will be inclined to believe in every detail the words which fell from the honourable member's lips; that this request came In sup- to the Government; that there was a threatened split in the ranks on the'other side; and it was then decided to, bring about a dissolution and go to the electors, and to go upon the plea that they wanted to restore law and order and constitutional government in this country. So much for the first statement made by the, Attorney-General as. to the issue on which honourable membersopposite went to the electors. The fact isParliament that they had to go to the electors. .They were not masters of the situation at all, buthad to meet a position that was forced upon them. There is one. passage 1 in the speech of the Attorney-General: which is very refreshing. I do not. think it has. previously been referred to, but I intend to .place it on record in Hatnsard, because I believe that it is calculated to open the eyes of a lot of gullible' people who hung upon every word uttered by 1 those who, - during - the election campaign, insisted that the Labour party was associated with . communists and revolutionists. I propose to put the statement 1 of the. Attorney-General side by sidle a. request."" with certain statements contained in two speeches made, one by the Prime; M i nister during the election campaign, and the other by the other Leader of the composite Government, the Treasurer. I propose to allow the Attorney-General to answer the statements made by both. During the campaign the Prime Minister went out - of his way to deliberately slander the party on this side. These are some of the statements he madeAustralian democracy is in danger, but, whilst ten years ago the menace was from the aggression of a foreign foe, today the danger lies in a small body of men within our own borders. The external foes and internal foes have one aim in common, the overthrow of constitutional government and the disintegration of Australian democracy. Both would hand the people over to bondage. The issue is again thu samo - Whethei thu will of the people is to prevail or whether' we are to be dominated by irresponsible, political and industrial extremists who care nothing for this country and are animated by malignant hatred of the Britisli Empire. Australia is passing through dark hours, when the laws are being defied and lawlessness and sedition are openly preached. Labour has encouraged those who had flouted the law-thos e who were openly for communism. The crimes resulting must be laid at the door of political labour. That waa a defamation of the Labour party and of everything for which it stands, and the Prime Minister knew it . I propose now to make his own Attorney General give him the lie. The other leader of the composite Government also made a statement which, if that were possible, was more exaggerated than that of the Prime Minister. He saidThe issue is between order and chaos; continuous employment and unemployment;, constant wages and no wages; rural prosperity and rural distress; industrial peace and trial unrest; arbitration methods or job control; Australian law and revolution; democratic rule of the majority and the dictatorship of a few; and between the composite Government standing firm for all that means progress, and political Labour betraying trade unionism into the hands of a few violent extremists arid agitators. The political Labour leaders seek to evade their complicity in the guilt of tliese men, but they cannot dissociate themselves, for in the last ten years they have allowed themselves to be used as the spokesmen and advocates of I.W.W. men, communist, the alien wrecker, and all who want to mix up the worker in quarrels that do not concern him. Apart from an election campaign, and with the exception of the Treasurer, there is possibly not one honourable member on the other side who would not characterize those statements as a slander on the party represented on this side of the House. I said that I would allow the Attorney General in calmer, post-election moments to answer these charges. I submit the following statement of the Attorney General in introducing this bill as a complete answer to them. He said I have never said, nor do I say now, that the Labour party seeks to obtain its objects  by violence. The platform of the Labour party makes it perfectly plain that that party aims at securing its objective by constitutional means. There cannot be the slightest objection to that . . . . The Labour party rightly says that it is a party of law ana order. . . . I have said numbers of times, and I repeat it here, that I do - not - either directly or indirectly suggest that, in the ordinary sense, the Labour party is a communist party or is allied with communists. I desire to make that perfectly plain. I ask honourable members to contrast that statement with the wild electioneering stunts of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. It is a complete answer to those people who defamed the Labour party during the elections. I have only to say that if they read the words of the Attorney-General"" it is not too much to expect that they should be ashamed of their utterances during the election campaign. The Attorney-General's statement should not only shame the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, but should open the eyes of those innocents outside who believed their statements and voted for them because of those statements. Another interesting aspect of the matter may be referred to. The Prime Minister said that there were extremists out to overthrow constitutional government and the Empire. He said that from the hustings, and he said it here. If he did not know indus- definitely of such people and where they were he should not have made such a statement. If he does know of their existence the people generally should ask him what he is doing in order to r i d the country of such dangerous elements. The Government was in such little hurry to deal with these evildoers and wrongdoers that, after the election was over, they allowed about seven weeks toelapse before they called Parliament. together. The fact is, of course, that the Government did not want to deal with these extremists at all. They would not be here were it not for the extremists. Mr VAT.ES - The Government would not sell Jock Garden for quids.  lionorable members have suggested that, individuals like Jock Garden served the Government f a it h full y and well during the election campaign and not without adequate reward. If Garden was not paid for his services to the Nationalist party during the election, he was doing a nationalist organizer out of a job. What does the Government propose to do with Jock Garden and men of his type against whom they rail? It cannot t say that it had to wait u n t i l today to know the nature of the sentiments for which Garden stands. There was a speech made by the Prime Minister on the 2Gth October last, about a fortnight before the election, in the electorate of Corio. The right honourable gentleman referred to a speech made by Jock Garden on the Yarra Bank. I have said before, and it has been said by many others, that, apparently, Garden came over here purposely to make that particular speech to the detriment of the party on this side. He said, in effect, that if the Labour party were returned at the elections the strike would go on, and if the Nationalist party were returned the strike would stop. He said a number of other things, and this is what the Prime Minister had to say about other portions of that speech, so that it cannot be contended that he is not aware of the kind of utterances these people indulge in . Referring to Garden's speech on the previous day, the Prime Minister is reported in the Melbourne daily newspapers to - have said in the Corio electorateThe Government was having the speech examined. Mr Garden in that speech had placed himself in a position where it would lie possible to deal with him. Garden talked about the British Empire, and uttered such poisonous stuff that the Government had instructed the legal advisers of the Crown to look into it and advise what action can be taken. . Garden's utterance was the most poisonous that had over been uttered about the British Empire. Words could not express his contempt for such a man. Those are the words of the Prime M i nister. I now ask him, what has he done? Jrlas he received a report from the officers who were appointed to examine the speech ? He said that the utterance was the most poisonous that had ever escaped from the lips of any one in this country, and that words could noli express his contempt for such a man'. Yet Mr Garden is still at large in this country, afree agent to express those sentiments again. From that day to this, the Prime M i nister has not raised a little finger to deal with that man. Mr Garden would have been apprehended long ago but that he serves the purpose of this Government. One can draw no other conclusion from the leniency shown to a man who uttered the "" poisonous s t u f f "" referred to by the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) had something to say about that portion of this bill relating to transport, and it reminded one of the wild statements made at the elections to try and associate the Labour party with the tying up of shipping. We can imagine the honourable  ing, for the edification of his electors, p it if u l and gloomy pictures of the sad plight of those who would not be able to ship their produce. There is, however, another side to that picture. The arch-offenders in preventing the shipment of the farmers' produce are those who sold over 40 of the Australian Commonwealth line of steamers. If a crisis in the nation's affairs were to arise tomorrow, the farmers would find that they had been robbed of their most reliable means of shipping their produce to the other side of the world. While the Government perpetrated the grave injustice of handing the primary producers over to the shipping combine, the honourable member for Forrest and his' associates in the Country party sat meekly by. Although some honourable members opposite obtained hundreds of votes because they were able to make the people believe that they stood foursquare for providing facilities for shipping the farmers' produce overseas, the first thing they did in Parliament after the. election was to sanction the selling of additional ships that belonged as - much to the primary producers as to any other section of the community. The honourable member for Forrest also said that thousands of trade unionists voted for the Government, and that they were expecting legislation of this kind. I believe that the Government did get some of the»votes of innocent trade unionists. I would not say that those votes ran into thousands, but in all walks of life there are "" innocents abroad."" One can hardly imagine that a large number of trade unionists were led astray by the prospect of the Prime Minister filling the role of the new-born leader of trade unionism. Those who were led astray, however, 'when they read this bill , will find themselves in danger* of being classed as criminals, and we can imagine them feeling now much as the unsophisticated visitors who have come to town from the country, and have handed their notes to a magsman to receive gold in exchange, may be expected to feel when they realise that they have been imposed upon. While waiting; for the fulfilment of what they are told will happen, they receive this bill, the second part of which specifically classes them, in certain circumstances, with criminals. Because the second part of the bill does that, honourable members .on this side ask the Government to put its industrial legislation into another bill. If the Government was serious in the statements made to trade unionists at the last election, it would bring down its proposals at once for improving industrial legislation. If it is not the intention of the Government to link genuine trade unionists with criminals, members of the Opposition will assist to place the undesirables in a category of their own. The Government has no mandate to do the things provided for in the second part of the bill, and no one knows that better than honourable members opposite. We, on this side, would not object to a bill - to deal with undesirables and alien wreckers-if there are such peoplebut no one can say that the Government has a mandate to. do the things contemplated in the second part of the bill. In truth, the Government has a majority because it was able to appeal to the passions of the people during a strike that was not an Australian but an oversea strike. At a time when the people were not able to see things in their true perspective, the Government made them believe that, in some mysterious way, the Labour party was responsible for the strike. The Labour party was not allowed to express its views to the electors. The only public man who did anything to endeavour to end the strike was the honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). He met representatives of the ship-owners and the men at a round-table conference.",28
67,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"During the election campaign I arranged for two ships to take eggs abroad, but the wealthy people prevented them from going.  people were not allowed to know those' things; doors were closed against publicity of that kind. The Prime Minister did nothing to arrange a conference of the disputants; but, on the other hand, I believe he prayed day and night that the dispute might continue until election day. If there were a clause in the bill to provide for the deportation of persons who spoke against the strike during the election campaign, but prayed silently and reverently that it might continue until election day, the Prime Minister would be the first to be sent out of the Commonwealth.",32
68,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,""" The prayer of the righteous man availeth much.""  by the Prime Minister's actions, and particularly by his passive resistance, his pious hope was that the strike would continue until election day. The Government says that the object of the bill is .to deal with extremists, but in operation it will create extremists. Mi'. WATKINS - And will anger the moderates.  anger many unionists whose desire is to obey the laws of this country. It fastens a grave libel on the unionists of this country. The Government proposes to spend millions of pounds to induce immigrants to come to Australia, and to establish new industries. Those objectives will not be attained by panic legislation of this nature. Its effect will be to discourage the people who contemplate the establishment of new industries here. The bill will not accomplish what is claimed for it. Indeed, it will have the opposite effect. Honourable members on the other side, who speak of the desirability of further capital being invested in Australia, are supporting a bill which, more than anything since federation, will keep it out of this country.",32
69,Mr KILLEN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Riverina) [4.52] - I congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr. Latham) on the able and concise speech* that he made when explaining the bill. Most of the arguments in favour of this legislation have already been advanced; I have risen only to draw attention to a few points wnich have escaped attention. Honourable members opposite appear to be desirous of minimizing the menace of communism. During the election campaign they attempted to ridicule those candidates who referred to communism as a menace, and who spoke of the connection between the Labour party aud communism. They have accused honourable members on this side of having deceived the people in those matters. Against that accusation I protest strongly. No attempt to deceive the people was made by honourable members on this side; we stated our case plainly and truthfully. What is the connection between the Labour party and communism? The objective of the Labour party is the socialization of the means of industry, - production, distribution, and exchange During the election campaign honourable members on this side mentioned that objective, and also the means by which the Labour party intended to achieve it, namely, the establishment of a supreme economic council elected by all nationalized industries. If that is not communism in its Russian form, I should like to know what it is. Mr. Theodore, one of the ablest leaders of Labour in Australia, speaking at a conference in Brisbane, said that the objective of the Labour party Was communism pure and simple. Yet notwithstanding that he strongly advised the conference to drop that objective, it was retained by a large majority. That objective is still the objective of the Labour party. If further evidence of the connection between the Labour party and communism be necessary, we have it in the action of a number of unions which, since the elecr tion, have attempted to expel communists from their ranks. Yet honourable members opposite say that there are no communists in the Labour movement! Mr E. RILEY - In the whole of Queensland about sixteen communists only were expelled from the Labour party.",32
70,Mr KILLEN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"-The honourable member said that the party contained no communists.  General said that those men had nothing to do with the Labour party. Mr KILLEN"" - Mr Garden, the secretary of the Trades and Labour Council of New South Wales, went to a communist conference in Russia as the representative of Australia. Addressing that conference, he said that his council was governed by an executive of twelve members, eleven of whom were communists. He added that that council directed the policy of 120 unions. In the face of that declaration, honourable members opposite say that there is no connection between the Labour party and communism.",33
71,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Mr Garden did not go to that conference .as a delegate from the Labour party.,33
72,Mr KILLEN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I do not suggest tha* honourable members opposite are revolutionary communists, or that they are in - sympathy with such men; but I repeat Mr Theodore's statement that the objective of the Labour party is the same as that of the communists. We all know what communism has done for - Russia. Mr E. RILEY - Has the honourable member been to Russia? Mr KILLEN"" - Sufficient informa-: tion is available in Australia to show what communism has done for Russia. Nearly 2,000,000 of her people have been murdered by the communists, and their possessions taken from them. Wc know, further, that many millions more have died of starvation, the direct result of the revolution. The communists, . who were determined to abolish capitalists from Russia, are now imploring them to come to their country's assistance, in order to save millions more from dying. Notwithstanding these facts, there are men in this country who want to bring similar conditions upon Australia. Honourable members opposite have said that the menace of communism is merely 1 a bogy, seeing that there are only about 1,000 communists in Australia. People who argue in that way cannot be well informed. It would be more correct to say that the communists in Australia number 100,000. In .the last Senate election Donald Grant, a member of the Industrial Workers of the World and a communist, polled 28,000 votes. Those votes are no true indication of the number of communists in New South Wales, because a great many communists will not vote for communist candidates until they consider that the time is ripe for effect to be given to the communists' objective. They believe that that objective should be achieved gradually, and that the Labour party is a stepping stone to that end. Donald Grant, when charged with having forsaken communism by joining the Labour party, assured his accusers that he was doing the most sensible thing in the circumstances. He meant that he would make the Labour party a stepping stone to communism. The Attorney-General, and the honourable  tioned some of the statements made by communists, including Mr Garden. Tbey did not, however, refer to Mr Garden's address on a recent May Day, - when he saidLet May Day be a day of demonstration of a proud class consciousness, a declaration of war on capitalistic society. Forward to the new battle; forward to the world revolution ! That is a sample of the poisonous doctrines that are ' being disseminated. That is the kind of propaganda which is demoralizing our people, and giving them a false outlook on life. The proposed new sections 30c, 30D, 3 0 E , and 30j? will prevent such statements from being made and circulated. The result should be a better tone in the community. I hope that those proposed new sections will pass in their present form . It has been said also that this bill is au attack on trade unionism. It is nothing of the kind. But it is an attack on job control and direct action. No honourable member on this side of the House desires to interfere with legitimate trade unionism. Great numbers of trade unionists who realise that it will promote industrial peace and prevent the strikes which cause so much in jury, ' not only to the workers, but to all sections of the community, will rejoice when this measure becomes law. Honourable members opposite desire that the workers, while enjoying the benefits of arbitration, should have the right to flout the awards of the Arbitration Court. They cannot have it both ways. We must have either arbitration or no arbitration. The strike that occurred some months ago when a number of British seamen refused duty is regarded by some honourable members as of no consequence. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) described it as a "" l it t l e disturbance."" This industrial upheaval, which necessitated overseas shipping being held up for months, was responsible for a loss of £3,000,000, to say nothing of the distress suffered by the wives and families of the strikers. If this measure is passed, similar dislocation of our transport services will be prevented. I intend to support the bill because the Government should have power to deal with disturbances such as occurred during the strike of British seamen, and with revolutionaries who desire to bring about in Australia the unhappy conditions which prevail in Russia today.",33
73,Dr MALONEY,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Melbourne) [5.7] I regret that I cannot agree with many of the statements of the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen), who, among other things, said that he thought there were at least 100.000 communists in Australia. Let me remind the honorablo member that my office in . Melbourne, which has been open for 37 years with some one in daily attendance, has not been visited by one communist. I-could young not locate a communist of the kind to which he referred if I tried. Communism, as preached by Mr Jock Garden, is a doctrine of which I do not approve. If communism as we know it today were the communism of Christ and His disciples, I would believe i u it . The communists are not supported by honourable members on this side of the House, but by some honourable members opposite. I agree with the opinion expressed by the right, honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), who said that if these men had been paid to disorganize .the service of the Australian Commonwealth line of steamers, they could not have done their work more effectively. In answer to a question asked last week, information was given to show that the Bay steamers travel faster than those of the Orient Company and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. The vessels of the last-named company are not subsidized by Australia as mail steamers, as in employing coloured labour they are acting contrary to our White Australia policy. If the vessels of the Australian Commonwealth line of steamers are sold, the members of the Country party and the farmers who support them will have to transport their produce by vessels belonging to the shipping combine. The members of the combine do not mind spending a few millions in order to get all the trade into their own hands. In discussing this ma!ter with my son, who is a farmer in Western Australia, he said that the wheat growers were being robbed by the big men who bought the wlieat. I asked an old schoolmate of mine who has special business knowledge what would have happened if a wheat pool had not been formed, and he replied that John Darling and Son and other grain merchants would have purchased all the wheat they wanted to meet the local demand and the farmers would then have had to dispose of the balance in the best way they could, and in doing so might obtain only Is. per bushel for it . The sale of the vessels of the Australian Commonwealth line of steamers would be about as absurd as the action of past governments of New South Wales in spending millions of pounds to construct tram lines to the Circular Quay in Sydney, and then allowing a private ferry company to carry the traffic over the harbour to No r t h Shore. All Australia's produce should be carried by government-owned railways and shipped overseas, by vessels under the control of the Government. Delegates appointed by the Government to visit Great Britain should always travel by the Bay steamers. 1I have nothing against the Orient Company which, in sending vessels out to compete for the Australian trade, employed white crews. I do not suppose any honourable member will disagree with me when I say that the Adelaide Advertiser is not a Labour paper. It is a Liberal publication, and this is the opinion it expresses on-the measure now before the HouseThe Attorney-General introduced the measure in a well - reasoned speech, spoilt a by the frivolous facctiousness which passes for wit in university debating clubs and other places where callow youth gathers, but which has no place in assemblies of men. Speaking of Liberalism, the article continuesLiberalism alone can make Australia great; liberalism which knows no distinction of class, creed, or calling.. The article criticizes very severely the careless drafting of the measure, and refers to the meaning of the word "" sabotage,"" which is being used for the first time in a British statute. sabotage? The word is French, but can any honourable member define its meaning in such a way as to j u s t if y its insertion in this bill? The Advertiser also says that any one who advocates the sor-ession of a State from the Commonwealth, as has been done in Western Australia and Tasmania, will come under the provisions of the bill. The article continues-Similar carelessness is visible all through the bill, which reaches, in some sections, ' notably 30 (i i ) , in its efforts to encompass all sorts of crimes against the Constitution, a vagueness which will, no doubt, horrify its framers when the High Court has finished interpreting it. The article goes onA second question which troubles one in reading this part of Part 2 of the bill is that the measure, in its zeal to squelch revolution wherever it shows itself, says that societies are also to be suppressed which aim at the "" overthrow by force or violence of the established government . . . of any other civilized country, or of organized government."" To that we do not object. Honourable members should recall that Byron went to the assistance of Greece, and that Garibaldi was made welcome in England. Both men interfered in the affairs of countries of which they were not nationals. Garibaldi, indeed, became such a hero in the eyes of the British people that he was asked to leave England, as it was thought that the English people were becoming too fond of him. I quote from the Mercury, published in Tasmania, which no one who has any regard for verity will say is a Labour paper. In a leading article the following appears:After the election had followed the deportation fiasco, the problem of how to fulfil his promise to the electors was still before Mr. Bruce, who found himself, however, in the difficult position of having received a "" mandate "" to do something which the High Court said little lie could not do by the means previously adopted on the advice of his Attorney-General. The electors spoke with almost one voice against communism. They would have none of it. So we have this second attempt to deal with the problem. The bill, whatever its merits, bristles with difficulties. During the recent elections only 800 communists voted, and every vote they recorded was against the Labour party. Honourable members opposite cannot say that the communists did not give their second preferences to Nationalist candidates. The communists opposed Labour What is candidates in every constituency for which a communist candidate was available. Who found the money for them? They did not get it from the workers.. I stated in this House before the elections and on the platform during the campaign that I had no time for Walsh, Johannsen, or Garden, who served a purpose during the election in the way honourable members opposite desired. The members of the Deportation Board were paid the highest salary ever paid by a Commonwealth or State Government, excepting that paid to the Governor General. The fee paid ' to the membei'3 of the board was 25 guineas a session, not a d a y two sessions could be held i u 24 hoursbut allowing for only one session a day, and eliminating Sundays, they could have drawn for 313 days, so that they were paid at the rate of £8,000 who, per annum. I make no reflection upon those three men, but they were appointed to bring in a certain verdict, and truly they did so. Had the judgment of the High Court been delivered five weeks fore the elections, the Ministry would have been returned to power. The honpunishable under this bill. orable member for Riverina (Mr Killen) said that the Labour party is opposed industrial arbitration. Having regard the fact that the tramway employees spent over £20,000, made up of contribuofficial tions' of shillings and sixpences, in ting an award from the Court, and that some of the miners have had to wait two years to have a plaint heard, is the as Minister dissatisfaction of the workers with Arbitration Court to be wondered at ? system which keeps men waiting two years to set redress of a wrong, and involves endless expense, is not just. The existassist ing circumlocutory methods enable some lawyers to make large incomes, but I am employment ? The Truth certain that some of them would sooner see justice done quickly even at some sacrifice of their own income. The Hobart Mercury saidIt would be hard to say where a secession movement would stand under this section if the matter ever came to a serious point. I do not think that Tasmanian tatives are sincere in their threats of secession. Many of us hold that Tasmania should be attached to Certainly the people of that State would be fools if they attempted to remove themselves from the federation. the island State, with a population of only 200,000 people, the same power in the Senate as has New South Wales, with over 2,000,000 people? And has not this Parliament, recognizing the peculiar circumstances of Tasmania, made a sympathetic gift to the island, of £900,000? The Mercury has referred in harsh terms to this bill, and I have quoted it only because, being a non-Labour journal, it may carry weight with honourable members Another cause of trouble in Australia are the Fascists. We have b°en told that there are no members of that society in this country. Readers of current know that the present political in Italy is extraordinarv. Those who have met Mwnlmi say he is a man of phenomenal intellect, but an Dr Maloney. dictator. He has suspended the publication of newspapers that criticized him and the Fascists, and has imprisoned men, though they differed from him, are as loyal to Italy as he. We do not wantmen of that type in Australia. We do not want the methods of the Fascists; - and any man who attempts to introduce them beinto our public life, be he government not officer or a private citizen, should be The Prime Minister declared that he knows nothing to of the Fascists. Possibly, as a private to citizen, he does know of their, existence; but there is a fiction that a man's mind may know nothing of somegetthing that is familiar to his unofficial mind-that things known to him in his for private capacity are unknown to him or member of Parliathe ment, and vice versa. Captain Hatcher A occupies a semi-government position; and if he believes in Fascism do honourable members doubt that he will endeavour to other members of the organization, when he is dealing with applications for newspaper, far which has an inspiring name, says"" TOO MUCH MUSSOLINI,"" SAY HATCHER'S FASCISTS.

' Hatcher voting is a Government official, and if he is organizing Fascism in Australia, the fact should be known; if the Government is supporting him, Ministers should be candid and let the House know where they stand. Undoubtedly, Mussolini has a great, though evil, b r a in ; but if British people are so barren of ideas that they look to Fascism for an inspiramore tion, God help them, and give them opposite. sense. The conditions in which this bill was conceived are not new. In the days of ancient Rome great tribunes were sacrificed because of their interest in the history people. Who can forget the Gracchus position brothers, sons of Cornelia, one of the noblest of Roman mothers, who, when asked by a patrician friend to show her absolute jewels, produced her two boys and said, ""These are my jewels!"" The Gracchi were animated by a desire to give justice to the working classes, and for a time they succeeded. But the powers of wealth and privilege-no t backed hy the press, this Government was at the last election, and not helped by daily outpourings of calumny and untruths^-conspired to about their downfall, and Livius Drusus, a great elocutionist, was bribed by the aristocrats to undermine the influence Caius Gracchus by outbidding him i generosity to the commons. Finally, that great patriot had to take refuge in flight, and was foully murdered, as his elder set. brother had been before . him. Prime Minister, educated as I wish every Australian could be educated, enjoying advantages of birth position which I wish every Ausform tralian mother could give to her sons England and. daughters., professes to speak on behalf of the trade unions. I assure honourable members that the average trade union secretary ranks high as a student of curister rent history, and all matters pertaining the welfare of the masses. I doubt i honourable members equal those men as readers of social and political history, most of us, I fear, are inclined to contration fine our reading to matter that agrees with our convictions. Honourable memdiction, bers opposite may pretend to offer gifts to the workers, but, like Drusus, the Roman, and the aristocrats in preready rovolution days in France, are only betraying the masses in order to serve their own I advise honourable members to see that splendid moving pictureScaramouche, which realistically portrays the aristothat cratic tyranny that obtained in France by in. the eighteenth century. At that time operates there was no room for the third estate, and auy man who did not belong to nobility could be shot down without redress. If any well-born man dared to speak as his conscience tated on behalf of the down-trodden people, he was promptly challenged by an aristocrat and run through with a rapier. The only B ritish survival of that old order is the House of Lords. If any honourable member would like see a telling indictment of that bouse fossils, he should read the almanac of Financial Reform League of Britain , which is supported by all great Liberals. These aristocrats nearly broke the heart of that great reformer, Lord Shaftesbury. I have no great regard for titles, except as the reward of merit and honourable service. The ordinary twopenny-halfpenny tin-pot titles I as despise. Do not honourable members recollect a great boomster who purchased a title by giving £30,000 to a university? bring But I never hear the name of Lord Shaftesbury mentioned without experiencing at h r i ll of admiration for him and of his work as a reformer, particularly in n connection with mining labour. Children, in winter, went down into the mines before sunrise, and came up after sunEven women took their childThe ren with them into the bowels of the earth; and when an agitation was started to alter these conditions, and the aristocrats stood in the path of re. They are learning their lesson in at the present time, but .they will have to learn more quickly if the Old Country is to escape from its economic and industrial troubles. The Prime M in and his supporters say that they deto sire to help the trade unionists. Justice, f mauy and not favours, is what, the trade unionists demand, and as a first instalfor ment they require the reform of the arbilaws. At the present time there is conflict between Federal and State jurisbecause in New South Wales a Labour Government has proclaimed a 44hour week. In South A f r i c a that is althe law of the land. On m y visit they to that country in 1925, I studied the labour question, and obtained much in class. formation and instruction. Thanks to the wise advice given by the larte Alfred Deakin to a South A f r i c a n Commission visited Australia, a law promulgated the South A f r i c a n Parliament throughout the Union. From the 1st December, 1924, the minithe mum wage was fixed at 2s. 9d. an hour for a week of 44 hours. Overtime was regarded as undesirable, and it was recogdicnized - that a contented body of workers could best be secured by continuity of employment. Every skilled worker in the building trade must now be paid not less than 2s. 9d. an hour, and if the law is not observed the penalty is a fine of £ 5 0 0 to or two years' imprisonment, or both. At of the end of January, 1.925. large builders the and contractors conferred with represenGreat tatives of thevarious skilled trades, and the in many of the provinces the wage was raised to as high as 3s. 4d. an hour, so that throughout the South African a working week of 44 hours and wages of from 2s. 9d. to 3s. 4d. an hour were legalized for the first time, I think, in the world's history. Overtime, except under most exceptional circumstances, countenanced ; and, in my opinion, the excellent working conditions about an increased influx of white people into that country. Prior to the opening of the Suez Canal only one out of every four ships that called at Table Bay came to Australia, and yet has been populated at rapid rate than South emigrants of British stock. reason for the slow development of white settlement in South Africa was the fact that emigrants arriving at Capetown with no capital had no chance of success, because they had to compete in employment with blacks and half-castes.. I was at the Cape I discovered that in a population of 120,000 white there were only two bricklayers not one white plasterer, the low wages for which coloured employees worked. Senator Whiteside, worked many years ago on the tramways in Victoria, but who has risen to the position of Commissioner for in South Africa, visited Australia time ago, and, in the course of conversation, he informed me that under the present law if any man, white, or black, worked at one of the skilled callings in the building trade, he must be paid, nt least, 2s. 9d. an hour. gard South Africa as being in the van in industrial matters. Since Mr Hertzog has been in power, 15,000 more people have been employed than General Smuts and his gang held office. In the brewing industry, I might tion, that a law is to be introduced pro^ viding that every employee must be white. In Johannesburg, the price of beer is now higher than in any other part of the world, although brewed by the cheapest labour; but employment will be provided in the industry for 10,000 more persons than were formerly engaged. now come to the serious feature of the bill. Strikes develop into revolution only when the employees are goaded into revolt. Most honourable members imagine that after the Boer war, when Chinese labour was introduced into South Africa, and when the Chinese killed many Dr Maloney.

I was uuder the same impression before is not I visited that country and made inquiries there.

When I give my lectures on South A f r i c a I men- throw on the screen a quotation that was published in one of the most conservative newspapers. in the Kimberley district. I refer to a statement by Dr Colin Steyne, a doctor of laws, and a barrister with one of the largest practices in that country. Referring to the fact white that innocent men had been hanged, he I said, "" Under martial law, legalized murder has taken place. I do not accuse the judge of having done wrong, but I take the strongest possible exception probably to the way in which the evidence was presented, to him, because, had it been submitted to him properly, he could not have sentenced innocent men to death, and would have followed the judge who first, tried them."" I do not think that the people of Australia, had they been consulted, have agreed to this bill. Surely Parliament is able to make laws that will adequately punish wrong-doers. ever measures, are needed, this Government should be strong enough to frame them. I have no sympathy with Mr . Walsh, but 1I have great sympathy with his seven Australian children.. If the father were deported, would not the British. Government be justified in saying to the Commonwealth Ministry, "" This man has been living in Australia for 30 years. He is married, and has seven children. Cannot you pass laws to punish those living in your midst who have done wrong? If not, you had better make room for stronger men."" A public meeting once took place near the site of the Melbourne Gaol to protest against a shipload of convicts being landed in Australia. The leaders said to the captain of the ship, "" If you land those men here, ' we hang you and your officers."" Those convicts, I may say, were taken furthe r on. Although Great B r it a in landed undesirables in Australia in the early days, are we now to return the compliment? No. Let us make laws to punish in Australia ithe wrong-doers in our midst. But we should give the people the right to say whether or not those laws should be passed. people had the right, by referendum, to say whether or not such a bill as this should be passed, they would promptly reject it . No such measure is to bo found in the criminal code of Switzerland, because, there the community has the controlling voice. I wish that the people of Australia enjoyed a similar privilege. The majority of those one meets in train or tram admit that they would not have voted as they did at the recent election had the judgment of the High Court been given before the election. Old-age pensioners have come to me saying. "" Doctor, we could not vote for you this time, because the present Government in creased the pension."" Another old man said, "" We voted for you, doctor, but we could not vote for your senate candidates. We were afraid to do so."" It is pitiable that old people should have been deceived by the lies which were circulated. This bill will pass; but, as an old conservative paper said, "" Parties change and the wheels go round."" When' the would people come into their own again under the power given by this bill they may decide to deport some of the profiteers. What- The honourable member for Riverina (Mr K ill e n ) and his colleagues of the Country party know that there is a great difference between the price paid by the consumer and that which goes to the producer. There are certainly men who ought to be deported. Among them. I would name those who built coffin ships for the Commonwealth Government. I have yet to learn that Kidman and Mayoh have paid the £60,000 or £70,000 which an arbitrator decided should be paid by them to the Commonwealth Government. If the people had the power to deport such men, they would do it . Honourable members opposite cry, "" Trust the people."" As a matter of fact, the only party that trusts the people is the Labour party. In will America the great Country party has joined with Labour, and has the referendum, initiative, and recall in the forefront of its platform. There are some honourable members of our Country party who believe in the referendum, initiative, and recall, but they will not put it in their p l at for m; they will not, trust the people. However, let Government supporters' go on their way crushI f the ing down all opposition. The amendment of the Leader of the Opposition is as follows :-That all the words after the word "" That"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof:- "" this House is of opinion that the bill should be withdrawn with a view to re-drafting so as to eliminate the obnoxious clauses referring to industrial disputes, as such clauses, associated with the Crimes Act, are an unwarranted affront to the great bodies of organized labour. ' It is a reasonable request that the offensive provisions of . the bill - should not apply to trade unionists, and I cannot see why the Government does not accede to it . Gladstone's Coercion Act, introduced in the British House of Commons, on the night when Cavendish and Burke, who had been murdered in Phoenix Park, Dublin, were buried, contained provisions whose severity one might in the circumstances forgive, but section 32 providedNo agreement or combination which under the Trade Unions Act 1871 and 1876 or the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875, is legal shall be deemed to be an offence against tins act. Thus the British Coercion Act especially exempted trade unions', and the matter at issue in this. Chamber today could be settled simply enough by the insertion of a clause exempting trade unions from the offensive provisions of the bill. I think my leader would agree to that. It would certainly be a way out of the difficulty, and would relieve the minds of many honourable members opposite who are not too pleased with the measure. However, I say to honourable members who are supporting the bill, "" Pass it , but always remember the turn of the wheel."" Labour will come into its own again, when,' perhaps, the abuse and malignity and misrepresentation to which it has been so recently subjected will not be so powerful, or when, perhaps, some newspapers with old Liberal instincts will give it fair play. When that day does come, the present unholy combination of Nationalists* and the Country party will come to an end.",34
74,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Eawkner) [5.58J Interest in this debate seems to have reached almost the vanishing point, and the question before the House, a simple but very important one, is whether the principles embodied in this amending Crimes Bill are worthy of our endorsement. In addressing himself to this measure,, there is great temptation for an honourable member to expatiate on the many excursions that have been made by honourable members of the Opposition. But I want, so far as possible, to resist that temptation, and to confine my atten. tion strictly to the measure itself. We have heard once or twice what I have never previously heard in this chamber from honourable members of the Opposition-the suggestion that, in the discusr sion of industrial matters, especially in discussing the settlement of industrial disputes,, we ought to resort to . sweet reasonableness, and honourable members have deprecated the principle of repression that is so apparent throughout this bill. I invite honourable members opposite to discuss the. bill in that spirit of sweetreasonableness which they so much desiderate. If , instead of constantly hurling at one another's heads charges of insincerity and stupidity, and the like,, we introduced the spirit of sweet reasonableness in discussing this bill, I think we should make much more progress'. First of. all, let «us examine the objection that is being urged by honourable members to the inclusion in a Crimes Bill of offences connected witli industry. Honourable members seem to regard the inclusion of industrial offences in a Crimes Bill as an affront to the trade unions of Australia. But let us examine the matter quietly and in a common-sense way. What is a crime? Why should lionorable members phy at the word? 1I have taken the trouble to consult Webster's Dictionary, and I find that, in its simplest expression, a crime is "" au act which subjects the doer to legal punishment.''' Of course, there can be every shade of seriousness in a crime; but I cannot understand why honourable members should boggle at the word itself. Webster also defines ""crime"" as ""a grave offence against social order.'' I ask honourable members opposite to apply that very fair definition to the acta specified in the proposed new section 30J, to which they have raised so much objection. I think it will be agreed that each of the acts specified in that section is a grave offence against social order. Another thing that has struck me in this debate is the claim of the Opposition that the bill is a blow struck at trade unionism. I ask them to give honourable members on the Ministerial side credit for hones'ty and sincerity of purpose in a matter of this kind. I ask them to believe us when we say that we recognize the fine work that trade unionism has done for labour in the past, and that we have faith in its ability to do splendid work fbr the working classes in the future.",40
75,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,All that labour has gained in the past has been in face of strong opposition from the honourable member's party.,40
76,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I said, in speaking on this matter previously, that labour has had to win at the point of the sword practically every inch of the way, but that is no reason why we on this side of the chamber should be saddled with all the iniquities of . those who have withstood labour in the past, or be credited with placing in its path all the obstacles it has encountered. We should be judged individually by our actions. We. on this side of the House, believe, and I think it not too much to say, glory, in the strength of. legitimate trade unionism. In my opinion a vast number of legitimate trade unionisfe in Australia will resent the suggestion made by honourable members opposite that this measure is an affront to them.",40
77,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"It is, to any one of them who has the courage to lead his fellows.",41
78,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,I cannot imagine a legitimate trade unionist objecting to it .,41
79,Mr COLEMAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,What does the honourable member mean by a legitimate trade unionist?,41
80,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I mean one who is not tainted by the poison of extremism. Honourable members know that I have taken a considerable interest in com.miuiistic ' developments in Four years ago, in a lecture in this city, I pointed to what seemed to me, even then, - the communism. I was, at as a voice crying in the wilderness, but I think I may be pardoned for taking some little credit to myself, because, at the last election, the people of Australia took the view that communism had become a real menace. I make bold to say also that the rank and file of trade unionists, throughout the length and breadth of Australia, regard communism as a menace to the movement. Mr E . RILEY - So do we in this House.",41
81,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,I am very glad to hear the honourable member for South Sydney say that.,41
82,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,We have excluded the communists from the Labour movement.,41
83,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I may say something about that presently. mate trade unionist, in my opinion, is a man who is still untainted with . com- munism and who regards communism as a menace to the great trade union movement. Let me place opposite to that statement this significant f a c t: that the communist regards trade unionism as the chief obstacle to the achievement of his objective. One of the main tenets of all communists - is the removal of this obstacle. They are logical,' for they say, id effect, "" As trade unionism is the chief obstacle to the achievement of our objective we must destroy it . "" Their method fbr bringing about its destruction is to join the trade unions for the purpose, not of strengthening them, but of eventually destroying them. set purpose of the nucleus of communists in every trade union in Australia is to create a left, or - militant, wing to serve their own purposes. I have in my hand, last week's issue of the Wor,l&e.rs' Weekly.",41
84,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Does the honourable member buy it?,41
85,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,I buy it regularly and read it carefully.,41
86,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Where is it published?,41
87,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"In Sydney. It is edited by . Mr Jock .Garden - The fact that honourable members opposite know nothing about it accounts for their ignorance of the extent of the communist propaganda. This issue of the newspaper sets out the attitude of the communists Australia. towards this bill. It advises the trade unionists of Australia to beware of the bill. It says that if it becomes menace of law the destruction of the trade unionist the time, movement is certain. It calls the bill the most diabolical measure introduced into anv Parliament in the world. Could anything be more ludicrous than for the communists to write this when their avowed object is the destruction of trade unionism? It is the height of hypocrisy for communists to tell trade unionists to get into a solid line to fight this measure, when they desire nothing more than to rout the unions. The communists are saying, in effect, to the trade unionists, "" Do not let the bill k ill y o u ; that is our job. Do not deprive us of it . """,41
88,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,That is sheer bunkum.,41
89,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"If the honourable member means that it is bunkum for the avowed enemies of trade unionists to advise them to resist the passage of this A legiti- bill, I agree with him. I should like to know whether honourable members opposite care to deny that the avowed object of the communists is to destroy trade unionism. If they do .not do so it is apparent that they agree with me that the attitude which the communists have adopted is ludicrous. I appreciate the silence of the Opposition. The communists are telling trade unionists that it, is of no use for them to wait u n t i l the Labour party obtains a parliamentary majority, for long before that time comes the trade union movement will be injured beyond the hope of recovery.",41
90,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Nonsense !,41
91,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I am glad that the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr . The West) agrees with me that it is the utterest nonsense for this newspaper to express these views. If the Opposition full y realized the object of the tactics adopted by the communists, they would completely alter their attitude towards such measures as this. The leading article in this paper asks trade unionists to "" show Bruce and company that the trade unions refuse to be bludgeoned out of existence by measures of this kind."" That also is nonsense.",41
92,Mr EOKDB,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"If that newspaper is a menace, why does not the Government suppress it ?",42
93,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"That is another question that I shall be glad to debate with the honourable member on a more fitting occasion. It is amazing to me that the communists should be associated with the Labour party in opposing this bill. The communists and honourable members opposite claim that aro speaking for the trade movement; but they are not voicing the real opinions of legitimate trade unionists. I wish for minutes to refer to the endeavour to establish the Fascist movement in Australia. In passing let me say that it is the existence of communism, which is the revolutionary party in the State, that renders such movements as the Fascisti necessary. The Fascist movement in It a l y was organized because of the revolutionary onset that was being made against constituted authority, and of the weakness of the existing government to combat it . It was instituted in pure self-defence. I wish to say quite definitely that I do not believe in force. But when force is brought into operation by one party the tendency is for the other party to counter it by force. That is exactly what happened in It a l y . I am told, and I have no reason to doubt - it, that there is what is called a Fascist movement in Australia; but it is very different from the ""Fascist movement in Italy . All movements must be judged by their declared constitution. I have in my hand a letter dealing with this matter, but it is very different from the letter read by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), which was proved to be an absolute and unmitigated fake. I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition would himself admit that the evidence is sufficient to prove it so, and that he woUld be the last man in the world to judge the Fascist movement by its terms. My letter was written early in November last, in the following circumstances:- A lecture was delivered in the Socialist H all, in Melbourne, by Mr C. ONEILL, chairman of the Overseas Strike Committee, in which he said that the Fascist movement must be nipped in the bud. He added that his party had its spies, one of whom he had caused to make application for membership in the Fascist movement. In answer to his application for membership, Captain Hatcher, who is evidently the head of the movement here, wrote a letter. I am sorry that I cannot myself read the letter, but perhaps, sir, with your permission and that of the House, my friend, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), will be permitted to read it .",42
94,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I assume that the House grants that permission. they Mr MAXWELL - I thank you, sir, union and I thank the House.",42
95,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Do I understand the honourable member to admit that a Fascist a few movement exists in Australia?,42
96,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"E v i d e n t l y , as the honourable member will learn from the letter. I shall have a word to say about it later. Mr Mann thereupon read the following letter:Yours of the 16th inst. to hand. Herewith an enrolment form, which, after completing, please return to me at the above address for approval. We are short of literature at the present time, and as we are trying to be self-supporting in this Dominion, we are, with the assistance of supporters, printing our own. I enclose copies of what I have left for your perusal. I suppose the area commander has already explained our objects in forming the brotherhood. Fascisti is essentially law abiding and constitutional. We have two immediate tasks-(1 ) to assist every patriotic organization and individual in awakening our feirow-countrymcn to the danger to the whole of the British Empire; and (2). to plant groups of Fascisti in every suburb of the large cities, also in towns and districts throughout Australia, not only to assist in countering communist poison, but to encourage selfsacrifice and brotherhood, regardless of class, and in the event of attempted revolution, to define rallying-points where loyal citizens could find a definite proposal for assisting the authorities where the authorities are taken unawares or overpowered. I would be very glad to meet you at my office at I o'clock. P.S - Perhaps you have friends who would like to come with you. We must show the flag and loyalty where the red flag and disloyalty are seen at the present time.",42
97,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"That is a statement of the objects and methods of the Fascist movement as it exists in Australia, and I ask whether any member of this House can take exception to one single thing in its constitution.",43
98,Mr COLEMAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Surely the honourable member does not defend it .,43
99,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"It has been suggested that it is usurping the functions of the Government. It is doing nothing of the kind. Honourable members opposite evidently did not listen carefully to the letter. The object of the movement is that when the government is taken unawares, or is overpowered, there shall be a body of its loyal supporters to come to its assistance. I ask honourable members to remember that if a constable who is responsible for the King's peace is engaged in the act of legally arresting without a warrant a person whom he has reason to suspect has committed a felony, is overpowered and finds it necessary, he can call on any private citizen to come to his aid and assist in the arrest of the offender. If the private citizen so called on, refuses, without lawful excuse, such aid, he is guilty of a substantive offence and may be prosecuted for an indictable misdemeanour. Surely that is fair in any properly organized community. Mr E . RILEY - That should be sufficient.",43
100,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"The trade union movement is taking steps to r i d itself of the poison that has got into its system, not only here but in the Old Country. Trade unionism today is doing its best to free itself from this revolutionary element. There cannot be the slightest doubt about that. unionists find that it is a mighty hard job to drive the communists out of their ranks. They find it almost impossible. The Australian Labour party itself has come to the conclusion, in its wisdom, that it is well to exclude from membership p f the party men holding communistic views. The Labour party has taken similar action in the Old Country. At the last annual meeting of the British Labour party held in Liverpool, in September last, by a vote of 2,500,000 to 500,000, a resolution was passed excluding communists from membership of the British Labour party. Honourable members will notice that there was a fairly substantial minority against action.",43
101,Mr COLEMAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Not necessarily a communist minority.,43
102,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I quite agree with the honourable member. There was a minority of 500,000 ' members of the party who believed it was not necessary to exclude these revolutionaries from the party. The spokesman of the minority,' whose name I forget at the moment, in severely condemning the resolution,, said that they would get into the party by some means or other. That is their determination, and they are relentless in their methods. They are determined to get into the Labour party and into the trade union movement. l o r . what purpose? Not to assist, but to destroy it . Their anxiety to white-ant the trade union movement is due to the fact that they know that in Australia and in Great Britain the trade union movement is the chief supporter of the political Labour party. They believe that if they destroy the trade union movement they will destroy the Labour party. Mr ' WATKINS - In whose interests would that be done?",43
103,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"In the interests of the communists. The communists regard the political Labour party with supreme contempt. They sneer at it for thinking that it will ever achieve its objective by constitutional means. They say that that cannot be done. They say, "" Our objective is the same as yours. You are reformers; you think you can reform things, but you cannot do anything of the kind. The only way is to destroy, and we intend to get a grip, not only of the trade union movement, but of the Labour party, in order that we may Trade achieve our objective by destruction."" They contend that before a proper social order can be reared, it is necessary to destroy the existing one. It can only be done by destruction, in their opinion. I should look for approval from honourable members opposite of any blow aimed at that extreme element in the community that is a menace; not only to us of the general public living under and believing in the present system, but also to the Labour party. I should have expected the earnest support of legitimate trade unionism throughout Australia to any attempt to stop this communistic tide, and to expel from the body politic such the poison that has got into it.",43
104,Unknown,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m.,43
105,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"On e other feature of this debate is worthy of remark. Membersof the Opposition have suggested that thisis a purely repressive measure, .that it will do no good,' and .that the Government,, instead of introducing measures for repressing and suppressing pro^ agenda, shouldsetto work to discover, and remove the root cause of industrial troubles. I think that we are all agreed that the most earnest endeavours ought to be made by every one who has the welfare of the community at heart to find out the causes of industrial troubles, and, having found them, to deal with them. But that is a very difficult task. The industrial trouble from which we are suffering, and which is manifest the world over, is not to be attributed to any single cause; it is the result of a complexity of causes. Surely, while we are engaged in investigating the causes, with a view to dealing with them, it is common sense to protect ourselves from the attacks of those who would overthrow and destroy the constructive work that has already been done by the community. I would remind honourable members of an incident in biblical history. In the time of Nehemiah, when the Jews were rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, and enemies were about them in all directions, they found it necessary to protect themselves, and every man engaged in that work had a trowel in one hand and a weapon of defence in the other. That is just typical of the attitude that we, who are engaged in constructive work, must in these days assume. We are doing our level best to construct a form of society that will be true to fundamental principles, and while we are doing that we find it necessary to protect ourselves from attack by those who would overthrow all the constructive work we are seeking to do. Surely, for co-operation in a matter of that kind, we ought to be able to look with confidence to those who are the direct representatives of Labour in this House. I now wish to come. to a consideration of the bill itself. I shall confine my remarks to the proposed new section 3 0 J , to which members of the Opposition have almost entirely directed tneir attention. It seems to me that in discussing this question members of the Opposition have assumed-at least, their arguments seemed - to indicate that they were proceeding on the assumption-that this bill deals with all industrial disputes. That is not so. They appear bo have lost sight of the fact that it is directed at at certain definite industrial situation--the situation in which we find ouuselves when it. appearsto the Govenunent,. which is responsible for the peace and order of the comnra-nity for the time being, that a state of seriousindustrial disturbance exists. Before the provisions of a measure of this kind could be brought into operation, every effort that reason and common sense could suggestwould be made in order to effect a settlement.",44
106,Mr COLEMAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,How many industrial disputes has this Governmentsettled ?,44
107,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"That is not the question. I am not dealing with the endeavours of this Government to settle disputes, and I am not here to pass judgment on it in regard to' any particular dispute. My object is to discuss the specific terms of this specific bill,' and I am seeking to point out that it is only after every effort has been made to avert a situation that has arisen that this measure will come into operation. Let us assume, for a moment, that, in spite of all endeavours to settle disputes that have arisen, a state of serious industrial disturbance, which prejudicially affects and threatens the well-being of the community, exists. The Government is faced with the duty of meeting that situation. How is it to be done? I have endeavoured to prove, as other honourable members have proved, that there exists in our community a party thathas as its avowed objective the prevention of the settlement of disputes and the overthrow of the ' whole industrial and social system. What could the Government do if a situation such as I have indicated arose and a proclamation had been made to that effect? Will any honourable member of the Opposition be bold enough to say that, in those circumstances, any one fomenting a strike or promoting a lockout would not be guilty of a grave social offence?",44
108,Mr COLEMAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"That would depend on the circumstances. Mr MAXWELL . - Of course it would., and that is the point I am making. The Government says that in those circumstances it needs to have power to deal with, men, or bodies of men, who are determined that industrial peace shall not be restored. Honourable members will recognize that the commission of any one of the acts .aimed at by this provision would aggravate ihesituation that had been declared by proclamation to exist. I therefore cannot understand honourable members saying that ""any one guilty of such acts is not. guilty of a grave offence against the social order-a n offence which, according to Webster, constitutes a crime. I should like to call the attention of the Attorney General to an anomaly in paragraph 3 of the proposed new. section 30J.. It states what a strike or a lockout shall include. It provides that employers who, ' in combination, refuse to ;give"" work, if such refusal is unreasonable, shall be guilty of an offence. Thus, if employers in combination arc charged with refusing men employment, it must be proved that their refusal was unreasonable. But the paragraph goes on to say that if an individual employer., with a view to compelling his employees to accept certain terms, suspends work, he shall be guilty of an offence. There is no necessity in that case to prove that the suspension was unreasonable. In either case, if an offence is charged against either employers in combination, or employers individually, proof ought to be required that the refusal to give work, or the suspension of work, was unreasonable. Honourable members will further notice that the paragraph, in saying what a strike shall include, provides that where there is a cessation of work by employees in combination for the purpose of compelling employers to accept certain terms, there is no necessity to prove that the cessation is unreasonable; but if employees in combination, with a view to forcing employers to accept certain terms, refuse to work, that refusal must be proved to be unreasonable. I cannot understand what principle is involved in making it necessary to prove unreasonableness in one case but not in the other. Where an offence is charged either as a lock-out or a strike, the cessation or refusal ought to be proved to be unreasonable. With that safeguard I cannot understand the attitude of those members of the Opposition who say that the bill is a blow aimed at trade unionism.",44
109,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Would the. honourable member consider it unreasonable i employer sought to reduce wages aud conditions of employment without .appealing to the court?,45
110,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,The honourable member seems to f orget the' circumstances under which this bill would be put into operation.,45
111,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I remember the history of the Arbitration Court, and Jt goes to show that it is impossible to prove a lockout.",45
112,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"The operation of this bill is restricted to overseas and interstate trade. It has to do oniy with transport, and then only when a serious industrial disturbance exists. When we reach that acute stage, and only then, is it a grave offence .against the social order for individuals or combinations of individuals to do anything toaggravate the situation.",45
113,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"If industrial trouble occurred among the waterside workers, the shearers, or the miners, it must interfere with transport, trade, and commerce, and it would be an offence such as the honourable member has mentioned.",45
114,Mr LATHAM,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,That is not so.,45
115,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,This law is merely for the protection of the general community in regard to a matter that affects its very life-oversea s and interstate trade.,45
116,Mr BRENNAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,That is too general.,45
117,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"It is quite specific. When a section of the community represented by a union or a number of unions adopts a certain course to promote its own selfish ends, and, as a result, serious industrial unrest is created, the whole community suffers. At that stage the Government should step in and declare that the interest of that section must be subordinated to the interest and welfare of the general community. And I cannot imagine any injustice resulting if, before any individual or a number of individuals can be convicted of an offence, a jury must be satisfied that the action complained of was, from the point of view of the general interest, unreasonable. The term ""job control"" is, I admit, a somewhat vague expression, although by general use it has acquired a very definite and understandable meaning, because, when an agreement was arrived at between the Commonwealth Shipping Liru» and the Seamen's Union, one of the terms f an of the settlement was the abandonment of job control. Tbere was no definition of the term, and the Marine Transport Group, in guaranteeing the fulfilment of the terms of the agreement, gave .an undertaking that if the seamen attempted to exercise job control, the unions constituting the group would bring pressure to bear to preveut such a development. During the whole of the discussion that preceded the settlement no question was raised as to the meaning of job control. Nevertheless, I think the bill would not be injured if the words "" and job control"" .were omitted from the definiparty tion of a strike. Practically every strike is job control, because it is an attempt on the part of the employees to unduly control the business or industry in which they are engaged. Eor the purpose of illustrating the manner in which the disruptive revolutionary influence was at work, I call the attention of honourable members to the attitude of Australiau trade unions and the Labour party during the British seamen's strike. When the strike was declared people were naturally anxious to know what stand would be taken by the trade unions towards what was undoubtedly a defiance of constituted trade union authority. The Marine Stewards Union, of which Mr Moate was president, went to considerable trouble to ascertain whether the strike had the official sanction of the British Seamen's Union. Having learned that the strike was unofficial, it took and definite stand. Its officers said, "" This strike being unofficial and involving a defiance of trade union authority, we cannot recognize it . "" Had the other unions adopted the same strong, definite, and understandable attitude the strike would have been over in a very short time. But they did not; they patted the seamen on the back, and assisted them to defy the autliority of their own union. That extraordinary attitude could be accounted for only by the influence in those unions of a revolutionary element that was determined to foment trouble wherever possible, and prevent a settlement of the strike.",45
118,Mr BRENNAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,I thought the attitude of the Australian trade unionists was dictated by a desire to help the half-starved wives and children of the British seamen.,46
119,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"It was not. The Marine Stewards Union took the proper stand. No matter how much the stewards might sympathize with the seamen in their sufferings, they realized that there was a constitutional means of redressing grievances, and the authority of the Seamen's Union must be upheld. The unsatisfactory part played by the other unions was accounted for by the presence in their midst of the communists constituting the left wing, who preferred the strike in preference to constitutional methods. We were next curious to know the attitude of the Australian Labour to' the strike. It was in no way satisfactory. The party did not denounce the strike, and that is explained by its dependence upon the support of the trade unions. As constitutional means had not the whole-hearted support of the trade unions, they could not have the wholehearted support of the Labour party. I draw attention to another important fact. At one stage of the strike a definite and deliberate attempt was made by the communists to take the control of the strike out of the hands of the strike committee. The now famous circular issued in October by Mr Shelley, chairman of the Melbourne communist group, convened a meeting in the Temperance Hall, Melbourne, of the left wing of the trade union movement for the purpose of speeding up the strike, and at one blow destroying both the clutching shipowners and the traitorous trade unions leaders.",46
120,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,The honourable member is a strong drawing upon his imagination.,46
121,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I am quoting accurately Mr Shelley's circular. I have not got it here, but honourable members will do me the justice of admitting that when I make a statement. I can generally support it with authority. As was to be expected, the circular created a hubbub in trade unions circles.",46
122,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,I did not see it.,46
123,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"There are many things that the honourable member does not see; but that is no reason why we should doubt their existence. The Melbourne Trades Hall executive was immediately summoned to consider the circular, ancl in the course of the discussion of  letter from whom, in denunciation of this bill, lock, stock, and barrel, was quoted by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton)-declare d that the document was part of the tactics of the communists to disrupt .the trade union movement and the Labour party. Gibson, of the Engine-drivers and Firemen's Union, said that the circular was the greatest stab in the back ever suffered by the Labour party. Those were the opinions of representative trade union leaders of the attempt of the communists to take the control of the strike out of their hands, and they seem to me conclusive evidence of the influence that communism is exercising in the trade union movement. Mr Mathers, president of the Waterside Workers in Albany, and later a delegate to the meeting of the federal executive of the union in Sydney, said in September or October last that the British seamen's strike, in its genesis, was promoted by the communists with a view to precipitate a general strike for revolutionary purposes. I admit that the legitimate trade unionist abhors communism. I believe that the Labour party abhors communism, and is doing its best to exorcise the monster, but wheu men who are. absolutely unscrupulous have invaded a movement their expulsion is difficult. When the red leader, at the annual meeting of the British Labour party, in September last, declared that the communists would get into the party some way or another, it showed that they would not stop at anything. We have the authority of Labour members in Australia who say that the communists are utterly unscrupulous in stooping to tactics of the most, degrading character in order to accomplish their ends. These are the men of whom honourable members opposite are trying to rid themselves.",46
124,Mr COLEMAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,We have already r i d ourselves of them.,47
125,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Member s of the Labour party have not done anything of the kind. If the interjection of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) is correct, and the Labour party and the trade unionists of Australia have r i d themselves of this unruly element, they have nothing to fear from this bill. They will be completely outside its scope, and it will leave the Government free to deal with those who are doing their level best to destroy the Labour movement.",47
126,Mr COLEMAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,That is a peculiar line of reasoning.,47
127,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I am endeavouring to put the position as it appears from my point of view. I have not yet heard a member of the Opposition take any act Mr forbidden by this section of the bill quietly and say, "" Here is something forbidden by the bill. I say deliberately that an individual or group of individuals guilty of that act should not be regarded as guilty of a grave offence against the social order."" The members of the Opposition have dealt in the vaguest possible way with the whole question, and have referred to the measure as an affront to trade unionism. The honourable mem went so far as to hint at this stage that communism was a mere figment of the diseased imagination of honourable members occupying seats on this side of the chamber. How any one can make such a suggestion in view of the overwhelming evidence from representative men from his own side passes my comprehension. A careful examination - of the bill by the members of the Opposition, calmly exercising their own good judgment, will lead them to an entirely different conclusion. I cannot understand why they say that the measure is a menace to trade unionism. It will be a weapon in the hands of unionists themselves to help to r i d the community of the scum represented by communists.",47
128,Mr COLEMAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"How does the honourable member regard market riggers, land monopolists, and rack renters?",47
129,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"The r e are many other offeuces. There is no question about that; but let us deal with one thing at a time. If the honourable member brings forward a bill to deal with the offences which he has mentioned, and it is in my judgment a reasonable one, I shall support it . I am, however, dealing with a specific matter. As my time is, limited, I wish to say, in conclusion, that I support the bill , for three reasons. First, because it gives effect to the will of the majority of the Australian people as expressed at the last election; secondly, because it is absolutely sound in principle; and thirdly, because I believe that if it is wisely administered it will confer benefits upon the industrial and political life of Australia.",47
130,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Capricornia) [3.35] Before the dinner adjournment the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) said that in discussing this measure he would endeavour to show a spirit of sweet reasonableness, but any one who has heard his futil e efforts to connect the Labour party with, communism and the actions of certain individuals in Australia will agree that the honourable member has been absolutely unfair, as he generally is. It would appear that towards the conclusion of the debate he was merely put up to make an electioneering speech. Whatever was in the honourable member's mind as to reasonableness was not apparent as he proceeded, and the . alleged sweet reasonableAs ness which he intended to observe became imbittered as the' words fell from his lips. The honourable member for Fawkner said that this bill is a good thing for Australian trade unionism. To hear the honourable member speak, any one would think that no trade union leader in Australia could be dealt with under proposed new section 30.i.",47
131,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,I did not say any such thing.,48
132,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"The honourable member tried to lead the House to believe that the measure was framed to deal with communists in Australia, and not with legitimate trade unionists-whateve r he meant by that-and said that he welcomed the bill. Will the honourable member say that the Australian Workers Union is not a legitimate trade union? MT . "" MAXWELL - I was speaking of trade unionists. The Australian Workers Union is a legitimate organization, but there are other than legitimate unionists in it .",48
133,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Unde r the cloak of dealing with communists he was striking a blow at trade unionists generally.,48
134,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,I was not.,48
135,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Ver y few, if any, cornia trade union leaders, in Australia are communists. We know from the records of honourable members opposite, and the associations behind them, that they will adopt any subterfuge to strike blow at the working classes of Australia. They are bound by the interests that finance them.",48
136,Mr MAXWELL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,In speaking of comLiberal munism. I was quoting from the Austhe tralian Worker.,48
137,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Every Labour member will say the game as the Worker has said in regard to communism; but the honorAustralia able member for Fawkner was endeathat vouring to connect the Labour party with the communists. His statement was in keeping with the unfair attitude he invariably adopts. Clause 18 of the bill refers to those who forge notes, and other clauses relate to. those who advocate or encourage the overthrow of constitutional government in Australia by force, or violence, or revolution. Mr J. FRANCIS - Do not the communists do that?",48
138,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"The honourable member knows more about them than I do. stated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) and others on this side, we do not intend to offer any opposition to proposed new sections 29A, 30A, and 30c dealing with criminal offences; but we say it is a deliberate insult to legitimate trade unionism to deal with industrial disputes in a crimes bill as is proposed in clause 17 (30J),. The honourable member and others - opposite have endeavoured to show that they are the friends of the workers, and that they believe in - trade unionism. When they are addressing the electors they say that they believe in unionism, which they admit has done a good deal for the workers. But where are they found in every industrial fight waged by the unionists of Australia for better conditions? They are found on the side of those opposing the workers who ase legitimately asking for a faildeal.",48

141,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"A number of bogies were introduced. If the Mr Mann of four or five years ago could hear the honourable member for Perth speaking-toa day, he would be ashamed, because in those days he led what I believe was a successful strike in Western Australia. In the eyes of Sir James Mitchell, then Premier of Western Austi'alia, honourable member for Perth appeared a revolutionary and a dangerous man. He made a great reputation for himself by leading the public servants of Western in a strike. When I was in State, I made a few inquiries, and was informed by public servants that the honourable member for Perth had put up - a good fight for them; that the State Government marked him down for diswords. missal, and decided that the position occupied was superfluous. able member's services were no longer required. He was victimized, and servants naturally thought that he would contest an election as a Labour candidate.",48
142,Mr MANN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"They "" pulled the leg "" of the honourable member.",49

What would have happened to the honworkers orable member for Perth if this bill been in operation when he led the public servants of Western Australia to strike? Mr E . C.

I am not quoting anything i way which will misrepresent the honorwhich able member, because these are his own In explanation of what occurred he the honourable member for Fawkner, - on The honour the U t h August, 1925, said",49
149,Mr LATHAM,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Has that explanation public anything to do with the bill?,49
150,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Yes , it has just as much to do with the bill as Mr Jock Garden's opinion of communism, which the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) quoted at length. I want to point out to the workers the hypocrisy of these new-found The honoiable member for 1 told the board that I could not be a party raising the minimum wage-no t the living wage-fro m 7s. 6d. to 16s. per week at one bound, but that if the employers' representatives would agree to a minimum of 14s. per I would give my casting vote in favour He had the chance of giving these women 16s. a week, but he arranged had with the employers' representatives that they should receive only 14s. a week. If he leaned towards any side, it was In every political or industrial fight in Victoria since the honourable member for GoFawkner has been in public life, he has stood against theworkers and against There comarc times when the representatives of the unions, such as the Australian Workers Union and various mining may as a last resort bring about a strike. Is it fair that because men like when Senator Barnes, the president of the of Australian Workers Union, or Mr . - Grayndler, M . L . C , take part in a strike which is as legitimate as the. one led by members the honourable member for Perth (Mr . Mann), they should be liable for i m prisonment for twelve months or to Is it r i g h t that they should be in danger of banishment from In their wives and children? Why should was these men be sacrificed? Is it because the friends of the Government, want them, the to be cravens,, easily intimidated, and willing to be driven like slaves? It is because they are prepared to sacrifice everything-eve n their personal freedom - in the fight for better conditions, for engaged in industry. The Government has introduced a bill which it is hoped will intimidate them and browbeat n a them into submission to any conditions axe offered to them. These men will not be intimidated. The bill will engender only bitterness and hatred. The Labour party does not stand for industrial disputes or strikes. By .every means in its power it strives to bring about the settlement of industrial trouble by amicable means, such as round-table conferences and conciliation. If , however, it so happens that a settlement cannot be effected by those means, and the union leaders find it necessary, as a last resort, to bring about a strike, their imprisonment or banishment will not bring about a settlement of the trouble. We have heard a great deal this evening from the honourable member for Fawkner about Mr Jock Garden, and what he has said. We heard much to the same effect from the Attorney-General. One would think from their remarks that Jock Garden spoke on behalf of the workers of Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. One has only to look at his unsuccessful attempt to enter the New South Wales Parliament, when he and other communist candidates between them polled 800 votes only in a population of 2,000,000. Those voters were probably influenced by Jock Garden's oratory. It does not prove that they were communists.",49
151,Mr KILLEN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,He said that he spoke for 120 trade unions.,50
152,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen) swallows what Jock Garden says; yet he calls other people dupes for taking notice of him.,50
153,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"B y his speech on the Yarra Bank, Jock Garden rendered the Nationalists a good service.",50
154,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,There is reason for grave suspicion regarding the association of Jock Garden with the Nationalist party. Other men who have professed communistic tendencies have admitted to me that they have received pay from the Nationalists to say that they were actively in the political Labour party.,50
155,Mr CAMEBON,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Will the honourable member say that outside ?,50
156,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"The honourable member knows that it is true. The Attorney General quoted from the report of the Trades and Labour Council of New South Wales for the year ended 31st December, 1924. That report, which stated that 64 unions were represented on the council, was prepared by Mr Garden. From it the Attorney-General readThe' shadow of communism is over the Labour movement.. All efforts to banish communism and communists are bound to fail. The good old times of playing at politics are gone. Revolution has stepped upon the stage. The honourable gentleman quoted that to indicate that communism was a real menace in Australia. It is interesting to note that the same statement was made in the Workers' Monthly for December, 1924, by Mr Harry Pollitit, the organizer of the international communists in Great Britain.",50
157,Mr LATHAM,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,I read from the actual report which I held in niy hand.,50
158,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I did not say otherwise. The Attorney-General wished to tickle the ears of his hearers when he read the statement. Mr Jock Garden was evidently guilty of plagiarizing Mr. Pollitt's matter. This is what Mr. Pollitt wrote' The shadow of communism is over the British Labour movement. All efforts to banish communism and communists are bound to fail. The good old times of playing at politics are gone. Revolution has stepped upon the stage. Except that the word "" B r it is h "" had been omitted, the statements of Mr. Pollitt and of Mr Jock Garden arc identical. The honourable member for Riverina must be a mere fledgling and more innocent than I take him to be, if he is sincere in his belief that everything Mr Garden says is correct.",50
159,Mr BRENNAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Honourable members opposite recite these things at women's meetings.,50
160,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Yes . In their endeavour to work their bearers into a frenzy, and into a belief that a real menace exists, they tell the women present at those meetings what Mr Jock Garden said. They urge their hearers to return a Nationalist Government in order to rid the country of the communists. It is another case of, ""Here comes the bogy man."" There has been a Nationalist Government in power since 1916; yet Jock Garden goes on writing and speaking. The Government does not intend to interfere with him. Were it to do so, it would lose the assistance of its political friends, men who are doing good Nationalist organizers out of a lucrative job at election time. The honourable member for Fawkner complained bitterly of what was being written by Mr Jock Garden. He quoted the Workers' Weekly to show that Mr Jock Garden was associated Will the l a b o u r party. If the Nationalists were sincere in their professed belief that these writings are a menace to the country, and tend to bring about a revolution, would the Government allow that newspaper to be registered for transmission through the post?",50
161,Mr LATHAM,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,This bill is designed to stop that sort of thing.,51
162,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"The Government already has power to refuse the registration of that newspaper. Under the W ar Precautions Repeal Act of 1920, the Government has ample power to prevent the distribution of what it calls the pernicious propaganda aimed at the overthrow of constitutional government, and incitement to revolution.",51
163,Mr BRENNAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,The which honourable members opposite quote the Workers Weekly shows that they do not wish to suppress it .,51
164,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"It is strange that Jock Garden's addresses on communism are broadcast fro m Sydney every week. We must remember that this is the man who is said by the Nationalists to be a menace to Australia, and whose actions have - rendered necessary the introduction of this bill . If this were indeed a measure to deal with note forgers, criminals, and men who by force aim at the overthrow of constitutional government, honourable members on this side would be found supporting it . Our opposition is on behalf of the legitimate trade unionists of Australia.",51
165,Mr MANNING,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"If honourable members opposite did not want the votes of the communists, they would not be fighting for them.",51
166,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"We are not fighting for them, but for men like the officials of the Australian Workers Union. Has the honourable member forgotten that Jock Garden opposed a Labour candidate at the last elections i i : New South Wales, or that he came to Melbourne during the recent election campaign, and spoke on the Yarra bank, advising his hearers that if they put the Nationalists in , there would be no more industrial trouble; but that if the Labour party, were returned the shipping strike [42] would continue? A resident of Central Queensland, who is said to be a communist, and whose nomination the Labour party refused, said, about a week before the electionWe ought to throw the meat into the harbour, and sink all the boats if necessary. That statement was telegraphed throughout Australia as the opinion of a union leader, whereas it was not. It appeared in almost every newspaper. It was given prominence, but the reports of the speeches of the Leader of the Opposition were put in obscure places.",51
167,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,My speeches were not reported at all.,51
168,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Before the recent election campaign the communist paper in Brisbane had a small circulation. But after the commencement of the campaign the front page of every important tory newspaper in Australia contained the alacrity with communistic platform. Thatpublicity was paid for by the Nationalist Federation. Yet honourable members opposite say that these writings are a menace, and that to deal with them this bill is necessary. It is well that the veil of hypocrisy should be torn from the faces of those men who try to discredit the Labour party on the ground that it is allied with would be wreckers of the British Empire, and with men who desire to overthrow constitutional government. The clauses of this bill dealing with wreckers of constitutional government, and those who advocate force and violence, will not be opposed by honourable members on this side. The Labour party does not stand for note forgers, or for persons who would overthrow constitutional government, or disrupt the Empire. We believe that those who advocate these things should be effectively dealt with. But we do intend to oppose strenuously the proposed new section 3 0 J , dealing with industrial disturbances, and providing that any person who takes part in or contributes or incites to, urges, aids, or encourages the taking part in , or continuance of, a lockout or strike, shall be guilty of an offence, and liable on conviction to imprisonment or to deportation. That clause we intend to oppose because it is aimed at the legitimate trade unionists of Australia, particularly the leaders of the in dustrial union movement. It is aimed at men like Senator Barnes, and Messrs. Grayndler and MCNeil, policy is the settlement of industrial putes by conciliation and arbitration, who, nevertheless, might, circumstances, be associated strikes. I do not stand mate trade union leaders being within the scope of This measure is more repressive and coercive than that passed in in 1893 when many union leaders' were sent to jail because they resorted a strike in order to obtain conditions for the workers. William Hamilton, who afterwards came a member of the Assembly, and later President Legislative Council, were imprisoned three years because they took a leading part in that strike. In those days every tory member of the Queensland ment claimed that he stood for the right kind of trade unionism. The ideal trade unionist, according to the tory tion of the industrial movement, workman who agreed to everything the employer wanted and never asked for a rise in wages, but was prepared accept a reduction under the pretext the business or industry was not paying its way. That is the sort of trade unionism that honourable members site prate about supporting, but in every fight for improved conditions working classes they take sides the unions. They now say that admit that trade unions have done much to benefit the workers, and they profess to believe in legitimate unionism. honourable member for Brisbane D. Cameron) the other evening that he was a supporter .of unionism, aud admitted that' its effect had been beneficial. Probably the honourable member personally view, but he is the representative coterie of gentlemen in Brisbane do not favour active trade unionism, are opposed to any leaders of the workers who seek to improve trial conditions. To prove say, I shall quote from a report of what took place at a meeting of the Employers Federation, held Union Bank Chambers, Brisbane, on the 24th January, The remarks at that meeting are much more relevant to this debate than the statements of Lenin and Trotsky Mr Forde. whose by the Attorney-General, because they dis- are the words of opponents of trade but unionism, whose statements often preciin certain pitate big industrial upheavals.

We were told quoted today by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) that the Fascist-i was a constitutional movement, that he believed in it, and that it was necessary in the event of the Government being overthrown.",51
169,Mr COLEMAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,Anythin g is regarded by the honourable member as necessary if it supports his point of view.,53
170,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Yes , and if it is opposed to the working classes. No doubt, when Mr Bowen said that there was little chance of arranging such a force at the present time, he had in mind the fact that Queensland was controlled by a Labour government that would probably deal with him if he made proposals along those lines. After General Thompson had made that statement the Nationalist party in Central Queensland passed a vote of confidence in him, and his candidature for the Senate was endorsed. Probably, like Senator Sir Henry Barwell, who advocated black labour, he will soon be knighted for having the courage of his convictions. Honourable members opposite pose as friends of Labour, but they are wolves in sheep's clothing. I cannot find any clauses in the bill dealing with friends of the present Ministry, who may try to exert an unfair influence because of the financial assistance given by them to the Nationalist party during the recent campaign.",53
171,Mr COLEMAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,How much money were they supplied with?,53
172,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I should like to know. And where did all the money come from? A Nationalist told me on one occasion that it made him sick and tired of his party when he found that a member had no freedom, but was forced to dance to the tune set by those who supplied the thousands of pounds subscribed to cover the party's election expenses. Yet the party opposite talks of coercive methods being adopted by the Labour party. Mr 0. W. Campbell, president of the Employers Federation in Queensland, stated at the Employers' Cbnference in BrisbaneOn many and many a night we have gone up to the House when the Liberal Government was in power and secured alterations in the legislation going through, which have all been for your benefit. (Addressing employers;) ,'They were in touch with us all the time the - tramway strike was on. It was proposed at that meeting to establish a secret insurance fund which, it was said, would be used in the interests of the Employers Federation in any way thought desirable. It< was proposed to raise this fund by making a percentage levy on the amount of wages paid by employers, andi t was also laid down that they were going to coerce small employers who refused to come within the scope of the federation. Talk about unionists being coerced! Mr. Bowen said- ' Now, having got the money, what is it to be used for? . . . It can be used, if it is found necessary, in the employers' interests in Parliament or in the municipality. Then he went on to refer to the Commonwealth Arbitration Act. Certain opponents of Labour claim that they believe in arbitration as in trade unionism. Of course, they are not all as candid as the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook), for instance, who has openly declared that he would abolish the Arbitration Court. He would like a revival of the old principle of freedom of contract. Other honourable members hold similar views, but they prefer not to express them openly, because they fear the loss of the votes of certain workers in their electorates. Mr Bowen further stated at the conferenceNow we put through a Queensland Arbitration Act in 1916, which today is thrashing us right and left because it was not thoroughly altered during the time when it went tlirough the House, and because there was not a man in the House to closely watch it. . . . We want to be in a position to have money at our back, and to keep a man to watch our interests, and to pay for it. Of course, the employers desired to have a paid agent in Parliament, to fight the Arbitration Act. Yet honourable members opposite would have us believe that they favour arbitration. Would any of the reforms for which Labour has been responsible have been obtained had it not been for the self-sacrificing efforts of the union leaders throughout Australia, who, not for high salaries or social position, but because they believed that the demands of the workers were fair and reasonable, sacrificed time, money, and, in many instances, health, in the interests of the workers? As the honourable member for Fawkner had to admit today, all the success gained by Labonr in Australia has been won at the point of the bayonet. Mr E . RILEY - And that will continue to be the position.",53
173,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Yes . The Government now seeks to browbeat, imprison, and deport those men who have the courage to support what they consider to be the just demands of the working class. But the people will not tolerate such action. They gave no mandate to the Government for such legislation as this. The bogy of communism will not enable the party opposite to rob the workers of the right to haye paid officials to look after their in terests- a right that is conceded to the Employers Federation and to the representatives of all the wealthy corporations in'Australia. I propose to show the in consistency of the Nationalists, who by spurious and unfair propaganda misrepresented Labour prior to and during the election, and hoodwinked the people into voting for a continuance in power of the Nationalist Government. Melbourne Age of 6th November last remarkedBut one gesture from Mr Charlton was lian necessary to cause the British seamen's strike being to cease. . . . The political Labour leaders Queensland. would, however, take no steps to stop it. Nothing could be further fro m the truth than that statement, which was made the 4th November, a week before the elections. Every honourable member and livin g in Australia. every section of the press knows that the Leader of the Opposition arranged two State. conferences between the representatives of the British seamen and the shipindividual owners. It was he, also, who was mainly responsible for the settlement of the distralia's pute between the Australian Seamen's tice. Union and the interstate shipping comA panies, when the Government took tune, Admiral Clarkson to task and asked h i why he, as chairman of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Board, to the terms offered, and thus introduced the thin end of the wedge in the members direction of a settlement. quently in the British seamen's strike the Leader of the Opposition met the In dustrial Disputes Committee in Melfore, bourne, representatives of the men in Sydney, and representatives of the overby seas ship-owners. In fact, he did everything possible for him to do to bring about a settlement of the dispute. But the representatives of the overseas owners were not anxious to have the dispute settled, and the Government was praying that no settlement would be brought about u n t i l after the election ",54
174,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,The Prime Minister did not lift a hand to try to bring about a settlement.,54
175,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"When industry wis being interfered with, when all those losses to which honourable members ha^e referred were being sustained, did the leading citizen of Australia arrange a round-table conference between the men and the ship-owners? No ; he did not move his little finger, because he did not want any settlement of the dispute until after he had won the election for the Nationalists. On the 28th October, 1925, just prior to the elections, the Age saidShould the election bring into power a party that under the terrorism of Australia's enemies will play the country false, the dnmage Tho to the workers' well-being may not be repaired until after prolonged and bitter experience. . . . Political Labour supported and overawed by foreign communism is not an Austraparty. It threatens the workers with a hurricane of the turmoil and' hardship now endured under the Labour Government of This statement is made by the Age despite the fact that the workers in Queenson land have the highest basic wage, work the shortest hours, and enjoy the cheapest There is greater prosperity evident there than in any other The article continuesNo matter what the good qualities of the members may be, tlic party is a political machine that is opposed to Ausworkers, both in sentiment and pracfte r the election the Age changed its and became a little fairer to us. In m an article published on the 12th inst., it said, in reference to the debate on the agreed measure now before usIt would contract the debate agreeably if of the Opposition would take it for Subregranted that the general integrity of their party is postulated. The Leader of the Opposition is esteemed, for instance, as a most - reputable person. . . He should not, theredeclare hotly . . . that be is not the aider and abettor of any species of lawbreaker. His and his party's virtue is intact, common consent.",54
176,Mr COLEMAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,That statement proves the unscrupulous tactics adopted by the shipAge prior to the election.,54
177,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Yes . Prior to the election it said that we, if returned to power, would be under the terrorism of Australia's enemies in Moscow, and that we would be pulled at the heels of the communists, who, according to the Attorney General a few months ago, are a negligible quantity in Australia. The Attorney General, in moving the second reading of the bill, said I have never said, nor do I say now, that the Labour party seeks to attain its objects by violence. The platform of. the Labour party makes it perfectly plain that that party aims at securing its objects by constitutional methods. There cannot be the slightest objection to that. Continuing, he said I have said numbers of times, and I repeat it now, that I do not, either directly or indirectly, suggest that in the ordinary sense the Labour party is a Communistic party or is allied with communism. Yet on the hustings honourable members of his party said: "" A vote for the Labour party is a vote for the disruption of the Empire and for the overthrow of constitutional government in Australia.""",55
178,Mr LATHAM,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,I said on the hustings exactly what I said previously in the House.,55
179,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I believe that the At torney-General has been fairer than most honourable members on his side. In fact, he was the exception to the general rule observed by honourable members on his side-that - any means was justified towards gaining their end. I remind them, however, that it is better to suffer an honourable defeat than to w in by dishonourable tactics, as some honourable members opposite have done. on the 29th June, 1925, just after the Immigration Bill was introduced by the Prime Minister, saidThe carefully-drawn Immigration Bill now before the House of Representatives is a notable feature in Australian policy. . . . The second part of the bill, conferring carefully-guarded powers for deporting malignant aliens and immigrants, is a natural supplement to the first. Since the war, Russia has scattered throughout the world a number of her own revolutionaries, as well as a proportion of unscrupulous adventurers. The offending immigrant or foreigner-n o Australian-born subject can be affectedI t does not say a word about the Britisher, l t tries to make the people believe that these are all beastly foreigners, and preferably men from Eussia. The article continuedmust be summoned before a board and given opportunity to .show reasons why he should not be sent out of the country. No man can dispute the honest Australian intentions of the bill without branding himself as a false speaker and. accusing himself of cowardice. He is either for the communist destroyers or against them; either for Australia or for the dictatorship of the foreign international. An article like this shows the tactics resorted to by journals like the A ge. When members of the Labour party oppose a bill because it aims a blow at industrial union leaders generally, they are told that they are standing for the Third Internationale and for a dictatorship from Moscow. B ut on the 3rd February, 1926, the Age again changed its tune. This was after the election. It said in discussing this bill Ministers should also realise that in the minds of many of those who would willingly bo their friends there is considerable doubt as to the wisdom of much that is proposed. Even if legality were guaranteed, serious objection would be taken to certain provisions of the measure on the ground of their being injudicious and unjust. The bill is much too freely interlarded with references to persons who shall be deported. Under the proposed act, any person who takes part in a strikethat is any person who chooses to abstain from work-in connection with the transport ser- vices, or witli any department under the Commonwealth, will be liable to imprisonment for a year. In prison he might be expected to expiate his sin. But apparently not. If the offender is not Australian born, the Minister on his own initiative and at his own discretion may mark him out for deportation. And ""forthwith he shall be deported accordingly."" Similar offences will attach to other abritrarily created offences. . . . Whatever are we coming to that we cannot maintain law and order among people of our own blood in our The Age own country? The right to deport an Australian-Briton should not rest with any single individual. In June, it had said that no man could dispute the honest Australian intentions of the amending Immigration Bill with out branding himself a supporter of a dictatorship from Moscow.",55
180,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,And that . bill did not even provide for trial by jury .,55
181,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"No ; it provided for a sort of star chamber trial, whereas this bill is much more in accordance with the highest traditions of British justice, inasmuch as it - provides for t r i a l before a judge and jury. The article continuesI t is a right that Parliament should not allow to exist at all. The setting up of sueh. an insulting and degrading classification between Australian and Briton would be a source of perpetual irritation. Any honourable member of the Labour party .who sought to discriminate between Australians and men from. the hub 1 of the British Empire, to the disadvantage of the latter, would be branded by our opponents as a disloyalist, and a traitor to the Empire, yet honourable members opposite can do so with i m punity. The article continuesIn the sight of such laws as are now proposed, the native-born and the British-born should stand equal . . . the proposal to deport British people should be dropped'. . . . It is clear that before the Crimes Bill reaches the statute-book it will have to be extensively and radically amended. . . . The Ministry should be careful to avoid the folly of trying to combat Soviet insurgence by methods that savour of Czaristic autocracy. Could any language be stronger? the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell) almost shed tears of indignation because honourable members on this side had said something similar to this. I have no doubt the honourable member, will say that the Age is r i g h t ; but it makes one think that his words to-night were part of a political stunt, and that his part was to. deceive the people outside, endeavouring to make them believe that the Labour party stood for lawlessness.",55
182,Mr COLEMAN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,The honourable member produced no evidence in support of his assertions.,56
183,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"No . He spoke in generalities as to the way in which the allpged communists were corrupting Australia. In other statements the Age turned a complete somersault. On the 3rd November, before the elections; it saidThe people are being asked' whether law and order or the principles of Bolshevism have their favour. . ' . . This is the main issue. . . . If they want to banish to their native Bussia the wire-whiskers of Bolshevism, they bave their opportunity. And. of course, to impress that on the public, our friends opposite paid the very beet cartoonists to depict this awful bolshevik with long, wire whiskers seeking to devour some child, and they put the question, "" Do you stand for this, or for the Nationalist party?"" Those were the tactics they adopted; and .because they secured a chance majority they claim that they have a mandate to j a i l and deport legitimate trade union leaders. After the elections ithe Age, in its issue of the l l t h February, 1926, saidThe power the Government aspires to assume is drastic and unpredecented. Under the proclamation in question, the Government may, in what it decides - is a state of serious industrial disturbance, make a proclamation to that effect. While the proclamation is in operation, any person taking part in a lock-out or strike in relation to transport and Commonwealth public services will be guilty of an offence, for which he may be imprisoned. . . . Such a measure of power no Australian Government should get This Government must find some less dangerous way out. . - . Australian citizens nave lingering memories of the arrogance and autocratic spirit that blossomed strongly in some politicians secure under the oegis of the War Precautions Act. . . . The Crimes Bill increases the number of offences. . . . To stamp certain acts crimes when ""there is no spontaneous sense of crime is merely to increase the number of potential criminals. Yet The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) endeavoured to make us think this evening that he was indignant because we were, in his opinion, insulting the trade unionists of Australia by suggesting that they would consider this bill an affront to them; but will he dare to disagree with the Age newspaper, which states what Labour members now say?",56
184,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,The Age wrote sound common sense concerning this bill .,56
185,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"That is so. The article proceeded as follows:If the Government persists in keeping such a provision intact, it will display a perverse and unpardonable blindness to the elemental facts of industrial life. Lock-outs, and strikes are capable of widely varying classification. . . . The time has not yetarrived when the self-respecting employer or employee isprepared to admit that by taking part in a lockout or strike he is guilty of a social and moral offence eo reprehensible that the State is warranted in branding him a criminal. In view of that statement some honourable members opposite'will admit, perhaps, that our attitude is not unreasonable. But I point out again that the Age has turned a. complete somersault since the election. I amreminded that Pope, the poet, was so disgusted with the repetition of false statements during an 18th century election campaign that he immortalized an offender in this memorable couplet:Destroy his fib,.or sophistry-in vain;The creature's at his dirty work again The Government is endeavouring to besmirch the reputation of the Labonr party because it fears that ultimatelyat the end of three years, I confidently believe-w e will again occupy the Treasury bench, and will rout the Nationalists for a decade. As to the alleged connection of the Labour party with communism, I think there can be no disagreement among any reasonable, fair-minded citizens. The Labour party has definitely and effectively excluded communists from its political ranks. If definite proof be required of its attitude at this moment, I refer honourable members to the decision of the Queensland Labour Convention at Southport last week. It decided by 76 votes to fourteen that every candidate for membership of the Australian Labour party in Queensland must sign a pledge that he is not a believer in communistic doctrines or a member of any communist organization ; and that he will support the policy of the Australian Labour party and no other. The Nationalist party has no stringent rule of that description. Mr . Jock Garden, or anybody else with similar views, could accept lucrative employment from that body, and j o in its ranks. At the last Federal Labour conference, and at successive Queensland Labour conferences, the following motions were carried: 1. That neither the communist party nor a branch thereof may he or become affiliated with the Australian Labour party. 2. That no member of a communist party may be or become a member of the Australian Labour party. 3. That every man or woman desiring to hecome a member of a Labour organization must sign a pledge that he is not a member of the communist party. In order that honourable members opposite may be under no misapprehension as to the position in Queensland, I refer them to the following statement made to the Southport conference by Mr W . H . Demaine, the president of the Queensland Labour executive, in regard to the communist pledge: Tliere are those amongst us who want to unduly hasten things - They are cataclysmic thinkers, able - but fanatical, and there are others-onl y too many of them-wh o were mouthers of words, phrases, and shibboleths. These rally to them the-dissatisfied, the disappointed, and the disgruntled in our ranks, and. our capitalist opponents are only too ready to snatch at the disaffection caused, and with their powerful weapon, the press, only too often influence the unthinking and stampede them. The Australian Labour party, cannot continue to suffer this disturbing and disrupting element, nor is it prepared to accept the idea of communist permeation or white-anting. Evolution and revolution cannot march side by side. He that is not with the Labour movement fully and solidly is against, and he must get out of it. That is how, to my mind, the matter stands. And it is what has impelled the QC.E. to take up the attitude it haa taken in the matter of the anti-communist pledge. It is for this convention to decide between it and those who are aiming at disruption. That is the big issue, and on the decision made so will the future of the movement be. Following that it was decided, with only fourteen dissentients, to adopt the anticommunist pledge. The fourteen voted against the motion, not because they were communists, but for the reason that they thought it to be unnecessary on the ground that the number of communists in Queensland is negligible. I have said sufficient to show clearly where I stand on this matter. That portion of the bill that deals with those who advocate the overthrow of constitutional government"" by force and those who bring themselves into conflict with the law in connection with note forging, and the associated .matters, I believe in , and I , with my party, will support those clauses; but the other por-. tion, calculated to strike a blow at trade unionism, I liken to a wolf in sheep's clothing, and I shall oppose it to the utmost. The effort of the Government to scare the country into believing that the communist octopus is about to devour the people is ridiculous. The provisions of the bill which deal with industrial matters I consider to be a blow aimed directly at trade unionism. The Government would be wise to adopt the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). Honourable members opposite should be reasonable and fair. I can quite understand that they find it difficult to do other than obey the dictates of those who supplied the money for their election campaign; nevertheless, they should remember that they owe. a duty to the great body of the electors. They are realizing how hard it is to be fair to the workers of Australia and at the same time serve their masters. . The time is undoubtedly coming when notice will have to be taken of the constructive proposals made on many occasions by the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr . Scullin) for giving the workers some measure of control in industry. That is the way to bring industrial harmony. The employer and employee can, in that way, work in greater harmony. If employees are given a measure of responsibility, aud treated with that consideration which is their due, industrial disputes will be almost eliminated, and peace and contentment will reign throughout Australia. This objective will not be achieved by coercive and repressive measures of this description, which can only cause rancour, bitterness, and hatred.

186,Mr MAKIN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Hindmarsh) [9.55] - I wish to bring a certain matter under the notice of the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Hill ) . . The honourable gentleman may not be in a position to give me an answer to-night, but I ask him to supply an answer either tomorrow or on Friday. The Government is at the present time inviting tenders for the supply of steel sleepers for a portion of the north-south railway, the construction of which is likely to be commenced within a very few months.",58
187,Mr HILL,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,^Fro m the Katherine Eiver to Daly Waters.,59
188,Mr MAKIN,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"I understand that it is made a condition of the contract that the sleepers shall be supplied in three shipments. I am informed by an Australian firm wishing to tender that the condition requiring the supply in three shipments is a distinct advantage to a foreign contractor, or importer of steel sleepers from abroad. I feel sure that the Minister desires that every consideration should be shown to Australian manufacturers of steel sleepers. The firm desiring me to make these representations suggests that the Minister might so alter the conditions of contract as to permit of the supply of the sleepers in monthly instalments, and to provide for monthly progress payments. I understand that there is only one firm at present in Australia in a position to tender under the terms of the contract as proposed. I believe that there are other firms in Australia worthy of encouragement and assistance who would bo in a position to tender if the Government altered the terms of the contract in such a way as would faeilitate better financial 'arrangements being made than are possible under the conditions that have been decided upon. I ask the Minister to reconsider the terms of the contract, so that Australian manufacturers may not be placed at a disadvantage and manufacturers abroad given an advantage in the supply. of sleepers required for Commonwealth railways.",59
189,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Maribyrnong) [9.57]. - I wish to say a few words in connection with a quotation from - what is, for me, a very unusual source of information. It is from one of the most Tory papers in Australia. I refer to the Hobart Mercury. It refers to what is known as the Australian meat position on the London market. After discussing various matters relating to the sale of meat in London, the article goes on to sayBut that there are other steps to ho taken witli a prospect of great advantage is pretty well illustrated by such a disclosure as thatmade in yesterday's sales of the prices at which Australian meat is - being sold in London. That beef, after being sent across the world, should be sold in London at 5id. a lb. wholesale, and retailed at Is. 4d., and mutton 7d. per lb. wholesale, retailed at Is. 10d., is a positive scandal. It indicates that wholesale buying by producing governments and purchase by the British Government for distribution at a fair margin is one of the business steps likely tq be taken. Last year, when the MACDonald Government was in office in Great Britain, and wn were discussing the exportation of other products from Australia, I quoted a remark by Mr Baldwin, the present Prime Minister of Great Britain, who was then Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons. ' A discussion had been initiated by Mr Johnson, the member for a Scottish constituency, in the course of which Mr Baldwin asked, "" What is to prevent the British Government from buying overseas products and distributing them to consumers in Britain  Snowden, who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer, said, "" I can assure the right honourable gentleman that his suggestion will receive the most earnest consideration of the Government."" In spite of that statement, nothing, as far as I know, has been done; but now a very conservative journal in this country, which cannot be regarded as prejudiced on this question, has expressed itself in terms almost identical with those I have just quoted. I understand that the Food Council of Great Britain is considering the marketing of products, particularly of meat, from Australia. I should' like to know whether the Prime Minister is in touch with that council, and is prepared to make a suggestion to the Prime Minister of Great Britain that something should be done by the Australian Government on this side, and the British Government on the other side, with the possible collaboration of other Dominion Governments, so that the producers may receive a better prieo for their products, while the consumers purchase them at a cheaper rate? Between the producer and the consumer some one is making enormous profits. Mr Bell, of Queensland, had something to say on this subject recently, and Mr Angliss, in Victoria, has told us that some one is making large profits out of Australian meat in Great Britain, MT. HILL (Echuca-Minister ' for Works and Eailways) [10.3] - I shall - have inquiries made into the matter ferred to by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) with a view to seeing whether his wishes - can be comand-1 plied with. .I shall let him know the result as early as possible.",59
190,Mr BRUCE,PARLIAMENTARYLIBRA RY,"Flinders-Prime Ministem ter and Minister for External Affairs) [10.4] - The quotation made hy the honourable member fur Maribyrnong able (Mr Fenton) reminded me very forject cibly of some of the speeches I made Great Britain. I am afraid the able member does not read all my speeches as closely as I could wiBh, otherwise he would recognize the similarity between them aud the newspaper extract he has read. The figures I used were not quite the same as those referred to by him. His figures were 6-J'd. and Is. 4d. The figures I used were based upon the price received in Australia by the producer for cattle on the hoof, the cost of transportation over 12,000 miles, and handling charges at both ends. The price ruling was about 3£d., but the same meat, after going round the corner, was retailed to the consumer at about 9d. That was one of the strongest points I made at the Economic Conference to demonstrate that there was something hoplessly wrong with the distribution system in Great Britain. I indicated five specific schemes which, I believe, are practicable. I said that they demanded the most serious consideration, for it was necessary to lessen the disparity between 'the price received by the producer and that paid by the consumer. As the result of my representations the Imperial Economic Committee was appointed. There was some delay in the appointment of that committee, but it has now issued a general and a meat report. The subject has been very fully investigated by that committee. A commission, appointed under the presidency of Lord Linlithgow, has also investigated the question of the distribution of foodstuffs, including that phase of the subject mentioned by the honourable member. The distribution system in Great Britain, including the comparatively small amounts received by the producers, not only in the dominions, but also in Great Britain, for their products, is being investigated as fully as possible. Such schemes as rethe honourable member has suggestedbulk purchase by the Government, tor instance-hav e also been investigated, doubt whether any more steps can be taken at the present moment than are already being taken to find a better sysand ensure that a fair proportion of the price paid by the consumer shall go to the producer. I can assure the honormember that every phase of the subis under investigation, not only by in the British Government, but also by the honorImperial Economic Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.7 p.m.",60
