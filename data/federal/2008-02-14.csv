13,The SPEAKER,NOES,"Pursuant to standing order 17, I lay on the table my warrant nominating the honourable members for Lyons, Pearce, Barker and Braddon to be members of the Speaker's panel to assist the chair when requested to do so by the Speaker or Deputy Speaker. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT (ENHANCED ALLOWANCES) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",20
14,Ms MACKLIN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (9.28 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill delivers on the government's $4 billion election commitment to help older Australians, carers and people with disability make ends meet. It will give much needed financial support to around three million eligible Australians who are finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet, including pensioners and self-funded retirees. This government understands the cost of living pressures faced by many in our community. Increases in the cost of living and staple items like food and housing mean those on fixed incomes and those caring for the most vulnerable in our society need our support. That is why the government is acting to help with these pressures. Since being elected, we have already announced an inquiry into grocery prices, and we are delivering on our commitment for a full-time petrol commissioner. Today we are delivering on another commitment, to increase utilities and telephone allowances for eligible seniors, carers and people with disability. This bill will amend the social security law, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 to give increased, and more timely, financial support to older Australians, people with a disability, carers and veterans. Through these measures, these Australians on fixed incomes will be able to plan more easily to meet their regular financial commitments. First, the bill will help older Australians receiving income support payments such as age pension and veterans service pension by significantly increasing the utilities allowance. This measure will benefit over 1.7 million aged income support recipients, 250,000 Commonwealth seniors health card holders, 700,000 disability support pensioners and 120,000 carer payment recipients. The annual rate of utilities allowance will increase from $107.20 to $500 and will be paid in quarterly instalments of $125 for singles and eligible couples combined. This equals a total annual payment of $500 for singles and $250 for each member of a couple. We understand that these bills come in four times a year so that is why the allowance will be paid quarterly. Paying the allowance regularly gives older Australians peace of mind and certainty that they will have the funds on hand to pay their bills. Secondly, the bill expands the qualification criteria for utilities allowance to cover people under pension or qualifying age and receiving a carer payment, a disability support pension, an invalidity service pension, a partner service pension, an income support supplement, a bereavement allowance, a widow B pension or a wife pension. This equals a total annual payment of $500 for singles and $250 for each member of a couple in one of these new groups. Under these first two elements, more Australians will receive more support to help with their utilities costs. Thirdly, the bill significantly increases the rate of seniors concession allowance, which is paid to self-funded retirees, from $218 to a total annual payment of $500 for each eligible individual. In another change to make life easier for seniors, this higher rate will also be paid on a quarterly basis on the same days as utilities allowance. Lastly, the bill provides a higher rate of telephone allowance for older Australians, carers and people with a disability if they receive income support and have an internet connection at home. The new rate of $132 a year for singles will be available to those who have a home internet connection, an increase from the standard rate of telephone allowance of $88 a year. The higher rate of telephone allowance will also be available for eligible veterans and their dependants who have an internet connection at home. The government understands that, in today's Australia, the internet is a critical means for families to stay in touch with their loved ones. Some Australians on income support pensions and payments can be at risk of becoming isolated from the community, and that is why we are helping them stay in touch with friends, children and grandchildren around the country and the world via the internet. Affordable home access to the internet has the potential to connect them with a new world of communication, information and entertainment. The government is proud to be delivering on these important election commitments. Debate (on motion by Mr John Cobb) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (VET FEE-HELP ASSISTANCE) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Gillard. Bill read a first time - VET Second Reading",20
15,Ms GILLARD,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (9.35 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Assistance) Bill 2008 is to implement the original policy intent of the VET FEE-HELP legislation passed through the parliament last year. That legislation extended the FEE-HELP student loan scheme to important parts of the vocational education and training sector, but it was poorly framed and now requires the corrections set out in this bill in order to operate effectively. Consequently it has fallen to this parliament and to the Rudd Labor government to fix the incompetence of the Howard-Costello government and specifically the incompetence of the former minister for education, who is now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is to be regretted that parliamentary time needs to be devoted to this patch-up job. But unfortunately there is no choice. If the errors in the current legislation are not corrected they will have budgetary consequences. The objective of VET FEE-HELP is to provide an Australian government loan to ease the up-front financial burden for full-fee paying students in high level vocational education and training courses, including diploma and advanced diploma courses that have appropriate credit transfer into a higher education award. Specifically the amendment will ensure: - VET FEE-HELP is restricted to eligible full-fee paying students in diploma, advanced diploma, graduate certificate and graduate diploma courses; and providers have credit transfer arrangements with a higher education provider in place for each VET accredited diploma or advanced diploma qualification. As it stands the current legislation does not achieve these aims and if left without amendment could result in an unintended extension of FEE-HELP far beyond the stated intention. Such extension is not budgeted for in the forward estimates and could prove extremely costly. In the current inflationary climate such an unintended expenditure cannot be justified. The current legislation fails to adequately set out the fee arrangements under which VET FEE-HELP can be offered to a student, leaving this wide open to a full range of VET courses. The proposed amendments ensure that VET FEE-HELP is to be made available only to students paying full fees, and a mechanism is put in place to ensure that the minister has clear information from VET providers on this matter. Further, the current legislation does not ensure that, in order to offer VET FEE-HELP to students, VET providers must have credit transfer arrangements in place. This is corrected in the proposed amendments. Increasing Australia's productivity is cal to our future economic prosperity and enhancing the skills and capacity of our workforce is a key to productivity. VET FEE-HELP provides a strong financial underpinning to help more Australians gain essential skills through vocational education and training. VET FEE-HELP enhances opportunities for individuals to pursue study in the vocational education and training sector at the diploma level and above without the disincentive of up-front payment of full fees. FEE-HELP loans are not subject to income and assets tests and repayments do not commence until an individual's income is above a minimum repayment threshold. VET FEE-HELP will create opportunities for Australians to pursue new careers or lift their qualification levels to diploma, advanced diploma, graduate certificate or graduate diploma. It opens the way for greater movement between vocational education and higher education. Aligning student financing arrangements between the sectors reduces the funding inconsistencies which can sometimes get in the way of students seeking to move between the sectors. It also eases the administrative load for multisector providers of both VET and higher education. We anticipate that over the next four years more than 6,000 students will benefit under this scheme. Higher level VET qualifications are the way of the future for skills developmentand the Rudd Labor government has made them a centrepiece of its Skilling Australia for the Future policy. Our Skilling Australia for the Future policy will increase and deepen the skills capacity of the Australian workforce. The government's plan for our future skilled workforce will close the skills gap in the Australian economy in three key ways: firstly, by fundcritiing an additional 450,000 training places over the next four years. The first 20,000 of these new training places will be available from April 2008. These initial places will be directed to those outside the workforce and will help many Australians gain employment and stimulate workforce participation rates. Secondly, we will ensure that most of the 450,000 places lead to a higher level qualification. The new places will offer high-quality training opportunities which better suit the needs of our economy in the future. In an increasingly globalised world, we need to increase not only the number of Australians with skills and qualifications but also the depth of skills in our workforce if we are to drive up productivity and compete internationally. The Business Council of Australia estimates that nearly half of the qualifications needed to meet the predicted demand for skilled workers over the next decade will need to be at certificate III level or above. A 2007 study by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research highlighted the importance of associate professional occupations in the context of globalisation, technological change and the changing nature of work yet shows that in recent years there has been a decrease in the level of participation in diploma and advanced diploma qualifications in the vocational education and training sector. Thirdly, we are placing industry demand at the heart of the skills training system through setting up Skills Australia and by strengthening industry skills councils. The Rudd Labor government's Skilling Australia for the Future policy will give skills training in critical high-level skills a much-needed boost. VET FEE-HELP provides an important underpinning for growing participation in high-level skills training. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr John Cobb) adjourned. NA (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES No. 1) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Gillard. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",22
16,Ms GILLARD,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (9.42 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Yesterday marked a significant moment in Australia's history, with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd offering an apology to the stolen generations as the first act of business of the 42nd Parliament. The historic act of saying sorry, after decades of division and despair, heralds the opportunity for a new beginning for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians to reconcile and move forward as one nation. Saying sorry is an important and symbolic act of recognition of the past hurts and mistreatment suffered by the stolen generations. But, as the Prime Minister acknowledged yesterday, it is an act that must now be followed through with practical measures to overcome the extreme disadvantage faced by too many Indigenous Australians. This is an issue that is beyond partisan politics. Yesterday the Prime Minister reached out to the Leader of the Opposition to form a new partnership across party lines, to form a joint policy commission to start work on closing the gap in housing-an offer which was accepted in a true bipartisan spirit. We must set practical targets and act on them urgently. We must close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. The Prime Minister yesterday made a commitment to close the gap in life expectancy, in educational achievement and in employment opportunities; a commitment to have the gap in literacy, numeracy and employment outcomes and opportunities for Indigenous Australians within a decade; and a commitment to have the gap in infant mortality rates and life expectancy within a generation. Education is the foundation upon which every individual builds his or her participation in society, their capacity to work and their ability to lead a healthy and active life. There is much work to be done to close the gap in education. Despite the fact that all the evidence shows us that, if you finish school you improve your chances of getting a further qualification, getting a job and increasing your lifetime earnings, only four in 10 Indigenous students stay at school until year 12. This is 35 per cent lower than the 75 per cent of non-Indigenous students who stay at school. The most recent national literacy and numeracy benchmark data shows that in all areas across Australia the percentage of Indigenous students meeting the benchmarks is significantly lower than for non-Indigenous students. Most concerning are the results for Indigenous students in year 7 numeracy. Less than half-only 48 per cent-of Indigenous students met the benchmark in 2006. The gap between Indigenous and all students in the 2006 benchmarks range from 13 percentage points in year 3 reading to 32 percentage points in year 7 numeracy. We will focus strongly on improving literacy and numeracy outcomes for Indigenous children and on closing these unacceptable gaps between the achievements and opportunities of our Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. This bill is a small but important first step. There are an estimated 10,000 schoolaged children in Indigenous communities who are part of the Northern Territory emergency response measures. Of these, the best estimates are that only some 8,000 are enrolled at school, leaving up to 2,000 schoolWhile aged children not enrolled at all. A further 2,500 enrolled students do not attend school regularly enough to benefit from their educanewed tional experience. If we are to encourage these young Indigenous people to come to school we need to have enough teachers ready to teach them. The Rudd Labor government is therefore committed to providing funding for an additional 200 teachers in the adjourned. Northern Territory over the next four years. The government is determined to play its part with practical measures such as this and to work with Indigenous people and Northern Territory education providers to ensure that these young people receive the education they need and deserve. This bill amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 by appropriating additional funding of $7.162 milam)-I move: lion over the 2008 school year for the recruitment of 50 of these additional 200 teachers. Additional funding of $56.8 million will also be provided through subsequent acts for the remaining 150 teachers over the years 2009-11. Funding will be provided to Northern Territory education providers to recruit and employ the additional teachers. Northern Territory education providers will be responsible for deploying and housing the teachers employed through this initiative. I am also pleased to announce that I have recently approved funding for a number of complementary measures for Indigenous students in the Northern Territory, including a qualified teaching and accelerated package to ensure that students benefit from a high-quality teaching workforce and additional classrooms to ensure that existing infrastructure meets the demands of anticipated enrolment increases. The government has also promised to build three new boarding colleges for Indigenous secondary students in the Northern Territory and to expand intensive literacy and numeracy programs. these challenges are daunting, this bill contains the first of many practical measures this government will bring forward in a respirit of reconciliation and partnership with Indigenous Australia to begin closing the gap in educational outcomes. I acknowledge in the gallery Warren Mundine. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr John Cobb) TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Swan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",24
17,Mr SWAN,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"Lilley-Treasurer) (9.49 That this bill be now read a second time. The amendments contained in this bill will cut personal income tax for all Australian taxpayers from 1 July 2008, and implement important taxation reforms that have been long championed by the newly elected government. These tax reforms are designed to reward the hard work of Australians whose efforts are so critical to keeping the economy strong. They are also a down payment on a more internationally competitive tax system that will enhance the economy's productive capacity and help attract and retain highly literacy skilled workers. In order to continue our remarkable 17year-long economic expansion it is necessary to draw more Australians into the labour market. The tax reforms contained in this bill are designed to do just that. Lifting the supply of labour is a key component of the government's five-point plan to tackle inflation. Labour shortages are now widespread and employers frequently report they are the No. 1 one constraint on business expansion. By expanding the pool of labour available to businesses they are better able to meet the high levels of demand they are facing for the goods and services they provide. This tax reform package will significantly improve the financial incentives for secondincome earners and those on welfare benefits to make the transition into the workforce or increase their hours of work. These incentives will be reinforced by other measures to be implemented by the government, including the 50 percent childcare tax rebate and 450,000 additional skills training places. Economic modelling undertaken by the Treasury indicates the personal income tax reforms alone will lift aggregate labour supply by around 65,000 persons in the medium term. This increase in workers, together with the increase in the effort of existing workers, will make available around 2.5 million additional hours of work to the economy each week. These tax reforms will also enhance the incentives for taxpayers to upgrade their skills and gain higher qualifications by allowing workers to keep more of the wage gains that come with being more highly skilled and productive. The tax reforms in this bill are fiscally sponsible. They will be progressively phased in, taking effect in three stages: from 1 July 2008, 1 July 2009 and 1 July 2010. This phased introduction will ensure that the increased disposable income that flows from the tax reductions will better match the anticipated improvement in the productive capacity of the economy in the years ahead. It should also be noted that the tax reductions will be accompanied by new savings incentives, such as the government's new first home saver accounts, which will encourage eligible taxpayers to make the most of their disposable income gains by boosting their savings efforts. Importantly, the new tax measures that take effect in the first year are focused on taxpayers that have the greatest labour supply response. From 1 July this year, the government will increase the 30 per cent marginal tax rate threshold so that the 15 per cent marginal tax rate will apply up to $34,000 of income, an increase in the threshold of $4,000. In addition, the low income tax offset will be increased from $750 to $1,200. It will continue to phase out at 4c for every dollar of income above $30,000. This means that those eligible for the full low-income tax offset will not incur a net income tax liability until their annual income exceeds $14,000. Importantly and also for the first time, from 1 July 2008, low-income earners will receive half the benefit of this offset through their regular pay, rather than receiving the total as a lump sum when their income tax returns are assessed. This will ensure that they receive more timely tax relief in their take-home pay and will sharpen incentives to participate in the workforce. Further tax cuts will apply from 1 July 2009, including an increase in the 30 per cent remarginal tax rate threshold, so that the 15 per cent marginal tax rate will apply up to $35,000 of income. In addition, the 40 per cent marginal tax rate will be reduced to 38 per cent. The low-income tax offset will be increased from $1,200 to $1,350 from 1 July 2009. This means that those eligible for the full low-income tax offset will not incur a income tax liability until their annual income exceeds $15,000. From 1 July 2010, the threshold for the 30 per cent marginal tax rate will increase so that the 15 per cent marginal tax rate will apply up to $37,000 of income. In addition, the 38 per cent marginal tax rate will be reduced to 37 per cent. The low-income tax offset will also be increased from $1,350 to $1,500 from 1 July 2010. This means that those eligible for the full low-income tax offset will not incur a tax liability until their annual income exceeds $16,000. Importantly, this plan provides the greatest tax cuts in percentage terms to those most in need-lowand middle-income earners. Compared with their income tax liability for 2007-08, not taking into account the Medicare levy, a person with taxable income of $20,000 will have an income tax reduction of around 56 per cent, a person with taxable income of $50,000 will have an income tax reduction of around 18 per cent and a person with taxable income of $100,000 will have an income tax reduction of around eight per cent by 2010-11. I also note that the increase in the 30 per cent threshold and the low-income tax offset will provide a greater incentive for those outside the workforce to re-enter it and for those in part-time work to take on additional hours. As a result of the increases in the lowincome tax offset and the threshold for the 30 per cent tax rate, the income up to which senior Australians eligible for the senior Ausjourned. tralians tax offset do not pay income tax will also increase. From 1 July 2008, senior Australians who are eligible for the senior Australians tax offset will not pay income tax until they net reach an annual income of $28,867 for singles and $24,680 for each member of a couple. From 1 July 2009, these income levels will increase to $29,867 for singles and $25,680 for each member of a couple. From 1 July 2010, these income levels will increase further to $30,685 for singles and $26,680 for each member of a couple. This package provides more than $30 billion of benefit to taxpayers over the period to 2010-11 and will enhance Australia's reputation as a low-tax country. This tax plan has net been developed within the context of a responsible fiscal envelope to enhance individual incentive and workforce participation, particularly for part-time workers and secondary earners. Overall, these tax cuts will deliver assistance to working Australians under financial pressure and help prepare Australia for its future economic challenges. The tax reforms contained in this bill are the first stage in the government's tax plan to flatten Australia's personal income tax system, by reducing the number of income tax rates from four to three-with a personal income tax scale of 15 per cent, 30 per cent and 40 per cent-and a more generous lowincome tax offset delivering an effective tax-free threshold of $20,000 to low-income earners. These further reforms will be implemented in due course as economic circumstances allow. Full details of the amendments in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs May) adNA (POISONS STANDARD) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",25
18,Ms ROXON,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I must say it is nice to be presenting my first bill as a minister and to have so many familiar faces up in the gallery today. I suspect they might be here for a rather different first speech, but it is nevertheless nice to have people here who are so friendly to our cause. This bill makes a number of amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to address the legal consequences arising from a recent decision of the Federal Court in Roche Products v National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee on 30 August 2007. In that case the Federal Court held that decisions made by the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee under subsection 52D(2) of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, which include decisions to amend the Poisons Standard, are legislative in character. On the basis of that decision, it is likely that the Poisons Standard and its amendments are legislative instruments for the purpose of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. As such, they are required to be registered in the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments, known as FRLI, to be enforceable. However, as they were treated as nonlegislative instruments prior to the Federal Court decision in Roche, the Poisons Standard and amendments made to it up to the time of the Roche decision have not been registered in FRLI. Furthermore, as certain amendments made to the Poisons Standard were not registered within the periods specified by the Legislative Instruments Act, that act operates to repeal the amendments. It is therefore necessary to reinstate those amendments, and provide for the integrity and enforceability of the Poisons Standard up until the Roche decision. The Poisons Standard consists of decisions made by the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee, established under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, regarding the classification of drugs and poisons into different schedules, from schedule 1 to 9, signifying the degree of risk. The Poisons Standard also contains a number of appendices which supplement the schedules by setting out additional controls, qualifications and exemptions affecting substances contained in the schedules. The higher the schedule, the higher the risk attributed to a relevant substance. Substances are then regulated under relevant state and territory legislation depending upon in which schedule the substances are included. The Poisons Standard is also relied upon by the Commonwealth under the Therapeutic Goods Act for regulatory and enforcement purposes, such as for regulating advertising and labelling in connection with certain medicines. Scheduling and rescheduling decisions by the committee are made based upon considerations of public health and safety, balanced with the need for public access to a substance. The committee may, for example, reschedule a ‘prescription only' medicine to a ‘pharmacist only' medicine on this basis, or vice-versa; or prohibit a substance from general access by the public to reduce the risk of abuse or dependence. It is therefore necessary in the interest of public health and safety to ensure that regulatory actions taken in reliance upon scheduling decisions made by the committee continue to operate. To this end, the bill reinstates any scheduling decisions that may have been repealed, and puts beyond doubt that scheduling decisions made before the Roche decision are enforceable because they are deemed to have complied with the requirements of the Legislative Instruments Act. The retrospective effect of the amendments will not add any new regulatory requirement. Rather, the retrospective effect of the amendments is necessary to preserve the status quo of the Poisons Standard, and amendments made to it, before the Roche decision. Decisions and actions taken by both the regulator and business relied upon the enforceability and integrity of the Poisons Standard and its amendments, and the retrospective effect of the bill is necessary to provide certainty for those decisions and actions. The bill also makes it clear that the Poisons Standard and amendments made to it are exempt from the parliamentary disallowance process. This exemption recognises that it is inappropriate for Commonwealth instruments forming part of an intergovernmental scheme to be unilaterally disallowed, and the exemption is consistent with the operation of subsection 44(1) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. The exemption is also appropriate because of the need to ensure certainty in the continuing application of state and territory laws which refer to the Poisons Standard. The bill also provides for a compensation regime in the event that the operation of the amendments to the act should result in an acquisition of property from a person other than on just terms. Debate (on motion by Mrs May) adjourned. CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT (ASSESSMENTS AND ADVERTISING) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Debus. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",28
19,Mr DEBUS,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The National Classification Scheme operates to classify the content of a range of entertainment media and provide important information to consumers about that content. The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Assessments and Advertising) Bill 2008 contains two areas of reform to classification procedures. First, it changes the way the Classification Act deals with the advertising of unclassified product and, second, it changes the classification procedures for box sets of television series that are released for sale or hire. The bill makes these amendments to improve the operation of the National Classification Scheme and to respond to the everchanging technological environment for entertainment media. The first initiative is part of a package of reforms which, together with amendments to state and territory legislation, will replace the prohibition on advertising unclassified films and computer games with a new scheme that will allow advertising, subject to conditions. Those conditions will be set out in a new Commonwealth instrument. The new advertising scheme was developed following public consultation on a discussion paper and has been the subject of discussions with state and territory censorship ministers. The package of reforms will update the definition of advertisement to explicitly include advertising on the internet, and to exclude what is commonly known as product merchandising such as clothing. This recognises where consumers get their classification information from. Currently there is a prohibition on advertising unclassified films and computer games. A limited number of exemptions is available for cinema release products. The increasing risk of piracy and rapid advances in technology have led to products being available for classification very close to release date. The current system therefore causes difficulties for marketing of classifiable products. In light of these changing circumstances, it is no longer tenable to prohibit the advertising of unclassified material. This bill enables a legislative instrument to set conditions on advertising unclassified films and computer games. The instrument will establish a strong new advertising message advising consumers to: Check the Classification. The public expects, if a film is advertised before a film at a cinema, or on a DVD, that it will be suitable for the audience for the feature they have chosen to see. The same applies to advertisements accompanying computer games. So the instrument will permit unclassified films and computer games to be advertised only with films or computer games likely to be of the same or higher classification. The instrument will establish an industry based self-assessment scheme whereby the likely classification of an unclassified film computer game is assessed when advertising together with classified films or computer games. The instrument will introduce a stronger commensurate audience rule so that advertisements for films likely to be classified PG may no longer be screened to an audience for a G film. The new scheme contains safeguards to ensure that audiences will not be confronted by advertisements for material likely to be classified at a higher level than the product they have chosen to view or play. For example, the Classification Act will be amended to enable applications to be made to the Classification Board for an assessment of the likely classification of an unclassified film or computer game in difficult cases or where it is not cost-effective for industry to self as their sess. Other safeguards include giving the director the power to revoke an assessor's status or, in serious cases, bar a distributor from accessing the scheme for up to three years. These powers are designed to deter users from abusing the system or making lax or inadequate assessments. Decisions by the director to revoke an assessor's status or bar someone from using the scheme will be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Further safeguards include initial and annual training for individual assessors, random and complaints based auditing of advertising material and the retention of existing powers which allow the director to call in advertisements. The second initiative contained in this bill is amendments to the classification procedures for films that are compilations of episodes of a television series that have already been broadcast in Australia. This bill enables a television series assessment scheme to be established. Under the new television series or scheme a person appropriately trained and authorised may provide a report and a recommendation to the Classification Board to assist them in their classification of a box set of episodes of a television series. The Classification Board will retain responsibility for classifying the film. But its consideration will be assisted by the assessment of an authorised assessor. To provide flexibility to respond to changing technology, and the increasing capacity of storage devices, the details of the scheme will be included in a legislative instrument. The television series assessment scheme also contains safeguards to ensure the integrity of the classification system and consistency of advice to consumers. These include requiring the board to revoke classifications in specified circumstances such as when the assessment on which the classification was based was highly unreliable. For example, an assessment may have lacked enough information about classifiable elements, or been misleading, incorrect or grossly inadequate. In addition, the director has a power to voke, in specified circumstances, an assessor's status. In serious cases, the director the power to bar a person from being an assessor for up to three years, or bar an applicant from using the television series assessment scheme for up to three years. These powers are permissive, and only exercisable under certain conditions. They are designed to deter users from abusing the system or providing lax or inadequate assessments of additional content. Decisions by the director to revoke an assessor's status or bar an assessor or applicant from using the scheme may be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. These amendments have been developed in response to concerns expressed by industry about the application of the existing laws in light of developing technology and changing marketing imperatives. The purpose of this proposal is to reduce the cost to industry and to streamline the classification process for the Classification Board. The amendments contained in this bill will ensure the National Classification Scheme continues to serve both industry and the public well, responding to the needs of the rapidly evolving world of entertainment media by providing reliable classification information for consumers. I join several of my colleagues in recognising Mr Warren Mundine in the gallery. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs May) adjourned. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 13 February, on motion by Mr Hale: That the address be agreed to.",29
20,Mr TRUSS,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"The Governorre- General in his address to the parliament at the beginning of this week commented on has the change of government and said ‘how fortunate we are to live in a nation where governments change hands peacefully as a result of the free expression of the will of the people'. The smooth transition that there has been from the previous government to the new government, largely without great bitterness within the electorate, is indeed a tribute to our traditions and our democracy. As a member of the outgoing government, I cannot say it was a period without pain. There was the disappointment, naturally, of having to say farewell to faithful staff, of meeting for the final time departmental officers who had served the government faithfully with fearless advice and assistance over the years, and of the knowledge that many of the people who had worked for the previous government would no longer have employment-all of those sorts of things were sad. At the outset, I take the opportunity to thank my own personal staff, who made my role as a minister much more pleasant, enabled us to achieve some very worthwhile things and ensured that the government was also able to achieve worthwhile objectives for Australians. But there is a new government, and I congratulate them on their election. There is a situation in Australia at present where, for the first time in our history, Labor is in government in every state, in every territory, and now in the Commonwealth. That of itself gives me concerns, because the absence of checks and balances is indeed a potential threat to our democracy. If Labor abuses its position of absolute power then the comments of the Governor General about peaceful transition and the way in which we as a country go about changing our governments would indeed be at threat. Labor has a particular responsibility, in view of its all-powerful position, to ensure that it consults effectively with the community and to ensure that it listens-that it does not just hand-pick an audience to receive an address from the Prime Minister and a few cabinet ministers, that when it chooses advisory committees it does not just choose the old Labor faithful but in fact obtains advice from people with alternative views. It will be particularly important with the sorts of issues that are potentially divisive in the community that it recognises that Labor comes from a particularly narrow base at the present time: 70 per cent of the front-bench are trade union officials. Labor is not just influenced by the trade union movement-it is a wholly owned subsidiary. Substantial funding for Labor campaigns come from the trade union movement, yet only a handful of Australia's workers are actually in the trade union movement, and it has been steadily dying over the years. It has a disproportionate representation within the policy-making processes of the Labor Party, whatever they might be, and certainly expects to be very powerful within the new government. In this context I also refer to the funding imbalance that is becoming apparent in the electoral process around Australia at present. In state election campaigns, Labor can be expected to spend six, eight or 10 times the amount that its opponents are able to muster. In the last federal election, whilst the coalition and Labor spent broadly the same amount of money, there was a new player in the field-the trade union movement-that spent more than everybody put together. Our democracy, referred to so generously and accurately by the Governor General in his speech, can in fact be put at threat if there is not a strong and healthy opposition and that opposition does not have the resources to be able to effectively question the government when issues arise. So there will be a close observance about the way in which Labor uses its absolute power. There are concerns in the community that those interests that are legitimate and contributing to our country but are not highly thought of by the trade union movement and Labor will lose out. That will be damaging to our country. Labor and its newly elected members need to heed the advice that I think most of us are given when we arrive in this place: not all wisdom sits on the one side of the parliament. Useful contributions can be made by both sides. It is important that we seek to work constructively. Our government has accepted the judgement of the people. We acknowledge that there has been a change. We want the new government to govern in the interests of our country. I hope that they will be prepared to listen to the views of others when significant issues arise. From a personal perspective, I thank the people of Wide Bay for returning me as the member for their area. It was a challenging campaign, but I am pleased and grateful to the people of my electorate for entrusting me with their confidence. My electorate was substantially changed. I particularly acknowledge the support received from the people of Noosa and district, who were added to my electorate this time. They did not want to be in the electorate of Wide Bay. It is a part of the Sunshine Coast. People of Hervey Bay that were moved out of my electorate into Hinkler did not want to be taken away. We had a pretty dreadful redistribution in Queensland this time. I am not saying that it was particularly politically balanced-it was not. All Queensland members can draw attention to the ridiculous lines that were drawn on the maps. Almost every coastal city is split in two for no logical reason. makes it very difficult for people to identify with their local member. Why were one or two suburbs taken out of Maryborough and put in an electorate with Bundaberg? Why was a bit of Bundaberg put into an electorate with Gladstone and, for that matter, with Longreach? It is just not logical. This was, frankly, the poorest redistribution I have ever seen. In the redistribution that comes up in Queensland again in the next couple of years, I hope that there will be a correction and that some of these illogical boundaries will be properly aligned. In my own electorate, whilst my result was better than in most places, I really should have got every vote, because there were so many issues in the electorate where people were being very critical of Labor. I have three headline issues that particularly affected my electorate. The first was Labor's local government amalgamations, forcibly amalgamating councils throughout Queensland into mega regional governments. Ms Roxon interjecting",31
21,Mr TRUSS,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"Your leader, Mr Rudd, opposed what the Queensland government did before the election. Since the election he has done absolutely nothing to stop it. It was one thing before the election and another thing after the election. It is a classic example of Labor ‘me-tooing' before the election but, when they get into office, doing absolutely nothing. In fact, Mr Rudd had form on this issue, because when he was helping to run Queensland he forcibly amalgamated other councils against their will. But this time we had referenda across the state: 85 referenda, jointly supported by both sides of the House. The results of those referenda were absolutely overwhelming. Only in one council was there a vote for a merger, and that was only by about 0.1 per cent. In more than 10 local authorities there were fewer than 10 That votes in favour-everybody else against. In one electorate there was only one favourable vote. In my own electorate, every referendum was overwhelmingly defeated, and yet the state Labor government has done nothing. Where is the Prime Minister now? Has he yet spoken to the Queensland Premier to respect the democratic wishes of the people and to make sure that he winds back this amalgamation process before it is too late? The second major issue in my electorate is Labor's plan to build a dam on the Mary River. I welcome the presence of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts at the table and I recognise that he will soon have to make a very important decision on this issue. I have welcomed his offer to come to my electorate, and I hope that he will do that, and I hope that he can make a decision in a genuinely bipartisan way based on the facts. I certainly offer to host him so that he can see what needs to be seen. This is a devastating proposal for my electorate. It will flood something like 900 farms and private homes. It will be a multibillion dollar proposal. It has been imposed on the region against all engineering and scientific advice. There have been many reports on dam sites for Queensland; this one has always been rejected. It was rejected by previous Labor governments. It has been rejected by previous coalition governments. It does not stack up economically, it does not stack up socially and it does not stack up environmentally. Brisbane is short of water. It is short of water because of the decision of the previous Labor government to abandon a dam proposal at Wolffdene, which would have been full through all this drought and left Brisbane people with little or no water restrictions. It would have been in a catchment area that has had generous rainfall and would have effectively resolved Brisbane's water problems, but they did not build it. This neglect has resulted in Brisbane having a water crisis. The government is building a desalination plant at Tugun, which I believe is a significant part of the answer to Brisbane's water problems. It can do more in relation to recycling. It can build extra desalination plants. The dam will cost far more than many of the alternatives. It will mean Brisbane people will pay more for their water than they need to. If they had a desalination plant, it could be working and operational the day it is completed. A dam may wait years to be filled. The dam will not always have water in it when it is needed, so it will be an unreliable source of water. There will be a huge energy cost in pumping the water to Brisbane. It will be environmentally unsound and the government is already talking about acquiring large parcels of land to plant trees to try and make up for some of the greenhouse gas emissions that will result from this dam construction. One of the key issues that the minister need to consider is the dam's impact on the environment. There are a number of truly remarkable species in this river that are not found anywhere else in the world. The lungfish is one of the only fish in the world, and the only one in Australia, that has lungs. an ancient species and it is thought that lungfish may be 30 or 40 years old before they breed and live perhaps as long as 100 years. It is a remarkable species because it is found only in a couple of other places in the world, and then in very small numbers. Then there is the Mary River turtle, which is another remarkable species because it is a turtle with gills, something that is also very rare in the world. So we need to make sure that the environment and the habitat for these species is protected, along with the Mary River cod, which is of course in no other river than the Mary. It is important for the future of the environment that these species be protected. The minister will be receiving thousands of submissions from local people and the environmental movement unanimously condemning this proposal. It simply does not stack up on economic grounds, but unfortunately the federal government cannot intervene in that regard. That is just another bad decision by the Queensland state government. But we can intervene on environmental grounds and the environmental arguments are very, very powerful. The third issue in my electorate that I want to refer to is the Bruce Highway. This is a dreadfully accident-prone section, rated the worse piece of the highway in Australia by road reports. There have been 34 fatal accidents over the last few years on the sections in my electorate. Before the last federal election, we promised to spend $800 million to extend the four lanes north from Cooroy so that some of these really serious accidentprone sections could be eliminated. There is will no question that this is the worse accident stretch on the highway. There is no argument about that. That is simply a statement of fact agreed by state and federal governments. The $800 million would have made a significant difference. It is appalling that in the election It is campaign the federal Labor Party promised to take $500 million of that money away from the most accident-prone section of the highway. There have been several more fatal accidents on this section since the election and yet the Australian government, the Labor government, wants to take $500 million off this road. The government is talking about an infrastructure led battle on inflation. That is nomic nonsense in the short term. If you are serious about building infrastructure, surely you would deal with an accident-prone section carrying very heavy volumes of traffic that feeds the entire Queensland coastline. This must be a priority, and I appeal to the government to reconsider its announcement and to ensure that this road is returned to proper priority. The change of government will obviously result in changes of policy, but there can be no doubt that Australia is very much stronger, more prosperous and more secure as a nation as a result of the 11 years of lition government. In my own electorate of Wide Bay, unemployment has dropped to the lowest level that anyone can recall. We have had incomes growing and Australian government services are very much better than those we inherited in 1996. My job will be to make sure that the Rudd government does not upset the momentum of sustained growth built by the coalition government over these years. I am concerned that the Labor government has been elected without any clear plan. It has lots of empty cliches and proposals which, at best, have been vague. We hear about an education revolution, but what is it-closing down the Investing in Our Schools Program and putting computers in schools, many of which already have a computer system? Those sorts of things do not make an education revolution. It talks about ideas to manage the economy, but clearly it has not got any of its own. There has been an economic ineptitude which has been quite staggering. Indeed, Labor, elected after 11 years in opposition, has so few ideas that it has to bring a thousand people in from around the countryside to tell it what to doa thousand no doubt hand-picked people to give the sort of advice that the Labor Party ecowants. The man it has chosen to give advice in that regard is a long standing friend of the Prime Minister and a long standing Labor hack. That is the sort of person who will be chosen to give advice on those sorts of issues. The reality is that this government does not know where it is going. Its plan to deal its with inflation does not make sense. Many of these things it proposes are important. I strongly believe that we should have a also budget surplus; that is something we should do. We do need to spend more on infrastructure bottlenecks, but, in the short term, that coawill actually increase inflation rather than decrease it. It is going to be a decade before you make a significant difference with infrastructure construction to actually put downward pressure on inflation. The previous coalition government spent more money on infrastructure than any federal government in our history. We were the first to commit significant funding to roads. We were the first to commit funding to the national rail network in a way that has never happened before. It was a tragedy that, in the very first round of Labor government budget cuts, they cut $65 million off rail maintenance and construction in New South Wales and Victoria-not, as the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government said yesterday, from inland rail. Very little of it is off inland rail; nearly all of it is from getting rid of bottlenecks on the existing rail network. I cannot say that his answer yesterday was untruthful-I think that is unparliamentary-but he must have been inadvertently misinformed. If he cares to read his own budget statements supporting the announcement, he will see that most of this money was to be spent on existing rail lines. We are going to do something about increasing skills; I am in favour of that as well. But building a few trade blocks, which were largely blocks that were taken away by a previous Labor government, is going to take years to feed extra trades men and women into the system. These are all important things; they are things that the previous government was doing. We were building trade colleges. Labor has chosen to do it at a high school level. Our trade colleges would have done the job faster but, for some reason or other, they are to be closed down, because of an ideological commitment by Labor with the state governments. The reality is that these are important priorities, but they are not a plan to tackle inflation in the next months. If this is an immediate crisis, as the government is choosing to say, then you need to take immediate action, and none of these things will deliver results in the short term. The previous government inherited a government debt of $96 billion. We were in surplus when we left. Interest on government debt was over $8 billion. Now you are earning interest. Real wages growth under the previous government to ours was in the negative. It grew, without rapid inflation, by 20 per cent under our term. Average mortgage rates under Labor were 12.75 per cent. For us, it was 7.2 per cent. The unemployment rate was halved, the number of long term unemployed was cut to one-third and the average inflation rate was halved. The net private investment was more than doubled and our tax burden was lowered. We lowered all of the tax rates. The number of Australians in work went up by two million-(Time expired)",33
22,The SPEAKER,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"Order! Before I call the member for Maribyrnong and Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, Mr Shorten, I remind honourable members that this is his first speech. I therefore ask that the usual courtesies be extended to him.",36
23,Mr SHORTEN,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"MaribyrnongParliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services) (10.33 am)Congratulations to you, Mr Speaker, upon your election to this very important office. I rise today in full recognition of the honour which the people of Maribyrnong and the Australian Labor Party have granted me by enabling me to serve in this parliament. I rise in full recognition of the responsibility that comes with this honour: to serve my electorate and the Australian people. And I rise in full recognition of the historic moment the parliament and the Australian people witnessed yesterday when we said sorry to the stolen generation. What a time to join a new parliament, what a time to be part of a new government and what a time to be part of the creation of a new and more hopeful chapter in the ongoing story of reconciliation with Indigenous Australians. Maribyrnong is a diverse electorate in Melbourne's west and north-west. It is, in fact, home to at least three Australian icons: Dame Edna Everage, the Cox Plate and the Harvester Judgement. Thus, Maribyrnong encompasses Australia's most famous housewife and deflator of egos, Australasia's premier weight-for-age championship and Justice Higgins's 1907 decision which gave Australian workers the right to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. It is an electorate which tells the Australian story of the 20th and 21st centuries. A hundred years since the Harvester Judgement, Maribyrnong is home to a community of hard working Australians from all over the world, for whom a fair day's pay for a fair day's work is as important today as it was then. I believe the people of Maribyrnong are true-blue Australian optimists, seeking long, meaningful lives, with their DNA hardwired to seek even greater opportunities for their children. I have had a fortunate life and I have been fortunate to have been surrounded by smart and capable people. I would like to thank some of them who have given me their kindness, wisdom and advice along my path to this great chamber. Above all others-and I can say this on Valentine's Day-I thank my wife, Deb Beale, an endlessly intelligent, supportive and loving woman. I knew this instantly from my first outing, when she agreed to visit a picket line with me. I thank my family for their constant support and belief over the years: my mother, Ann, and my late father, Bill; my twin brother, Robert, and his family; my parents-in-law, Julian and Felicity Beale; and my great uncle Bert Nolan, a union man from the days of the Depression whose values inspired me. I mourn his recent passing. I would like to thank the Jesuits and teachers of Xavier College for teaching me to question and debate. I would also like to acknowledge previous members Maribyrnong-Bob Sercombe, Alan Griffiths and Moss Cass-for their distinguished public service; and, of course, my local branch members for their energy and efforts. I would like to acknowledge Bill Ludwig, the president of Australia's oldest continuous union, the Australian Workers Union; Cesar Melhem, who arrived in Australia as a young veteran of the violence in Lebanon and who is now the secretary of the Victoria AWU; and Paul Howes and the AWU national executive, who I expect will steward my union to even greater heights. I would like to thank all the unions, members, delegates and organisers linked and animated by the desire to help other people. They, like all modern Australian unionists, respect the employment relationship and the right to investment profits, but they would also seek mutuality of cooperation in the workplace. Bill Kelty, legendary Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, has my gratitude for his mentoring. When I was a young and green solicitor learning about workers compensation from John Cain Jr, at Morris Blackburn, Bill invited me to join the union movement. I seized his invitation with alacrity, signing on to serve the cause of working people. It was an exciting, indeed electrifying, time. I spent each day meeting with and organising and empowering the unorganised workers of the farms and factories all around Australia. I once organised a wire factory, and 160 people wanted to join the union. We had to spend two years getting union recognition in that factory. A man named Michael Chen became my friend and my delegate in that factory. He had economics degrees from China but was working as a wire bender at Tullamarine. He eventually came to work with me at the union as a financial controller, and now he is running his own fast-growing business. He is for one of the smartest people I have met, and there he was-bending wire in a Melbourne factory. You see, when you are a union organiser-as people perhaps do not realiseyou get the chance to see the full potential of individuals. On the boards of a woolshed, you know that shearers earn their pay. When you talk to steelworkers at the Port Kembla blast furnaces, to the underground miners at Mount Isa, to the oil workers in Bass Strait in winter or to those who staff the undertakers' night vans as they deal with the grief and tragedy of a road trauma or worse, you know you are in the presence of greatness. When you come face to face with heroism, cooperation and fighting spirit in workplace tragedies such as the Longford gas explosion in Victoria or the Beaconsfield mine collapse in Tasmania, you know you are in the presence of ordinary people performing extraordinary deeds. Every company, every work site I have visited for the last 15 years, taught me the potential for greatness that individuals carry within them and showed me the limitless capacity of Australian workers and Australian businesses-and, thus, the limitless potential of the Australian economy and Australian society. I have experienced the abundant goodwill of Australian workplaces, from both employers and employees. I know first hand the many examples of cooperation, compromise and pragmatism which bring dividends for all involved. There are many untold success stories of business and workers that should be told and should be celebrated. I thank the many businesspeople with whom I have worked cooperatively over the years. They include some of Australia's most successful and imaginative enterprises, headed by those who understand that success in the economy is underpinned by leadership, legacy and consistent values. I have learned from them that business is hard work. Australia needs business. It is the principal ‘doing' arm of our society. It creates wealth and jobs. But in the real economy, as union organisers know, building a business, running a farm or constructing a road is a really tough thing to do. There are no shortcuts-trust, openness, fairness, partnership, a bit of flexibility and compromise all round. Where you find these qualities, in my experience, you will spot a successful growing business and business leaders who understand that people are the most important feature of their business. I believe much more can be done to harness the capacity of Australian people. To do this, we need to confront the realities. Business and government must stop their periodic blame shifting. The old class war conflicts should finally be pronounced dead. The real conflict today, I suggest, cuts across the old divides. It is reflected within business, unions, the community and politics. The real conflict is between those who are stuck in a business-as-usual routine and those that pursue innovation, knowledge and creativity. Those are the drivers of economic growth around our world. Those are the drivers that can unlock the full potential of our fellow Australians. Now, more than ever, we need Australians to be educated, skilled and motivated. And we need them to be healthy and engaged. I am honoured that my Prime Minister has appointed me as a parliamentary secretary with special responsibility for people with a disability. I am excited by the opportunity to help empower another section of the community, not so people with disability receive special treatment but so they receive the same treatment as everybody else-the rights which are theirs, with the dignity that they deserve. I believe the challenge for government is not to fit people with disabilities around programs but for programs to fit the lives, needs and ambitions of people with disabilities. The challenge for all of us is to abolish once and for all the second-class status that too often accompanies Australians living with disabilities. In this great country, if I were another skin colour or if I were a woman and could not enter a shop, ride a bus, catch an aeroplane or get a job, there would be a hue and cryand deservedly so-but if I am in a wheelchair or have a mental illness or an intellectual disability then somehow the same treatment is accepted. Why should I be told to be grateful to receive charity rather than equality? It is not enough just to rely on the existence of laws to prevent this treatment. It is something that, with every fibre that we have, we should cry out against. It should go without saying that all of us demand equal treatment for those living with disabilities, as we would for any other Australian. This argument, for me, is a natural progression and parliament, I believe, is a place where real change can occur. I respect the institution of parliament and the crucial role that it has played in our national development. This is what has driven me to become a parliamentarian. At the close of the 19th century and the great debates of Federation, our forebears shunned the laissez-faire, master-servant views of the far Right and the revolutionary tendencies of the far Left. They went a middle way, creating unique institutions with both egalitarian and entrepreneurial tendencies. For me, the Australian parliament is the keeper of the middle way-labour and capital working together, metropolitan centres and strong regions in balance, prosperity, cross-subsidising growth and need across our large and diverse continent. I believe parliament operates best when it promotes tolerance and diversity. When political parties drift to extremes, the patient electorate makes it clear, through the ballot box, that they expect parliament to reflect the native Australian gradualism and pragmatism. I believe parliament is a moderating institution that is helping Australia to adapt to the big issues of the future. Previous parliaments have said that they did not want the White Australia policy. Previous parliaments have said that they did want to protect our environment. Previous parliaments have said that we do want to have an old-age pension. Previous parliaments have said that we want an open economy, a national superannuation scheme and an end to the legal discrimination against women. I want to belong to a parliament that will deal with the big, over-the-horizon issues facing our nation for the next 25 years. I aspire to be a Labor member who helps our parliament to be a moderating force for change in a complex, changing world. I hope to be a consistent and persistent Labor parliamentarian. I shall apply the lessons of my first four decades: the lessons of my family, the lessons of my education, the lessons of business, the lessons of my union days. All of these lessons, I believe, can be distilled into one phrase: never give up. What I want to accomplish in my time in parliament rests upon understanding what lies ahead for Australia in the next three decades. I am here because we must wrestle with a raft of issues. I am here because I do not accept that dignified aged care is somehow optional. I do not accept that quality healthcare should be determined by the size of your wallet. I do not accept that women should be paid less than men. I do not accept that Indigenous Australians should lack economic power. I do not accept the inevitability of an unfair and complex tax system. I do not accept that the collapse of Australian manufacturing is a foregone conclusion. I do believe that politics can sometimes lag behind individuals, communities and business. I do believe that Australians need lifelong learning to prepare for their many careers over their lifetime. I do believe in closer engagement with India and China in the spirit of the long standing great Labor internationalist tradition. I do believe in national infrastructure building greater capacity for economic growth. I do believe our teachers deserve more than they currently receive. I do believe that we should be saving more for our future. I do believe that we can and we must support our regions. I do believe that we can combine a sustainable environment and a sustainable economy. I do believe that governments should decrease the regulatory burden, promote competition and provide regulatory certainty. I do believe an Australian republic will arise. How to achieve a long, meaningful life in a rapidly changing world is one of the great themes of our new century. I believe our institutions will have to rethink the way they do things, coming up with new ideas for extracting the maximum social and economic value from the advances in medical technology which offer us the potential of a century of life. What I want to accomplish for working people is about aspiration-not for material wealth and plasma televisions alone but for 100 years of health; for education and skills to do quality, interesting work; for ing in decent and supportive communities; and for leading a rewarding and meaningful life. There are many paths to this end. I advocate no rigid road, for I am sceptical of absolutes. Australians are-by nature, history and geography-pragmatic, and we are gradualists. Sometimes I think in the public reporting of Australian politics the desire to highlight conflict overlooks the clear Australian preference for compromise and consensus. Let me clarify this point. In every federal election since Federation, nearly half the nation has voted for either Labor or the conservatives; yet within days we reunite around the fundamentals of our society. I am an optimist. I believe Australians are optimists. We see few problems that cannot be solved by reason and debate, and we are confident that most problems can be solved. We are egalitarian. We do not believe in a static and confining social order, so we have no profound passion to uproot and destroy it. Yet, for all this convergence, there are serious and meaningful divergences. The American historian Schlesinger described in the following terms the 19th century philosopher Emerson's view of the differences between American progressives and American conservatives: Mankind … is divided between the party of Conservatism and the party of Innovation, between the Past and the Future, between Memory and Hope. In Australia, Labor is the party of innovation, the future and hope. So it is a great privilege to be here right now in this place in what feels, after the last election, like a different country. Our national leadership is young, vigorous, intelligent, civilised and innovative. I believe it will spur a re-emergence of public faith in our leadership, in our diversity, in contention, in nonconformism and in livimagination. My vision of the Labor Party is that of a humane, insightful, pragmatic agent of change-not dogmatic, not utopian, not wedded to a belief that fundamental problems have only one solution. My experience of Labor is the unequivocal rejection of extremes. Our Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, has made Australia a proud member of the international community again by ratifying the Kyoto protocol. And I think everyone will remember where they were the day that he apologised to the stolen generations. Julia Gillard, our first female Acting Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, is the driver of our much-needed education revolution reforms. Wayne Swan, our Treasurer, knows that getting the economic settings right is vital for our nation to grow; but he will pursue these priorities with a sense of fairness and compassion. From industrial relations to Indigenous affairs, from nation building to community renewal, Australia is reasserting itself as a nation of the future, a nation of hope and a nation of the fair go. This will be a nation Arthur that values its people, whose capacity for achievement is irreplaceable. We need individuals; they are fundamental to the progress of our society. It is the existence of free choice, of equal opportunity and innovation which drives the capacity of individuals. I believe that the audacious pursuit of creative innovation can expand our choices and enhance our lives. That pursuit lies at the heart of my commitment to this place. In closing, I think of the thousands of people I have met around our nation. I think of passionate advocates; inspirational shop floor workers; people with disabilities, whose courage and determination are aweinspiring and business leaders whose contributions enrich our nation and our community. I have always been struck by how united we are by our common desire to see every individual enjoy the longest life, full of quality and meaning. I am inexpressibly proud to be here as part of this new, fresh and hopeful Rudd government-a government that has already shown itself to be socially inclusive, a builder of bridges, a dissolver of divisions in society. This week has shown us all the real meaning of the politics of hope, and it is a privilege to be part of this. I hope my role in this parliament will serve to assist and support these ideals and advance a fair Australia.",36
24,Mr BILSON,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"Dunkley) (10.52 am)Congratulations to the new member for Maribyrnong, the previous speaker, and to all those who have joined this parliament as a result of the last election, particularly my colleagues on both sides of the House from Victoria. I look forward to a constructive working relationship with them all and wish them all the best for the future. For me it is truly an honour to be representing the people of Dunkley again, to be rehired for a fifth term after the recent election. At a local level, there is no greater, no more humbling and no more demanding role than being the advocate for a community as diverse, as full of optimism and as rich in character-though not without its challenges-as the electorate of Dunkley. It is a community that I grew up in, that runs through my veins. As I listen to the first speeches of the new members, I reflect on my first speech nearly 12 years ago and think what an extraordinary journey it has been. A chance for a fifth term to make possible through action on the ground, supporting, collaborating and partnering with the local community and providing leadership, direction, optimism and hope for the future is what being rehired is all about. The people of Dunkley have again given me the opportunity to work with them and for them to make our region a better place-and I grab that opportunity with both hands. It is important that I acknowledge a number of incredible people who have helped make that possible. Once again I have been blessed with an outstanding campaign team of tirelessly committed, community-minded and very gifted individuals. I sincerely thank my dear mate Greg Sugars, who was again volunteered by me to be campaign chairman at a time when his own business was demanding much of him and his family. I thank Virginia, Mason and Reilly for lending him to us once again. To Natalie Fairlie, Norm Branson, Bill Beaglehole, Arthur Rauken and all those in the campaign team: thank you for your dedicated efforts. And thank you to the many hundreds of people who volunteerednot only on election day. There is something character building about being at the Frankston railway station at 5 am and knowing that there are volunteers with you, so committed are they to our shared endeavours. At a local level I must also acknowledge the team in the Dunkley electorate office as well as the staff in the ministerial office. They have been tireless in their efforts. I thank them most sincerely and value their friendship, their advice and their wise counsel. Noelene Warwick, Vincent Sheehy, Cameron Hill, Raeleigh Speedie, Judith Donnelly, Kristy Spena, James Sampson, Hayley Najim, Cameron Hooke, Claire Mackay, Brice Pacey and my former chief of staff Phil Connole are all remarkable individuals, and I wish them all the best for the future. To some of the new members and those in new offices: one of the characterbuilding things of a change in government is that the team thins quite considerably in opposition. Thankfully all those people are doing quite worthwhile and meaningful things, and I wish them well for the future. I would also on this Valentines Day like to pay a particular tribute to my sweetheart, Kate. As many in this House will know, spouses endure much in public life. Kate is certainly well known in our community and is often viewed as a nice segue in raising issues with me. Her contribution is tirelessit is immense-and her forbearance as we travel around the country and very regularly within our community is quite remarkable. I again want to place on the record my devotion to and admiration for her-and hopefully, through her, pay a tribute to all the spouses and families of members of parliament. It is a team effort, and they make an enormous contribution. I would also like to thank my children, Alex and Zoe. They are quite young. Alex is 10. I thought my election was exciting, but I acknowledge his election as vice-captain of Diamond house at Viewbank Primary School. He campaigned well and got a good result, and I congratulate him on that. He and Zoe were great supporters during the campaign, being co-drivers in the campaign bus, enthusiastically offering material to those who were interested. Their support and encouragement are very much valued. It is a reminder of why we come to this place. I will not recount my journey here, but it is important to know that it has inspired an outlook that I carry with me every day: your postcode does not determine your potential. Right across this continent there are people in communities for whom success is perhaps less familiar, but we should never allow that to diminish people's optimism about the future. The community that I represent is very diverse, and, for all those who are a part of their postcode is neither a roadblock nor a meal ticket to success. All of them have what it takes to live a successful life. I hope that through my campaign motto, which has survived many elections, of being positive, passionate and persistent we can embrace a positivity and optimism about the future and go about our work with vigour and enthusiasm but recognise that important things do not always come easily and that you need to stick at them. Hopefully through that work I can achieve the benchmark that I have set for myself of being handy to have around for the local community. It is also important that we pause and remember that a vast number of peoplemillions of Australians-voted for the return of the former government. They had been touched and encouraged by the prosperity and the opportunity and the greater sharing of those opportunities across Australia. They recognised that many achievements of the Howard government era stand this nation in great stead and provide the foundation for future achievements. It will be important, certainly in the coming months as the new government seeks to position itself, to not allow what was a very good government to be vilified needlessly. You would expect me to say these things having been a member of that government and a minister, but one only needs to look at the very masterful and artful campaign of the Labor Party, where they sought to position themselves as closely as they could to the work, the policy agenda, the goals and the programs of the Howard government and then just differentiate on a few particular things. Clearly the strategists and the thinkers in the Labor Party thought that things were not all that bad and that the nation was on the right pathway. For the community that I represent, that is evidenced in a number of ways. For the first time in most people's living memory, our it, unemployment rate is either at or below the national average. For those in this House who are not familiar with the Mornington Peninsula, it is some 40-odd kilometres, through to many more kilometres, away from the Melbourne central business district. If the economy stumbles, we fall flat on our faces in our community. Employment can be very difficult when opportunities contract. For too long we were exporting our brightest, as they left the community to try and find opportunities elsewhere. Thankfully, with the change of government-that is, with the introduction of the Howard government-more and more local people could be a complete part of their local community. They not only could engage with their family and friends and their social activities, their sporting interests, their religious pursuits, their communities but also had a chance to actually work in the community. You see unemployment rates now that had only been dreamed of in the past. You see people who were previously denied the opportunity to work, perhaps because they did not offer the skills that some others may have had, also able to gain employment. They have a chance to show what they are capable of, perhaps after a long period of unemployment or of different prioritiesraising a family or the like. When we talk about employment we need to realise that it is a very personal thing. Labor has made much of employment relations and that is understood. The election has encouraged us all to recalibrate some of the industrial relations laws. That is recognised. But it is very important that people have a chance to be employed. We hear much about the role of unions. My role is to be the union for people who do not have a job, to try to make sure that policies and decisions in this parliament mean the environment is conducive to more employment and that there is more investment so that everybody has the chance to gain a job and shape their future destiny. We achieved that over the course of the Howard government. I hope we do not lose that, as we move forward. I hope that productivity is improved not by simply excluding the least productive from the labour market. That is no solution. We need to make sure everybody has the opportunity to be involved. It was quite a masterful campaign by the ALP to align themselves so closely to the Howard government. In fact, we have heard it said that there was only a cigarette paper between the two parties. It was a very interesting campaign, yet we often hear now in this place that it was so different. It is interesting. We wonder and the nation will look to see just what kind of government the Rudd government offers, to see whether it lives up to those reassurances or whether the hubris that you have already seen in these early days sees a completely different agenda brought forward. I acknowledge the member for Kingsford Smith at the table. The areas that were very important to the community that I represent could be pursued not only at a national level through the enabling policies of a national government but also through the translation of those opportunities into particular initiatives for our community. Sadly, many of these will not move forward unless the new government recognises the importance of them to the Dunkley community. It is worrying because in 1996, when I was first elected, the Labor member I replaced acknowledged that our community had been forgotten about by the HawkeKeating governments. I think that in part played into why there was a change of member. I hope, now that there is a Labor government back, my community is not forgotten again as the focus moves elsewhere. There are some worrying early signs. The member for Maribyrnong spoke eloquently about his journey and the importance of his community to him and in the context of the nation. I feel equally strongly but do not see the same investment in the west and the north-west of Melbourne as in the south and the south-east. We remember how our community was punished with a tollway after being promised the road would not be one. The south-east and east of Melbourne are the only ones who pay to use an arterial ring road; the northern and western suburbs do not pay. One of the consequences of this tollway is an enormous increase in traffic congestion-25 per cent is the estimate-on an already clogged highway network that ends its journey at the corner of Cranbourne-Frankston Road, an intersection already choking under the traffic. During the election campaign no remedy was offered, except from the Howard government. It offered financial support for the Frankston bypass, a project so important not only to relieve and to address the current forecast congestions but also to make sure that our community is not disconnected from the rest of Melbourne purely because of travel journeys. For those listening who know the peninsula well, imagine a 40minute trip from Main Street, Mornington, to get to Thompson Road in Carrum Downs. This separation by time of our community from other parts of greater Melbourne is a worry. I hope the Rudd government recognises that the enormous commitment that was made by the Howard government, if it were re-elected, is something it needs to carry through on. Those funding commitments were important because they were about showing that research into the direction, the grade separation and the EES process was not purely an academic exercise but that some action would flow from it. We also had the promise of an Australian technical college. Under the former Labor government, the Hawke-Keating government, you very rarely heard about skills. In fact the Australian public and young people were fed a diet that success was only achieved by a university pathway. We know that to be nonsense but we also know that there is a concerted effort required to reengage people who are perhaps disconnected from their education and that Australian technical colleges were achieving that. The Australian technical college that was to be established in Frankston would have been an enormous boost for our community. Alas, that now looks like not being achievable either. I can assure the House I will persist. I am positive about this project and passionate about its need, and I will persist to see that that infrastructure is available. Other election commitments are very important to our local community. They include the $2 million contribution towards the construction of an environmentally compatible sea wall to support the boating facilities in and Frankston and the vision for our city. It is very important, but we had not a noise about that from the Labor candidate. The ongoing work to enhance community safety and security, the incredibly successful CCTV programs in Mornington and around the railway station in Frankston were going to be rolled out even further, as was mobile technology that would address the scourge that too many Australians are experiencing-that is, the scourge of the doof-doof hoon in a soupedup VL Commodore at the front of houses, terrifying neighbourhoods. Mr Baldwin-Doof-doof!",41
25,Mr BILSON,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Member for Paterson. That is the bass sound of the vehicle as it drops a burnout out the front of someone's house. Speeding in local neighbourhoods is really affecting the humanity of those areas, but it is incredibly hard to police. Mr Baldwin-It is a national disgrace.",44
26,Mr BILSON,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"It is a national disgrace and it is a trend. When I look back on my Mazda 808 super deluxe coupe when I was of that vintage, it could not pull the skin off a custard, so underpowered was it. I still felt cool, although others had another view. Today those entry-level vehicles are highpowered vehicles. We see too many young people losing their lives, too many neighbourhoods compromised by bad driving behaviour, albeit in passing. It is a small minority, but it is enough to cause a real impact, to have a detrimental impact, on people's quality of life and the quality of their neighbourhoods. We had a commitment to fund movement activated CCTV systems which you could mount on a power pole or sit on the back parcel deck of a car to capture some of this conduct so that the vehicle confiscation laws would actually have some evidence to push off from. That was a very important initiative but one that we have heard nothing about. Other initiatives included the revitalisation package for the Seaford RSL car park, the area around the foreshore and the lifesaving precinct, which would have provided a chance to enjoy the Seaford-Edithvale wetlands through all seasons, through the re-establishment of the pathways. These were important local projects, along with the Eric Bell Reserve redevelopment and upgrade project in Frankston North and support for the Langwarrin footy club and the community basketball stadium in Mornington. These were local issues that the local community, I felt, embraced. The trend in voting patterns away fromdare I say-my kind was less obvious in my electorate. I think that was perhaps because these local projects mattered. Having said that, I also add that, for those like me who are advocates of Tip ONEILL's motto ‘all politics is local', Tip was away from my electorate during this election campaign. The national mood certainly was embraced by many of the local voters and that was evidenced by a very low-profile, almost stealthlike campaign by my Labor opponent. But, still, we persist and we work on. I would like to add some further comments about the challenges ahead. We have heard much about a broadband agenda. We have seen little about the detail of it from the Labor Party. We saw yesterday a bill introduced into the House that will allow a stripping of the Communications Fund, the very future-proofing tool that regional and rural Australians are concerned about. We are going to see those taxpayer resources drawn away from where there is clearly an underservicing and a difficulty in providing commercially funded broadband services. They are to be made available for the metropolitan area, where there is no such problem. The logic of that astounds me, but this is what seems to be moving forward. I will talk more about that at another time. I want to pay tribute to those that I had the good fortune of working with as a minister. The Department of Veterans' Affairs is a remarkable organisation. It carries an extraordinarily special duty to a very special group of Australians who have served our nation and given all that they have. It was an honour and a privilege to be the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, to work closely with Mark Sullivan and his department team and with the ex-service community, many of whom are often vilified by some characters that offer much in the way of commentary but very little in the way of constructive agendas for the future. I wish all those in Veterans' Affairs the best future. Alan Griffin, the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs, is already benefiting from the momentum that we created, but I hope that he also has a sense of the challenges that are ahead. To the serving men and women of the Australian Defence Force: my role in assisting the humans in the ADF was a great honour and a privilege. Our people are our greatest capability. We can buy aircraft and ships and all the kit under the sun, but it is our people that make those items of technology, that implement doctrine, that use their creativity, their judgement and their personalities to bring about the military and strateSecretary gic objectives that they are tasked to carry out. To Angus Houston and all of the service chiefs, to Nick Warner, to the defence enterprise-all of the civilians and uniformed personnel who work at Russell and at many installations across the country: I salute you. You are a remarkable bunch of people. I admire what you do, and it was an incredible honour to work closely with you. To the people of Dunkley I pay my highest compliment and pass on my sincere thanks. To be rehired by you, a group of people I have grown up with, is an honour. Your challenges, ambitions, hopes for the future and moments of reflection run through my veins as well. I hope I honour the trust and support you have placed in me for a fifth time. I hope I represent you with vigour and advocate your interests well in this place. I should apologise because it seems as though I will need to be here on a Friday. I do not shirk from that role; I am happy to be a contributor in parliament any time. But parliament ‘lite', as it is proposed on a Friday, is a bad move. When I come here and talk about the grievances of my community, I expect the people who are in a position to remedy them to be here as well. Rostered days off, or Rudd days off, are not good for our parliament. Parliament is valued. It should be respected. If being removed from this place for one hour is an important sanction for bad behaviour and being removed for 24 hours is a bigger sanction, not being required to turn up at all is an insult. (Time expired)",44
27,The SPEAKER,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"Order! Before I call the member for Charlton and Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",46
28,Mr COMBET,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, and congratulations on your election. It has occurred to me, I must say, in my naivete as a parliamentarian, that your role is somewhat akin to a judge on a new reality television show called So You Think You Can Talk! But of course there is somewhat more gravity associated with the role and I wish you all the best in it. I have committed my working life to the cause of fairness and justice in our society. I believe very strongly in a fairer distribution of wealth and opportunity. I have been an advocate for the rights of working people and I have campaigned against injustice. I believe that a strong economy is an essential foundation for social progress and I profoundly believe in our democracy. I am proudly Australian and I believe that, as an independent nation, it would be appropriate to have an Australian head of state. My values and beliefs have informed my decision to stand for election to the House of Representatives. But the achievement of change, of course, requires more than individual belief or personal effort alone. It requires the collective action of those with common ideals. That is why I have been committed to the labour movement for many years and that is why I am a member of the Australian Labor Party. As former Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley put it in 1949, Labor is ‘a movement bringing something better to the people, better standards of living, greater happiness to ... the people'. I am grateful for the opportunity that Labor provided me to stand as a candidate in the electorate of Charlton and I am very proud to have been elected. I am also honoured to have been appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement in the Rudd government. I wish to thank the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, for my appointment to this role and to congratulate him and all of the Labor team for the tremendous achievement of winning government. Many people contributed to my election but I would like at the outset to thank my wife, Petra, for her personal support and sacrifice; and our children, Clara, Anna and Yannis. It has been a major upheaval for my family. I also sincerely thank my mother, Aida; my stepfather, Vic; and my sister, Jennifer-and I acknowledge my late father, Todd-for all that they have done to support me through my life. Charlton is in the Hunter region of my home state of New South Wales. The electorate is named after former Labor leader and coal miner Matthew Charlton. It encompasses the western areas of Newcastle and Lake Macquarie, a region of considerable geographic beauty in which live very diverse communities. I respectfully acknowledge the work of the previous member, Kelly Hoare, and, before her, Bob Brown. They represented Charlton since its inception in 1984. While there is growing prosperity in many parts of the electorate, there is also signifiimplementation cant disadvantage. Charlton has a large retired population, many of whom depend solely upon the age pension. The electorate has lower than average income levels, a large proportion of people who attended school only to year 10 and youth unemployment which still stands at around 16 per cent, so there is much work to be done. There is also a large Aboriginal community in Charlton, and I extend my respects to the traditional owners of the lands within the electorate, the Awabakal people, and their elders. I respectfully acknowledge the Awabakal and Koompahtoo land councils and affirm my heartfelt support for the apology to the stolen generations. I will cherish the opportunity to work closely with Aboriginal people in the electorate. Service industries are large employers in Charlton but manufacturing, coal mining and electricity generation are important economic drivers. The failure of the former Howard government on climate change has created uncertainty for the future of the coal and electricity industries in the region. There is apprehension amongst workers about their jobs and uncertainty about investment in the electricity industry. This is a problem area which I will take a keen interest in on behalf of the electorate and the Hunter region generally. In my view, a national trading scheme which effectively prices carbon emissions will be important for my electorate as well as for the country. Not only will it create an incentive to reduce emissions; it will provide greater certainty for jobs and for investment in all forms of energy. Charlton residents have also suffered from insufficient investment in infrastructure. One of my main priorities will be to campaign for a new integrated rail, road and bus transport centre at Glendale, in the demographic heart of the electorate. Also high on my list is the of the Rudd government's commitment to a new GP superclinic in the area. The ratio of GPs to the population is now 1 to 2,000, making it far too difficult for many people to see a general practitioner. I would like to thank not only the voters of Charlton for their support but also the members of the Labor Party and the local community who made a significant contribution to my campaign. There are, as usual, too many to individually name. However, I would like to acknowledge a small number who dedicated very much of their time: Kelly and Lynne Lofberg, Angie Sidonio, Janelle Smee and her family, Yasmin Catley and Megan Montefiore. I also received great support from businesspeople and many unions, and I particularly wish to thank the ACTU, the Maritime Union of Australia, the CFMEU mining and energy division and the Newcastle Trades Hall Council. I have very much appreciated the warmth extended to me from people in the community and I have had some great experiences while campaigning. My great-grandfather, who migrated to the Hunter from France, once owned a wine bar near Cardiff in the electorate. It closed, think, in the 1950s. Imagine my pleasure when a very elderly and frail man came into my Cardiff campaign office and, after seeing my name on the window, asked if this was where the wine bar had moved to. He did say it was a long time between drinks! I bring a variety of experiences to my new role. I grew up in Rooty Hill in Western Sydney. At that time it was a diverse, semirural community and a settlement area for many postwar European migrants. My father was a winemaker at Penfolds at the Minchinbury Estate. He died when I was 13 and this remains perhaps the most formative experience of my life. He instilled in me a sense of community, and I recall spending much of my time with him at community service and fundraising events in which he participated as a member of Rotary. Like many of my generation, I was influenced by the major political and cultural events of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the tumult over the Vietnam War and the excitement surrounding Labor's political ascendancy under Gough Whitlam-although, I have to say, in Rooty Hill these events were almost eclipsed by the shock and outrage over the nude scene in the rock musical Hair.",46
29,Unknown,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,Honourable members interjecting,48
30,Mr COMBET,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"There are some of my generation here. Following school I worked for some time and then studied mining engineering. As part of my studies, I worked in underground coal mining at Lithgow and joined the coalminers union at the age of 19. My early working and industrial experiences helped crystallise my commitment to the labour movement, where my heart and my passion could find expression through my work. I left the mining industry and worked in a variety of community organisations, including the Workers Health Centre in Lidcombe I in Western Sydney. It was there that I broadened my involvement with unions and first began what has extended now to 25 years of campaigning on behalf of asbestos victims. I studied economics and by 1987 became an official of the Waterside Workers Federation, now the Maritime Union. Tas Bull, the head of the union at the time, influenced more than anyone else my development as a union leader. He had the capacity to balance strength with pragmatism and the courage to advocate unpopular positions when it was the right course of action. I have missed him in the years since his death. The experience I gained in a national role at the union prepared me for work at the ACTU, where I was privileged to work with one of its most outstanding and intelligent leaders, Bill Kelty. I was elected his successor in October 1999. My 14 years in Melbourne at the ACTU involved me in major events such as the 1998 waterfront dispute, and I shared those tumultuous days with my close friend and colleague John Coombs, who courageously led the Maritime Union. At the ACTU, I also led the successful campaign to rescue $700 million of Ansett employee entitlements following the collapse of the airline, and I worked to achieve justice for the victims of James Hardie asbestos products. The James Hardie campaign resulted in a commercial settlement worth billions of dollars in compensation payments over the next 40 to 50 years, and it is unique internationally. But it is a settlement which will, rightly, forever be associated with the late Bernie Banton, a genuine fighter for tice and a person who enriched my life and inspired countless others, and I am proud of what we achieved. Over the last 2½ years, I have also been proud to be a leader of the Your Rights at Work campaign, conducted by the union movement. This campaign achieved widespread opposition to the former Howard government's workplace laws and it undeniably influenced national politics. The former government's arrogance and its unwillingness to listen to legitimate concerns its Work Choices laws were part of its undoing. I vividly recall a meeting I had as ACTU secretary with former Prime Minister John Howard in May 2005. I explained how his proposed reforms would allow some employers to use AWA individual contracts to cut take-home pay and the damaging impact this would have on the most vulnerable people in the labour market. Mr Howard was unmoved. In my role as a union leader, I learnt the importance of considering and balancing competing views and to respect the legitimate interests and concerns of business. Mr Howard's failure to extend this respect to interests of employees hardened my resolve to mount a concerted campaign against the Work Choices legislation, with television advertising at its foundation. When the ACTU began its TV campaign, our research showed that about 35 per cent of Australians opposed the Howard government's planned industrial relations changes. Within months of our advertising, opposition to risen to 65 per cent, and it essentially remained at this level all the way through to last year's election. While advertising was important, the foundation of the Your Rights at Work campaign was its support in the community and the grassroots activism of many thousands of people. I want to take the opportunity in this place to thank each and jusevery one of them for their contribution to achieving change. The Rudd government's workplace relations changes will restore fairness and balance to the workplace and they will not harm the economy. In fact, the High Court has now cleared the way for industrial relations jurisdictions to be rationalised on the basis of a national system and this will significantly reduce the complexity of regulation for business. Furthermore, the constitutional path is now clear for legislation to establish a simple about and consistent safety net of employment rights, obligations and entitlements. Pay and employment conditions over and above the safety net will be the subject of genuine workplace-level bargaining. The only fair workplace bargaining system is one which respects the right of employees to collectively bargain. The fact is that individual employees rarely have comparable bargaining power with an employer, and that is why the right for employees to collectively negotiate with their employer is crucial. It is also why employees must be genuinely free to join, associate in and be represented by a union, if that is what they wish. Fighting for the these rights has been a cornerstone of my working life and I shall stand up for them in this place. Basic rights such as freedom of association and the right to collectively bargain should, ultimately, in my view, join other fundamental democratic freedoms in a codified set of human rights in Australia. I believe the absence of such a code, perhaps in the form of a human rights act, to be a the laws had weakness of our democracy. My particular interest, though, is in economic issues. I maintain strong relationships with members of the business community and I have enjoyed serving on the boards of a large superannuation fund and a bank, Members Equity Bank. From the shop floor to the boardroom, I have witnessed in recent years the emergence of serious impediments to Australia's future economic prosperity. We have as a nation experienced a prolonged period of economic expansion, low inflation and strong employment growth. This strong economic performance has yielded historic fiscal dividends to government. However, serious skill shortages and underinvestment in infrastructure, poor preparation for an ageing population and a failure to encourage investment in research and innovation threaten our prosperity. The failure of the previous government to adequately address these issues is constraining GDP and productivity growth and therefore constraining future improvement in real living standards. It is a contributor to the inflationary and interest rate pressures we are now experiencing. As we well know, and as I know from my role representing working people, inflation hurts those Australians least able to afford The tragedy is that the former Howard government had a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in future prosperity and it failed. I strongly support the Rudd government's plan for investment in education and skills development, leadership in infrastructure, and new policies encouraging innovation and research and development. I have been an advocate of these policies for some time. The government's focus on education is particularly important for our country. Universal access to quality education is central, in my view, to any decent democracy. For many children, public education in particular is the only vehicle to overcome social and economic disadvantage. In my own electorate, I look forward to the improved availability of trades training in schools, broadband access and the availability of computers to students in years 9 to 12, and the government's emphasis on early childhood education. These initiatives will make a huge difference. They are foundations for social equity. Addressing the challenge of an ageing population through better retirement savings is also an area in which I have a keen interest. There are important reasons for boosting retirement savings. The current average superannuation account balance is around $39,600 and only $27,600 for women. For low-paid, casual and part-time workers it is much less than this. In the hospitality industry, where many thousands of people are employed, it is around $8,000. At the current contribution rate, this will not be enough for many people to have an adequate standard of living in retirement. That is one reason to boost superannuation savings. Another is that our superannuation system is the main mitigating factor against wealth inequality in our society. Indeed, for many people it is the only form of savings that they have. Boosting super also increases the quantum of nait. tional savings available for investment. It enhances the capacity of retirees to finance the escalating cost of health care. By encouraging savings rather than consumption, we can diminish inflationary pressure. This issue, in my view, should not be confused, as some have done, with the tax cuts to be delivered by the government, because these are sorely needed by working families, but it is a longer term issue demanding public policy consideration. While I look forward to involvement in these policy areas as a parliamentarian, much of my immediate work will involve the honour of supporting the Australian Defence Force through my role in defence procurement. I have already met many dedicated and talented people working in Defence and the Defence Materiel Organisation. Procurement is, many would say, a fascinating challenge, with almost $10 billion to be expended this year on the acquisition and sustainment of material for the ADF. There are many unheralded successes in defence procurement, but it is well known that there are a few difficult issues as well. Together with the Minister for Defence, I have started reviewing some of the problem projects which are over budget and beyond their schedule. I also aim, with the minister, to continue the process of reform within the Defence Materiel Organisation. It remains for me to thank the union movement, because it has provided me with the greatest opportunities of my working life, including a foundation for my election to parliament. I have received tremendous support and met wonderful people who deserve respect and recognition for their work, not vilification. I am especially grateful for the years spent with my colleagues at the ACTU and in the leadership with Sharan Burrow. Of the many whose friendship I enjoy, I would like to thank in particular Pirjo Laine, who worked with me for 13 years, and George Wright, who also worked closely with me over a long period of time. As I embark upon this new beginning, I draw strength and inspiration from the achievements of the Australian Labor Party. From wartime leadership to postwar nationbuilding, from our pioneering role in the United Nations to the forging of our regional relationships, from Aboriginal rights to universal superannuation and Medicare, from opening access for people of my generation to tertiary education to economic modernisation, Labor has shaped this nation for the better. Labor is a builder, a creator of opportunity, a driver of social and economic progress and equity. Only Labor would take the unifying step forward for this country of an apology to the stolen generations. It is time to find greater unity in our sociFirst ety, to turn the page on the recent years of division and intolerance. We are a diverse society, and my greatest hope for the future is that we evoke in our community greater tolerance, compassion, decency and respect towards one another. I am very proud to be a member of the House and a member of the Rudd Labor government.",48
31,Mr WOOD,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"I start my speech on the address-in-reply by congratulating the member for Charlton and all the new members of parliament. It is truly a great honour to be elected to this place. I also congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your elevation. It is a great honour for you. I know you personally and I know your integrity. I also rise today in this new parliament delighted to have been re-elected as the representative for the seat of La Trobe. My first task is to thank the voters in La Trobe for reelecting me and giving me the honour and privilege of being the federal member for La Trobe. It is a great honour for me. I again thank my supporters and all those who voted for me for their support. I am determined to work harder than ever before, to ensure that the newly elected Rudd Labor government keeps to its promises in La Trobe. I recognise that in La Trobe a number of people voted for the Liberal Party for the first time and gave me personal recognition from my position on issues such as supporting the Kyoto protocol, opposing the pulp mill in Tasmania and opposing nuclear reactors. The Liberal Party have learnt a lot from this election and I know we will go into the future learning from our mistakes. There are many people that I would like to express my thanks to for their dedication to my campaign and for their tireless commitment to ensuring my re-election. It takes a team effort and I would not be here today without support from a number of people. of all, I must thank my parents, Bob and Jan. They are not traditional Liberal supporters, but they have actually come on board. It is really good to see my parents do that. I thank them, because, as a member of parliament, it is actually your family who cop a fair bit of the burden for your decisions and your policies. I also have to get the name of my dog, Moejoe, into Hansard. Moejoe was a great support for me after hours. Mr Baldwin-You didn't lose your mojo!",51
32,Mr WOOD,THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT,"No, I haven't lost my mojo. Moejoe, hopefully, is with my parents as I speak. Like everyone, I love getting back home, and I get inspiration in after-hours time spent with, believe it or not, my dog, Moejoe. At two o'clock in the morning he would love a good walk. When it comes to dedication and persistence, I must thank my Liberal Party supporters. In no particular order but first of all I must thank Peter and Chris Smith-they are here to see me as well as all the new members being sworn in, and I thank them for making that trip. Peter is also my FEC chairman. I thank Andrew MCNabb, who campaigned tirelessly; Sue MCMillan; and Stan and Steve Davey, who I cannot thank enough-they are not actually Liberal branch members but they campaigned for me for a month. I thank John Shipp, David Jancik and Michael Basset, who brought their youth and enthusiasm into the campaign; David Menaham; David Holmes, who was the first person in 2004 who said I should stand for parliament; Brad Battin; Julie Hughes, Carol Porter, Sheila Purcell, Margery Nowack and all the ladies from Berwick Women's section. I thank my branches in La Trobe, including Berwick, Fern Tree Gully, Emerald, Boronia, Dandenong Ranges, Gembrook, Upwey and the Berwick Young Liberals. I also must thank the members of the Malvern Young Liberals club, who came out and campaigned with me; the BerwickRanges 500 club for their strong financial support; Tony Snell from the admin committee for his leadership and dedication during the scrutineering process, which dragged on; the Wildes family for their assistance; Sharon Verschaeren; Brian and Pauline Hetherton; Betty and Peter MCLaren; and also Mick Morland and Kay for their assistance. To those I have not mentioned: I apologise but I can never thank you enough. One thing I try to do is thank all my supporters. I thank the Victorian state division for all their support and especially the state director, Julian Sheezel: you were great when I needed you to make phone calls to make things happen. Again, I also thank the Liberal Party for their trust in me as their candidate in 2004 and again last year. In 2004, I made some election commitments and I must again thank the former Prime Minister, John Howard, for all his support in the electorate of La Trobe. Projects such as Fernlea House palliative care received funding; Fernlea House received $800,000. This is a state government responsibility but the former Prime Minister, John Howard, recognised the need and committed the funding-I thank him for that. With this commitment anyone in the seat of La Trobe can go into Emerald today and see Fernlea House and the way it is being managed. This election commitment has been delivered. Bryn Mawr Bridge in Berwick-I am sure there are a few people who may be listening to this speech as they are driving across this bridge in Beaconsfield-is again a state Labor government responsibility, which we committed $10 million to and which, again, was delivered in my first term. In last year's election campaign, La Trobe voters saw Labor's ‘me too' strategy in full flight not at the national level but at the local level. I am delighted that, in the election campaign, the Labor Party were forced into matching three of these commitments. Labor matched my election commitment of the substantial upgrade to Clyde Road in Berwick to ease traffic congestion. We initially promised $25 million for this project and we are seeking the second half from the state Labor government. My Labor opponent Rodney Cocks-and I congratulate him first of all for his tireless efforts-tried to trump me by announcing $30 million for the grade separation. We committed this in the May budget, which I believe was also matched by Labor. I hope they stick to their promises. Just as importantly, I was at the Beaconsfield Progress Association in a debate with my opponent Rodney Cocks. He made it very clear to all those present that Tim Pallas, the roads minister for Victoria, had agreed and he was able to successfully negotiate an agreement that the state Labor government would match the funding of $30 million, so I will keep the Brumby government accountable to this promise. Labor matched my election commitment of $2.5 million for a performing arts centre for the Emerald Secondary College. First, I must congratulate all the students who participated in last year's rock eisteddfod, where they came third-they were my inspiration for pushing this project to see whether it was warranted. The students worked so hard for this project and they must be congratulated for their persistence and especially for coming third in the whole state. It was an amazing effort. But there is one person in particuI lar who must get all the accolades for this, and that is Wayne Burgess, the principal at Emerald Secondary College. He was the one who invited me to the rock eisteddfod that night and put the plans and the concept together. He put an amazing application together. He was strongly supported by the school president, Doug. Wayne, you did an amazing job. Wayne wrote me a letter dated 30 January. It states: On Thursday 11th October 2007, Emerald Secondary College received a commitment that a re elected Howard government would provide $2.5 million for this community facility. And, as I said, we heard the echo from the Labor Party in Wayne Burgess's letter: On Tuesday 16th October 2007 Stephen Smith, Shadow Minister for Education and Training made a similar commitment. In actual fact it was an identical commitment, and we are now calling for the new Rudd government to honour this commitment to the students at Emerald Secondary College. I believe the decision on the day was that it would be in this year's federal budget in May. Let us not start breaking promises; let us commit to this project. It is so vitally important. Labor also matched my election commitment of $2 million for a new sports stadium in Timbarra. The history of Timbarra is this: initially the state Labor government was planning to sell the land but after a large, strong local campaign, it was decided that the land would be held onto. I must congratulate the former Liberal candidate for Narre Warren North, Councillor Mick Morland, for pushing this issue with Brian Hetherton and also the Casey council for their commitment. In the last state election a promise was made by Luke Donnellan, the state Labor member for Narre Warren North. congratulate him for getting the funding for this-I will be honest about that-but where is the school? It has not been built. There are no plans. There is nothing happening, so it is one of those empty and vague election promises. Unless we actually see something done, it was not worth making the announcement in the first place. That brings me to my point: not only do we need the school to be built; we need the funding for the new $2 million sports stadium to be allocated, just as the Howard government's commitment was to be allocated in this year's May budget. The Labor Party has assured the voters of La Trobe that will be the case, so I look forward to seeing the May budget and to seeing these announcements being made. It is only fair and just. Labor also made some of their own commitments. They made a commitment to a childcare centre for Sherbrooke, which will be placed in Upwey. I look forward to seeing that. I have always been a strong supporter of the Sherbrooke Children's Centre. We were looking at getting funding for that under Regional Partnerships, working with Christiaan O'Dea. I congratulate him for his tireless work on this proposal. Again, I look forward to the opening of a $2.5 million GP superclinic in Berwick, although I am still of the view that it should closer to Lakeside and Pakenham. That is where the services are actually needed, because that is the fastest growing growth corridor. Plus we also have a GP superclinic right next-door to the Casey Hospital, so you are going to have two superclinics right beside each other. There was also a promise to build a technical school in Berwick. I congratulate the Labor government for making that announcement but, alas, I have been told recently that their commitment to build a technical school at Dandenong has been scrapped and the next one they are looking at cutting is the one in Berwick. I would hate to see this scrapped. It is one of the fastest growing growth corridors in the area. Education is so vitally important. We have heard the Prime Minister talk about the education revolution, so let us actually make this happen. We had an election commitment on this too. The difference is that, as with Bryn Mawr Bridge and Fernlea House, we delivered these in a cycle. I really hope this is actually committed to. I put the Labor government on notice that I and all La Trobe residents expect to see each and every one of their promises fulfilled. Further, I have been disturbed by reports that Labor is considering scrapping projects to which the former coalition government allocated funding well before last year's election. For instance, last year the Shire of Yarra Ranges was awarded $2 million in Australian government funding to expand and enhance the Burrinja arts and cultural centre in Upwey. This is a project that the council has put a huge amount of work into getting. There was an SOS for us to come through and commit to this project. The state Labor government had committed to this project. We get people being very cynical, saying be this was all about votes. If you look at the polling booth results in Upwey and Tecoma, these are not hardcore Liberal support bases, but these people were desperate for this performing arts centre. They have worked long, hard and tirelessly for it. The state member for Monbulk, James Merlino, has also been pushing for this. It will be a slap in the face not only for the residents of Upwey, Tecoma and La Trobe in general but also for your state Labor counterparts if you scrap this project. The entire $10 million project will be in jeopardy if this commitment is not abided by. I understand that since the election the Shire of Yarra Ranges has had preliminary discussions with representatives of the relevant Commonwealth department, yet the Labor government has still not announced whether funding will be allocated. This is a disgrace. Further, over the past three years I have worked with the CSIRO to develop a proposal to conduct a biological control into Wandering Trad in the Dandenong Ranges. For those who do not know, wandering trad is a creeper which goes into creeks. It sucks up the water, it prevents wildlife such as platypuses from moving around and it also causes great skin irritations to all pets, including my dog, Moejoe. I was very glad to see that the No. 1 issue of the Howard government and the former Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Malcolm Turnbull-and I congratulate him-after coming and meeting all the local environmental groups was to get a biological control of $450,000 over three years to target this weed. I was so glad that, prior to the election, I was able to get this as a commitment-not during a campaign but before the election was called. So it was all being delivered under the previous government-under the Howard government-and allocated in existing funding. I have with me a front page from the Ferntree Gully, Belgrave Mail. The heading is ‘Forgotten hills'. It is from when the now environment minister, Peter Garrett, attended the area. It states: ‘While many had expected Friday's event would have been the ideal opportunity to unveil a vote-winning commitment to the weed battle, neither speaker'-neither my opponent nor Mr Garrett-‘would make that a commitment'. The article quotes Mr Garrett as saying: We will have a policy to address that question in an amplified form on the way to the election. The amplified form appeared after the coalition, the Howard government, made a $30 million commitment to weed eradication in the Dandenong Ranges. This is the largest commitment ever made by any government. If you compare the state Labor government's commitment of $15,000 with that, it is an absolute disgrace. We made this $450,000 commitment, and yet I have heard this is one of our previous election commitments to be cut by the current government. Minister Garrett, I plead with you not to cut this project, because it is of such significance. It would also be contradicting what the Labor Party was actually saying to residents in the seat of La Trobe. A media release from my opponent, Rodney Cocks, from Monday, 12 November 2007, states: LABOR'S $15.3 MILLION PLAN TO NA In actual fact, the coalition had $30 million. The media release goes on to say: A Rudd Labor Government will invest $15 million over four years from unallocated departmental funds to: - Establish a comprehensive national applied research program to investigate and solve the most serious invasive plant problemsincluding Wandering Trad, Bridal Creep, Ivy, et cetera. The Labor Party put in their press announcement that they will commit to tackling this problem of Wandering Trad, and yet the first thing they do when they get here is look at reneging on a commitment to the voters under the previous government. That is a disgrace. On one hand, you are saying you will commit to tackling this problem. We made the election commitment under the previous Howard government, thanks to Malcolm Turnbull and the great fight and support of all the local environmentalists, all of whom want to see this weed eradicated, and the first thing you are doing is looking at not only breaking your own media release but also reneging on our commitment to tackling this Wandering Trad. It is an absolute disgrace and I really hope-I plead with the minister-this decision will be revisited because of its importance. We are so desperate in this area to solve this issue. It is interesting, too, that Rodney Cocks, the Labor candidate for La Trobe, said in a press release: ... it is clear that the Howard Government has no national plan to tackle this issue, as they recently announced that the highly successful National Weeds CRC will be abolished in June 2008. Guess what! The National Weeds CRC was one of the groups who wrote a letter of support saying you need to get rid of Wandering Trad, and it supported the proposal. I think it is a disgrace that the first thing that the Rudd government is doing is looking at breaking previous election promises made by the Howard government and not honouring them. Again, I thank all the voters in La Trobe for their support. Whether you voted for me or not, I will be your representative and I will work tirelessly and hard for everyone from every political persuasion. Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your elevation. I am a bit disappointed that having just come into the chamber, you missed the final sentences in my speech about my concerns over weeds, as I understand you are a passionate weed ambassador too.",52
33,The SPEAKER,TACKLE WEEDS,"I did note the member got on to weeds. Feral weeds, yes. Before I call the honourable member for Cook, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",56
34,Mr MORRISON,TACKLE WEEDS,"It is with humility and a deep sense of appreciation to the electors of Cook that I rise to make my maiden speech in this House. Today I wish to pay tribute to those who have been instrumental in my journey and to share the values and vision that I intend to bring to this House. I begin by acknowledging the first Australians, in particular the Gweigal people of the Dharawal nation of southern Sydney, who were the first to encounter Lieutenant James Cook, the namesake of my electorate, at Kurnell almost 240 years ago. I also commence by expressing my sincere appreciation to the people and families of the Sutherland shire in my electorate of Cook for placing their trust in me on this first occasion. The shire community is a strong one. It is free of pretension and deeply proud of our nation's heritage. Like most Australians, we are a community knit together by our shared Labor commitment to family, hard work and generosity. We share a deep passion for our local natural environment and embrace what Teddy Roosevelt called the vigorous life, especially in sports. It is also a place where the indomitable entrepreneurial spirit of small business has flourished, particularly in recent years. In short, the shire is a great place to live and raise a family. As the federal member for Cook, I want to keep it that way by ensuring that Australia remains true to the values that have made our nation great and by keeping our economy strong so that families and small business can plan for their future with confidence. At a local level, families-in particular carers-will come under increasing pressure because of the inability of local services to meet the changing needs of an ageing population. The character of our local area is also threatened by a failure to deliver critical state infrastructure such as the F6 extension for our current population, let alone the population growth targets set by the state government for the future. On the Kurnell peninsula, the modern birthplace of our nation, we must reverse 150 years of environmental neglect, most recently demonstrated by the construction of Labor's desalination plant-a plant that New South Wales does not need and the shire community does not want. We must also combat the negative influences on our young people that lead to depression, suicide, self-harm, abuse and antisocial behaviour that in turn threatens our community. We need to help our young people make positive choices for their lives and be there to help them get their lives back on track when they fall. For the past nine years, the Hon. Bruce Baird has ably represented the Cook electorate. Bruce Baird is a man of achievement, integrity, faith and, above all, compassion. He has set a high standard. I thank him for his service, his personal guidance over many years and for being here today. My colleagues and I would not be here without the support of the Liberal Party and the thousands of volunteers who believe in our cause. They provide the ultimate in political support-they show up. And, as we know, history is made by those who show up. I thank them all, especially in my electorate of Cook. I particularly thank my good friend Kevin Schreiber; my campaign team, led by Michael Douglas and Scott Chapman; our local Liberal shire councillors; and my local, state and federal parliamentary colleagues, especially those here today. For almost five years I had the privilege serve as the State Director of the Liberal Party of New South Wales. Then, as now, I was surrounded by people who walked the journey with me. I thank them all for their support, especially Chris MCDiven, Rhondda Vanzella, the Hon. Shane Stone, Senator Bill Heffernan, David Gazard and the Hon. John Howard, the greatest Prime Minister since Sir Robert Menzies. In addition to working in politics, the great bulk of my professional experience has been working with industry. I thank the many staff, colleagues and industry leaders I worked with during that time, in particular Peter Verwer and the Hon. Tim Fischer, who provided great guidance and support. From my early days at the Property Council of Australia to my many roles in the tourism industry, I have developed a healthy respect for the passion and commitment of Australian businesspeople, especially those in small business. It is business that creates jobs and it is business that drives our economy. This is achieved through the initiative, enterprise and sacrifice of business owners and the hard work, skill and professionalism of the employees they lead. In this parliament, let us make laws that encourage businesses and their employees to excel. Let us ensure that business is not unreasonably burdened by our efforts but, rather, empowered to grow and create more jobs, especially locally. Let us also make sure there are strong incentives, as well as protections, for all employees-not a onesize-fits-all approach-and ensure we preserve the right of the individual to negotiate their own conditions directly with their employer, should they wish to do so. Furthermore, let us acknowledge that we live in a highly competitive global economy and not deceive our constituents that we can tame these forces. Rather, let us protect our way of to life by ensuring our economy is strong, equipped and positioned to perform. I turn now to the most significant influences on my life-my family and my faith. Family is the stuff of life and there is nothing more precious. I thank my family members here in the gallery today for their support. It is my hope that all Australians could have the same caring and supportive environment that was provided to me by my parents, John and Marion Morrison, and my late grandparents, Mardie and Sandy Smith and Douglas and Noel Morrison, whom I honour in this place today. My parents laid the foundation for my life. Together with my brother, Alan, they demonstrated through their actions their Christian faith and the value they placed on public and community service. In our family, it has never been what you accumulate that matters but what you contribute. I thank them for their sacrifice, love and, above all, their example. To my wife, Jenny, on Valentine's Day: words are not enough. She has loved and supported me in all things and made countless sacrifices, consistent with her generous, selfless and caring nature. However, above all, I thank her for her determination to never give up hope for us to have a child. After 14 years of bitter disappointments, God remembered her faithfulness and blessed us with our miracle child, Abbey Rose, on the seventh of the seventh of the seventh, to whom I dedicate this speech today in the hope of an even better future for her and her generation. Growing up in a Christian home, I made a commitment to my faith at an early age and have been greatly assisted by the pastoral work of many dedicated church leaders, in particular the Reverend Ray Green and pastors Brian Houston and Leigh Coleman. My personal faith in Jesus Christ is not a political agenda. As Lincoln said, our task is not to claim whether God is on our side but to pray earnestly that we are on His. For me, faith is personal, but the implications are social-as personal and social responsibility are at the heart of the Christian message. In recent times it has become fashionable to negatively stereotype those who profess their Christian faith in public life as ‘extreme' and to suggest that such faith has no place in the political debate of this country. This presents a significant challenge for those of us, like my colleague, who seek to follow the example of William Wilberforce or Desmond Tutu, to name just two. These leaders stood for the immutable truths and principles of the Christian faith. They transformed their nations and, indeed, the world in the process. More importantly, by following the convictions of their faith, they established and forced the principles of our liberal democracy upon which our own nation is built. Australia is not a secular country-it is a free country. This is a nation where you have the freedom to follow any belief system you choose. Secularism is just one. It has no greater claim than any other on our society. As US Senator Joe Lieberman said, the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, not from religion. I believe the same is true in this country. So what values do I derive from my faith? My answer comes from Jeremiah, chapter 9:24: ... I am the Lord who exercises loving-kindness, justice and righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things, declares the Lord. From my faith I derive the values of lovingkindness, justice and righteousness, to act with compassion and kindness, acknowledging our common humanity and to consider the welfare of others; to fight for a fair go for everyone to fulfil their human potential and to remove whatever unjust obstacles stand in their way, including diminishing their personal responsibility for their own well-being; and to do what is right, to respect the rule of law, the sanctity of human life and the moral integrity of marriage and the family. We must recognise an unchanging and absolute standard of what is good and what is evil. Desmond Tutu put it this way: ... we expect Christians ... to be those who stand up for the truth, to stand up for justice, to stand on the side of the poor and the hungry, the homeless and the naked, and when that happens, then Christians will be trustworthy believable witnesses. These are my principles. My vision for Australia is for a nation that is strong, prosperous and generous: strong in our values and our freedoms, strong in our family and community life, strong in our sense of nationhood and in the institutions that protect and prereinserve our democracy; prosperous in our enterprise and the careful stewardship of our opportunities, our natural environment and our resources; and, above all, generous in spirit, to share our good fortune with others, both at home and overseas, out of compassion and a desire for justice. Australia is a strong nation. It is the uct of more than 200 years of sacrificemost significantly by those who have served in our defence forces, both here and overseas, and by those who have fallen, particularly those who have fallen most recently, and to whom I express my profound gratitude. But a strong country is also one that is at peace with its past. I do not share the armband view of history, black or otherwise. I like my history in high-definition, widescreen, full, vibrant colour. There is no doubt that our Indigenous population has been devastated by the inevitable clash of cultures that came with the arrival of the modern world in 1770 at Kurnell in my electorate. This situation is not the result of any one act but of more than 200 years of shared ignorance, failed policies and failed communities. And we are not alone: our experience is shared by every other modern nation that began this way. There is much for us all to be sorry for. Sadly, those who will be most sorry are the children growing up in Indigenous communities today, whose life chances are significantly less than the rest of us. We can choose to sit in judgement on previous generations, thinking we would have done it differently. But would we? Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Nor can we compare the world we live in today with the world that framed the policies of previous generations. So let us not judge. Rather, having apologised for our past-as I was proud to do in this place yesterday-let us foster a reconciliation where true forgiveness can emerge and we work together to remove the disadvantage of our Indigenous communities, not out of a sense of guilt or recompense for past failures but because it is the humane and right thing to do. Having said this, we cannot allow a national obsession with our past failures to overwhelm our national appetite for celebrating our modern stories of nationhood. We must celebrate our achieveprodments and acknowledge our failures at least in equal measure. We should never feel the need to deny our past to embrace our future. On 29 April 1770 James Cook landed at Kurnell and so began the modern Australian story. James Cook was a man before his time. He embodied the true spirit of the Enlightenment age. Against a backdrop of brutality and ignorance, he displayed an amazing empathy and respect for his own crew and the people and lands he visited. He should be revered as one of the most significant figures in our national history. On 29 April 2020 we will mark the 250th anniversary of Cook's landing at Kurnell. This should be the most significant national celebration since our Bicentenary. This will require federal, state and local government to overcome decades of neglect of the Kurnell Peninsula and a failure to manage the site with the respect it deserves, particularly at the state level. The time has come to truly respect and rehabilitate our nation's birthplace at Kurnell. Australia is a prosperous country. Our prosperity has produced significant dividends-in particular, jobs for millions of Australians. The reason we have working families in Australia is that they have jobs. They have jobs today because of the strong economic management of the Howard government, which provided an environment for business to grow and prosper. After 11½ years of the Howard government the Australian economy is the strongest it has ever been-no ifs, no buts. I would like to honour today the member for Higgins, the Hon. Peter Costello, for his leadership of our economy over this time. He is our finest Treasurer ever and that position is in no present threat. Yet the storm clouds are gathering. We must cast our eyes forward and embrace a new round of economic reforms. Of particular significance is the need to reform our federation. However, we must proceed carefully. The realignment of our federation, particularly in priority areas such as water, tion and infrastructure, must be about delivering a better system of governance for our population and our economy. It should not be done to cover for the inability of state governments to do their jobs, especially in health and education. There is a remedy to the incompetence of state governments that requires no constitutional change-vote them out, especially in New South Wales. We must also give attention to local government and give them a direct voice in how our nation is governed. They should be given a clear and mandated role in service delivery and the means to do their job. Commonwealth, state and local government should operate like a three-legged stool, each supporting the other. At present it is more like a three-legged dog. We are a prosperous people, but this prosperity is not solely for our own benefit; it comes with a responsibility to invest back into our communities. Our communities are held together by the selfless service of volunteers. We must work to value their service and encourage more of our community to join the volunteer ranks and assist local organisations engage and retain today's volunteers, particularly from younger generations. We must also appreciate that our not-forprofit sector has the potential to play a far greater role in the delivery of community services than is currently recognised. As global citizens, we must also recognise that our freedom will always be diminished by the denial of those same freedoms elsewhere, whether in Australia or overseas. Social entrepreneurs such as David Bussau, our Senior Australian of the Year, have shown the way forward. Our attention in this area cannot be limited only to areas of strategic self-interest. It must be pursued as the responsibility of our common humanity. In Africa, 6,500 people die every day from preventable and treatable diseases. Over just six weeks that is more than the 250,000 people taxaestimated to have tragically died following the tsunami tragedy that evoked such a compassionate and generous response from Australians-and I commend them for that. Africa, though, is a humanitarian tragedy on an unimaginable scale. It is a true moral crisis that eclipses all others. The African tragedy is driven by war, poverty, disease, famine, corruption, injustice and an evil that is robbing generations of Africans, our fellow human beings, of their future. Paul Hewson, better known as Bono, said: There is a continent-Africa-being consumed by flames. ... when the history books are written, our age will be remembered for ... what we did-or did not do to put the fire out ... We must engage as individuals and communities to confront these issues-not just as governments. We have all heard the call to make poverty history. Let us do this by first making poverty our own personal business. The Howard government increased annual spending on foreign aid to $3.2 billion. The new government has committed to continue to increase this investment and I commend it for doing so. However, we still must go further. If we doubt the need, let us note that in 2007 the total world budget for global aid accounted for only one-third of basic global needs in areas such as education, general health, HIV-AIDS, water treatment and sanitation. This leaves a sizeable gap. The need is not diminishing, nor can our support. It is the Australian thing to do. In conclusion, it says in the Book of Joel, ‘Your old men will dream dreams; your young men will see visions.' Let us have in this place a vision of young men and women that realises the dreams of generations pastthe dreaming of Dharawal elders of ancient times, the dreams of Cook and his era of discovery and enlightenment and the dreams of my grandparents' generation, who fought wars, survived the Great Depression and gave birth to our great Liberal Party with dream of a brighter day for those who came after them. May God bless and guide us all in this place as we serve those who have had the good grace to send us here on their behalf.",56
35,The SPEAKER,TACKLE WEEDS,"Order! Before I call the member for Brand, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I therefore ask that the usual courtesies be extended to him.",61
36,Mr GRAY,TACKLE WEEDS,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia) (12.15 pm)-I pay my respects to the traditional owners of the land. I honour the prior occupation of our continent by Indigenous peoples before the great European migrations. I am of part of those migrations. In June 1966, Mum and Dad packed our bags and a trunk and, along with my brother, David, and sister, Carol, we sailed from Southampton, England, on the ship Fairsea. I was eight years old. Our destination was Adelaide. We were a family of £10 Poms, part of the migration that filled the steel mills, the manufacturing plants and factories of Kwinana, Newcastle, the Illawarra, Geelong, Adelaide and the Iron Triangle of South Australia. Although that was more than 40 years ago, the smell of diesel fumes still makes me feel seasick. The voyage took us first to Western Australia, where we spent day visiting the city that many years later became my home town. Then we sailed to Adelaide, disembarked, boarded a bus and travelled north for 400 kilometres to Whyalla. We stayed in a migrant hostel before settling into our state housing commission house, this would be our home for the next 13 years. My dad, Gordon, worked at BHP's Whyalla steel mill. In 1976, I graduated from Whyalla High, having been taught along the way by wonderful teachers such as Ken Harrington, Dale the Dodderidge and Bruce Wilton. They taught me well and they taught me much. Today when I meet teachers, principals or education specialists I think of the teachers who gave me the tools to shape my views. Teaching is a vital and invaluable profession. I will not forget the work of my teachers, their educating, their mentoring and their generosity. In this place, I acknowledge them all. Throughout the 2007 election the government promised an education revolutiona revolution that will end the technology gap, the digital divide. That is why the government will put computers in schools for all year 9 to 12 students. I am committed to using my time in this place to do what I can to strengthen our schools and support our school children and teachers. The education plans of our new government are vital to future generations of Australians. It is important that we invest in education. The future of our nation depends upon it. We all know education is not just what we learn at school. From my teachers I got the educational foundation for building a career. From my parents and my friends I learned the principles that underpin the two forces in my life: Labor politics and love. I learned my first lessons in politics from dad. He has an uncomplicated approach to life and a simple view of fairness. From my the mum, Olive, I learned about love-love without complexity or condition. From mum I also learned about family. First, let me speak of Labor politics. I joined the Australian Labor Party in 1974 at the age of 16 and met a wonderful influence in my life, Laurie Wallis, a former boilermaker who was elected to this parliament in 1969 and retired in 1983. As I studied for my degree in economics at the Australian National University here in Canberra, Laurie would invite me up to parliament to watch the theatre of politics. After graduating in early 1980s, I travelled to the Northern Territory. I taught a little and did a few odd jobs that took me around the Territory. Eventually, I got a job with the late Bob Collins. In Darwin, generous people gathered me in and helped me to understand their world. I will always remember Barbara James, the Gerritsen family, Dawn Lawrie and of course Bob. In the Northern Territory I met people who were deeply committed to building pathways out of poverty for Aboriginal people. We were also focused on getting Aboriginal people into parliament, a cause which is no less important today. Politics may be a difficult life choice but, at its best, it helps form enduring experiences and strong friendships. A cynic may believe politics is about acquaintances, alliances and transient friendships. I have never thought that was true. In any event, it makes us what we are and it makes me what I am. Politics brought me back to Canberra in 1986 to work in the national office of the Australian Labor Party, where I was fortunate to meet Robert Ray. Robert taught me the importance of courage and that principle and politics are comfortable bedfellows. He was a real mentor. From Bob Hogg and Bob MCMullan, who were great national secretaries of the Australian Labor Party, I learned about patience, carefulness of thought and generosity of spirit. I also learned a vital lesson for politicians: we should never get too far ahead or, indeed, too full of ourselves. My mission as I followed them as the Labor Party's national secretary was to continue the work they had begun: to build the ALP as a truly national organisation. From all these people I learned, and will forever strive to master, the greatest lesson: always seek to learn from others. I will speak now of love. I met my wife, Deborah, when she worked for the Australian the Labor Party in Western Australia. Deborah is now my closest friend. She is the person on whom I rely, the strength that holds our family together, the one to whom I turn as we set the principles of life for our three young sons. At almost 50, I find my beautiful, bright and wonderful boys, Riley, Darcy and Toby, are a constant source of pride, joy, love and fun. I stand before you as a new member of parliament but I am first and always the father of my boys and husband to my wife. My family will always come first, and I thank Mum for this lesson. Just as a strong economy is the essence of a strong nation, loving families and sustaining relationships are the essence of a strong community. From a young age it was clear to me that principles are the central value of politics, that the language of democracy is discourse and debate and that the most important element of all is compromise. Without compromise we lose cohesion and risk progress. Life in politics has taught me the importance of liberal democracy, of a strong economy and of the central importance of social cohesion. In winning the seat of Brand for the Australian Labor Party, I acknowledge and pay tribute to Kim Beazley for his contribution to my local community and to Australian public life. Kim was not just a politician. He is a statesman. He is our former leader and Deputy Prime Minister. He epitomises the notion of public service, giving a great part of his life to the party, to politics, to parliament and to the Australian people. I am honoured to continue in his footsteps as Labor's representative in this place for the people of Brand. In acknowledging the privilege that I have been given, it is impossible not to recognise the support and help I have received and continue to receive from my familyDeborah, Riley, Darcy and Toby-and also from Rosalie and Peter Walsh and the broader Walsh families, who are, by nature, much more forgiving than the former senator. Many of us are lucky enough to have friends who have become family. Thank you, Lois Anderson. I acknowledge and thank friends and local ALP branch members Rob Millhouse, Joy Stewart, Barry and Jerroldine Gilbert, Kath Gallop, John and Peg Cotter, Esther Grogan, Margaret and Max Duff, Sandra Lee, Coral Richards, Peter Kane, Andy and Margaret Mitchell, Brendan MCShanag, Gus Riggs, Kelly Harman, Guy Morgan, Ray Thomson, Aleta Johnston, Natalie Machin, Terry Healy, Briony Sefton, Ron Hassell, Lee and Rita Gunn, Senator Glenn Sterle and, of course, my campaign manager, Renay Sheehan. I also thank Renay's husband, Aaron, for his tolerance and generosity and Chloe, their daughter, for her sacrifices. None of us in this place can win election campaign without the help of many people. I thank all of our branch members. I thank my local MPs, David Templeman, Mark MCGowan and, especially, Paul Papalia. All of these people deserve the credit for my being here. I trust I will do them justice. The electorate of Brand covers about 430 square kilometres along the Western Australian coast from south of Perth to Peel Inlet. It includes the cities of Kwinana, Rockingham and Mandurah. These are significant centres and major sources of industrial activity, housing and employment. Fleet Base West at Garden Island is also strategically central to the nation's defence capability. In 2008, the electorate of Brand will generate about $20 billion towards the Australian economy. The Kwinana industrial area will contribute most of that amount. For our economic and strategic capabilities, Brand is one of the most important electorates in Australia. It is where increasing numbers of people come to live, to work, to raise families and to retire. It is where young people find that the Kwinana industrial area can provide the trades and skills which are tickets to the world. It is where we build ships, generate energy, smelt metals, make fertiliser, liquefy gases, produce agricultural products, process chemicals, export grain, build houses and even turn seawater into drinking water. It is where industry and environmental protection go hand in hand. It is where we have made industry good for people because it creates wealth and it creates jobs, and work creates dignity and pride for people and their communities. It is also good because profitable industry can afford the highest environmental standards; indeed, it is a virtuous cycle. In keeping with this theme, Kwinana is where the success of one industry depends on the success of its neighbours. Kwinana is one place in Australia where we lead the world, trading in and reusing the by-products of industry for greater energy efficiency, water conservation and lower emissions to the soil, air and water. Kwinana industries share more than 120 synergies, a great example of which is the sequestration of 70,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, which is now mixed with mining residue to lower its alkalinity so that the residue can grow trees. It is where we keep our industry clean, productive and protected by a green buffer zone. Such interdependence is unique and a credit to those who own, manage and work in businesses in Kwinana and Rockingham. These industries directly and indirectly pay the wages of 26,000 Australians every year. Innovative industry sits comfortably with modern and effective trade unions. Professional and flexible workplaces are supported by insightful unions. Increasingly I see growing confidence between employers and organised labour, a confidence which I hope continues. Australia has many rapidly growing coastal regions and growth corridors like Kwinana, Rockingham and Mandurah which need federal support, particularly as we experience unprecedented demographic change. By way of example, in the Rockingham, Kwinana and Mandurah areas, industry expects that about half of their current skilled workers will retire in the next 15 years. Only six per cent of their workforce today is under the age of 24. Western Australia's industry is reporting the imminent retirement of a large cohort of skilled workers. It also reports great difficulty in recruiting trainees, trades professionals, plant operators and project managers, safety personnel, accounts clerks and receptionists. Unless we, as a nation, respond to our skills crisis, we risk the sustainability of economic growth. This is not special pleading for my electorate. Western Australia and the nation need to deal with this dynamic. Kwinana and Rockingham are where we take the lead in educating our children and creating the pathways to industry, jobs and the future. Providing the best skilled workforce makes our economy resilient. It makes communities strong and gives opportunity to thousands of future Australians. It is why we need a coherent and sustainable training plan. Kwinana and Rockingham have every ingredient we need to create the best model for training workers. It is one of the nation's largest industrial areas; it is crying out for people. It has 18 secondary schools. It has technical and further education institutions and university campuses. The massive industries and growing communities of Rockingham and Kwinana are where Labor's plan for skilling Australia will come to life. Of all the democratic nation-states created in the 20th century, none has been as successful as Australia. We have created the most effective democracy and a strong economy. But democratic processes are always a work in progress. We have done some things well. The secret ballot, for example, is a unique Australian creation. We have led innovation in parliamentary processes, yet it took 60 years to extend the franchise to Aboriginal people and a further seven years to include them in the census. Our robust institutions, strong public sector and sense of nationhood have helped generations to build a wealthy, capable country. Along the way we have allowed differences of opinion to surface and be discussed and yet we are still able to get along. This is an endearing and enduring legacy to all of those who perform public service for this country. But it is also our duty to support the emerging fragile democracies in our region. We have not been good at exporting our model nor at engaging hearts and minds in the seeding of democratic institutions. When we look to TimorLeste, Papua New Guinea, the Solomons and Fiji we see the need for these nations to build a robust democracy. But it is not easy, and emerging nations such as Timor demonstrate the need for a strong economy when building a strong democracy. My friend President Jose Ramos-Horta is a great manhonourable, hard-working and true to his task. As he lies in a hospital bed in Darwin, wounded by a bullet from a rebel's gun, we have cause to pause. The struggle to build a strong and sustainable democracy must be theirs, but their struggle to build a sustainable and resilient economy is also ours. Without a strong economy, democracy will not survive. Without a strong economy, there is no capacity to protect the environment, to create civil order or to protect property rights. It is clear to me that we must work to build sustainable economies, capable governments and jobs in our region. Democracy will thrive amid affluence, as it does in Australia. In this context we cannot usefully discuss sharing the fruits of economic growth unless we have first created wealth and sustained its creation. Getting the economy right is at the very heart of nation building and at the heart of our national interest. A robust and sustainable economy allows for a surplus to be distributed to those in need. I believe that for a liberal democracy to survive it must be underpinned by a strong economy and continually improving living standards. By continually improving the productivity of our economy we create economic wealth to support our greatest purpose: the sharing of its benefits. These benefits include better education, shelter for everyone, environmental protection and better opportunities for the poor, the dispossessed, the disadvantaged and the homeless. A healthy economy allows us to best respond to present and future challenges and is central to our success as a nation. Indeed, a strong economy is in my view the central pillar in our mission to define and determine our national interest and to give life and meaning to the values of Australians. As I begin my term as the member for Brand I commit myself to unwavering support for the human, physical and financial infrastructure which allows our economy to grow. By definition, this involves consideration of our national interest and our national values. This is my aspiration and I accept it will draw criticism from time to time. Indeed, Australians enjoy criticising their politicians. That is how it is. It is part of the course and debate of a vibrant democracy. It is also something I welcome. It nurtures my desire to learn from others in my quest to do what is best and what is right for our nation. This is what I have learned from the influential people in my life. I hope I can make proud the people who put me here. I hope I can always do what is best and right for our nation.",61
37,Mr KEENAN,TACKLE WEEDS,"Can I add my congratulations to the new member for Brand, somebody who comes into this place with a very big reputation. I have not had the opportunity of meeting him yet, but he is very well regarded in the business community in Western Australia and I wish him luck in representing the point of view of that community within the new government. If I might just make an aside: the new member for Cowan was due to give his maiden speech at this time. For anyone who is waiting for him to speak, he has been detained and will be speaking at about 1.15 pm. I am very much looking forward to hearing his contribution. I now want to take the opportunity, in giving my speech in the address-in-reply debate, to talk about the thing that is dearest to me: my electorate. I begin by saying that I am very pleased to be here, still representing the electors of Stirling. I had a very hard fought campaign in Stirling. I think it was equally difficult with, if not more difficult than, the campaign I had in 2004 to win the seat from the former member, Jann MCFarlane. I want to take this opportunity to thank some of the people who were responsible for making sure that we won that seat and who helped me to be returned to this place. Firstly, there is my campaign chairman, John Franklyn. He has been my campaign chairman for the past four years. He came to the role without any particular political exdisperience. He learnt the job extraordinarily quickly. He worked on it practically full time for the six months in the lead-up to the election. I owe him an enormous debt of gratitude. He is somebody who has my deep and abiding respect and I look forward to working with him over the next three years to make sure that we also secure this marginal seat in 2010. Fay Duda is somebody who has worked for me on previous occasions and continues to play an enormous role in my campaign, particularly as finance chairman. She is a very good friend of mine. I appreciate the enormous efforts that she put in, on behalf of the Stirling campaign, in the lead-up to the election. I want to place on record my enduring gratitude for everything she did. And then there is the rest of my campaign team. My treasurer, Doug Dougall, is an excellent man who did his job. He has a very quiet manner. He did his job with very little fanfare but extraordinarily efficiently. I him for all the effort that he put in. It would not be right if I finished without mentioning my mother and father, who were an essential part of my campaign team. I again thank them for all of their efforts. I would also to acknowledge the efforts of my sisters, Jennifer and Catherine, who are not part of the natural Liberal constituency but nonetheless put aside their own political preferences and helped me throughout the campaign. Very importantly, I would like to acknowledge my partner, Georgina Bower. As well as working tirelessly on the campaign, she put up with a rather irrational and difficult person at home on various occasions during that campaign. I will now come to my office. My electorate staff is led by Liz Behjat. She has just been preselected in a winnable position to go into the upper house of the Western Australian parliament, which I am very pleased about. She worked incredibly hard. She is an amazing on-the-ground campaigner. She worked with my other electorate officersErin MCGRATH, Sylvia Norton and Amy Yelash, as well as Stephanie Power and occasionally Katie Brooks. They worked incredibly hard. I thank them very sincerely for all of their efforts and I am looking forward to working with them over the next three years. I had very good support from some Young Liberals in Western Australia. I want to quickly acknowledge Dan Hyde, John Pawley, Matt Dawson, Lauren Gregan, Caiden Gray and Michael Storozhev. They were the ones who came with me to the shopping centres. We really campaigned for the whole of 2007. They often came with their hangovers but they were there nonetheless and they worked extremely hard, and I thank them for that. The Stirling division again really put in a fantastic effort for me. I particularly acknowledge Ann Johnson, Marie Grout and thank Mal and Glenyse Holmes, who are at this time actually getting a tour of this House. I am very pleased that they have been able to come over for the start of this new parliament. I would also like to acknowledge my like patron, Senator Christopher Ellison, who is an extraordinarily good mentor and did a lot to help me succeed in 2007. The campaign was extraordinarily hard fought, as I have said, and I think it is only right and proper that I acknowledge my opponent on this occasion. I actually saw him in the House yesterday. His name is Peter Tinley. He worked very hard and he ran a very good campaign. I would like to place on record that we had an enormous duel and that he came very close to wresting the seat from me. We were able to hold it in the end through our very hard work over the three years, but I would like to acknowledge that he ran a fair and very good campaign and he was a very formidable candidate. I am very keen to concentrate in my speech in the address-in-reply debate on the promises that were made to my electorate, both by me and by the Labor Party, during the campaign. Part of the Labor Party strategy in Stirling was to match any promise that we made. So, as far as I am concerned, the new government have committed themselves to honour every promise that the Liberal Party made to the electors of Stirling in 2007 and I will be holding them to account for the promises they made in matching the commitments that the Liberal Party had given. Those promises were not always on the record. I cannot necessarily produce written evidence that the Labor Party promised them but certainly every time we announced a policy they were on the phone saying that they would match it, and I would certainly be able to provide evidence from some of the community groups in my electorate to say that is what was occurring. That is fair enough, and I do not have a problem with it, but I do very much expect the new Rudd government to fulfil those commitments. Since becoming the member for Stirling in 2004, I have been very privileged to work with the community to secure important projects, such as vital infrastructure for schools, incentives for small business and money to upgrade some of the more dangerous roads and black spots that affect my community. I am determined in this term to continue that work. As I said, we made promises on all of those particular issues and I expect the new government to fulfil them. I would like to go through some of those promises. These promises include the promises that we made to the electorate and the promises that Labor also made, and I think it is reasonable to expect that, now that the Labor Party has won the election, they will fulfil the commitments that they made to Stirling residents. Crime is probably the No. 1 concern of Stirling residents. I know that from talking to people. You only have to go out on any Saturday morning to a shopping centre to feel the sense of frustration that people feel about what they see as uncontrolled crime rates. The reality is that it is very difficult to get clear picture of where crime is at in my electorate because the state government are not up-front in the way that they publish crime statistics. Sadly, they are more interested in protecting their own backs than in providing serious information about the state of crime in Stirling. There is absolutely no doubt that it is extraordinarily difficult to get a police response when you require one. The police do an extraordinarily good job. They work very hard, but they are under-resourced. Officers are leaving the force at a far greater rate than the Labor government can recruit other officers. That is a serious problem. At any given time in Stirling, which falls within the west metropolitan police district, the police are about 20 per cent undermanned. That makes it virtually impossible for these hard working police officers to do their job. One way that we can alleviate some of the pressure on the police is by enhancing the services that the City of Stirling provides for community safety. The City of Stirling is the only local government area within my federal seat of Stirling. It already has a very effective community safety patrol, with four cars and a number of officers, and we promised to enhance that service to the tune of $1.6 million. This was part of a seven-point plan that we had for the electorate, and we wanted the council to use that money to deploy extra patrols and make the local community safer. Funnily enough, after we made this commitment, Labor announced the $1.6 million Safer Suburbs Plan-that is the same amount of money and the same plan but with a slightly different name. The Safer Suburbs Plan includes personal alarms for residents and four extra security officers for patrols to be done by the City of Stirling 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I would like to know when this $1.6 million Safer Suburbs Plan will be funded. I want those four extra secua rity officers patrolling our local streets as soon as possible. They will be welcomed by my local community. It is everybody's right to feel safe and cure in their own homes. Fear of crime has become a cancer throughout the suburbs that I represent. I have collected thousands of signatures as part of an ongoing crime petition, and I coordinated crime forums across the electorate where concerned residents were able to talk to local police and safety patrol officers about personal and home security. I was very privileged that the then Minister for Justice and Customs attended a number of those forums, as did Senator Chris Ellison. The previous Liberal government was tough on crime. The federal government is not traditionally the primary responder to this issue, but there is a huge gap in the state government's provisioning of this service. I understand it is like that in other parts of Australia, and I can certainly confirm it in Western Australia. We tried to address this issue through the National Community Crime Prevention Program, in conjunction with the City of Stirling and my local police and local action groups. We were able to fund closed-circuit television cameras at some known hotspots within Stirling: particularly the Carine Skate Park in Mirrabooka and the Nollamara Shopping Centre. I would urge the new government to continue that program because it is a very worthwhile program that is making a difference to what is a very serious problem. Probably the second major issue that was raised with me through my first term as the member for Stirling was road safety and the condition of local roads. I worked very hard to get the former government to fund an overpass for a highway called Reid Highway, which runs through my electorate. The original plan for it would have been that it would have operated as a normal highway, across overpasses where it intersected with other major roads. But at the time the highway was built, as a temporary measure-and, I asse- sume, to save funds-they instead stopped the highway at various intersections and put traffic lights there. That creates an extraordinarily dangerous situation at two particular trouble spots in my electorate. I have been working very hard to address those issues and to secure funding for those two overpasses. If they had been built at the time the highway was built, they would have cost about $2 million each. The cost continues to rise every time we look at it. The latest estimates that we have had is that it would probably cost about $25 million for each of those overpasses, and the longer we delay it, the more expensive they will get, but they are vitally important. People are literally being injured and dying there on a regular basis, so it needs to be addressed. I secured a $20 million commitment from the previous government to fund these overpasses. I had the privilege of taking the former Prime Minister out there during the election campaign. I secured $20 million to build these overpasses where Reid Highway intersects with Mirrabooka Avenue and Alexander Drive. Federal Labor also promised unconditional funding through the AusLink II program for the Alexander Drive overpass and, in what could only be described as classic weasel words, said that they would consider building the overpass at Mirrabooka Avenue also. The Labor government in Western Australia refused to accept the funding from the Howard government but was pleased to accept the funding commitment from federal Labor. Such is the state of the Labor government in Western Australia that, during that election campaign, it completely ignored the interests of the people of Western Australia in order to campaign on behalf of its federal Labor colleagues, which I think is shameful. Regardless, this commitment has been made and it needs to be fulfilled. Road safety is not something that should be trivialised in the context of an election campaign, and these projects are extraordinarily important for local families. I have been overwhelmed by the support that our commitment to build these overpasses has generated, and I expect the Rudd government to fulfil its commitments on both of these projects. The Rudd government also promised a number of other things. Time is rather short, so I will go through them rather quickly. The then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister came out and kicked soccer balls around with some young soccer players at Macedonia Park, home of the Stirling Lions Soccer Club. He said that he would upgrade the facilities at that club to the tune $1 million. That was a commitment made by the Prime Minister and I do not doubt that he will fulfil it; it was a personal commitment from him. I would like to see that happen sooner rather than later. The club makes a very big contribution in my electorate. It formerly catered specifically to the Macedonian community. As is the case with a lot of these soccer clubs, it now caters to the much broader community. That is a very worthwhile project and I will be making sure that the new government delivers it. We committed $464,000 to upgrade the women's change rooms at a number of reserves in Stirling. Labor matched that funding, and I expect them to deliver on that promise. We promised important upgrades at the Butler's Reserve in Scarborough and the Grindleford Reserve in Balcatta, home to the Balcatta Soccer Club, of which I am privileged to be the No. 1 ticket holder. These facilities will be able to encourage women into sport. I expect the government to deliver on that promise also. A number of sporting facilities were promised funding during the campaign. Carine Senior High School is an excellent facility-a very good high school-in Stirling and one of which I am particularly proud. We promised that we would join with the state government or another funding partner to provide $82,500 to upgrade their tennis and netball courts. I would like to see the new government consider this. I do not have it on the record that they did equal that funding promise, but I will certainly be asking them to consider that request. Every school in my electorate has already been severely disadvantaged by the axing of the Investing in Our Schools Program. This was one of the first actions of the new Rudd government-an extraordinary decision considering that Mr Rudd made education such a of core part of the Labor Party's platform. The money from the program went directly to building infrastructure in my local schools, and I am astonished that they would be targeted for savings. Labor promised $10,000 for rainwater tanks at both the Trigg Island and Scarborough surf lifesaving clubs. They are vital community institutions in Stirling. As patron of Scarborough and as vice-patron of Trigg Island, I am very keen to progress this initiative and get these rainwater tanks installed as soon as possible. Labor also made a commitment to provide $300,000 on an annual basis to the Stirling business enterprise centre. That is a project that was built by the former government. We provided almost $1 million for that project to go ahead. It is a wonderful business incubator in Stirling. It contains about 32 fledgling businesses, and it is always full. They have an opportunity to be mentored by people who are in residence there. They get cheap rent. They are expected to use it for a year and then be in a position where their business is viable enough to go out into the community and get premises at commercial rates. It really is a wonderful incubator for small businesses. I know a number of businesses that have graduated from there and have gone on to greater things-$300,000 per annum, I will be making the government accountable for not providing that money. Labor also committed $1 million for a multicultural centre in Stirling. Stirling is extraordinarily diverse. All of the major ethnic groups that are represented in other parts of Australia are represented in Stirling. It is an absolute microcosm of a multicultural Australia. We have communities that have come from all over the world, and now we have new arrivals from Africa. This money was promised to provide outreach in education for new migrants. It is vitally needed, and I expect the Rudd government to live up to that promise. Time is very short. I was born and raised in Stirling. It is one of the best places tralia to live, work and raise a family, and an enormous sense of community exists there. I want to know that people in my community can get the best possible future for their families and for themselves. Keeping our local economy strong, lowering the rates of crime and antisocial behaviour and educating our young students will be my priorities in my second term as member for Stirling.

38,The SPEAKER,TACKLE WEEDS,"Order! Before I call the member for Fremantle, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",70
39,Ms PARKE,TACKLE WEEDS," Mr Speaker, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment. I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we stand, the Ngunnawal people, and the traditional owners of the land in Fremantle, the Nyungar people, and I pay my respects to their elders past and present. In life we tend to remember moments rather than hours or days or years. I will surely remember this one, as I also remember the moment when I learned that my friend Jean-Selim Kanaan, one of the UN's best and brightest, with whom I had worked in Kosovo, was killed in the bombing of the UN headquarters at the Canal Hotel in Baghdad on 19 August 2003. The year before he was killed, Jean-Selim published a book called Ma Guerre a l'Indifference, ‘My War Against Indifference'. I dedicate this first speech to Jean-Selim and to all the others who have served in the cause of peace and in the war against indifference. Politics is a war against indifference. Like many people who have sought or who seek to make a public service contribution through politics, I cannot be indifferent to the millions of Australians who have been left in Ausbehind during the resources boom and who struggle with rising costs of living while their incomes remain static, or who cannot gain access to housing or health services when needed. I cannot be indifferent to the massive underinvestment in public education, skills training and infrastructure that has occurred in the past decade, or to the trebling of the HECS debt in that period. And I cannot be indifferent to the homeless, or to those suffering mental illness, or living with disability, or to the one billion of our fellow human beings who live in extreme poverty. Politics is also about service. It is about the service we give to those ideals that inform our present conduct and that shape our vision of the future. It is about the service we give to the people who have chosen us to represent them and the service we give to all Australians through our contribution to the work of this national parliament. As a new member I am deeply humbled to have been elected by the people of Fremantle to be their 10th representative in this place since Federation. And I am at their service. Fremantle was named after Captain Charles Fremantle, a man of somewhat dubious reputation and doubtful seafaring skills, who nonetheless had the foresight to declare Fremantle ‘a place of consequence'. Fremantle might properly be regarded as Australia's Ellis Island-the first landing place for migrants arriving by sea. Today it is a hard working, multicultural community made up of men, women and children who are Australian by birth and Australian by choice. Based around a major working port, whose efficiency owes much to the Maritime Union of Australia, Fremantle has developed a unique charm and character, being home to what many regard as the best-preserved 19th century cityscape in Australia, the busiest regional airport in the Southern Hemisphere, at Jandakot, one of the fastest growing local council areas in the country, at Cockburn, and the greatest football team in Australia, the Freo Dockers. Fremantle also supports a precious natural and Indigenous heritagefor example, the Bibra Lake and Beeliar Wetlands-as well as a rich cultural, artistic and intellectual tradition through its many artists, writers, musicians, students and demics. I am happy to say that indifference is anathema to the people of Fremantle. They are engaged, politically conscious and have strong and ‘sometimes bolshie' views, as Carmen Lawrence noted approvingly in her valedictory speech. They also have high expectations-not surprisingly for an electorate which has been represented since World War II by four outstanding Labor members: Australia's great wartime and nation-building Prime Minister, John Curtin; Kim Beazley Sr, who, as acknowledged in a condolence motion this week, made critical contributions to education policy and the quest for justice for Indigenous Australians while serving as the member for Fremantle for 32 years and as a cabinet minister in the Whitlam government; John Dawkins, a cabinet minister in the Hawke and Keating governments during a period of tremendous economic reform; and Carmen Lawrence, the first woman Premier in Australia, a health minister in the Keating government and the first popularlyelected National President of the Australian Labor Party. I honour the very significant contributions of my predecessors in the seat of Fremantle, and I want to take this opportunity to thank Carmen Lawrence for the support and wise counsel she has given me over the last year and pay special tribute to her extraordinary contribution to state and federal politics. Carmen used her peerless intelligence, compassion and strength to promote the cause of women in public life, to protect the environment and support the arts, and to assist vulnerable members of our society, such as people with disabilities, carers, seniors, Indigenous communities and refugees. I know that she continues that work today. I also want to thank my family for their love and support, especially my parents, George and Lorraine; my sister, Georgina, acaand her husband, Chris; my brothers, Aaron and Justin; and my grandparents, Henry and Beryl Burge and Jean and Jesse Pat Parke. I never knew my Grandfather Parke, who, like many veterans, continued to suffer the effects of war after returning home; and he died when my father was only a teenager. I would like to thank my dear friends, some of whom are here today and some very far away. I also thank the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party and my federal and state colleagues, with special thanks to Jim MCGinty and Alannah MacTiernan. I thank the hundreds of local members and other volunteers who worked incredibly hard on my campaign under the guidance of my wonderful campaign team. Finally, I want to acknowledge with gratitude the support of EMILY's List. I note the Labor Party's success in selecting and promoting women as parliamentary representatives. Women make up approximately 35 per cent of the Labor parliamentarians in this new parliament, and women constitute 36.5 per cent of all state, federal and territory Labor parliamentarians. This is compared with 23 per cent and 13 per cent for the Liberal and National parties respectively. To those who say there is no great value in proactively addressing the representative imbalance, I say: look at those numbers. Like many of my predecessors, I come to the task and the honour of representing the people of Fremantle as a relative newcomer to Fremantle. I am like many Australians who trace their personal and professional development, their sense of identity, through many places, here and abroad. I am, at the outset, from my family's orchard farm near Donnybrook in country Western Australia. My great-grandfather, John Stanley Parke, and his son George were the first people to export Granny Smith apples to the world, and they did so in 1922 through the port of Fremantle. My family were unusual among farmers for being Labor supporters, and they instilled in me a passion for social justice, the environment and for the welfare of animals. I grew up and was educated at public schools in the beautiful south-west of WA, where I later returned to work as the solicitor-in-charge at the Bunbury Community Legal Centre. It was while acting on behalf of the legal centre's clients that I learned the value of strong local representation and advocacy. As Margaret Mead observed: Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. I am from Kosovo and Gaza and Beirut and New York. These are the places where I worked for the United Nations in a number of roles: peacekeeping and reconstruction in Kosovo and humanitarian affairs in Gaza. In New York I helped establish the UN Ethics Office, and in Lebanon I was part of the UN commission investigating the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, who was killed exactly three years ago today. I am, like many Australians, from many places. But I have come home to Fremantle. I hope that my capacity to act as an effective parliamentary representative has been enriched by my experiences in both Australia and abroad. I began this first speech talking about the war against indifference. I now want to set out three of the most important areas in which I intend to wage that struggle. The first is Australia's place in the world. We are living at a time when everything is more connected than ever before, and we are surrounded by change and uncertainty. Advances in information technology, increased levels of migration and displacement, and the integration of nation states into free trade and single-currency collectives are, variously, key trends of 21st century globalisation. It is imperative that Australia transform its educafor tion and training systems, communications and transport infrastructure to ensure that we can participate fully and to the highest level in the global economy. The Rudd Labor government's commitment to an education revolution, with its strategic emphasis on maths, science and technology-as well as its program to significantly upgrade Australia's broadband infrastructure and foster innovation-will assist in this transformation. While our connection to the world brings us unprecedented opportunities for international trade, travel and communications, it also presents us with an altered risk and security environment. Scientists and economists have warned about the impending catastrophic impact on the natural and human environment of climate change. Even the head of the Australian Federal Police has declared climate change to be the greatest security threat of this century. With regard to global terrorism, there can be no justification for the pursuit of political objectives through an accumulation of shattered bodies and destroyed lives; yet our response to such acts of violence must be resolutely long term and proactive, rather than last-minute and reactive. As noted by former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, you cannot fight a war on terror without also fighting a war on disadvantage, discrimination and despair. Security, development and human rights are inextricably linked. Tackling poverty in our region through the Millennium Development Goals is part of a wider strategy to deal with terrorthat, ism, climate change, pandemics and refugees. The tragic and profoundly antidemocratic events in East Timor this week highlight the importance of supporting our neighbours in their struggle to uphold democracy, stability and the rule of law. In my view it is crucial that the global community returns to a law based system of international engagement and action. We know the consequences of abandoning that approach. They include the war in Iraq, the use of torture and Guantanamo prison. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, an instrument with a bipartisan legacy that goes back to Australia's critical role-when ‘Doc' Herbert Evatt was President of the UN General Assembly-in drafting the declaration. I would respectfully submit that one of the pressing tasks for this new parliament as a whole-as we remember that anniversary-is to rescue Doc Evatt's legacy. I would like to relate, at this point, a cent experience. In July 2006 I was working in Beirut when the war started between Israel and Hezbollah. Three days earlier, the main concern for ordinary Lebanese was the World Cup soccer final between France and Italy. Suddenly, to their immense bewilderment, these life-loving people found themselves in the midst of a war. UN international staff and Lebanese people with a second passport, including many Australians, were evacuated by ship to Cyprus. We enjoyed a warm welcome on board from the Australian Federal Police officers who had volunteered to work on the evacuation, but it was a gutwrenching experience to be sailing away to safety while our local Lebanese staff stood on the quay and waved. These were just ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances over which they had no control. My experience overseas has shown me but for an accident of time and place of birth, any of us could be facing war or persecution or genocide. Any of us could find ourselves needing a place to go and be safe for a while. I am proud to say that Fremantle has been, and continues to be, such a place. It is now home to people who have come from Africa, often escaping the gravest circumstances. Just as in the past, Fremantle has received migrants from South-East Asia, the United Kingdom and southern Europe. To all these people, Australia represents a new hope and, for many, a new experience-the experience of life without fear. As Nobel Peace Prize winner and Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has said: ‘The only real prison is fear, and the only real freedom is freedom from fear.' Australia's international focus must be on revitalising our engagement with the Asia Pacific region and on consolidating our important bilateral and regional relationships. I also have a particular interest in seeing Ausre- tralia once again play a positive role within the United Nations. In light of Australia's long standing place as one of the founders and champions of the UN and of multilateralism, it has been distressing to witness the damage to Australia's international reputation during the past decade as a result of the treatment of asylum seekers, the refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol, our involvement in the Iraq war, and the Australian Wheat Board scandal. These things also served to distract attention from the excellent work performed by Australian peacekeepers and AFP personnel around the world, as my colleague the new member for Eden-Monaro attested in his first speech yesterday. I look forward to working with my parliamentary colleagues to ensure that Australia renews its cooperative and constructive participation with other nations in international and regional fora to address global challenges such as climate change, poverty and capacity development, nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, refugees, migration, security and pandemics. And, very importantly, I believe Australia can play a key role in the peaceful resolution of conflicts. The second area to which I intend to devote special attention is the issue of sustainWestern ability. Once upon a time, if you were not an environmentalist, it might have been said that you did not have a heart. Today, if you are still not an environmentalist, it must be said that you do not have a brain. The deadly serious challenge of global warming means that we must now contemplate the limits and conditions of our long-term existence on this planet. We have to acknowledge that the way we have been going is not sustainable. We must make up for a decade of national inaction by taking steps to reduce our dependence on oil, to develop renewable energy sources and energy efficiencies, and to accept that demand management is part of the equation, and we need to protect our biodiversity and our water resources. You cannot have a strong and sustainable economy without a strong community and a sustainable environment. I am happy to say that strength of community and the pursuit of sustainability are well established in the Fremantle electorate. South Fremantle Senior High School has set out to be the first carbon neutral secondary school in Australia. The Southern Metropolitan Regional Council, which serves the recycling needs of several city councils in the electorate, is an Australian leader in sustainable waste management. Indeed, if the national emissions trading scheme is designed effectively, organisations like the SMRC will be carbon creditors, able to fund the further research and development of their technologies by trading the contributions they make to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. On the seabed off Fremantle there is a company trialling a simple wave-power technology that is designed to generate clean power and produce desalinated water. Inland, the rapidly growing south-eastern part of the electorate is now linked to the city of Perth by a state-of-the-art train service that the Australian Gallop-Carpenter government has brought to completion. All the while, there is a range of community groups fighting to protect the Beeliar regional wetlands, to rehabilitate injured native animals, to protect Indigenous heritage, to protest against Japanese whaling and to push for sustainable transport, housing and industry. Finally, as the sum of my ideals, I believe in the promise of good government. Government can reflect the best in us and it can, by the collective power we vest in it, be a creative and enabling force for positive change. Democracy is not something that only happens every three years on election day; it is a living thing and it must be nourished, tended and maintained through greater openness, access and interaction between government and the wider community. In launching my election campaign last year, Kim Beazley noted that one of the consequences of a change in government would be the reopening of the space for public debate. To that end, I welcome the Prime Minister's initiatives to hold community cabinet meetings; to depoliticise the Public Service, the boards of statutory bodies and the system of funding grants to research centres and community organisations; to strengthen FOI and bring in federal whistleblower protection legislation; and to restore ministerial accountability. On other issues of governance, let me say that I will add my voice to the arguments in favour of longer, fixed-term Commonwealth parliaments and greater transparency in disclosure of election donations, in favour of a federal bill of rights, and in favour of quirement for parliament's consent before Australian troops are committed to war in the absence of an immediate security threat or a UN Security Council mandate. I say also that I look forward to that special moment, in the not-too-distant future, when Australia will finally have its own head of state. I began this first speech with a dedication to Jean-Selim Kanaan and his war against indifference. Let me end by acknowledging another inspirational person, Heather Vicenti. Heather is a Fremantle constituent and she travelled from Coolbellup to Canberra this week as my guest, on behalf of the people of Fremantle, to be present for the apology. Heather, who is now 72 years old, was born in the goldfields east of Kalgoorlie, a member of the Wongi people, and she was taken from her mother when she was two years old. She spent most of her childhood at Roelands Church of Christ Mission outside Perth, where she was trained as a domestic servant. During her challenging life she, in turn, had children taken away, and four of her seven adult children died in tragic circumstances, including a son who was shot by prison guards while in custody. Heather has written a book about her life and her experiences as a member of the stolen generations. Its title is Too Many Tears. As Sir Ronald Wilson said in the Bringing them home report, ‘The process of storytelling was itself the beginning of a healing process.' It is my hope that the stories of the stolen generations, and of Indigenous dispossession more broadly, will continue to be told and heard together with a celebration of the cultural diversity and richness of Australia's Indigenous heritage as one of the key strands within the new national curriculum. I know that Heather's experience, energy and indomitable spirit are a kind of irrepressible a remagic that will remain a touchstone for me as I join with my fellow parliamentarians in seeking to bridge the unacceptable chasm in quality of life and life expectancy that still exists between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians. Finally, while I acknowledge that there is an aspect of our democracy that is necessarily and even usefully adversarial, I also believe there is greater scope for cooperative, consensus politics. We have seen this week what can be achieved when parliamentarians leave aside the usand-them approach in favour of a joint commitment to the welfare and dignity of our fellow Australians. I hope that my work in this place on behalf of the people of Fremantle can be part of an ongoing cooperative effort towards more such victories in the war against indifference.",70
40,The SPEAKER,TACKLE WEEDS,"Order! Before I call the member for Cowan, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",75
41,Mr SIMPKINS,TACKLE WEEDS,"At the commencement of my first speech in this place, I would like to record my thanks to the people of Cowan for their confidence in electing me. I am humbled by their endorsement, and I will not let them down. I am the fourth member for Cowan and also the first MP in some time who does actually live in the electorate. Before proceeding, I would like to acknowledge the service of the previous member for Cowan, the Hon. Graham Edwards, and before him Mr Richard Evans, who was our last member for Cowan. For many years I have focused strongly on serving the people of Cowan. For enabling me to work for the people and to win the election, I owe a great debt of thanks to my wife, Kelly, and my children, Emily and Rebecca, who are here today. They knew that I had embarked on a mission and that a lot of things needed to be done for the people of Cowan. With my family's support, I sacrificed much of our family time to pursue that mission. They also know that the future for our family will have its challenges, so I thank them for their ongoing support. I thank my mother, Connaught, who is also here today, for her unconditional support. I know that, should my father have lived to see this day, he would have been very proud. Although my family gave me time, a lot of very hard work was done by the Liberal Party, by volunteers and friends, some of whom are here today. I would especially like to thank the Liberal Party, which has given me the opportunity to stand in this place, in particular the state president, Danielle Blain, the state director, Mark Neeham, and his assistant, Zak Kirkup, for all their support. I would also like to place on record my thanks to Colin Edwardes, my campaign chairman. He was always there for me during the tough times. I would also like to thank my dedicated team for Cowan, which included Jonathan Daventry; the Hon. Cheryl Edwardes; Tim Brooks; Kate Taylor; Sherryl Paternoster; Peter and Norma Tyler; Geoff Paddick; and many Young Liberals, including Matt Dawson, whom I thank for being here today; Alex Butterworth; Ryan Blake, who is also here; Heidi Brooks; Douglas Brooks; Matt Blampey; Ange Wills; and my friend Sue MCDonald for her efforts in the 2004 campaign. I would like to especially thank Scott Edwardes, who was courageous on election day when he faced up to the aggression and intimidation of employees of the Your Rights at Work movement at Noranda Primary School. That was an interesting morning. In addition, I greatly appreciated the support and guidance provided by the Hon. Julie Bishop MP; Mal Washer MP; Senators Chris Ellison, Mathias Cormann and David Johnston; former Senator Sue Knowles; the Hon. Peter Collier MLC; and the Hon. Ray Halligan MLC. In particular I owe a debt of gratitude to Chris Ellison for his advice and encouragement over the last three years. Chris is a man of great honour and integrity and I respect him for his strength of character. I also thank those members of the former government who were there for me but were not themselves returned, particularly the Hon. John Howard and the Hon. Mal Brough, who did such great work for this country. During my election campaign, one of the most frequently asked questions of me was: ‘Why do you want to be the member for Cowan?' The answer is quite simple, really. I and have put myself forward because I believe that I can make a positive and dedicated contribution to providing the people of Cowan with better lives. I strongly believe in better community safety, better road safety and greater opportunities for the families in Cowan. As a resident of Cowan and a father of two young children under the age of 10, I worry about their safety and their futures. I believe that the vast majority of parents in Cowan have those same feelings about their own children. Yet, sadly, there are some places in Cowan where graffiti, hooning and antisocial behaviour are at near epidemic proportions. There are also places where crimes such as drug dealing, burglaries and assaults are far too common. Those crimes particularly impact on children where their families are both victims and, in some cases, perpetrators. For my own part, I believe that parents or carers who provide their children with examples of crime, drug addiction or illicit drug use clearly demonstrate that they are poor role models. I believe in intervention where necessary and the removal of children where necessary from the threat of these dangers. It is my view that children in these circumstances are better off with a couple where a man and a woman truly appreciate their responsibilities and can provide appropriate examples of behaviour and respect for society. At the centre of this situation is, arguably, the great scourge of drugs. Unfortunately, the number of police in Western Australia has been in decline for years now. Subsequently, they have a reduced capacity to deal with these critical problems. The situation is made worse by the soft drug laws introduced by the current state government in Western Australia. The incapacity to act, coupled with these weaker laws, leads to toleration. The use of misnomers such as ‘party drugs', ‘soft drugs' or ‘recreational drugs' tends to normalise drug use. In a similar vein, terms such as ‘harm reduction' and ‘harm minimisation', I believe, are very dangerous indeed. It is my strong view that the only path is to work towards a life without illicit drugs, an abstinence approach. We are in good times at the moment, where hard work is being rewarded, and particularly so in the wonderful state of WA. It is a great situation where just about anyone in WA who wants a job and is prepared to work hard can get one. Since the last election, in this place the majority view has become that the economic success of this country is due to luck and international demand for resources. This view of course denies the influence of economic and waterfront reforms that have made this country and particularly Western Australia reliable trading partners of China and other developing countries. My reason for raising this point in this speech is that it has never been my view that a belief in luck or other superstitions adds any value. I have a background of highly competitive sport and 15 years as an Army officer. From these backgrounds I have come to realise that it is only through hard work that success can be assured. When I was at school we prepared for such events in our rowing calendar as the Head of the River. At school we would train only three times a week for four or five months. I recall being defeated badly through many a rowing season, and yet on the day of the main event we would still have hope for victory. We would of course have a blind disregard for the facts and reality, but we thought that if we wore our lucky socks we could still pull it off on the day. Yet the same result would always occur: if not last-and I know my mother remembers these daysthen very nearly last. So I describe my school rowing days as days when we rarely won anything. Once I left school and began rowing at club, state and-in a brief periodinternational level, we used to train anywhere from eight to 13 times a week. Within the club competition we were rarely defeated because we used to train harder than anyone else. Based upon these experiences, I have come to realise that in politics, just as in sport, nothing will be all right on the day. We cannot wear our lucky socks or pray for victory when the work has not been done. Often it takes years to achieve goals. I think we know that after the last four years of this campaign. When people talk about a particular set of circumstances and describe comprehensive success as being a result of luck, I say, ‘Look to the past to see how this future has come to pass.' Along with rowing, the other great defining period of my life has been my 15 years of service in the Army as an officer. From this period I have come to realise that in order to truly achieve one must live every moment to its fullest. It is simply not enough to plan to make it to the end of a challenging activity. One must try to maximise the level of performance, knowledge and experience that you gain from the whole activity. Simply put: one must try to be the best person one can be. I therefore bring my experiences of failure, struggle and, ultimately, success to me to achieve both in this chamber and in my electorate of Cowan. It does, however, remain important for me to say that I stand here with these friends around me not because I was born into my political party; nor did friends introduce me to that political party. I joined the Liberal Party of Australia only after reflection and thought, when I came to see that the philosophies, beliefs and approaches represented by members on this side of the House provided the best ingredients for progress in Australia. When I talk of progress it is progress for the benefit of the people of Australia and particularly of Cowan-which brings me to the centre of the world: the electorate of Cowan. My mistake: I mean the centre of the civilised world. The electorate of Cowan bears the name of Dame Edith Cowan, who lived between 1861 and 1932. She was the first female member of an Australian parliament and was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly as the member for West Perth between 1921 and 1924. This great lady also holds the distinction of having a university named after her for her service to the community. The electorate itself comprises 195 square kilometres of the outer northern suburbs of Perth. Economic confidence and the resulting growth in the last decade have seen a substantial increase in the number of houses and businesses in Cowan. Unemployment dropped in the late 1990s and has dropped even more in the last seven years, so there are now many more working families in Cowan as opposed to the high percentage of non-working families before that time. The growth of the Cowan suburbs in terms of both homes and businesses is a testament to the great Western Australian spirit of working hard for a better future. That spirit is particularly clear when you assist consider the number of organisations in Cowan that work well for their members, organisations which I have personally had some association with. Firstly, I would like to mention the RSLs and, in particular, Ron Privilege and the members of the WannerooJoondalup RSL sub-branch, who each ANZAC Day hold a dawn service, a march and then a very popular district commemoration in Wanneroo. I am particularly pleased to mention them because I too am a member. I would also make mention of the Ballajura RSL. They maintain a very fine war memorial and peace park adjacent to the Ballajura Community College. Scotty Alcorn and the dedicated members of the sub-branch have found a great place in their local community with the peace park, and I am proud to have helped them get a federal grant of $125,000 a couple of years ago under the Regional Partnerships Program, which at that time did not have bipartisan support in Cowan. In relation to the veterans community, I would also like to mention the Extremely Disabled Veterans Association of Western Australia, of which I am the patron. They are a dedicated, effective and hard working association serving the interests of World War II and Korean War veterans. I would particularly like to pay tribute to the long years of work in the association by Sue Plane and Ruth Down. These two ladies know only too well the adversity that life can grant. Within Cowan there are also two large and vibrant business associations. I am a member of the Malaga and Districts Business Association, which works closely with the City of Swan to serve and advocate for almost 2,000 member businesses-that is a big organisation. The president is my good friend Rod Henderson. Up in Wanneroo, the Wanneroo Business Association works closely with the staff of the City of Wanneroo. Peter Newbound is the president there and I look forward to working closely with the WA as a member. I want to make mention of a number of ethnic groups within the electorate of Cowan that have made a positive contribution to the Australian way of life. These groups understand, respect and embrace the institutions and values of our society. They understand that the people of Australia have no issue with race, colour or religion but, gard a person by their actions. They have integrated into this country and have placed their loyalty first and foremost with Australia and its laws, above and beyond all others. Yet they still have an understandable concern for their former homelands, and it is on this point that I wish to concentrate. Firstly, I would like to mention the people of Vietnamese heritage; they number many thousands in Cowan. They are hard working people who are strong with a sense of family. I would like to thank Dr Van Phat Nguyen, Mr Tung and Mr Troung for their assistance and support. I know that many Vietnamese who came to Australia as refugees remain concerned about human rights issues in Vietnam. I would also like to mention the assistance and support of Mr Zoran Coseski of Marangaroo, who is the Honorary Consul for the Republic of Macedonia in Perth. Although born in Australia, Mr Coseski is a great advocate for Macedonia. I would also like to make mention of the situation in Cyprus, where the island remains divided following the invasion in 1974 by Turkish forces. Land was seized, families separated and many Greeks are still missing. As part of future negotiations, I look forward to Turkey providing compensation or restitution for the land of Greek Cypriots seized during that invasion. Next, I would like to mention that great and enduring concern of the Jewish people in Cowan-namely, the Middle Eastern peace process and the rightful pursuit of a two-state solution in Palestine. The great problem with the pursuit of lasting peace and harmony is that it is difficult to identify a Palestinian authority willing and able to speak for their side. It appears even more difficult to see a Palestinian authority that would be capable of delivering on negotiations, thereby ensurrather, re- ing a peaceful future. Before I conclude, I also want to make mention of two very important local issues in Cowan-namely, the school closures in Girrawheen and Greenwood by the state government. In Girrawheen, the state Labor government is closing Blackmore Primary School, against all reason and sense. Despite the vocal and well-justified protests of the parents and local community, ably led by Tory Clerke, it is still going on. Sadly, it appears that the resale value of the Blackmore Primary School site of some $17 million is just too high to be passed up. Just over in the next suburb, the Kingsley and Greenwood Residents Association, together with local parents such as David and Robyn Bertolini, are fighting to stop the sale of one hectare of the Allenswood Primary School site. While the sale of the nearby East Greenwood Primary School site is already a sure thing, the site of the rebuilt school at Allenswood will be reduced in size so that more money can be made from land sales. While the priority should be an effective educational precinct with appropriate infrastructure, the emphasis seems to be on cash flow into the coffers of a state government that is consistently unable to manage projects on time or to budget. It is no wonder that the people of Perth are cynical about that government. Earlier in this speech I made mention of why I became a candidate. However, every reason needs to be accompanied by action and I have relentlessly pursued the interests of my fellow residents. I have, in the last few years, won or helped to win a number of grants and extensions of services for the suburbs of Cowan. Yet, as I spoke to increasing numbers of people in the electorate, they told me their concerns about community safety, road safety and opportunities for themselves and their families. Those concerns have driven my successful advocacy for the grant of road funding for the Ocean Reef Road extension, as well as the road funding initiatives concerning the upgrade of Wanneroo Road and the upgrade and extension projects of Hepburn Avenue and the Reid Highway interchange at Alexander Drive. I note that the latter of those two initiatives was picked up in the election campaign by the Labor Party and therefore I look forward to their delivery via the election promises legislation that I would imagine we will be seeing soon. In addition, I recall our being promised a superclinic of GPs in Wanneroo, $1 million of CCTV for the City of Wanneroo, $1 million for a footbridge overpass in Banksia Grove and $500,000 for a youth drop-in centre in Ballajura, so I will look forward to also seeing the detail on those projects in the same legislation. Should the government be interested in improving the quality of life of people in Cowan, I have other initiatives that could be added to the list. Over the last four years I have walked along hundreds of roads in Cowan, spoken to thousands of people and looked into the lives of my fellow residents in order to understand them and their issues-all that in order to make a difference. I have seen great hardship, yet I have also seen great courage. At times I have found weakness in spirit but also strength of character. But, in amongst it all, there is a clear need for a representative dedicated to building a stronger and more secure community in Cowan. I asked for that role and I am now humbled to have been granted that responsibility by my fellow residents of Cowan.",75
42,The SPEAKER,TACKLE WEEDS,"Order! Before I call the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare, the member for Bennelong, I remind honourable members that this is her first speech. I therefore ask the House to extend the usual courtesies to her.",80
43,Ms MCKEW,TACKLE WEEDS,"Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare) (1.37 pm)-I rise to speak for the first time in this House as the new member for Bennelong. In line with the historic importance of what has been said in the parliament this week, I wish to acknowledge, first and foremost, the original Bennelong. Along with another resident of Sydney Cove, Colbee, Bennelong was captured, taken from his family, but befriended by Governor Arthur Phillip. Bennelong eventually travelled to England and met King George III, a trip which can be reasonably described as the equivalent in today's terms of a trip to Mars. It is a complex story, the story of early European settlement. The historian Inga Clendinnen refers to a brief period in those early years where there was a ‘springtime of trust'. She talks of the honour and courage of the men of the First Fleet and the creative resourcefulness of the ‘Australians', as she calls the Indigenous population. This is something about our history that should be known-that there were individuals and there were moments when trust and goodwill ruled hearts on both sides of the divide. The universal disaster did not have to happen and it does not have to happen now. For Bennelong there was no happy ending. When he returned to his own land after three years in England, he was scorned by the Europeans and by his own people. He was the first of tens of thousands of Aboriginals who have attempted or been forced to straddle both worlds, only to end up lost between both. The brewer James Squire provided shelter for Bennelong in his last years, which is why he lies buried in an unmarked grave near the site of the old brewery in Kissing Point in Putney, in the electorate that now bears his name. A question for us all as we start out road to reconciliation is to ask: what was Bennelong trying to do in forging a friendship with the British? At the very least, we can say he was making a connection, attempting to build a bridge. And that is what we need to do. It is my sincere hope that in offering an apology for the suffering and injustices experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, we can make a new start and work together in a meaningful way. As Martin Luther King said nearly 50 years ago: We are all tied together in a single garment of destiny. What I have learnt from a lifetime of reporting is that we are at our best when we work together and when we appreciate difference. Diversity enriches us. It lifts the spirit. First of all, I would like to pay tribute the work and extraordinary commitment to public life of the previous member for Bennelong, John Howard. His service to the community and representation in the federal parliament for 33 years is a great record and a fine achievement. Mr Howard was a hardy warrior for his beliefs, and that too should be acknowledged. I come to this place with the firm view that the contest of ideas matters, belief matters and knowledge matters. While it is true that the great ideological struggles of the 20th century are behind us, the ground has shifted in this new decade and in this new century. The sheer complexity of modern life bewilders many, but the new century is a rich one and there is much to appreciate. The monocultural Moorooka that I recall from my girlhood in the 1950s and sixties has vanished. These days the place is enlivened by the presence of many African families. As my mother Mary, who is in the gallery today, often says, with a more than disapproving nod about my irregular attendance, ‘These on the families are filling the pews at Sunday mass.' The seat of Bennelong, which I am proud to represent, provides a near perfect snapshot of how the country is changing. Join the throng on the weekend in the Eastwood mall and you will find that Rowe Street is both a modern-day Babel and a dynamic part of cosmopolitan Sydney. While parents race around to fit in 101 chores, the teenagers have mobile phones strapped to their ears and the younger ones are plaguing their parents and saying, ‘When do we eat?' The body language is clear, while the verbalising is as likely to be in Chinese as in English or Korean. There are other changes. The Kims are forming partnerships with the Kellys. The Lis are walking down the aisle with the to O'Farrells. For some, these changes are unsettling. But there is a younger generation that is entirely at ease with who we are and what we are becoming. Exceptionally well educated, many have secured a second degree from an international university and are multilingual. Some will be in mixed-race marriages. What they all have in common is that they will see their professional lives as crossing borders. They will be citizens of the world, trained here initially but orbiting around the world and working and playing in those places that will enrich them. They will still call Australia home, but when they are in Delhi, Hong Kong or London, what story will they be telling about home? How do we want the Australian story to look for the coming generation? I think it needs to be a big story and that it is time to revive some big ambitions about how we build sustainable cities, how we restore our rivers, how we recreate a first-rate education system that elevates excellence for all and how we treat everyone with dignity and equality, regardless of physical ability, race or sexual preference. What we need is a new imagining, a revived sense of what is possible. The negativity and the tedium of the culture wars will not get us there. But look at our history with all its warts and all its failures and you will still find plenty to inspire wonder, hope and optimism. You will also find that, if there common animating principle in Australia, it is that we look forwards, not back. Survey the suburbs, towns and farms of this country and you will find the desire to assure the happiness and independence of the next generation is inextinguishable. This altruism is in the nature of most human beings-it is one of the better angels, to which all good governments should listen. How hard we work to satisfy that desire and how well we succeed is a measure of our progress as a nation and as a democracy. What people want now, I think, is an intelligent national conversation. The prevailing orthodoxy, to this point, has been that, because we are enjoying such bounty, we are indifferent, to the point of being somnolent, about the bigger societal questions. Well, I happen to think that 2007 demolished that idea. Most of the commentators missed the mood shift. But it is there. It is real. All sorts of people know that politics and policymaking matter. Our national spirit matters. The lesson for me from the past year is that there is a great reservoir of goodwill that lies untapped beneath the surface of our national life, and smart governments will find ways to liberate and direct it. Many of us lead charmed lives. I am one of them. It was not always thus. I had a good deal of unhappiness in my early years, which is why I identify with scratchy teens. But at some point I just got on with it. Being curious helped. I am also convinced that any success I have enjoyed in my professional and personal life has come about because of the generous embrace of friends and mentors. What they have in common is a welldeveloped joie de vivre and, importantly, a deep appreciation that no problem is so great that it should not be tackled over a decent lunch-at some length. So, along with many people in this chamis a ber and many others who helped get me elected, I have been the lucky beneficiary of rich opportunities. But in recent years many of us have been feeling something else-an unease, a stirring in the soul, a sense that things are not quite right, that too many are missing out, that, far from leading charmed lives in the lucky country, too many Australians are leading pinched lives. What it is, this stirring in our souls, is a realisation that our famed egalitarian spirit is more talked about than real. This is the paradox of modernity: alongside the exceptional economic prosperity the country has enjoyed, we are also seeing what Professor Fiona Stanley calls an increase in the social gradients. When we look at the key indicators for the development, well-being and health of our children and our young people, the gaps are not shrinking; they are widening. The experts all tell us the same thing: that 50 per cent of a child's educational performance is determined before that child even enters the formal school system. Yet still, today, 20 per cent of Australian children do not have access to a quality preschool. Among Aboriginal children, as with so much else, the reality is so much worse. Only 46 per cent of four-year-old Indigenous children receive a preschool education. Regrettably, the Commonwealth has been the missing player in this most critical area. We know that those children who are missing out on an appropriate early learning experience will struggle in the first years of school. So this where the education revolution begins. It begins before school with significant fresh investment and a new approach that integrates care and early learning. I am proud to be part of a government that has put this issue at the very centre of its policy approach. How successful we are will determine whether or not in future publications Professor Stanley can remove the question mark that she currently has in her title Children of the Lucky Country? For this to happen, we also need to see a revival in the capacity of governments to do things, to get on with it. Part of the sheer thrill of being elected to this chamber at this point in our history is that it coincides, I think, with a revived belief in governments as active players and navigators of our national life. For too long, governments have suffered from withered imaginations and from a collapsed will. For our grandparents it was so different. The Sydney Harbour Bridge was constructed at the peak of the Great Depression. The planners had the foresight to put in eight lanes. The same could be said for the Storey Bridge, an iconic part of the Brisbane landscape and a piece of engineering that is part of the MCKew family history. I come from a family of builders, and my grandfather Joe MCKew ran the Evans Deakin plant which built the bridge in conjunction with Dr John Bradfield. As the family story goes, every time a new span of the bridge was due to be manoeuvred into place, all the MCKew boys, including my father, Bryan, were marched off to mass. Divine help was deemed necessary to assist with the engineering. The point is, these were big projects, undertaken when the country was smaller and poorer. But there was nothing small about the enterprise. When we consider our major cities today, particularly Brisbane and Sydney, and how the metro infrastructure can struggle to get is people to work on time, surely it is time to reconnect to the enterprise and ambition of the past. We need nothing less than a return to nation building-but in a modern way. We need to recruit the talents of our innovators and our technologists, our teachers, our writers and our best policy thinkers. In my own electorate we have significant research and educational institutions-Macquarie University, the CSIRO and the Northern Sydney Institute of TAFE. There is also an emerging technology corridor of leading global companies in ICT, medical devices, media and environmental technologies. But the potential of this corridor is yet to be realised. We need an innovation economy, one that recognises that comparative advantage in the modern world is underpinned by those things that the private sector cannot provide: a workable tax system, first-rate health and education systems, and strong research networks. That is the 21st century role of government. I come to this House as a proud member of the Australian Labor Party, a party that has always had as a core belief the view that active, reformist policymaking should be directed towards maximising equality of opportunity. I like the way the Melbourne philosopher John Armstrong puts it: The proper goal of power is civilization. And civilization depends, crucially, on spiritual perity: upon what we care about, on what we admire, what sorts of ideals and hopes we have. Part of what I care about-friendship, beauty and the life of the mind-was nurtured by my teachers at All Hallows Convent, a school that sits high above the Brisbane River and overlooks the bridge built by my grandfather. The older I get the more I appreciate that I was taught by women, by lay and religious staff, who seemed to me to know what was worth knowing. When one considers the deep provincialism of Queensland during this period, this seems extraordinary. But the best of these women were not bound by borders or prejudice. They did what all good teachers do: they took their charges on a journey and fired the imagination. Wherever you look across this country you see the work of women. It is a particular joy for me to come to this place as one of 40 female representatives. From the time of Federation, it would be 40 years before the first two women, Dorothy Tangney and Dame Enid Lyons, were elected to the federal parliament. One could say that things have moved at a glacial pace. Part of the explanation is that in Australia, never an easy country for women, it is still too hard. For most of our history the value of labour has been split on a gender basis. The institutional die was cast at the beginning of the 20th century when the basic female wage was set at 54 per cent of the male rate. For decades, Jessie Street, Edna Ryan and others fought to correct this historic injustice, but it would take until the 1970s and three landmark equal pay cases to remove gender classifications from job descriptions. It remains a continuing disgrace that, 30 years on from these cases, we still cannot say that pay justice for women has been achieved. Women's workforce participation now stands at 58 per proscent and the educational achievements of women have never been higher. Yet, whether you are behind the counter of a cafeteria or in the executive suite, if you are female, wage parity is not guaranteed. When we consider the wider economic picture for women, it is not what it should be. Australia remains one of very few developed countries to have no national system of maternity leave, and returning to work and negotiating flexibility is still problematic for mothers. Is it any wonder that women find themselves in midlife agonising about their limited retirement savings following a life of interrupted work? It is time for this country to junk its historic ambivalence towards female workers and embrace once and for all a set of policies that recognises the real worth of everyone's labour. A few years from now I want to be able to say to the young women graduating from Ryde Secondary College and Marsden High School or those on the campus of Macquarie University in my electorate and their equivalents across the country that Australia is closer to being the meritocracy it should to be. I am here in this place first and foremost as a representative of my local community. If you look inside the suburbs that make up Bennelong, you see the real, contemporary, rather amazing Australia. And it is not the same as what you see on TV. It is much more complex, subtle and wonderful. As I said on the night of 24 November last year, I spent 30 years interviewing Australians-often the most admired and most powerful Australians; many of them in this place-but now I know I missed the best of them. To get to know them you have to knock on front doors and listen to them in the street-and you find out so much more when you are not carrying a camera and a microphone. It is the stories that are so compelling, stories that cry out greater attention. I thank the House for the courtesy of listening to this first speech, as I thank the many, many volunteers and ALP branch members, without whose help and belief I would not be here. Throughout 2007, the women and men, and the boys and girls of the ‘purple army', as they called themselves, were united under a simple banner: nothing is impossible. The foot soldiers of the purple army are among the finest and most selfless individuals I have ever met. I would like to thank in particular Lucienne Joy, John Range, Trish Drum, Michael Butterworth, Sally Sitou, Richard Ho, Marie Faulkner, Louise Rose, Tim Quadrio, Senator John Faulkner and the Hon. John Watkins for their friendship and guidance. And to my partner, Bob, a political legend if ever there was one: you are to me the reason for everything. I hope my time in this place validates and vindicates the faith you have all placed in me. Like all members, I come here wanting to make a difference. To the people of Bennelong, your needs come first. I will not let you down.",80
44,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,TACKLE WEEDS,"I rise to speak in this address-in-reply. I know I have limited time but I will be seeking to continue my remarks at a later time. Listening to the Governor General's speech, something struck me in his opening comments about this great democracy that we have. The decision of the Australian people was that we saw a change of government, and that change, from the coalition to the Labor government, was a peaceful transition. I want to talk about another level of government where democracy is also very important. I believe our whole democracy starts at the level of local government in our local communities, which are the cornerstone of this great nation of ours. I want to particufor larly focus today on the leadership that has been displayed by local councils, local mayors and the community in general during the extraordinary floods that we have recently seen and continue to see in the state of Queensland. In western Queensland, out in the Murweh Shire Council headquarters on the Warrego River, we saw the leadership of the Mayor, Mark O'Brien, coming to the fore and the important role that local government plays when you have a state of emergency without warning, without notice. You have to have a response if you are going to save communities and prevent the further damage that would occur without great local leadership. Through Mark O'Brien and other councillors in North and Central Queensland, I saw the importance of local government and local leadership in a time of national emergency. When they responded to the emergency in Charleville, they needed to put up a levy bank quickly because the one that they had partly constructed was not complete. It was quite invigorating and inspiring to see the speed at which the local community acted in putting up a temporary levy bank to protect the town from what would have been devastating floods.",85
45,The SPEAKER,TACKLE WEEDS,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. I thank the member for Maranoa for his forbearance when the chair was unable to get an orderly House for him. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.

46,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Given his pre-election commitments, can the Prime Minister now give Australian families a guarantee his shopping trolley full of inquiries will give Australian families a shopping trolley full of cheaper groceries?",85
47,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. When it comes to one of the core sets of factors impacting on the family budget each week, it is the cost of petrol, groceries and mortgages. In each of these areas, the government has advanced plans to the Australian people, and we intend to get on with implementing them. On the first one, when it comes to housing affordability, I note the fact that the government which preceded us had no minister for housing. This government has appointed a minister for housing, and we have already, within the first 72 days of operation of the government's term, outlined how we intend to implement our first home saver accounts. There are a range of other policies on housing affordability, because that goes to the ultimate cost-of-living pressures on working families. Then it goes to the question of petrol. This government has a plan to appoint a petrol price commissioner. Our predecessors-and I notice that the former Treasurer smiles in the seat which he now occupies-in the previous government failed to act decisively when it came to effective monitoring of petrol prices. They failed to do it until, in the middle of last year, we in opposition said that our policy would be to appoint a petrol price commissioner. As a consequence of that, the government, led by the then Treasurer, announced such an inquiry. This government has already undertaken other measures to enhance greater external scrutiny on the oil majors when it comes to the cost of petrol. On grocery prices, we have indicated we will have a",86

49,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! In the past, the occupant of this chair might have been able to glean from the Leader of the Opposition's question a number of factors to justify relevance. First of all, the Leader of the Opposition talked about the promises made by the Prime Minister-very broad. Secondly, he talked about the shopping trolley of inquiries-very broad. It could be said that the Prime Minister was actually picking that part of the question. The Leader of the Opposition then went on to something that was more specific: the cost of a shopping trolley of groceries. This is the dilemma that occupants of this chair have had about the relevance rule. Of course, to talk about any promise that was made would be completely out of order, in my belief. But to add the ‘shopping trolley of inquiries' and the ‘shopping trolley of groceries' then leads to this dilemma that we now have. At this point in time, I will rule that the Prime Minister is in order, but I ask all members of the HouseMr Downer-Of course!",86
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Mayo for his biased comment. It will get him nowhere. Mr Downer-I just said, ‘Of course!'",86
51,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, it will get him nowhere. If he wants to participate in the House trying to reform question time, he might discuss it with his colleagues on both sides of the chamber.",86
52,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The cost-of-living pressures which affect working families are housing mortgages, the cost of petrol and the cost of groceries. On the cost of groceries, over the last 10 years food prices have risen an average annual rate of 3.8 per cent-well above the 2.9 per cent average for the CPI. A large I part of the rise in the price of food can be attributed to the drought and high world prices for commodities such as grains. The government is keen to ensure that consumers have access to a competitive market for basic food items. On 22 January 2008, the government directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to undertake an inquiry into the competitiveness of retail prices for groceries under the Trade Practices Act 1974. Under the TPA the ACCC can monitor prices, costs and profits in any industry or business, as directed, and report the results. The ACCC has been instructed to take a broad approach to its inquiry and ensure all aspects of the grocery supply chain are included, from the farm gate to the checkout point, with the ACCC report due to the government by 31 July 2008. This is action which the previous government never undertook. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I ask that you ask the Prime Minister to table the document from which he was reading.",86

56,Mr HALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister explain to the House the importance of today's release of an exposure draft of the National Employment Standards? Will the Prime Minister outline what other modest wage measures the government will support for parliamentarians in the year ahead?,87
57,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. This government was elected on a platform of helping working families under financial pressure. That goes to the core of changing the industrial relations system of this country, an industrial relations system which we inherited which was unfair. Part of unpicking that unfairness lies in today's release of the exposure draft of the National Employment Standards. It is the government's next step in honouring its commitment to build a fair and flexible industrial relations system. It follows the introduction of the government's transition to Forward with Fairness bill into the House yesterday. The government's new workplace relations system will provide a decent safety net for fair minimum pay and conditions for all employees. The government believes in a consultative process and in laying out what it intends to do on the industrial relations blueprint it has for the future. It laid out its workplace relations policies well in advance of the last election in detail-unlike various governments which have preceded us. It has also continued to consult widely and does so through the agency of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations at present. Consistent with that spirit of consultation, the minister is laying out an exposure draft for comment on these important National Employment Standards. The National Employment Standards establish a stronger safety net than existed in the past from the so-called Australian fair pay and conditions standard under Work Choices. For example, under the AFPC, no matter how many hours an employee was being forced to work, an employee could generally not seek relief for working excessive and unreasonable work hours until they had been employed for 12 months. The National Employment Standards make it clear that an employee cannot be asked to work unreasonable hours-period. Flexibility will be retained in modern awards to allow for averaging of hours when that is relevant for particular work arrangements, such as fly-in fly-out arrangements. Such arrangements will be relevant for determining whether the additional hours required are reasonable. That is just one example of how the government's workplace relations system will deliver fair and minimum standards and sensible flexibility for business. We believe in a simpler set of arrangements for business and we believe that it is important to have appropriate responses from industry and from others once this exposure draft is tabled. These National Employment Standards, which are important for all working families-though met with the derision of members of opposite, who seem not to have learned the lesson from the last election when it comes to industrial relationsprovide as follows: (1) minimum weekly hours of 38 hours per week plus reasonable additional hours; (2) a right to request flexithe ble working hours for parents of young children; (3) 12 months additional parental leave for families by granting each parent a separate entitlement of up to 12 months unpaid parental leave so that a baby has up to two years continual care from a parent on unpaid leave; (4) annual leave of four weeks per year of service; (5) personal carers leave of 10 days for each year of service; (6) community service leave to allow employees to request absence from work; (7) long service leave arrangements to be protected under a new nationally consistent approach; (8) reasonable notice of termination arrangements and a right to redundancy pay; (9) protection of public holidays; and (10) a right to basic workplace information. These are important reforms for working families right across the country, working families which had inflicted upon them an industrial relations system about which they were not consulted at the last election. They were not consulted one bit. It was imposed on them unilaterally by a government which has now paid the political price for it. But I am asked further whether there are any other measures which the government would embrace and measures which would be supported by members of parliament here on the overall question of how we approach the inflation challenge this year, including wage restraint. In a modest exercise in wage restraint the government has decided to propose to the parliament a regulation which will have the effect of not increasing MPs' salaries through until the middle of next year. Furthermore, the government proposes that, when this measure comes to a close in mid2009, there be no clawback mechanism for any salary forgone between now and then. This is a modest measure. It does not of itself solve the nation's economic challenges or problems. But it does, I believe, indicate to public at large that the government-and I hope the parliament-is serious about the overall challenge of wage restraint. Therefore, we are not calling on working families to engage in some sort of freeze on their wage claims or wage outcomes. Working families are already under financial pressure. But we need to be able to face the Australian community in the eye and say that we in the privileged position of this place are doing one small bit when it comes to exercising some wage restraint on our part. I will conclude by saying this. Right across the country and the economy many people have responded to various claims for further CEO salary increases. Markets ultimately determine these things. But, in the difficult challenges we face ahead this year on the economy and inflation, I would hope that those in the most privileged positions in the corporate sector also reflect carefully on the need for CEO wage restraint in the year ahead. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I ask that you ask the Prime Minister to table the document from which was reading.",87
58,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Was the Prime Minister reading from a document? Is the document confidential? Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Given the new standards that the Prime Minister has endeavoured to set in this place, was that not a ministerial statement rather than the answer to a question?",89
59,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was well and truly in order, and the answer was relevant to the question. Economy",89
60,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Given it is a fact that the last three budgets have delivered surpluses of 1.5 per cent or more of gross domestic product, how will the surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP in this 2008 budget reduce inflation and take pressure off grocery prices for Australian families?",89
61,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. When the government outlined its five-point plan to tackle inflation earlier this year, restraint in public demand was one of the measures. I will come back to the direct question which the Leader of the Opposition has put forward concerning the budget surplus target for this year. It was one part of a five-part approach. The second related to how we best encourage private savings in the economy, because it is the aggregate of private demand and public demand which of course is one-half of the overall inflation equation. Therefore, restraint is important in both. But that is not the end of the story. The rest of the inflation equation goes to the supply side. It is on the supply side I would commend to the attention of the honourable member that the government which preceded us was most lax indeed. We have been warned on 20 separate occasions by the Reserve Bank on the question of capacity constraints within the economy: skills and infrastructure. Then, on top of that-beyond skills, beyond infrastructure-is the overarching problem also of workforce participation. On these supplyside measures it is not just the Reserve Bank which issued this series of warnings. Many respected economic commentators did the same over a long period of time. And why I suspect those opposite respond so volubly to this argument when it is put forward is they happen to know that it is true. If you look at the content of each of those warnings, the sharpness of the advice which the previous government received from the institution responsible for the conduct of monetary policy in this country, they were ignoredskills, infrastructure and workforce participation. Go back to the first of those elements, which the Leader of the Opposition raised, on how we deal with public demand and the shape of the budget surplus. We have indicated that our target for the year ahead is for a minimum budget surplus of 1.5 per cent. I note for the record that, as the government approached the election, in its official documents it was projecting a budget surplus not in excess of 1.1 per cent. If the government, as it then stood, had a different view of the shape of the budget surplus, which should have pertained in the year ahead, why did it not say so prior to the election? Or was it content simply to continue the spending binge in which it was engaged in the years leading up to the election, in the hope of stealing another election through profligate spending?

68,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyons for his very well put question and the associated remarks. Can I join with the Prime Minister in indicating that the government today has taken another important step forward in the delivery of fairness and balance in Australian workplaces. We have released an exposure draft of our 10 new National Employment Standards. Under Labor's industrial relations system, these will be protections that every working Australian can rely on-protections about hours of work, annual leave, public holidays, personal leave, long service leave and a new category of community service leave. There will be rights to parental leave, including a new rightMr Hockey interjecting",90
69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will cease interjecting. The Deputy Prime Minister should ignore these interjections.,90
70,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Once again, the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is showing his complete ignorance. There will be a right to parental leave, including a new right to sequencing leave, so that the mother and father of a child, if they choose, can sequence their unpaid maternity and paternity leave so that they can have the first two years of a child's life with a parent at home. It includes a new right to request flexible and part-time work, a right to have information about employment law, and a right to notice of termination and redundancy pay. These provisions have been produced as an exposure draft to enable public commentary. We will not make the same error made by the Howard government when it put out its Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard, which it did without adequate consultation, and it had to issue version after version with increased complexity and red tape for Australian businesses. We care about making these provisions work. That is why an exposure draft is here, with a public commentary period. This is one part of Labor's safety net for working Australians. The second part of Labor's safety net is a modern, simple award system for employees who earn $100,000 or less. That modern, simple award system will be created by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The modernisation request was contained in the explanatory memorandum to our Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill, which was presented to the House yesterday. What is very important about this safety net under Labor is that, under Labor's workplace relations system, the safety net can never be stripped away. Never again will an Australian walk into a workplace not knowing if that is the day that they will have an Australian workplace agreement thrust into their hands which strips away aspects of the safety net. We will not allow that to occur in Labor's system. There will be no Australian workplace agreements and no individual statutory employment agreements. This is in stark contrast to Work Choices and the industrial relations extremism of the Liberal Party. What they gave us was Australian workplace agreements that can strip the safety net away-including, today, stripping away redundancy pay and basic protections like a notice of change of shift. It is important for this House and the tralian people to note that, when the Leader of the Opposition said to them that Work Choices is dead, he did not tell them the truth. Today in the Senate the Liberal Party has voted to keep Work Choices going. Today we asked the Liberal Party to process our transition bill, which will mean there will be no more new Australian workplace agreements. We asked them to process that bill in exactly the same time frame that the parliament processed the last industrial relations changes of the Howard government. That is, we asked the Liberal Party to apply their own standards to themselves. Faced with that proposition of applying their own standards to themselves-something that they must agree is fair, something that they must agree is proper, given that it was brought into the parliament by the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who is now their guardian of parliamentary practice as the Manager of Opposition Business-they must concede that that is a fair time frame in which to process legisto lation. The only reason they did not agree to it is that they want Work Choices to continue as long as possible. Notwithstanding the words of the Leader of the Opposition, they believe in Work Choices and they believe in industrial relations extremism. Any Australian who has put into their hands in this time period an Australian workplace agreement that takes away a basic condition that they rely on should look at that Australian workplace agreement and say to themselves, ‘This agreement is in my hands because the Leader of the Opposition is not a truthful man, and the Liberal Party believe in Work Choices and industrial relations extremism.'

71,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for EmAusployment and Workplace Relations, Minister for Education and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the minister guarantee that her preferred workplace agreement-union negotiated collective agreements-do not take away award conditions such as penalty rates and leave loading?",91
72,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was waiting for page 2, but page 2 did not come. For a former minister of the Howard government who claimed to care so much about literacy, it would be really useful if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition read Labor's policy. If she is in any doubt about how to find it, it is on the internet. We campaigned on it for all of 2007. I will send it to her. The policy contains the answer, and I will give it to you now. The policy is Forward with Fairness. You should read it. And if you did read it, you would know that we do not have a preferred industrial instrument in Forward with Fairness; we talk about creating a fair and balanced system in which people have choice. People have choice, if they want to, negotiate a collective agreement. They can do that with or without the assistance of a trade union. That is a matter for them, because that is a basic freedom of association matter. Alternatively, they can choose to not collectively bargain; they can choose to have individual agreements. The important thing about those individual agreements is that they stand on top of the safety net. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and her party today voted for a continuation of Work ChoicesMs Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question was simple: will she guaranteeMr Debus-On what grounds? Ms Julie Bishop-Relevance! Will she guarantee that union negotiated collective agreements will not take away award conditions, including penalty rates and leave loadings? Will she guarantee? Yes or no?",91
73,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I am trying to do is to explain the equivalent of complex mathematics to someone who cannot count, so it does require a bit of explanation. Under Labor's full system, you will have a choice as to whether you have a collective agreement or an individual common-law contract. You might want to concentrate here, because you might learn something: the collective agreement is not lawful unless it passes a full no-disadvantage test against the award. That means that people under a collective agreement have to do better than the award. How is that different from the current system? Under the current system, award conditions can be ripped away without any compensation-redundancy pay gone, notice of change of shift gone. You believe in that, you voted for its continuation today.

75,Ms HALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. What information is available about the impact of Australian workplace agreements on working families?,92
76,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Shortland for her question. Today in the Senate, the Liberal Party voted for the continuation of Work Choices. In order to do that-to vote for a continued industrial relations extremism and a continued ripping off of Australian working families-it tried to hide behind creating an inquiry. One of the terms of reference of that inquiry is-would you believe it!-the ‘economic and social impacts from the abolition of individual statutory agreements'. This has come from a political party which, in government, deliberately did not want to know how Australian workplace agreements were hurting working families. They could have collected this data, analysed it and released it but they did not want to know how bad these agreements were. They did not want them to come to public light. Given the members of the Liberal Party used to get up in this place and screech on about how good AWAs were for working families, for women, for young people-for all Australians-you would have thought they would have comprehensively analysed the data at their disposal. But, of course, they did not. What we do know is that, in May 2006, the Office of the Employment Advocate revealed that it had been reviewing AWAs to determine how many were stripping away what the former government deceptively and contemptuously called ‘protected award conditions'. I welcome the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's new-found interest in things like annual leave loading, because the data showed this: under the government of which she was a cabinet member, 64 per cent of Australian workplace agreements cut annual leave loading. That is how much she cares about annual leave loading-64 per cent of those agreements cut annual leave loading. Then, 63 per cent of them cut penalty rates. Does she now care about penalty rates because she has made the short walk from here to there? She clearly did not care about them then-63 per cent of those agreements, no penalty rates.  of order understanding order 64(c). The minister continues to refer to the honourable member by a term other than her seat, and she should desist from doing so.",92

78,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member of the Liberal Party, sitting opposite, when in government could have had this data and did not want to know about it. Fifty-two per cent of these agreements cut shift loadings, 51 per cent cut overtime loadings, 48 per cent cut monetary allowance and 46 per cent cut holiday pay. The government at that stage denied it was doing any further modelling but, in April 2007, data was leaked to the media that revealed further erosion by Australian workplace agreements of pay and conditions. In that leaked data, 75 per cent agreements cut shift loadings, 68 per cent cut penalty rates, 57 per cent cut monetary allowances and 52 per cent cut public holiday pay. Mr Hockey interjecting",93
79,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What we know-and the former minister really should be a bit more wise about his interjections-is that they never properly coded or analysed the data to be able to tell whether the loss of these conditions was compensated for. The minister could have authorised analysis of that data, but he did not, because he did not want to know the answer. He deliberately wanted to run a system where he did not want to know the answer. What we do know is that these conditions were ripped away by a government that put the information into the dark and did not want Australians to know. What we do know is that Australian workplace agreements ripped away those basic conditions, and we also know that many of those agreements had in them no particular compensation in terms of the amount of money that was paid to people. This is the system that the former government put into place in this country. This is the system that they argued for in the lead-up to the last election, and this is the system that the Australian people voted against and rejected. They voted in favour of Labor's fair and balanced system but, in arrogant contempt of the views of the Australian people, the Liberal Party-informed by their bornto-rule mentality-have today voted for a continuation of Work Choices. They have voted to spit in the face of the Australian people and to deny them fairness and balance at work. Every Australian should know this and every Australian should judge them on the basis of it. Days and Hours of Meeting",93

I responded to one part of his question yesterday, in the response I think I gave to the Leader of the Opposition concerning sitting Fridays. The position of the government is absolutely clear on that. The purpose of sitting Fridays is to ensure that backbenchers in this parliament have an opportunity to bring to the attention of the parliament issues of concern to them in their local communities, such as in the honourable member for Kalgoorlie's community. My experience as a backbencher in this place is that the opportunities to raise concerns here as a backbencher are limited. Therefore the parliament providing further opportunities of a sitting Friday appropriate way forward. We remain committed to that reform.

We welcome the creation of 28,600 new jobs in January, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.1 per cent. As I said yesterday, we are very optimistic about the future of the Australian economy. We recognise that unemployment is low and that we are in our 17th straight year of growth. But we also have very substantial challenges, because we are in the midst of a terms of trade boom, which has been delivering the wealth creation and the jobs of recent years. The challenge that we have as a nation is to prepare for the future, to meet the challenges that flow from that terms of trade boom, because the labour market is tight.

95,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite did ignore the capacity constraints in the Australian economy precisely at the time that we needed them to put in place some far-sighted reforms. And they did not do it. They ignored 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank over three years about capacity constraints in the Australian economy. This government will not ignore those capacity constraints. At the very core of the program that we took to the Australian people are schemes to address the skills shortage and a whole series of plans to deal with infrastructure bottlenecks. This government will expand the skills base in this economy. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has already announced additional training places, and we have announced what we are doing in terms of infrastructure. But also, in this environment, what is really important is labour force participation. Enhancing labour force participation, giving incentives to Australians who work hard, is very important.

On a point I raised about private members business, I said before that, under this government, there will be an extra one hour and 35 minutes per week.

112,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer update the House on the work Treasury is undertaking on the economics of climate change?,96
113,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. This government sees climate change as one of the greatest intergenerational challenges that this country faces. To enhance our understanding of climate change, the Australian Treasury is undertaking detailed modelling of the macroeconomic impacts of emissions reductions. It is very important work. This modelling will be a very important part in our determinations of an emissions trading system. The Treasury is consulting broadly with international and domestic experts in developing modelling assumptions. This modelling work is expected to be complete by mid-June. In designing the government's response to climate change, the Australian government as will draw on a range of work, including this modelling from Treasury, independent academic analysis by Professor Garnaut and other analysis from here and abroad. We on this side of the House recognise the costs of climate change and that the costs of inaction are far greater than the costs of action. That is why we will take an evidence based approach to finding solutions for the long term. It is very important. Australia now has a government that recognises the important implications of climate change and is addressing them. Automotive Industry",96
114,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Was the Treasurer aware prior to giving his answer yesterday that the government had made a decision to appoint Mr Steve Bracks to head a major review of the car industry?,96

Let me say, the appointment of Mr Bracks is a fine appointment. Let me also say that we take this industry very seriously. A lot of jobs are involved in this industry and there are very big challenges. This review is very important and it will receive the full backing of the government. Economy",96
116,Mrs IRWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, the red roses have not been sent, but congratulations on your election as Speaker. My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Can the minister tell the House what the challenge of rising inflation means for the Australian economy, businesses and families? What action is the government taking to address this challenge?",96
117,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment, and I thank the member for Fowler for her question. I would remind the House of three simple but extremely important facts: the underlying inflation rate in this country has hit 3.6 per cent-the highest in 16 years and it threatens to go higher; we have had 11 interest rate increases in a row; and government spending in the current financial year, according to budget figures of the previous government, is running at an increased rate of 4½ per cent in real terms, possibly even higher depending on which indicator you use. These are three simple facts that should be seared into the consciousness of every member of this House. Increased inflation threatens us with increased interest rates, less economic efficiency and eroded savings. This government is absolutely committed to ensuring that we take action, both in the short term and in the longer term, to meet and defeat the inflation challenge. We are absolutely committed to getting inflation under control. On 21 January in Perth, the Prime Minister announced the government's five-point plan to tackle the inflation problem; to deal with skills, infrastructure, participation in the workforce and private savings; and, of course, to tackle the problem of government spending accelerating way too quickly. As was mentioned earlier today in the House, we are absolutely committed to getting the surplus above 1½ per cent of GDP, and that means significant cuts in government spending, serious cuts in government spending. It means tough decisions. Last week I announced a very modest first instalment, which was required to be addressed because of the additional appropriations legislation needing to be put to this parliament, an instalment which will yield savings of approximately $643 million over four years-but that, I stress, is only a modest first instalment. We will be guided in this exercise-the razor-gang exercise that we committed to prior to the election and that we are now following through on-by our election promises. We will fulfil those election promises. Of course, we will be guided by existing contracts; we will honour contracts. But the there will be pain; there will be difficulty; there will be tough decisions. That is unavoidable. After years of excessive, wasteful, profligate spending by the former government, that pain is necessary in order to ensure that we avoid the far worse pain that higher inflation and higher interest rates will bring to ordinary working people in this country. As you can probably see, the government's analysis of this problem and its prescription for a solution are not shared by everyone. Not everybody agrees. During the course of last year the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, just as inflation was starting to push up against the top level of the Reserve Bank's range, said that the government had inflation just where it wanted it. The Leader of the Opposition said a couple of weeks ago that, when the former government handed over to the current government, the Australian economy had been in absolutely first-rate condition. There was no inflation problem according to him. The shadow Treasurer, the member for Wentworth, is on the record as saying that the inflation problem is a fairytale; it does not exist. But, as usual, you can always rely on the National Party to top the lot. When you are in the market for a bit of economic literacy, you can always rely on the National Party! Last week, in response to the initial cuts that I announced, the Leader of the National Party held a press conference. When he was asked, ‘Isn't it necessary to cut government spending in order to put downward pressure on inflation?' his response was: ‘The United States has actually got a higher inflation rate than Australia and it is actually increasing government spending.' So, in other words, we should be increasing government spending! The National Party solution to the inflation problem is to increase government spending. Here they all are: the economic party animals of Australian politics. They have formed a new parliamentary friendship group: it is called the ‘friends of Corey'! They are all out there with the big yellow shades-the party animals of Australian politics. They have not realised that the party is over. It is time for a bit of discipline, and time for somebody to clean up the mess. That is what we are going to be doing. The reason is that we understand what is happening in the supermarkets, the petrol stations and the estate agents of this country. The opposition do not. In conclusion, the government is committed to achieving good economic outcomes for the working people of this country. Central to that is ensuring that we continue the low inflation that has occurred over 16 years under governments of both political persuasions. Returning to that low inflation rate is critical to ensure that the working people of this country enjoy good economic opportunities and good economic outcomes. But I will tell you this: there will be some things you will not see as part of our exercise. You will not see $457 million spent on government advertising in 16 months, which is what you saw under the previous government. You will not see $350 million spent in a single year on Work Choices-triple the amount previously spent on industrial relations machinery-as you saw under the previous government. You will not see the kinds of outrageous rorts under the Regional Partnerships program that the Auditor-General so thoroughly exposed. You will not see the ludicrous indulgences like $350,000 given to a private individual to build a carriage to give as a private gift to the Queen. They are the kinds of things that you will not see in our efforts to get inflation under control, because we realise that every dollar that the government has to spend on behalf of Australian taxpayers is coming from a working family's budget. That is a very great responsibility. We are not going to be spending the Australian taxpayers' dollars on those things. Automotive Industry",97

121,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the member for Dickson something that he wants to share with the whole chamber? I think that he should sit there quietly.,98
122,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Page for her question and acknowledge her long standing interest in East Timor. On Tuesday I travelled to Darwin to meet with the East Timorese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Zacarias da Costa. The purpose of that visit was to relay personally to the East Timorese foreign minister the Australian government's response to the deplorable acts that had occurred earlier in the week in respect of the East Timorese President, Dr Ramos-Horta, with the attack on him, and the attack upon the East Timorese Prime Minister. I took the opportunity of speaking to medical staff at the Royal Darwin Hospital, in whose care the President is. I also took opportunity of speaking with Ramos-Horta's family. I personally relayed to Zacarias da Costa the Australian government's speedy response to the deplorable events. Firstly, I relayed our best wishes for a speedy recovery so far as the President was concerned. Secondly, I relayed our quick response to the East Timorese government's request for support: additional troops, additional police and the stationing of HMAS Perth off the coast of Dili. The East Timorese response was one of very grateful acknowledgement of our support. The foreign minister and I agreed that-after the East Timorese government, the Australian government, the United Nations and the international stabilisation force had effected a full and proper evaluationwe would take account of what, if any, lessons there were to be learned as a result of these terrible actions. Taking the opportunity to speak to the medical staff at the hospital, two things became clear. Firstly, but for the very skilled work under enormous pressure at the Aspen medical facility in Dili, the President would not now be in the serious but stable condition that he is in. Secondly, at the Royal Darwin Hospital the President is in the highest quality care. Before I came into the chamber, having checked upon the President's medical condition, I was informed that he remains in a serious but stable state. Members would appreciate that in these circumstances stability is progress. I also took the opportunity of expressing the Australian government's and the Australian people's sorrow and sympathy to members of the President's family, in particular his mother and his sister. The family members are very appreciative of those best wishes and also very appreciative of the good work that is being done at very short the notice by officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who are doing their best to take care of the family members visiting Darwin in these terrible circumstances. Can I also indicate that I took the opportunity of meeting with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, who indicated to me the Territory government's readiness and willingness to provide whatever support they can to the family. This morning I took a phone call from the Portuguese foreign minister, who expressed his concern to me. Portugal has a long standing historical and emotional interest in East Timor, and the minister indicated to me that once an evaluation had been done Portugal stood ready to consider any requests that might come its way. Portugal will do that in full cooperation and consultation with the Australian government. I am appreciative of that expression of support and best wishes from the Portuguese government. The East Timorese foreign minister, Zacarias da Costa, has returned to Dili from Darwin, but I very much hope that he will be in a position to visit Australia next week as part of a long standing arrangement for a guest-of-government visit to Australia. That will entirely depend on the circumstances in Dili which, as I came to question time, were still being described as tense but calm. We certainly hope that that continues. The Prime Minister will visit Dili and speak with the East Timorese Prime Minister tomorrow, relaying all the things that I have outlined to the House. At the first available opportunity he is personally attending Dili at a time of great need as far as East Timor is concerned, reflecting the Australian government's, the Australian parliament's and the Australian people's long standing support for and long standing friendship and special relationship with East Timor.

123,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Given the Treasurer's statement that the decision to appoint Mr Bracks to head the review of the car industry was only made last night, can he tell the House when Mr Bracks and the other members of this review- Mr Tim Harcourt,  Mr Nixon Apple-were advised of their appointment and in what manner?",100
124,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for his question. The decision was taken by the minister only last night. There have been consultations about this for some time. This is the normal process of government. There is a panel and there have been discussions with people about appointments to the panel. Of course that has occurred. That is the normal process of government. The decision was formally taken by the minister last night. There have been discussions for some weeks. We have put together this review. It is a first class review with a first-class head and a first-class panel. Afghanistan,100
125,Mr DREYFUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Defence. Can the minister please outline what steps the government has taken to ensure that NATO has a coherent military plan and overall strategy in place for success in Afghanistan?,100
126,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Isaacs for the question. I know that, like many new members to this place, he will be making a substantial contribution to the debate in Australia. In opposition, the Labor Party supported the intervention in Afghanistan. We did so because we wanted to ensure that the mission, so important to Australia's national security, enjoyed broad public support. The new government continues to support the Afghanistan project. The international community cannot afford to sit back and allow a failed state to remain a breeding ground for terrorists prepared to kill innocent people en masse in the name of their extremist beliefs. I described the war in Afghanistan as a project, and I did so quite deliberately. I did so because the work of the international community there necessarily goes well beyond the military action-consolidating new democratic health and educational institutions, building economic capacity absent of narcotics and developing Afghanistan's security forces to the point where the government can independently enforce the rule of law or require coherent and coordinated plans which marry all military and non-military strategies. Unfortunately, such coordinated and coherent plans have been the absent part of the Afghanistan jigsaw. Indeed, the highly respected Lord Paddy Ashdown said only today that the absence of an agreed national strategy meant that in Afghanistan ‘defeat is now a real possibility'. What a tragedy failure in Afghanistan would be for all of those who have given their lives for the cause or have been badly injured. What an ominous development it would be for global security and for the Afghan people. What a tragedy it would be if all the good work done so far in the end were to count for nought. There have been significant gains. Economic growth in the war-weary country is currently running at an impressive eight per cent. Health care in Afghanistan also continues to improve. Indeed, 80 per cent of the Afghani people now have access to basic health care services. Infant mortality rates continue to steadily decline. The number of Afghan children receiving an education now exceeds some six million. Importantly, a number of those, some two million people, are girls. The outcomes flowing from Australia's military role have been significant and substantial. The work of our Special Forces, our infantry, our cavalry and other elements are very highly regarded by our partners. Our Defence Force engineers, tradespeople and project managers are rebuilding local infrastructure. They have helped construct schools and bridges. Amongst those schools is an important trade-training school. What a tragedy it would be if this were all for nil. Unsurprisingly, the future of the Afghanistan project was an early priority for me when I was appointed the Minister for Defence. Alarmingly, early in the course of my work I found a lack of common objectives amongst the partners-no coherent strategy; confused chains of command and blurred lines of responsibility; a failing counternarcotics strategy; the absence of benchmarks for progress; a crisis in burden sharing, with a number of NATO countries failing to meet or live up to their side of the bargain; and poor progress in advancing Afghan security forces towards the critical mass in skill required for them to be able to hold our military gains. But what surprised me most was the extent to which Australia had been denied access to important war information and excluded from the strategic-planning processes. Our people have been going to war, some to make the ultimate sacrifice, but it seems their political masters have been happy to sit on the sidelines. Mr Downer-That is not true.",100
127,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I hear the interjection from the former foreign minister.,101
128,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will ignore interjections, and the honourable member for Mayo will not interject.",101
129,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He says, ‘That is not true.' Let me refer the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and all members of the House to an ABC radio interview which occurred on AM just this morning. The interview was with a NATO spokesperson. The reporter asked the NATO spokesperson whether these complaints to NATO were new. He asked the spokesperson very deliberately, ‘Oh, do you mean Australia and other non-NATO countries have made these complaints before?' And here is his response. It is very important. He said: Countries like Sweden and Finland for example, that are very heavily deployed with us in Afghanistan, but are not NATO members have raised this issue in the past... I repeat: ‘Countries like Sweden and Finland'. I did not hear any reference to Australia in the NATO spokesperson's remarks. But the new government is determined that if we are to send our troops to war we must be privy to the war plan and we must always be part of the planning strategy. No government, surely, can make informed decisions about whether to send their people to war or keep them at war without access to the vital information required both to assess the risk involved and to assess the likelihood of success. In Vilnius last week I told my NATO counterparts and the Secretary General that their failure to share information with the Australian government and to exclude us from those planning processes were both unsustainable. I am pleased to report to the House that no NATO country raised any objections to my appeals and that, along with a number of key defence ministers, including from the US, the UK, the Netherlands and Canada, the Secretary General made a personal commitment to me that he would do all he could to right this wrong. I was very pleased to hear the Secretary General's spokesman today also reinforce that commitment that I heard in Vilnius last week. I was also very pleased to hear him acknowledge, on behalf of NATO, the very good work our troops are doing in Afghanistan. Advancing beyond the Vilnius promises will not be easy, nor will embracing or getting NATO to embrace new strategies, but the size of the challenge should be no reason not to try; the stakes are all too high. Automotive Industry",101
130,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer confirm that the Treasury advised the government that the Productivity Commission should conduct the review of the motor vehicle industry, as opposed to the ‘jobs for the boys' panel that was established?",102
131,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is certainly a matter that I discussed with the Treasury, as I do on all of these matters. I discussed it with the Treasury and they provided advice. As a consequence of that advice, the Productivity Commission is advising the panel, and that is a very good thing. I did discuss it with the Treasury. I took their advice and the Productivity Commission is involved. Infrastructure",102
132,Mr BUTLER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. How will the government's plans for Infrastructure Australia improve productivity in the transport sector?",102
133,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his question. Building long-term productivity growth after years of decline is indeed a central priority the Rudd government. Like few other areas, development of infrastructure has the capacity to boost the productive economy, to lift our living standards and to lock in our long term prosperity. That is why infrastructure is a key element of the government's five-point plan to fight inflation and to boost productivity. The government committed to establishing Infrastructure Australia to coordinate nationally significant infrastructure, including transport, water, energy and communications. Infrastructure Australia will develop a strategic blueprint for our nation's infrastructure and it will drive investment where it is needed most. It is an unprecedented overhaul of the way that we think about infrastructure development in this nation. This government makes no apologies for moving away from the ‘business as usual' approach of the last 11½ years. The Reserve Bank warned on some 20 separate occasions that capacity constraints were creating inflationary pressures.",102
134,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,102
135,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Those opposite should listen to what happens in parliament. The Treasurer has already tabled the 20 different warnings from the Reserve Bank about capacity constraints. Opposition members-When?,102
136,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They were tabled earlier today. I say that to help the opposition.,102
137,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The interjectors will cease interjecting and the minister will ignore them.,102
138,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am surprised that they have not heard about these warnings because many of them were made at the House of Representatives economics committee hearings with the Reserve Bank Governor which are held twice a year. If they looked at Hansard they would see the warnings from the Reserve Bank of Australia of about the capacity constraints and the problems that exist with skills and infrastructure. Twenty warnings on 20 separate occasions were ignored by those opposite. The Rudd Labor government is committed to putting in place structures that will fix the problem. The Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics estimates that urban congestion will cost nearly $20 billion by 2015. With the freight task set to double by 2020, the greatest impact will be in urban areas, particularly around our ports, our inner modal terminals and our distribution centres. However, a policy for moving goods will not work without a policy for moving people. It is motorists in their cars, much more than truckies in their cabs, that are clogging our cities. Whether it be road or rail carrying commuters or containers, the systems must work together to achieve the best outcomes for workers, businesses and exporters. Freight must be able to move seamlessly, not be slowed down when moving from the farm gate to the kitchen table and from the mines to the ports. Transport will represent a significant element of the Infrastructure Australia work program. I have taken steps to ensure that there is early progress to advance a national transport reform agenda. I am working closely with my state and territory colleagues to drive national transport outcomes. I have written to the National Transport Commission requesting urgent advice on the development of a national policy framework and a national infrastructure plan for all modes. This work will dovetail the work of",102
139,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to the fact statements are usually dealt with at the end of question time and they afford a member of the opposition the chance to respond. This is the standard practice of this House. I note some reference to the new program as accommodating statements. I would request that you tell the minister to come in here and give us answers, not statements.",103
140,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I give the same response that I gave to the honourable member for North Sydney earlier on: the question was in order and the answer is relevant. If people peruse the old Hansards they will see that the former member for Scullin has made some remarks about ministerial statements. I refer honourable members to those remarks-as they might guide the feelings of the occupant of the chair! In fact, what is now happening is in order.",103
141,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. We did not get any answers to questions from the minister for infrastructure in the Howard government because they did not have one. For 12 years they did not have one. We have a plan to address these issues through Infrastructure Australia. Transport is central to that task, and that task is central to fighting inflation and boosting productivity. Automotive Industry",103
142,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to his previous answer. When was the Treasury advised of the government's decision to appoint Mr Bracks to head the panel and when did the Treasury give its advice to the Treasurer regarding the role of the Productivity Commission?,103
143,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We took advice from the Treasury, and the government took its final formal decision last night. Health",103
144,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My that question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Since 3 December last year, what has the government done to help build a better health system for a modern Australia?",103
145,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you for the question. I know the member for Canberra has had a great interest in health issues not just in this region but across the country. I am very pleased to be able to say that, since the election of the Rudd Labor government, we have been incredibly busy in the health area. In less than 100 days we have put in place some of the infrastructure for reforming our health system to build a modern Australia. That is something that the previous health minister was decidedly against-any sort of reform was a dirty word-and I note that the new opposition spokesperson on health has not yet rebutted that view. So, as far as we are aware, it is only this side of the House that is interested in reforming our health system so that we can deliver for a modern Australia and for working families. We have not just put the infrastructure in place; we have also delivered on practical reforms. With respect to elective surgery waiting lists, there is money to provide 25,000 procedures across the country. The 25,000 people who will have their hip replacement done or their cataract surgery done will be able to live their lives free of pain because we are the first Commonwealth government to put money into elective surgery. That is something the previous government never did.",103
146,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,104
147,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Interestingly, the members from Queensland are interjecting. Perhaps the members from Queensland want to explain why they do not think we should give Queensland $27 million to undertake 4,000 procedures for Queenslanders who live in the electorate of the members who are interjecting. You do not want the people who are waiting for knee surgery, cataract surgery or hip surgery to have their procedures done? It would be interesting if the members opposite objected to the government paying for 25,000 people to have their elective surgery done across the country. Perhaps they want to stand up and say why they are against families in their electorate getting assistance from the federal government, when they know full well that the previous government ripped $1 billion out of the public hospital system. The Leader of the Opposition, even with this background in health, the member for North Sydney and the member for Warringah all stood by in the previous cabinet and let that $1 billion be ripped out of our system. So don't all come in here and complain about us, piece by piece, trying to fix the system and the mess that you left.",104
148,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,104
149,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Interestingly, the members from Victoria are also interjecting. Perhaps the members from Victoria would like to stand up and say-the member for Casey is welcome to; he has a very good hospital in his electorate-why they do not want $34 million paid to Victoria for nearly 6,000 procedures to be undertaken for people in their electorate.",104
150,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,104
151,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members will cease interjecting. I suggest the minister just ignore them and not encourage them. The interjectors should just sit there quietly.,104
152,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In addition to the $150 million already being delivered to undertake 25,000 procedures across the country, in the space of three months I have met four times with my state colleagues to bat out and negotiate health reform. Interestingly, that is already double the number of times that the previous minister met in a whole year with the state health ministers. I am sure that the former Minister for Health and Ageing is well aware that in three months I have already doubled the work that he did in a whole year. Importantly, there are a number of other very important initiatives that have been undertaken. I think members, despite their interjections, will share with me my pleasure in Labor having already instigated our home nurse visiting program for Indigenous mothers. This is something that we supported and that the previous government was committed to. It is being extended massively by this government with a $260 million commitment to investing in early childhood health and development for Indigenous children. It is really important and we have hit the ground running with it. On top of that, we have already implemented initiatives to attract more nurses into our hospitals. All of these are things that the previous government neglected. We are proud that we are up and running on these initiatives. All of us will benefit from an improved health system that will be developed under a Rudd Labor government so that we ensure we have the modern health system that is needed for a modern Australia.

153,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisherkick ies and Forestry. Can the minister inform the HouseMr Truss interjecting",105
154,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Capricornia will get the call. I advise the House that only one person jumped for the call.,105
155,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,105
156,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for North Sydney will sit down. I will just deal with an interjection. Nobody jumped when ‘Prospect jumped', as you put it, Leader of the National Party. In the past, an alert side of the House may have had somebody jump. I am not offering advice and consultancy to the opposition but I just make that observation. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I clearly saw the member for Wentworth jump to his feet as you were looking over there. It has been the practice of Speakers of this House to grant some leniency",105
157,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. I will tell you what happened: the member for Wentworth got two inches off the seat, stared across the chamber and dropped, making it very difficult for the Speaker to give him the call.",105
158,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Can the minister inform the House what steps he has taken to deliver on Labor's election commitments for rural and regional Australia and comment on any other initiatives that he has taken to ensure that Australia's primary industry sector has a vibrant and sustainable future?",105
159,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She has significant primary industries within her electorate and is also, I understand, an ambassador for Beef Week in Queensland. I would like to off by referring to some malicious rumours that have been put out by the National Party, which claim that I do not have a background in primary industries. I would like to put on the record that they are absolutely true-I do not. That is why I have decided that it is essential not only to be taking advice from my own department and from the official stakeholder groups but also to be spending every moment that I can actually meeting with people who work the land, on their land. To that end, I am pleased to report to the House that since receiving the portfolio in December, I have met with primary producers in Roma and Kyogle-with the Prime Minister-and in Emerald, Tamworth, Inverell, Glen Innes, Guyra, Armidale, the outskirts of Hobart, Launceston, Innisfail, Griffith, Hay, Broken Hill, Mildura, throughout the Fleurieu Peninsula in South AustraliaMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the honourable member wants to give us a guided tour of Australia, surely he can do it in a ministerial statement. This is an answer to a question, and previous Speakers have made a point of bringing the member's attention back to the question that has been asked, rather than allowing him to go on with gasbagging.",105
160,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry knows that he has to get back to the basis of the question. The minister will answer the question.",106
161,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the course of those visits I have had the opportunity, with regard to the different election promises which we have undertaken, to gain a view of the different views of people working the land-for instance, on the reforms which we have undertaken and are now implementing with respect to wheat marketing arrangements for the $3.5 billion wheat industry in Australia. Both Kelly Shields and Mark Hyde, and the pastoralists and graziers when I visited them in Western Australia, are very supportive of the changes of the government. At the same time, the WA Farmers Federation are taking a different view and are urging me to depart from the promises that the Labor Party took to the election. I inform the House that we will be keeping to the promise to have a regulated but competitive wheat export market in Australia. The process for drafting legislation to establish Wheat Exports Australia has begun. I have also established the Independent Expert Group to advise me on the ‘industry good' functions previously undertaken by the AWB. The IEG met for the first time last week. It is chaired by South Australian wheat grower John Crosby. Under the existing law, we have also issued three wheat export permits allowing further wheat exports to Iraq and the UK. Our promise on the Torres Strait fisheries buyback has been implemented. The new member for Leichhardt has been a strong advocate on this issue, and the outcomes acknowledge and protect the traditional way of life and the livelihood of Torres Strait traditional inhabitants while providing long-term economic and employment opportunities. We have also extended assistance in the wake of equine influenza. That assistance was due to end on 8 February but has now been extended to 14 March. Particularly given the comments today from the New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries, we are very hopeful that there will no longer be red and purple zones by 14 March. I have had the opportunity to meet with the leaders of the peak bodies of the Australian horse industry from Queensland and New South Wales and also those involved in the racing industry at Warwick Farm. It is no exaggeration to say that in the wake of EI the horse industry has been devastated in recent months, and I am sure that we will have more to say on that when the Callinan inquiry reports. The damage caused by the floods in New South Wales and Queensland has been particularly shocking. When I visited Emerald with the Minister for Human Services and Kyogle with the Prime Minister, we had the opportunity to meet with affected families. It was made clear to us that the full extent of damage by floods is not always clear at the high-water mark. We were able to lend a helping hand under the National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements and hear about the good work being done on the ground by the members for Flynn and Page to help working families affected. The savings measures on drought have been referred to and were announced by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. The two concepts of drought and climate change, while different, are intrinsically linked. The member for New England, as well as presenting me with an Akubra, for which I thank him, took me out to Brian and Marion Reid's sheep and cattle farm at Bendemeer, near Tamworth. Compounding the problem of drought that those families were able to tell us about is, of course, the serious inflation problem. It is not simply people in suburbia who are affected by mortgages and who are concerned about Australia having the highest inflation rate in 16 years. To that end, we identified where savings could be made within the drought assistance programs that would not affect farmers who are receiving much-needed help. Unfortunately, in the wake of those savings, which were done in a way that would not affect farmers who were receiving muchneeded help, a fear campaign was waged by the Leader of the National Party which, if successful, will only have the impact of causing farmers who are entitled to assistance not to apply. It is the first time there has been a departure from bipartisan support on drought assistance. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am reluctant to do this on his maiden ministerial question, but I draw the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry back to the question he was asked. It was about beef and a range of other issues. He is totally out of order in relation to his own question. It should be a ministerial statement.",106

169,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I invite the honourable member to have a discussion with the Chamber Research Office. Days and Hours of Meeting  congratulating you on your election can I let you know that you will have no trouble with me in terms of the matters of the House.,107
170,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"You now have my attention. I am worried too.  cerns that have been raised about whether parliamentary privilege attaches to Friday sittings, inter alia because of the suspension of quorum requirements, will you obtain and release the legal advice referred to by the Leader of the House in the debate on Tuesday? If not, will you obtain your own legal advice and report back to the House?",107
171,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Because I think that the member for Sturt is seeking a considered response, I will take advice from the Clerk and, without stating the extent to which I will be able to answer all the items in his question, I will provide him with information. Days and Hours of Meeting",108
172,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have two questions to you. The first one is by way of elimination. I am interested to know whether members opposite, before making their maiden speeches, are entitled to ask questions. If that is the case, fine. My second question is about you, Mr Speaker. Given that parliament is to sit on Fridays, will you yourself be here all of Friday?",108
173,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I will answer the easy one first. Members are allowed to ask questions before they have made their maiden speeches. It is quite clear. Mr Tuckey interjecting,108
174,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"No, Member for O'Connor; that is not the case. It is not their maiden speech. On the second matter: I am obliged by standing orders to attend to open proceedings of the parliament on any day. As I am obliged to implement the standing and sessional orders as decided by the House, that will be my intention. Mr Randall-Further to my question, Mr Speaker: the question was whether you will be here for all of the day.",108

I emphasise the point that I do not wish to enter into the debate that went on until two o'clock in the morning on the first day of sitting. I am obliged under the standing and sessional orders to ensure that the standing and sessional orders are implemented and I will be doing that faithfully on behalf of the House. Therefore, I believe that it is the responsibility of the Speaker to make themselves available for any day that parliamentary procedures are being carried out. Parliamentary Seating Plan",108
179,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question to you on the seating plan that we have in front of us. We have actually got two members for Batman including you, Mr Speaker. I am wondering if action has been taken to change that.",108

182,The SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"I present the Auditor-General's Audit report No. 22 of 2007-08 entitled: Performance audit: Adof grants to the Australian Rail Track Corporation: Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government”. Ordered that the report be made a parliaNA",119
183,Mr ALBANESE,DOCUMENTS,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (3.37 pm)-Documents are presented as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. I move: That the House take note of the following documents: Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency-Quarterly reports of the Chief Executive Officer for period: 1 January to 31 March 2007. 1 April to 30 June 2007. 1 July to 30 September 2007. Debate (on motion by Mr Hockey) adjourned. NA Economy",120
184,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Wentworth proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's inconsistent and reckless approach to economic management. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",120
185,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Treasurer was asked yesterday a very straightforward question in the House about the appointment of Mr Steve Bracks, the former Victorian Premier, to head a review of Australia's car industry. He said that he knew nothing of it. He said he was not able to confirm the appointment at all. Mr Albanese-Is this the MPI?",120
186,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, this is the MPI. Mr Albanese-Have you read it yet?",120
187,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, I have read the MPI-absolutely. The Treasurer had the opportunity to be straight and forthright with this House. Instead he denied everything and then today relied on the claim-and no doubt further enquiries and investigations will see how much validity there is in this claimthat the decision had only been taken last night, notwithstanding that we know Treasury had provided him and the government with advice that the Productivity Commission should conduct that inquiry. There is no body in Australia better qualified to look into industry matters of this kind than the Productivity Commission itself-after all, it started off as the Tariff Board and then became the Industry Assistance Commission and the Industry Commission. This is the most distinguished independent economic think tank in Australia. It has years of expertise in looking into these industry matters and so, naturally, Treasury recommended that it would be the appropriate body. That advice was rejected. A political group was assembled, headed by a former Labor Premier aided by a number of trade union officials, and instead the Productivity Commission was reduced to a minor role to do some economic modelling. When the Rudd opposition were seeking to become the Rudd government, they contended that they were fiscal conservatives, economic conservatives. I recall the Prime Minister saying, shortly after the election, that he wanted the Treasury brought: ... to the centre stage of what this Government does in the future. We cannot afford to fall behind when it comes to national economic reform and I intend to harness the full resources and capabilities of the Treasury in so doing. We have a vital manufacturing industry in Australia under great pressure, for which the best economic insights and the most objective and clear-headed advice is needed. Treasury says the Productivity Commission is the right body to provide it-and so it was-and that advice is ignored and we have jobs for the boys. What we have here is the wrong job for the wrong boy. If ever there were an appointment that was a political fix, a job for the boys, to get a predetermined outcome, it would be this one, and all of those people who believed that Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan were going to be economic conservatives now realise that they are only interested in jobs for the boys. Throughout his term as Treasurer, the Treasurer has acted in a way which is uniquely reckless. When we speak about economic matters and when we speak about inflation, it is vital that we speak about them moderately and objectively. It is particularly vital that treasurers and, indeed, central bank governors do so as well. We need facts. We need sober assessment. But what have we had from Wayne Swan? This is a man who said he was dripping with empathy, concerned about the price of groceries, concerned about the struggles of ordinary Australians sitting at their kitchen table, and worried about the impact that interest rate rises would have on them. And what did he say the day before the Reserve Bank met to consider a rise in interest rates that most commentators regarded as likely or very likely? He said: The inflation genie is out of the bottle. There was nothing he could have said which would have been more likely, more certainly calculated, to ensure that that interest rate rise would occur. It was a rhetorical flourish, it was a headline-grabbing flourish, and it reminds me of Paul Keating's much lamented and much criticised remark that Australia was heading towards a ‘banana republic', which produced a whole series of economic consequences-because when a Treasurer speaks, the world listens, the whole economy listens, the whole global economy listens, and what he says will inevitably have a consequence as to the way our economy is viewed. One of the other reckless things the Treasurer has done is run down the Australian economy. We have to recognise that we have problems in our economy; we always will. As I said before, a treasurer complaining about economic challenges is like a firefighter complaining about fires. It is the job of the Treasurer to deal with economic challenges. That is the job description. But, when you for politically partisan purposes create a false impression of the Australian economy, you undermine the living standards of all Australians because it impacts on the regard, the rating, the credibility and the credit of our country. So it is vital to be accurate. To be fair, not everybody in the government is as reckless as the Treasurer. The Assistant Treasurer, Mr Bowen, who I see sitting opposite, said on 22 January, ‘The evidence of a serious inflation problem has only begun to mount over the last six months or so.' I beg your pardon-that was the finance minister on 5 February. But the Assistant Treasurer said on 22 January, ‘Inflation has been low in Australia over the last few years.' Those two ministers were correct; they were absolutely correct. The Treasurer has said that inflation has been on the march for a couple of years. He is trying to create the impression that inflation has been ramping up consistently for a couple of years, that the Reserve Bank has been there, warning the former government, and that the former government ignored all those warnings. Mr Bowen-That's right.",120
188,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Assistant Treasurer said, ‘That's right.' It is completely untrue. In fact, as recently as 14 June last year the Reserve Bank Governor, Glenn Stevens, said in a speech where he considered the whole economic outlook that inflation was actually moderating. He said: Inflation did pick up in Australia during the middle years of the current decade ... That peak in CPI inflation rate was affected by some temporary factors, which have now reversed. He went on to say: The most recent data for inflation ... showed a more welcome trend, with underlying measures of inflation running at a reduced pace and the CPI rate on its way down as well. An opposition member-When was that?",121
189,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That was June 2007. The reality is that it was not until the last half of last year that signs developed to demonstrate that the governor's outlook or forecast was wrong. The forecasts of the Reserve Bank became more troubling, for those who are concerned about inflation, in November and particularly in February. The reality is that we do have an inflation challenge here in Australia, and the opposition take it very seriously indeed. But we take it so seriously that we do not tell falsehoods about it. The reality is that as far as the numbers indicated, be they the headline CPI or the numerous measures of underlying CPI, inflation was coming down in the first half of this year, following-and no doubt as a consequence of-the three rate rises in 2006. In other words, it appeared that monetary policy was doing its job. Inflation had been going up, the Reserve Bank tightened the screwsthat is their job-and put rates up 75 basis points over that year, and inflation started to come down. The signs that inflation was not behaving as the governor had suggested in June 2007 only started to become apparentand, of course, not everybody was as convinced as everybody else-in the June numbers, when they were released in the second half of 2007. It is very important to recognise that, throughout the 47 quarters of the Howard government, inflation, whether you measure it as the headline rate or use any of the underlying measures, was managed the within the target band. The objective of inflation targeting, which the Treasurer signed off on in December 2007, in essentially the same form as it had been for some years, is to maintain inflation-and inflation is consumer price inflation or the headline CPIwithin the band of two to three per cent on average over the cycle. It is expressly stated that it will not be within that band in every quarter. It is designed to allow for fluctuations above and below the band. The focus is on the average. The record is there. If you take headline CPI, it is between two and three per cent; it is 2½ per cent. You can take the underlying measure that is calculated on an exclusion basis by eliminating volatiles, and it is around 2½ per cent. You can take the weighted median, another underlying measure, and it is 2½ per cent. The trimmed mean is 2½ per cent. That was the test that was set in the objectives of monetary policy agreed to by Peter Costello in 1996 and restated a number of times, most recently by the Treasurer. And it was met. Yet, if you listened to the Treasurer's rhetoric, you would think the economy had been left in a mess. This is an economy with unemployment at a 35-year low and there are more Australians in work than ever before. I see a new member, a former secretary of the Australian Workers Union, opposite me. I wonder what he thinks about being a member of a government that has no regard for employment. There was no thrill of excitement, no delight expressed from the government benches, at the unemployment figure today. It was down to 4.1 per cent. When we were in government and new employment numbers came out, Peter Costello was on his feet, filled with pride that there were more jobs. What has gone wrong with the Labor Party? I remember Neville Wran used to say, ‘Jobs, jobs, jobs.' What is the economic objective of the new Rudd government? The truth is that the objectives of monetary policy are not just to deal with inflation; they are to maintain medium-term price stability and that means handling inflation. We are all committed to that. But equally important is maintaining full employment. Yet we seem now to have a government that has no interest in maintaining full employment. When we talk about Reserve Bank warnings, we hear about these 20 warnings. This is the most selective list. It is a long list. They are invariably quotations from Reserve Bank documents taken dramatically out of context. One of the documents is the one I just mentioned from June 2007, where, in fact, far from warning the government that inflation was going up, the Reserve Bank governor said: ‘Don't worry. We've got everything under control. It is heading down. Things are looking good.' I just quoted it. That is exactly what they said. Inflation is a huge challenge. Managing Australia's economy is a huge challenge. But it has to be done responsibly. It has to be done with language that is moderate, objective and above all accurate. At the moment, the Treasurer, far from taking on economic challenges, is creating economic problems himself.",122
190,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, congratulations on the job. The member for Wentworth is acutely embarrassed, most particularly about a number of outrageous and wildly inaccurate statements that he has been making about inflation in the last month or so. What we have seen today from the shadow Treasurer in his discussion of inflation is an attempt simply to fiddle the figures because the truth is too hard for him to digest and too hard for him to comprehend. He spoke before about how proud the member for Higgins was of his economic record-so proud indeed that he could not even attend the House to listen to the member for Wentworth! He would not come, because the record is far from perfect. We are going to have a debate about the size of our inflation problem; we are going to have a debate about its causes, because getting this right is absolutely essential to Australia's economic future. If the member for Wentworth were to have his way, there would not be the policies in place that need to address the capacity constraints that we have experienced for years and years in relation to infrastructure and skills. There would not be those policies in place at all because the former government was in denial. We have this wonderful construction and fiddling of the figures because he is so embarrassed, most particularly by his performance on Insiders on Sunday. What did he say on Insiders on Sunday? I will tell you what he said. He said that the underlying inflation rate did not matter-the underlying inflation rate was not the one used by the Reserve Bank-and that the government was wrong to focus on the underlying inflation rate. The other porky that he told on Insiders on Sunday was that there is no such figure as a 3.6 per cent underlying inflation rate; it does not exist on the Reserve Bank's website. Wrong again! It is most certainly there. What he has been trying to do is to somehow reanalyse the figures to wash away the inflation that everyone in the community has been feeling, not just for the last two months, three months or six months but for years and years. The reason the member for Wentworth is so embarrassed about this is that he dropped another clanger a couple of weeks ago. Do you know what that clanger was? He said inflation was a fairy story. And perhaps nothing more demonstrated how out of touch the member for Wentworth is than his description of that inflation figure cember quarter as a fairy story, because working families around this country know about inflation. They do not need the member for Wentworth to fiddle the figures. They have been feeling inflation, because it has been on the march for the last two yearssubstantially on the march. Of course, the former government was warned.",123
191,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,124
192,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,They were most certainly warned. Arrogant self-promotion does not pass for serious economic analysis.,124
193,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,124
194,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order!,124
195,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What we have not had from the member for Wentworth is serious economic analysis. There has been none at all. There are two things he does not really comprehend. The statement on monetary policy which came out from the Reserve Bank earlier this week was very grim news. Of course, if you are going to deal with it, you have to understand its causes. The parting gift from the Liberal Party of Australia and the former Treasurer to the Australian people was this elevated level of inflation-an elevated level of inflation over and above the target band, headline and underlying, for the next two years. What we get is a redefinition of the figures. What he has been doing out there for the last couple of weeks is somehow trying to redefine away the problem so you cannot be held responsible for your complacency and for your neglect over the last couple of years. That is what is at stake in this debate. This government has put together a comprehensive plan to deal with inflation: a fivepoint plan, the type of plan that the Liberal Party could not put together at any stage of the last three years. Mr Keenan-No, we couldn't come up for the De- with those cliches!",124
196,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You certainly could not. You certainly could not come up with a plan. You have denied the problem. The problem we have with the member for Wentworth is that perhaps he is the only member of parliament in the country who could make the member for Higgins look in touch. He is the only member who could possibly do that. Mr Turnbull-You make Kevin Rudd look numerate.,124
197,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Oh dear. So the member for Wentworth ought to be honest enough to, first of all, admit that underlying inflation has been on the march for a lot longer than the last six months-a lot longer than that. Mr Keenan-Stop repeating yourself.",124
198,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! Stop interjecting.,124
199,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Of course the reason he is so embarrassed is that we had this ridiculous statement from the Leader of the Opposition. He described the Australian economy as being in a first-rate condition. There are some good things in the Australian economy and we discussed them today. The latest employment figures are good. We have had 17 years of growth. That is good. But all of this is now threatened-threatened by an inflation problem that must be brought under control. Mr Ciobo-By your state Labor governments-$80 billion worth of debt.,124
200,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,There we go.,124
201,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Moncrieff.,124
202,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"All of this is threatened by an inflation problem which we accepted responsibility for on day one. As I said in the House the other day, we accept responsibility for dealing with this problem. But why don't you just have the common decency to accept some responsibility for causing it? The notion that inflation just suddenly jumped out of the bottle in the last six months shows how out of touch the opposition is. If you have been out there doing the shopping or going to a childcare centre, if you have been out there paying your bills, you will know that inflation has been elevated for some time. What is the history of this? Why has he started to redefine the figures? Because the member for Wentworth is so acutely embarrassed by this fact. Mr Dutton interjecting Mr Debus interjecting",124
203,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Dickson and the Minister for Home Affairs will stop injecting across the table.,125
204,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Last year, around September, the previous Treasurer, the member for Higgins, made the now famous statement that inflation was right where he wanted it. That is what the former Treasurer said: inflation was right where he wanted it. This just demonstrates how you guys in government got this all wrong. And now it falls to us, the Rudd Labor government, to put in place a series of fundamental reforms to address these problems. We are absolutely determined to do that. The first step we are taking is to bring under control your reckless spending spree of the last three or four years. We saw in the last four-year period the biggest increase in federal spending of any other four-year period in the last 15 years, just at time when the terms of trade were pumping up the economy. Mr Hockey interjecting",125
205,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for North Sydney.,125
206,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What we needed to do was attend to the capacity constraints, as the Reserve Bank advised you to do repeatedlyMr Hockey interjecting",125
207,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,over the last three years. What we would have done was to take the warnings on inflation very seriously. Mr Hockey interjecting,125
208,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for North Sydney will stop interjecting.,125
209,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Of course, what that means is that the first step that has to be taken is that the federal government itself has to take the lead, has to provide restraint. So it falls to us to cut back your reckless spending spree-and we will, which is why the Prime Minister has made his commitment for a surplus of at least 1.5 per cent of GDP. It is why the Prime Minister made the announcement in the House today about there being the need for restraint-and there is, because those in the opposition do not understand the problem. We have to have some fiscal discipline. Mr Hockey interjecting",125
210,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The Manager of Opposition Business is already on thin ice.,125
211,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"But, secondly, we must attend to the skills crisis in the Australian economy left to us by the Liberals. You cannot go out and talk to anyone in this country, any employer, large or small, anywhere in the country, who does not talk to you about a skills crisis. But nothing was put in place to a deal with this precisely at the time when urgent action was required, when inflation was on the march. When inflation was on the march, what were you doing? I know what you were doing, because we talked about it a bit. You were out there playing tag team with Peter Costello. That is what you were doing. That is what the shadow minister was up to. Mr Turnbull interjecting",125
212,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, you were. You were out there trying to shame him into putting in place some decent tax reform. That is what you were doing. You were not actually looking after the fundamental interests of the Australian economy-and you were not doing anything about the infrastructure bottlenecks. You would come into the House day after day, week after week, playing the blame game-blame the states; do not accept any responsibility for political leadership, which is what the Reserve Bank was advising you to do. Mr Ciobo-I've eaten mousse with more substance than you.",126
213,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And it shows. What is also important is some fundamental tax reformfundamental tax reform to put incentive in the tax system, so the people who do work hard to make our economy strong get a fair go. Of course, the previous government was content to leave in place the most horrendous effective marginal tax rates, particularly ones which affected second-income earners. You left them there year after year after year after year, and we shamed you into acknowledging the problem. We absolutely shamed you into acknowledging the problem. We did. And we can go back through the record. We understand that working families deserve not only some tax relief but also a tax system that works for them, and we are determined to put one in place. I am proud to have introduced the bill that came to the House today, along with other measures that the government will bring forward as part of its election commitments. The increase in compensation for out-of-pocket childcare costs, for example, and the education tax rebate are all very important parts of assisting working families-who are under tremendous financial pressure-on the one hand, and, on the other hand, effectively lifting workforce participation, which is so important. Mr Ciobo-It's at a record high now.",126
214,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, it is, and it needs to go higher-something that you have not recognised either-because we do live in a situation where there is a terms of trade boom that has fuelled demand and it has to be dealt with. It is part and parcel of our five-point plan. We on this side of the House recognise the enormity of the challenge that we face-and we are up for it. We will not deny the problem. It was absolutely laughable for the member for Wentworth to claim that our accurately describing the size of the inflation challenge was somehow going to cause inflation. I will tell you what it causes: acute political embarrassment to the opposition, because you should be ashamed of your record. The opposition's claim to economic competenceMr Turnbull interjecting",126
215,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Wentworth!,126
216,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,has been blown away completelyMr Turnbull-You've been warned.,126
217,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You will be warned in a minute.,126
218,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"by the statement on monetary policy that was delivered by the Reserve Bank only on Monday and blown away completely by the December CPI number, the inflation for the months of October, November and December-a 16-year high. Mr Turnbull-On one measure.",126
219,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is still denying it. The member for Wentworth still denies that it is high. Shadow minister, if you do not understand the problem, you cannot be part of the solution. The sort of grandstanding that we have had from you today and over the last couple of weeks shows how ill prepared you are and how you are not fit to occupy the role that you do. The clangers that you have dropped on program after program have seen you become a figure of fun in economic commentary right around this country-and I have to say that I was surprised to see it. (Time expired)",126
220,Mr DUTTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would say that that is the worse performance by a Treasurer in well over 12 years. Today Australian people listening to the debate going on in this chamber and people who have been listening to this Treasurer over the last several months really must cringe. The Australian people, small business, and big business at the moment, have been sapped of their confidence. This is an arrangement that cannot continue. This bloke is completely and utterly out of his depth. Businesses out there at the moment really are concerned about whether to put on extra staff and they are concerned about whether they will make extra investment. That is all because the nomic circumstances in this country have changed very quickly. If the confidence goes from the marketplace in this country, unemployment will go up and we will see a fall in investment-and that will be bad for the long-term economic situation facing our country. The reality is that, when the coalition came into government in 1996, it inherited a debt from the Labor Party of close to $100 billion. It was off the back of Australian families paying 17 per cent for interest rates on their homes-it was over 20 per cent for people who were in small business or who owned farms. All Australians know that, over the last 12 years, our economy was transformed into one of the best in the world. All of that is in the process of being undone. of that will be undone by a bloke who is completely out of his depth and is fast becoming the laughing-stock of financial markets right around the world. What has happened so far over the last couple of months is that, because this bloke, this Treasurer, is out of his depth, he is going about a process of rewriting history. He is out there telling people that he inherited a poor-performing economy. He is out there rewriting figures. He is out there fabricating stories about the way in which the member for Wentworth has presented the difficulties in relation to inflation. This bloke thinks, as he did during the election campaign, that if he repeats a line long enough and often enough it will become a truth. The reality, of course, is quite the opposite, because the Australian people know that this is a Treasurer who, in the history of Australia, is the most unqualified person to be running a $1.1 trillion economy and he is thoroughly demonstrating that fact. This is a bloke who has never run a business. He has never employed staff. Outside of running some hack organisation in Queenecosland, he has not had any experience in economic management. I say to Australian families and small businesses right now: watch this space very closely, because this is a concerning time in this country's history. The reality is that most people are worried. Most people are worried about a return to 17 per cent interest rates. If we have a wages blowout in this country, they are worried about a return to high interest rates under a Labor government. They are concerned about returning to high unemployment. High unemployment, of course, was the other hallmark of the former Labor government and it is fast becoming a concern for this country. Good employment figures were released today, but really what will happen is that, if the inflation difficulty is not reined in by this govAll ernment, if it does not face up to the economic realities, those difficulties will be livered to the Australian people. For the record and for all Australian people, the reality is that, when Labor came into government on 24 November, the Australian economy had been run well for the last dozen years. Madam Deputy Speaker, we have heard from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer about how they will rein in this inflation difficulty they talk of. They talk about a five-point plan. Do you know that one of the points of that plan is to address issue of home loan affordability? They want to create a greater environment for people to be able to buy a house. That is all admirable. However, what they have tried to do in rewriting history over the last few months, particularly the history of inflation, is to say that, through the five-point plan and their policy on home loan affordability, they will reduce the pressure on inflation. Do you know what that plan promised? That plan promised to deliver to national savings about $3 billion to $4 billion over the estimates, over a four-year period. This is a $1.1 trillion economy. The Treasurer of this nation is asking economists to believe that adding between $3 billion and $4 billion to national savings-adding to national savings is a good thing; nobody questions that-over a four-year period in a $1.1 trillion economy, where the government itself spends $1 billion a day, will put some downward pressure on inflation. That shows the shallowness of this bloke. It shows the deception and the fraud that he is engaging in at the moment, and it is again a demonstration of the old-style union politics. He is out there with these shallow, weak arguments, and he is not convincing anybody at the moment. He has no economic credibility whatsoever. He has no capacity to carry an economic argument, and he has no ability whatsoever to convince financial markets de- that he is on top of his brief any time soon. This bloke was spooked from day one, when the banks stared him down, when they increased their interest rates beyond what they should have, beyond what the expectation from Australian families was. His performance in question time this week has been nothing short of embarrassing. It has been embarrassing not just for him but for the people behind him-you see them laughing behind him during question time. You see the the gallery laughing when this bloke gets up to answer a question.",127
221,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member will refer to the minister by his appropriate title.,128
222,Mr DUTTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, this bloke, the member for Lilley.",128
223,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,No. The member will refer to the Treasurer by his appropriate title.,128
224,Mr DUTTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, the Treasurer is a bloke who is out of his depth. The Treasurer is a bloke who is the laughing-stock at the moment of economists, of the press gallery, of his colleagues and ultimately of the Australian people. The difficulty and the most important point to make out of all of thiswhich I opened with-is that this is undermining confidence. This really is undermining confidence in the Australian economy. Talking it down, talking about the inflation genie getting out of the bottle-that is all very difficult. The other aspect of the Labor Party plan at the moment is to slash government spending. The point I made before was that this government spends about $1 billion a day. This is a big, international economy, a $1.1 trillion economy, with a Treasurer who does not have the capacity to manage it. The other day there was an announcement from the Minister for Finance and Deregulation talking about some spending cuts of just over $600 million, which to the average Australian-to all of us-is an enormous amount of money. But the way in which the Labor Party couched this spending cut was that it was going to be part of bringing down pressure on inflation. It is not going to have any impact on reducing inflationary pressures in this country. That is why people from the Reserve Bank governor down are laughing at the contribution of this Treasurer at the moment. To suggest that, in a $1,100 billion per annum economy, this is going to bring down inflation-that it will put a downward pressure on inflation-really just goes to the laughing-stock demonstration that this guy is putting forward. When the Labor Party talks about government spending under the Howard government, it is talking about spending in areas like family tax benefit, to help families. It is talking about areas like child care, where there was increased expenditure under the Howard government. It is talking about tax cuts. It is talking about all of these issues. There is no proposal on the table at the moment that I am aware of to trim billions of dollars from those measures. It is really quite amazing when you look at how shallow this argument is. Nothing has been more startling than the revelation by this Treasurer-to underscore his economic inability-when he said that the $31 billion of tax cuts were okay this year because they were a Labor Party election promise and they would not add to inflationary pressures, but tax cuts in the out years would not be allowed because they would be inflationary. That is how shallow and inept this Treasurer is. The Australian people at the moment are laughing at this bloke. (Time expired)",128
225,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (4.19 pm)-I am happy to talk about recklessness and inconsistency in economic policy, because we have heard plenty of that from the honourable gentlemen opposite in the last half an hour. As the Treasurer said, we have seen the shadow Treasurer grappling, struggling, with the issue of inflation since he became shadow Treasurer. We have seen him desperately searching for the right sound grab. He has tried to claim that inflation was not a problem. He has tried to deny that it was at a 16-year high. And, as the Treasurer said, he had a shocker on Insiders. It was a woeful performance. He should have stayed in bed. The country would have been better off, and he certainly would have been better off. We saw him say on Insiders: The other measurers of inflation, so-called “underlying inflations”, which are statistical adjustments are … none of them were 3.6 per cent, not one. So, where the 3.6 per cent comes from, I could make a guess but it is not one that was published by the RBA. That was the shadow Treasurer on the Insiders program on Sunday. I am happy to table the RBA February statement, which was released the next day: underlying inflation, you guessed it, of 3.6 per cent. No wonder he is having trouble. Mr Turnbull interjecting",129
226,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is an average, he says. He is having real trouble with the inflation figure. But the best has been his solution. He is full of advice for the Treasurer on how you can fix inflation. He has a plan. It is a cunning plan. It is very smart: ignore it and it will go away. ‘Stop talking about it,' he says, ‘and it will go away. Don't talk about inflation, because you put it up.' So when I saw the Reserve Bank's statement on monetary policy I thought: ‘Oh well, they're going to say that the cause of inflation is the Treasurer's comments. They're going to say there's too much inflationary expectation in the economy, so that's what's causing inflation.' But what did the Reserve Bank say? They said: Given the current strength of domestic demand and pressures on capacity, a significant moderation in demand will be needed if inflation is satisfactorily reduced over time. They said nothing about inflationary expectations, nothing about the Treasurer's comments. They recognise that the causes of high inflation are the supply-side constraints in the economy and the roaring demand throughout the economy. But the shadow Treasurer has, in just two short months, developed a new economic paradigm. He says: ‘Ignore it and it will go away. Put your head in the sand.' Ostrich economics, that is his solution! Give me Swan economics any time over ostrich economics, because that is his solution. His solution is to ignore it and it will go away. What a joke! That is his plan as Treasurer. ‘Make me Treasurer,' he says, ‘and I'll ignore it. It will go away; everything will be okay.' What a plan! There you go-the shadow Treasurer's alternative approach. His fresh idea for Australia is to ignore it and it will all go away. The Baldrick of Australian politics, with his cunning plan, better do something better than that because the Australian economy needs a better plan than that. That is why we have a different plan. That is why we have a five-point plan. Now, what is point 1? It is to put fiscal policy to work and have a budget surplus at least 1.5 per cent of GDP. Why is this important? I will share with the House some quotes. They are not from me. They are not from the Treasurer. They are not from anybody on this side of the House. They are from well-respected economic commentators Access Economics. What did they have to say about fiscal policy under the previous government? Cop a load of this: Although it is usual for bad spending decisions to cumulate over the life of a government, the quality of spending decisions in recent years has riorated even more than usual as the previous government found itself the recipient of a China driven boom in revenues … the spending decito be sions flying out of Canberra in recent years proved positive Whitlamesque. Now, we love Gough on this side of the House, but I do not think Access Economics meant it as a compliment. They were not talking about how great it was that government spending was out of a control under the member for Higgins and the previous government. From 2002, the previous government pumped an extra $40 billion a year into the economy. We are facing inflationary pressures because they have pumped money into the economy which we have to fix. We have to impose the cuts and there will be some tests for members opposite. We will see how serious they are about inflation. We will see how serious they are when we put out our budget, when we put out our cuts and when we put out our expenditure review process. Let us see where they stand on inflation. Let us see how serious they are. Do they go for the cheap political ‘keep the fishing hall of fame' line or do they support the cuts? There will be some tests for the opposition as we go along in the process. We will see how they go. The other quote is from the Reserve Bank. What did they say about government revenue and expenditure in their November board minutes? They said: New expenditure and revenue measures announced since the budget and in the early part of the election campaign had since reduced the projected surplus to around 1 per cent of GDP. This meant that fiscal policy was roughly neutral in its overall effect on growth as conventionally measured, the recent initiatives having offset the ‘automatic fiscal stabilisers'. You will recall that, when the Prime Minister announced that the budget surplus would be detetaken to 1.5 per cent of GDP, the shadow Treasurer raced out and said: ‘That would have happened anyway. The government is not doing anything.' But the Reserve Bank begs to differ with Professor Turnbull. The Reserve Bank points out that the projection was for the budget surplus to be one per cent of GDP and in their words, not mine, effectively neutral. When you have an inflationary economy, you cannot afford to have budgetary policy and fiscal policy effectively neutral. You need a different approach, and that is our approach. There are other elements, of course, to our plan on inflation. We will be examining options to improve private savings. We will be tackling the skills shortage with 450,000 training places over four years. We will be dealing with infrastructure bottlenecks and workforce participation. These are all mediumto long-term solutions. They will not bring down inflation overnight. We have been bequeathed high inflation by the members opposite. Talking about inconsistency, I was intrigued to hear the shadow minister for finance, the member for Dickson, say that it has been a problem that the Treasurer has not been able to stop the banks from increasing their interest rates over and above the Reserve Bank cash rate. He conveniently ignores that that started while they were in fice. The Adelaide Bank increased its interest rates over the Reserve Bank cash rate while they were in office. I do not recall the member for Higgins-the then Treasurer-calling in the Adelaide Bank and having a stern conversation. What is their solution? They are going to use moral suasion. They are going to convince the banks to be good corporate citizens. They are going to call them in and have a very stern chat to them. That is their solution. Their solution to inflation is on one hand to ignore it and on the other hand to have the Treasurer of the day call in the banks and say: ‘You have been very naughty boys. Don't do it again!' They seem to think that will have some effect. Either they are going to reregulate interest rates or they are not. What is your policy? Would you change the law so that the Treasurer sets bank interest rates or not? If you would not then your words are hollow and your policy is an excuse for failure. They are a joke. They have no consistency. They ignored 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank on inflation. Over 12 years, they ignored 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank, as tabled by the Treasurer in question time. Mr Turnbull interjecting",129
227,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They will be questioning about them! Time is short, but we have a series of plans to deal with inflation. You shrugged your shoulders when you were in office and said: ‘Australian working people have never been better off and therefore there is nothing we can do. There is nothing we can do about grocery prices. There is nothing we can do about petrol prices. We will just let the market reign. We won't care about competition.' We believe in competition on this side of the House. You do not, but we believe in competition. That is why we have given the ACCC real teeth. That is why we are getting the ACCC to ensure that there is competition in the grocery market. of- That is why we are giving the ACCC the job of standing up for Australian consumers. You shrugged your shoulders and said that there was nothing you could do about the fact that grocery prices have gone up 43.6 per cent over the last 12 years, a rate double that of comparable countries. You thought it was fine. Well, we do not. We have a different approach. We believe that competition can play a role in reducing inflation. We believe that competition is how consumers win. That the is why we have given the ACCC real teeth and that is why the ACCC has used the powers that we have given to it. The shadow Treasurer really needs to think carefully the next time he goes on a Sunday current affairs program. He might be better off staying in bed. At the least, he should read the Reserve Bank statement before he goes on and understand that inflation is not caused by the Treasurer saying that inflation is a problem. There is a difference between cause and effect. Inflation going up causes the Treasurer to say that inflation is a problem. The Treasurer saying that does not affect inflation. (Time expired)",131
228,Mr KEENAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will say this for the Assistant Treasurer: a lot of wattage on the bottom of the Labor economics ticket. That was probably one of the most impressive job applications that we have ever seen in this place. But let me dispense with some of the snake oil that we are getting from the government about the state of our tremendous economy, the economy that has been called by the economists ‘the wonder down under'. Let us have a look at the economy that this government inherited, because no government in the history of Federation has inherited an economy of this strength. The Howard government delivered record low unemployment. Real household wealth doubled under the period of the Howard government. The Labor Party inherited no debt. Debate interrupted. NA",132
229,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. ",132
230,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Warringah) (4.30 pm)This week the parliament has eulogised Bernie Banton, Matt Price, Sir Charles Court and Sir Edmund Hillary, and I rise this afternoon to praise a man equally worthy of parliamentary tribute, namely, the journalist and editor PP MCGuinness, who died last month. For more than 35 years, Paddy helped to shape Australia's public debate as a writer, an editor of the Financial Review, a columnist on the Australian and the Sydney Morning Herald and, finally, as editor of Quadrant, Australia's finest intellectual magazine. In this final role, he gave a forum for Keith Windschuttle to bring more academic rigour and less political correctness to the study of Indigenous history. Paddy loved ideas. He had an unquenchhe is able intellectual curiosity and he endowed the Centre for Independent Studies library with what is probably this country's finest collection of Marxist documents. Paradoxically, Paddy was an early advocate of economic reform, the tariff cuts, the privatisations and the deregulation begun by the Hawke government and deepened by the Howard government, but unlike so many other economic rationalists he was not oblivious to the short-term pain of change and never lost his affinity with average wage earners. The eclectic crowd at Paddy's funeral ranged from John Howard, John Stone and Peter Coleman to Bill Hayden, Eva Cox and Bob Ellis, but it also included many otherwise unknown people whom Paddy had befriended in the pubs of Balmain. Although Paddy could be acidic in debate, he had a gentle heart. Clad all in black, taxi drivers would often mistake him for a priest. Paddy would patiently hear their confessions, but as befitted a pre-Vatican II atheist, as he called himself, he would never offer absolution. Paddy once advised me that to succeed I needed to look older and put on weight. That was advice he was happy to take himself. In his last editorial in the current issue of Quadrant, Paddy asked ‘whether Rudd will have the strength to continue his essentially rationalist position' and concluded: At the very least Rudd is going to find himself dealing with a torrent of criticism from his posed friends, especially the Greens (who have no sense) and the bourgeois Labor Left. Paddy was frequently scornful of politicians but eventually joined their ranks as an elected member of Leichhardt Council. Notwithstanding this effort, I think his journalism will be his lasting legacy to public lifea legacy, I might add, which even the most senior cabinet minister would struggle to equal. God bless you, Paddy. Public life will long miss your good counsel. Threatened and Extinct Species",132
231,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your election to high office. It is very well deserved indeed. I consider it a grotesque piece of arrogance on our part as a human race that we think we have the right to destroy other species-plants, birds and animals-on our way to affluence. While some species have prospered as a result of human activity, the vast majority have not, and many species are now threatened with extinction. In December 2005, the USA based National Academy of Sciences reported that human activities are leading to a wave of extinctions that is over a hundred times greater than natural rates. According to the World Conservation Union, almost 800 species have become extinct since the year 1500, when more accurate records began. The Alliance for Zero Extinction has identified a further 800 species on the brink of oblivion. These species are confined to around 600 sites around the world. Only one-third of them enjoy legal protection, and most are surrounded by human population densities approximately three times the global average. Human activity has increased extinction by between 1,000 and 10,000 times the normal level in rainforests as a result of reduction in area alone. According to the United sup- Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, the earth is down to its last five per cent of tropical forest cover and is losing that at a rate of over 200,000 square kilometres a year, with the rate of loss increasing. The world has entered the 21st century with little more than 10 per cent of its original forest cover intact and, according to the anthropologists Richard Leakey and Roger Lewis, all the forest cover will be largely gone by the year 2050. The country which has the world's worse record for species extinction turns out to be Australia: 27 mammal species, 23 bird species and four frog species have become extinct over the past 200 years. Our wildlife is some of the most beautiful and unusual in the world. We are known around the world for our unique wildlife but, unfortunately, we have a very poor track record of protecting it. Everyone knows about the loss of the Tasmanian tiger, a stunning animal which is now sadly extinct, but people are less well aware of just how bad our overall track record is. We have the worse rate of mammal extinction in the world. Since European colonisation, about 10 per cent of Australia's mammals have become extinct. In fact, almost half the mammals that have become extinct globally in the past 200 years have been Australian. The World Wildlife Fund says-and it is right-that we urgently need to build a safety net of terrestrial and marine protected areas to help our unique and threatened wildlife weather the upheavals of climate change. We need to reduce the impact of invasive species like foxes and cats on our native species, we need to assist Indigenous Australians to manage fire on their country and prevent late, hot, dry-season fires wiping out species and their habitats and, above all, everyone needs to commit to reducing carbon emissions to prevent a wave of mass species extinctions in Australia. I believe there is an opportunity to strengthen the protection for threatened species and their habitats in the review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which the Labor government has promised. The last government failed to keep the EPBC Act list of threatened ecological communities up to date because it was pandering to National Party pressure. This has meant that large tracts of threatened habitat across the country are not receiving the protection that is warranted from the federal government under the legislation. We need to recognise the importance of biodiversity protection; it is a crucial of this country's climate change mitigation efforts. We need a major national biodiversity action plan and a national biodiversity initiative. I commend for the consideration of the government, the parliament and the people of Australia such an initiative, which has been put forward by the Humane Society International. I commend the Humane Society International and WWF for their essential work. I urge all Australians to support their efforts at work. I urge us to ensure that we will not allow other species to become extinct on our watch, during our lifetimes. Banka Island Massacre",133
232,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to ask that we remember the 21 Australian service nurses who were killed 66 years ago in an event that would become known as the Banka Island massacre. This Saturday, 16 February, will mark the 66th anniversary of this horrific event. One nurse, Sister Lieutenant Vivian Bullwinkel, was the sole survivor of the massacre. Her story is one of tragedy, triumph and, above all, compassion. Vivian Bullwinkel was one of 65 Australian service nurses who escaped a besieged Singapore on the merchant ship the SS Vyner Brooke. The ship, built to carry fewer than 15 passengers, was carrying more than 300. Two days later the ship was hit by Japanese fire, sinking in less than 20 minutes. Together with the women and children who survived the attack on the ship, 22 Australian service nurses made it to shore on the nearby Banka Island. A day later, about 100 British soldiers, whose ship had also been attacked, landed on the island. The women and children left for the nearest village for help. The Australian nurses stayed behind to take care of the wounded British soldiers. It was decided that the best bet for survival was to surrender to the Japanese army on the island. A small part group left to find the Japanese troops. When they returned, the Japanese soldiers marched the men out of sight. The nurses heard gunfire and moments later the Japanese returned, wiping clean their bayonets. They ordered the nurses to stand in a line and walk into the sea. When the nurses were waist high in water the Japanese troops opened fire. Sister Vivian Bullwinkel was shot but not killed. She lay silently in the water until the Japanese soldiers had left the beach, later meeting up with a wounded British soldier, Private Pat Kingsley. She tended his wounds for 12 days before surrendering again to the Japanese. Both were taken to prisoner of war camps. Vivian was sent to the Sumatra prisoner of war camp, where she was reunited with 31 of her fellow nurses who had survived the sinking of the Vyner Brooke. Eight of them would die in the camp. Vivian would also later find out that Private Pat Kingsley died of his wounds in captivity. Determined to tell her story, Vivian survived 3½ years as a prisoner of war. In 1947, she was able to give evidence of the massacre at a war crimes tribunal in Tokyo. Only 24 nurses survived the events following the sinking of the SS Vyner Brooke. Fifty years later, Vivian returned to the island, officially opening a memorial to the 41 nurses who did not return home. During my years as veterans' affairs minister, I had the incredible honour to get to know Sister Vivian Bullwinkel. Her strength of character, compassion and her amazing emotional capacity to forgive her captors cannot truly be expressed in words. Until her death almost eight years ago, she endlessly devoted herself to honouring the service and lives of her fellow nurses. She received the Florence Nightingale Medal, an MBE and an AM. As well as opening a memorial on Banka Island, the year before her death Vivian attended the opening of the Australian Service Nurses Memorial on ANZAC Parade, which honours all past and present Australian service nurses. In the Hall of Memory in the Australian War Memorial a stained glass window of a nurse stands above our unknown Australian solder. Accompanied by the Red Cross symbol, the Australian Coat of Arms and the sign of charity, the nurse symbolises ‘devotion'. Sister Vivian Bullwinkel embodied this quality. She is a role model. Dedicated to her patients, her fellow nurses and their enduring legacy, she was the living example of that stained glass symbol of charity and devotion. It is important that this Saturday all of us take the time to remember Vivian, her fallen comrades and the many Australians who sacrificed so much to give us what we often take for granted today. Indeed, it is Vivian herself who put it best-and I quote: I would like people to appreciate that the lives, opportunities, sports and freedom for our young were bought at a price. Apology to Australia's Indigenous Peoples",134
233,Ms OWENS,ADJOURNMENT,"Parramatta) (4.43 pm)Yesterday was a great day to be a member of parliament, a day that will be remembered by many and talked about for years to come. It was, of course, the day that the Prime Minister of the country said sorry to the stolen generation. It was the greatest of days and I, like so many of my colleagues, felt so privileged to have been present on the floor of this House sharing the space with four great former prime ministers, the current Prime Minister and so many Aboriginal elders and representatives of the stolen generation. The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Australian parliament, said sorry three times and without qualification. I was expecting the apology-we had promised it and it still moved me deeplybut I have to say that what I did not expect and what surprised and moved me more than anything was the sense of joy, relief and hope about the House, the warmth of the welcome towards our Indigenous brothers and sisters and their sense of confidence and belonging in this place. In fact, I have said several times that Indigenous Australia owned Parliament House yesterday and that is a great thing. We should never underestimate the power of belonging and of being valued, particularly for those who have been so disadvantaged in so many ways for so many years. It was a day to honour the people of a living culture that dates back tens of thousands of years and to feel relieved and pleased for them that finally the day had come-the day to acknowledge the experiences of the stolen generation, to walk with them into the light, to look them in the eye, to recognise them in their grief and to acknowledge, once and for all time, the sheer scope of the nation's responsibility for fractured lives, broken families and decimated culture and to say the simple words: ‘I'm sorry.' It was a day to acknowledge openly that Western civilisation in Australia flourished at the expense of the dignity and, in many cases, the very survival of the oldest living culture in the world. The losses of the Indigenous people over 200 years of modern settlement are beyond measurement. But I think we should acknowledge that the nation as a whole, through our own actions, lost much more than we can comprehend when we valued our own culture and needs above those of the first inhabitants and when modern Australia as a nation accepted such incredible losses of life, culture and family for the first Australians as the price paid for our own development. I am incredibly saddened, on this day following the day we said sorry, that I cannot meet my local tribe, the Barramatugal clan of the Darug nation, in its full strength. When we rowed up the Parramatta River just a few weeks after first settlement we found a space which was like a park because the local tribes had burnt the land. The crescent in the Parramatta River was their meeting place. We built Government House there at that meeting place. Today there are a few elders-we know a few of them well. But the opportunity to meet that nation and that tribe in its full strength is gone forever from this nation. I feel that I have lost the opportunity to know my community well because of this loss-to meet them and marvel at a people whose perception of the world, space, time and land is so different from ours, to marvel at concepts that exist in one language and not in another, and to be introduced to the land on which I live by a people who have a very real spiritual connection to that land. We as a nation have all lost something. The settlers and governments that destroyed so much, gained so much and lost so much for future generations actually had some say in the choices that they made, but the stolen generation did not have a choice. The new seat of Parramatta has a larger population of Indigenous Australians than the old one and some members of our Indigenous community are clearly under stress. We in this House have the task, as we return home, of taking the sense of appreciation and hope with us to work with local communities on moving forward. We all have much work to do, but the events of yesterday make that task just a tiny bit easier. 2020 Summit",135
234,Mr TURNBULL,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise a matter of serious concern to many of my constituents and to many other Australians. On 3 February the Prime Minister announced that he would hold a summit of 1,000 of what he described as Australia's ‘best and brightest' to generate ideas for the future of our nation-that is, his 2020 summit. There was great disappointment in both the Jewish community and in the wider community over the Prime Minister's decision to hold this summit on the weekend of the Passover, 19-20 April. I wrote to the Prime Minister last week to urge him to change the date of the summit. All religious holidays are in our calendar, and it must be possible to find two days which do not conflict with any of them. It is, frankly, incredible for the Prime Minister to insist-having had this matter brought to his attention by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry at the outset-on holding the summit on a weekend which will preclude the attendance of most Jewish Australians. Is the Prime Minister saying he will have a gathering of 1,000 of Australia's best and brightest nonJewish Australians? That seems incredible. Passover is a very important festival in the Jewish religion. Not only is it a festival of family and giving but it is also a time to remember the perseverance of the Jewish people and the redemption of their ancestors from bitter slavery in Egypt. I do not imagine that Mr Rudd would have considered holding the summit on a weekend which would conflict with Easter or on a day which could conflict with Christmas. I wrote to him last week about this, raising it in what I hoped he would see as a constructive way, and I have had no response. I know the member for Melbourne Ports has also raised this issue with the Prime ister, and it appears that he has also ignored the concerns of his colleague. I urge the Prime Minister to reconsider the date of this summit. It is unreasonable to ask Jewish Australians if they want to attend this summit on a day which conflicts with their religious obligations. The first nights of Passover are festivals which the vast majority of Jews celebrate. Even Jews who would regard themselves as being fairly secular will find this a very difficult time to attend such a summit. This should not be a gathering of 1,000 of our best and brightest non-Jews; it should be a gathering of our best and brightest from all religions, whatever their background and whatever their faith. I respectfully urge the Prime Minister to have regard for my concerns, the concerns of my constituents and those of the member for Melbourne Ports and change the date to make it work for everybody. Australian Police medal",136
235,Mr HAYES,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to congratulate Superintendent Stuart Wilkins, who was awarded the Australian Police Medal in the Australia Day honours this year. Superintendent Wilkins is a proud member of the New South Wales Police Force. In fact, he is the Commander of the Macquarie Fields police station. He has had a proud history, going back some 28 years, in the New South Wales police. Predominantly, he has been engaged in investigating homicides and other serious crimes. People will recall that in 2005 there was a much publicised event that occurred in Macquarie Fields, which is in my electorate. Unfortunately, a riot took place. Subsequent to that riot, Superintendent Wilkins was transferred to Macquarie Fields. I happen to know personally the amount of work that Superintendent Wilkins has put into working with Min- the community-with Father Chris Riley's Youth off the Streets and every other agency in Macquarie Fields. It is extraordinary to see the lengths to which he and his command have gone to normalise relations in the community. I have particular appreciation and respect for the police, partly because of having spent a good part of my life representing the interests of police officers in a professional capacity and also because my father was a senior officer in the New South Wales police. I have had the opportunity on many occasions, formal and otherwise, to ask police why they chose policing as a career. Extraordinarily and invariably, the response has been ‘to make a difference'. I take that as absolute sincerity because that was the very same comment that my father made to me many years back when I questioned him as to why he had joined the police. Superintendent Wilkins has made an enormous contribution to his command in Macquarie Fields. He has made a significant difference to the life of the community generally but also to the normalisation of relationships and to the fact that we can rely on the enforcement of law and order. That is an extraordinary thing. The Australian Police Medal is a rare honour. Since its establishment in 1986 there have been only 1,067 of these awards presented. As I understand it, the police services are only allowed to present one award per 1,000 members. Consequently, the award given to Superintendent Wilkins is significant, certainly in terms of the community but also because it is recognition by his peers of his extraordinary efforts during his career in the New South Wales police-in particular, what he has done in administering the command at Macquarie Fields. The lot of a police officer is always difficult. It is often seen as a thankless task. Police officers are in place to protect the community and community values, and often they are referred to as ‘the thin blue line'. It is incumbent on people who occupy seats in this august body to recognise that there are people out there who are prepared to put their lives on the line every single day as they go about their duties on behalf of all members of the community. On behalf of a very grateful community, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Superintendent Wilkins and all the other police throughout this country and congratulate Superintendent Wilkins on a job well done.
