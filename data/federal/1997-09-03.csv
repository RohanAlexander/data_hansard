6,Mr BEAZLEY,PLEBISCITE FOR AN AUSTRALIAN," Mr Speaker. I hope that this final preparedness on the part of the government to actually let me be heard in place on this private member's bill, the Plebiscite for an Australian Republic Bill, is an indication that they are having a change of heart and that they are in fact going to support a process which respects what is now very widespread community support for their desire to express an opinion-unfettered, uncluttered by any manipulation and directly-on whether or not Australia should have its own head of state. Orders This bill sets up a process whereby that can occur. The convention process will not permit this. This bill would permit it. It sets in place a process far cheaper than the convention process, using a parliamentary committee to a question after public consultation, the question then being put directly to the people. It could be done at election time, therefore saving massively on the government's alternative option. It would be a simple question to the Australian people: do you or do you not wish to have an Australian head of state? This is what will determine the character of our constitution-whether we remain a constitutional monarchy or whether we become a As each day passes, we are having more and yet more revealed before us in this place of what the government's intentions are in this area. This policy of theirs-the conventhe tion-was conceived in party disunity with the intention of obfuscation. That is what that proposition of theirs was about at the time. When that bill ultimately passed through the Senate, the most disappointed person was not on amongst us on this side of the House-upset and concerned though we were at the first being breaches of the Australian secret ballot and what has made the Australian system sustainable in terms of public support for our democratic processes. Disappointed though we were, we were not the most disappointed. The most disappointed person was the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He has been wriggling on the spit of this undertaking of his predecessor as leader of the Liberal Party for the last 18 months. It has been on again, off again, and, finally, he hoped the Senate would give him an excuse to make it off again. Tandberg got it quite right with that little this box cartoon of his which had two Liberal Party hacks coming in, waving a flag at him, and saying, 'Good news, Prime Minister. We've got our bill through.' But the picture of the Prime Minister was of a very down-in the-mouth individual indeed-as he was. The Prime Minister does not want this discussed. If it is going to be discussed, he wants it sullied by confusion as to the legitimacy of the outcome in relation to the ballot. We know that, virtually automatically, two million Australians will be disenfranchised, and therefore no credibility will be given to any particular deliberations. And, if that does not work, he wants to put a dead hand on what ought to be an opportunity for some vibrant, civil debate in this country by the process of his appointments. Before I knew a little bit more about the appointees, I said the other day that, while they were a set of distinguished Australians, they seemed to be agnostic so we would not know which way they would fall when they came to the convention. We now know a great deal more about the nominees of this government. The youth that he sought to draw from are about as representative of the youth of Australia as my big toe. That is what we have from the other side of the House on the nominees that they have put forward for this convention. In the United Kingdom they are described as 'young fogies'. This does not apply to all of them, but it applies to an unrepresentative sample of them. And we had a Liberal Party spokesman coming out the other day saying that the nominee from Queensland had in fact been disciplined for rorting in the Liberal Party system in Queensland. Mr Speaker, this bill is necessary. This bill is the only way in which an honest opinion will be sought from the Australian people; the only way we will get a representative result; the only way what ought to be an exciting, interesting, vibrant debate in our community, in which the community again takes possession of the forms by which it is governed, will actually be delivered. The failure of the government to provide a process for that is one of the many reasons why they now stand condemned in this community. Bill read a first time.",13
7,Mr SPEAKER,PLEBISCITE FOR AN AUSTRALIAN,"In accordance with the resolution agreed to earlier, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.5) 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",14
8,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Berowra-Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (9:38 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill implements one of the government's important reforms to review of immigration decisions. The provisions of the bill comprise measures relating to judicial review of immigration decision making which are being removed from the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997 which I introduced into this House on 25 June 1997. Although now in a separate bill, there has been no change to these measures and the reform they bring remains part of the government's interrelated package of reforms to merits and judicial review of immigration decisions. The bill gives legislative effect to the government's pre-election policy commitment that we would restrict access to judicial review in migration matters in all but exceptional circumstances. That commitment was given in light of the extensive merits review rights in the migration area and arose from concerns about the growing cost and incidence of, and delays resulting from, migration litigation. To give effect to the government's commitment, this bill introduces a new judicial review scheme to cover decisions under the Migration Act relating to the ability of noncitizens to enter and remain in Australia. The key mechanism in the new scheme is the privative clause provision at new section 474. The privative clause, and the related provisions, will replace the existing judicial review scheme at part 8 of the Migration Act. Unlike the existing scheme, the new judicial review scheme will also apply to the High Court and not just the Federal Court. In my second reading speech for the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997, I set out how the need for the new judicial review scheme was clearly demonstrated by looking at the history of the existing scheme, how it was operating today and what would happen in the future if it were left untouched. Some of the key points that I made are: the current judicial review scheme for visa decisions introduced by the previous government in 1994 has not met that government's intention of reducing the volume of cases before the courts; in fact, recourse to the courts is trending upwards despite full and open access by many applicants to heavily subsidised independent merits review by tribunals; the high level of litigation, particularly by twice refused asylum claimants, cannot remain unchecked-increased litigation leads to increased costs and delays, and, those in detention, to a significantly longer period of detention; and it is hard not to conclude that there is a substantial number who are using the legal process primarily in order to extend their stay in Australia, especially given that less than half of all applicants withdraw from legal proceedings before hearing. As I stated in the earlier second reading speech, in the migration area litigation can be an end in itself. There is a high incentive for applicants refused permanent residence to delay removal from Australia for as long as possible. Some may seek to gain time to establish ties within the Australian community which they may hope will yield entitlement to a visa through another pathway. The incentive to delay removal from Australia is increased if the refused applicants are enjoying privilegmember-and es such as work rights and access to Medicare. The advice I received about best achieving !he government's policy objective of restrictmg access to judicial review was that the only workable option was a privative clause. That advice was obtained from the Attorney General's Department and eminent lawyers in the private sphere. As members are aware, section 75 of the Commonwealth constitution gives the High Court original jurisdiction to consider challenges to the actions and decisions of Commonwealth officers. As a result, access to the High Court cannot be legislatively restricted without a constitutional amendment. While access to the Federal Court, and the scope of judicial review it can exercise, can be changed by legislation, to simply restrict access to the Federal Court in migration legislation matters would in practice deflect many cases to the High Court. That would have the potential to erode the proper role and purpose of the High Court. The legal advice I received was that a privative clause would have the effect of narrowing the scope of judicial review by the High Court, and of course the Federal Court. That advice was largely based on the High Court's own interpretation of such clauses in for cases such as Hickman's case, as long ago as 1945, and more recently the Richard Walter case in 1995. Members may be aware that the effect of a privative clause such as that used in Hickman's case is to expand the legal validity just of the acts done and the decisions made by decision makers. The result is to give decision makers wider lawful operation for their decisions and this means that the grounds on which those decisions can be challenged in the Federal and High Courts are narrower than currently. In practice, the decision is lawful provided the decision maker: was acting in good faith; had been given the authority to make the decision concerned-for example, had the authority delegated to him or her by me, or had been properly appointed as a tribunal did not exceed constitutional limits. The options available to the government were very much shaped by the constitution. While I accept that the precise limits of privative clauses may need examination by the High Court, there is no other practical option open to the government to achieve its policy objective. Although the measures in this bill will judicial review, it does not affect the existing access to independent merits review by the Immigration Review Tribunal, its successor the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I commend the bill to the House and I also table the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned.

9,Ms WORTH,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (9.45 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.4) amends schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act J 995 to maintain the increases in the rates of customs duty on tobacco, certain tobacco products and certain petroleum products imposed by the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997, otherwise known as the government's safety net initiative. The safety net initiative was introduced to address the 5 August 1997 decision of the High Court in the cases of Ngo Ngo Ha v. State of New South Wales and Walter Hammond and Associates Pty Ltd v. State of New South Wales. The decision invalidated the New South Wales tobacco business franchise fees and cast considerable doubt upon the constitutional validity of all other state and territory business franchise fees on tobacco, alcohol and some petroleum products. Due to the serious budgetary implications this decision had on states and territories, the Commonwealth agreed to a safety net to protect state and territory revenues. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 introduced this safety net by increasing the equivalent customs duties in the Customs Tariff Act 1995. At the same time, limit complementary amendments were made to the Excise Tariff Act 192'}. While this timely measure successfully maintained the budgetary equilibrium which existed prior to the High Court decision, it was not possible to take account of other amendments to those rates of duty which were introduced into the parliament during the winter sittings, namely, the government's fuel substitution package. Specifically, the Customs Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendment) Bill 1997 will, when enacted, revise many of the descriptions of fuel presently contained in the act to prominently relate those descriptions to fuel containing a chemical marker. If enacted in its present form-that is, without the further amendments contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997-it would displace the recently introduced safety net provisions, undoing their purpose. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 will amend the revised rates contained in the Customs Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendment) Bill 1997 to incorporate the safety net into the new chemical marker oriented descriptions immediately after that legislation is enacted. Financial impact statement These amendments merely maintain the existing rates of duty imposed as a safety net measure by the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997. Therefore, the financial impact on the Commonwealth budget is neutral. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned.

11,Ms WORTH,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (9.52 a.m.)--I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No.7 (1997) Customs Tariff Proposal No. 7 (1997) contains alterations to schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. The changes will operate on and from the first day of September 1997. It will give effect to the tariff regime for passenger motor vehicles-PMV-and automotive components from 2000 up to 2010. Honourable members will be aware of the announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 5 June 1997 of the key elements of the government's response to the Industry Commission's review of the automotive industry. The government delivered an integrated package of reforms and measures designed to promote a sustainable and internationally competitive automotive industry into the next century. A central element of the package was the government's decision on the tariff arrangements to apply to passenger motor vehicles and automotive components from 2001. There are to be no changes to the tariff phasedown as provided for in the current legislation up to the year 2000 when the tariff will be 15 per cent. This will hold constant till 2005. The changes to be introduced through this proposal effect a reduction in tariffs on passenger motor vehicles and components of five percentage points from I January 2005, reducing the rate to 10 per cent. Tariffs on four-wheel drive and light commercial vehicles are to remain at their present rate of five per cent. Tariffs on micro/light vehicles are to stay in line with that of passenger motor vehicles. This delivers clear and certain policy settings that will ensure that the automotive companies can invest and operate with confidence. The industry is now well placed to build on its achievements to date and to continue to move towards global integration. At the same time the government is maintaining the trend towards lower tariff levels. In 2005 automotive tariffs will be at 10 per cent-a significant achievement since 1985 when assistance measures included import quotas and a tariff of 571/2 per cent. The decision also demonstrates anew the government's commitment to the APEC goal of trade liberalisation by 2010. This benefits all trading countries and will enhance opportunities for all globally competitive firms. It will benefit Australia's automotive industry as well by enhancing the opportunities for further growth through exports under the APEC agenda. The government's decision was endorsed by industry and state governments. It was unanimously supported by the Automotive Manufacturing Council, which provided advice to the government throughout the review process on issues critical to the future viability of the industry. A summary of the alterations contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned. TEXTILES, CLOTHING AND NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",17

NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.4) 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 June, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time.",20
15,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"This is the first time that I stand on my feet in this House as the opposition shadow minister responsible for population and immigration. In accepting the responNOES sibility for the opposition, 1 understand that it is not only a heavy workload but also a very heavy responsibility. 1 say that because 1 believe that Australia has an enviable reputation for successfully integrating into our society the peoples of many different nations, cultures and religions. On this issue we are a model for other nations, as so aptly noted in November when President Clinton visited Australia and praised our nation as a multicultural success story. President Clinton noted that Australia had a higher percentage of immigrants who had come here and built decent lives through hard work than almost any other country in the world. Mr Clinton marvelled at our success and said, 'I cannot think of a better place in the entire world, a more shining example of how people can come together as one nation and one community.' This is a wonderful reputation-a reputation that we should carefully maintain and nurture as we move into the next century. It also means that this parliament has huge responsibilities to maintain that reputation, and it requires from time to time that all members of this House take hard decisions to ensure that we protect that reputation and stand up to PAIRS those minorities who would seek to undermine and erode that reputation both within Australia and beyond. In good part, the different communities which have come to our country have trust in this reputation because we have created a system of review of decision making which they can accept as open, fair and impartial. They know that, if they are worried that large faceless bureaucracies have made wrong and unfair decisions, they have recourse to a fair appeal mechanism. We as a Labor opposition consider a fair appeal mechanism to be exceptionally important. On that note, can I suggest that Australia has led the world in the creation of administrative review systems, of administrative appeal mechanisms. The systems we set in place are now being closely studied by a wide range of nations as a model which they want to copy for their local legal processes. I have always believed that a properly run, transparent process of administrative review of both immigration and refugee matters one that we should go out of our way maintain. Obviously from time to time requires governments, irrespective of who in power, to ensure that action is taken maintain such a system. I am also keenly aware of its value, not only from the point of view of the nation at large but also, importantly, from the point of view of my own electorate of Batman in the northern suburbs of Melbourne-an electorate that is very much made of people who have come to Australia from many different countries. They often raise the importance of such a system as a safeguard, a sense of opportunity, to ensure that they are given a fair go in the traditional Australian way. I am therefore keenly aware of its value for Australia if we are to maintain a decent society. It is not a revelation to note in this place that in recent times trust in the immigration and refugee processes has broken down. That is a fair statement acknowledged by both sides of the House. I suggest that some people in this House have unfairly and unwisely exploited this issue for their own crass political gain. that, a minority are to be condemned. about time they faced up to their responsibilities so that, when they raise these issues, raise them in a proper and objective way that we maintain the integrity of our system and provide opportunities for people to ensure that they avail themselves of all available legal rights, not for crass political gain which undermines the integrity of that system. Governments of all political shades must seek to build and maintain community support for an intelligent population policy. I believe that is the objective of both sides of the House, though it is fair to say that from time to time we have debates and differences respect to the content of that population policy. Governments of all political shades must seek to build and maintain the fair go and decency which Australians have generally displayed towards each new wave of immithis grants to our nation. On that note, can suggest that a transparent administrative review process for migrants and refugees, is which has the trust and support of all Australto ians, is a key ingredient in this process. it For one moment I would like to digress. I is want to note here that another key ingredient to at this time is an effective quality education campaign on the issue of racism. This government, despite election rhetoric, has not yet produced the anti-racism campaign it has promised the community. I think it is exceptionally important that the government now proceed to implement that promise. It should treat that as a core election promise because I would like to know, and the Australian community would like to know, when the department's market testing of this campaign will be completed. When will we finally see this important campaign, or is it conveniently being caught up in the bureaucratic mire because of the weak leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on this issue? It is not Mr Howard who is leading this issue but another politician in this House, whose surname also begins with 'H', who is leading on this issue at the moment for crass political gain. I think it is important that others in the House join together to ensure that a decent and objective For anti-racism campaign be put in place as a It is matter of urgency. On the issue of this bill before the House, they I would like to say that, had we been reso elected, a new Labor government would probably have taken the opportunity to review, to look at the current processes. For that, we do not question the current government. It is clearly the right thing to do. I am sure that the new Labor minister in this portfolio would have wanted to carefully evaluate and judge whether the processes could be improved, made more efficient and fairer in the interests of Australia, in the interests of all the communities which make with up our great nation. The bill before us this morning seeks to make amendments to the administrative processes available to migrants and refugees who come to our shores. My predecessor in portfolio area-the member for Denison, I Mr KERR - has had most of the carriage for negotiations with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) on this issue. My colleague has advised me that he has successfully negotiated with the minister's office on these matters to ensure that today we are discussing the least contentious areas, and the more contentious matters of debate have been introduced as a separate bill and will be debated at a later time. The key issues of the bill relate, firstly, to the merging of the Migration Internal Review Office and the Immigration Review Tribunal into a new body called the Migration Review Tribunal; and, secondly, to giving the principal members of the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal clear authority to give directions on the operation of the tribunals with the objective of obtaining efficient processing practices. I wish to make it clear that, whilst the opposition regrets the decision to eliminate a process of internal review, we accept the government's intention of merging the Migration Internal Review Office and the Immigration Review Tribunal. Again, we accept the desire of the government to ensure efficiency in the running of the proposed Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal but think it dangerous to allow the principal member alone the extensive powers proposed in the bill. We are therefore particularly concerned about the proposal to allow the principal member to direct that a member constituting the tribunal for a particular matter be removed. Any undue delay-such as a serious illness on the part of a member constituting the tribunal-should constitute grounds for removal. Obviously we will consider the suggested amendments by the government with respect to those matters. The government should consider a number of safeguards on this issue so as to maintain the transparency and the integrity of the tribunals. As an example, any such directions by the principal member should specify the reason for removal, be signed by the principal member and the member removed and a member directed to now constitute the tribunal. We also believe there should be strict guidelines and safeguards to ensure that the power to hear matters without the personal attendance of an applicant are not abused. I would now like to take a few moments to comment on what will now become Migration Legislation Bill (No.5) 1997-the more contentious amendments to the administrative review processes which came into this place earlier today for debate and have been adjourned for future debate. I suggest that the good, cooperative relationship developed by my predecessor, the member for Denison, with the minister's office has seen the debate on this contentious bill adjourned for another date to allow the less controversial matters which I have spoken about today in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 to proceed. We oppose the wholesale elimination of judicial review as wrong in principle and the thin edge of the wedge for other administrative review matters-that, to the Labor opposition, is exceptionally important. Earlier I noted the need to maintain the integrity and transparency of the administrative review process. This should be accepted by all parties as a basic principle. We have very real concerns that the government's current proposals for elimination of judicial review will undermine this principle. We will argue strongly that the High Court will almost certainly invalidate the intended effect of the privative clause in the human rights context of immigration and refugee decisions. The government is therefore embarking on a very expensive and futile legislative process with the next migration bill to come before this House for debate. I note here that the Administrative Review Council currently has a project before it looking at appeals from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to the Federal Court. The results of this reference may have important implications for the government, given the plans by the Attorney General (Mr Williams) to amalgamate review tribunals into a single body. The opposition will insist that the bill dealing with the removal of judicial review be referred to a Senate committee for thorough public consultation. I would have thought that that ought to be agreed to by the government, because we are talking about a major change with respect to this proposal. I seek to conclude on this note. The opposition is concerned to maintain the integrity of the migration and review process for the reason I indicated, that is, we would have reviewed the issues currently before the House for debate. We do not question the government's intent, which is to maintain the integrity of the processes and to ensure that all get a fair go with respect to those issues. The Australian community has a right to demand from its political leaders that they should be secure that this process will deliver a fair, just system which takes into account the primary interests of all the peoples who now live in this country.",21
16,Mr TONY SMITH,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997 will implement a series of important reforms to refugee and immigration decision making. These measures flow from election commitments. The key provisions of the bill amount to a limitation of the role of the courts in immigration and refugee matters through the use of a privative clause. I will discuss that matter in some further detail in the latter part of my speech. There are two main components to Australia's immigration program: the migration (non-humanitarian) program and the humanitarian program. The former caters for the majority of immigrants and consists of the skilled stream, preferential family, concessional family and special eligibility programs. The humanitarian program comprises the refugee, special humanitarian and special assistance categories. In 1995-96, the rate of immigration was significantly higher than in previous yearsbut, in particular, it was higher by 13.4 per cent in 1994-95. Digressing a little, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), did, perhaps in a way that contributed to the so-called perceived concern and gave rise to what was a really silly statement made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) that we were being overrun by Asians. I say it is silly because when I was growing up in the 1950s and 1960s I can remember people coming here from Italy and Greece and there were real concerns at the time that we were being overrun by Greeks and Italians. What a load of rubbish that turned out to be. A great enrichment of our culture occurred as a result of those people coming to this country. Mr Lee-Not to mention the parliament.",24
17,Mr TONY SMITH,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"And I am reminded about the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou). It is important to put that into context because, when we look at this silly statement that was made, we forget about the fantastic things that have been achieved and we forget about the migrants who have contributed to the great projects of Australia-for example, the Snowy Mountains scheme and great railway projects-and about the hard work and the hard labour that they have undertaken in pursuit not only of uplifting themselves but also of enriching the country. I have likened their contribution to Australia as being spliced onto the trunk of a tree that is now much more healthy for their coming here. I do not, however, go so far as the honourable member for Batman in relation to racism education. We have to be very careful not to give credence to a lot of the things that are being said in the debate because an overreaction raises the issue to a much greater temperature than it really demands. We have to get on with it. We have to ignore the ignorant comments. We have to be very careful not to overreact, because we do not need to give credibility to some of the things that have been said in this area and inflame public passions to an undue degree. It is just unnecessary and irrelevant. I have become acquainted with a Polish family in recent years and with the hard work of a particular elderly Polish migrant who came here. He used to travel from Newcastle to Brisbane to work. He would come home to see his family on weekends. He worked very hard in the Evans Deakin shipyards as an ironworker. It has been an absolute privilege to be associated with this man. It highlights yet again the enormous privations that people from those other countries have suffered. They have come here, have not wanted pity, have got on with it, have worked hard and have done very well in this country, and long may that continue. Obviously, when considering the numbers of people who are coming here, we must also balance the interests of those people who are here and we must ensure that we get the balance right. Of the almost 100,000 people who came to Australia in 1995-96, 13,824 arrived under the humanitarian program. They were mainly from the former Yugoslavia and the Middle East. The refugee category of the humanitarian program is only available to people who satisfy the United Nations' definition of 'refugee'. In summary, that means a person who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group, and is unable or unwilling to return to his country because of such well-founded fear. The special humanitarian category is open to those who have suffered discrimination or other violations of their human rights but who are not refugees. The special assistance category is available to people who are in vulnerable positions overseas and who have close links with Australia. Many Australian people have been concerned about the incursion of boat people over the years. But I tend to feel, with respect to those who believe otherwise, that it has been exaggerated a good deal. For example, between 1989 and 1996, 2,508 boat people arrived in Australia without authorisation and, of those, nearly 1,800 people have been removed and sent back. During 1995-96, 589 boat people arrived in 14 boats and, of those, 413 have been removed, with an average time before removal of 17 days. So in my submission that does put the argument into some context and into some reality. As I said earlier, the thrust of the bill create a Migration Review Tribunal for nonrefugee decisions replacing the existing twotier process, which involves an initial departmental review-the Migration Internal Review Office, MIRO-followed by a review by the Immigration Review Tribunal, the IRT. The bill also inserts a privative clause in the Migration Act to limit the role of the courts in immigration and refugee matters. The government has taken steps as part of this process to address what has been-and, I think, justifiably-treated as an abuse of migration based on fabricated or non-bona fide relationships, especially in relation to spouse and fiancee applicants. These measures include the extension of the two-year probationary period for onshore spouse applications to offshore spouse applicants, limiting serial sponsorships, more rigorous assessment procedures, and requiring a one-year cohabitation period for de facto and interdependency relationships. Other measures introduced to restore the balance to the program include the ability to cap the number of aged parents able to enter Australia in anyone year and an increased emphasis placed on the English language for concessional family members wishing to enter Australia from 1 July. The bill does provide a number of measures to allow for more flexible processes in both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. They will amount effectively to a streamlining and in particular they provide a discretion for tribunals to decide whether or not a personal hearing will be of assistance to the decision making process, enable the tribunals to use the telephone or other media to conduct personal hearings or to require other witnesses to appear before them, and allow tribunals to proceed to a decision without delay if an applicant does not respond to a notice to attend a hearing or provide comment. The background to a lot of this is the enormous amount of litigation that has occupied the time of courts and, obviously, in many cases, the enormous amount of taxpayers' money that has been used in dealing with the litany of procedural steps and ultimately the court process. The bill effecis to tively gives imprimatur to the government's pre-election policy commitment that it would restrict access to judicial review in all but exceptional circumstances. That commitment was given in light of the extensive merits review rights in the migration area and arose from concerns about the growing cost, incidence and delays in migration litigation. To give effect to that commitment, the bill introduces a new judicial review scheme to cover decisions under the Migration Act relating to the ability of noncitizens to enter and remain in Australia. The key mechanism in that process being the privative clause provision at new section 474. This provision and related sections will replace the existing judicial review scheme. The new judicial review process, unlike the existing scheme, will apply to the High Court and not just the Federal Court. The history of the existing scheme really has determined the need for a new judicial review scheme. It is interesting to reflect very quickly on what could happen if the process-which is generally regarded as an awful bog in the court and review process-kept going. The current process was introduced by the previous government in September 1994. It was part of a package that included: expanded access to merits review; a requirement that any review rights must be exhausted prior to seeking judicial review; statutory codes of procedure for visa decision making and some restriction on the rights of judicial review in light of the access to merits review; and statutory codes for visa decision making. The former government intended those changes to reduce Federal Court litigation and to provide greater certainty as to what was required from both decision makers and visa applicants and holders. However, the scheme did not reduce the volume of litigation before the courts. The number of cases has continually trended upwards. Recourse to the Federal Court and the High Court has trended upwards with 400 applications in 1994-95, 600 in 1995-96 and over 700 in 1996-97perhaps they were trying to overcome the impending changes. It is anticipated that the number could rise to around 850 in the current financial year. In 1995-96, migration legislation matters formed approximately 65 per cent of the Federal Court's entire administrative law caseload. This surely highlights the totally out of proportion trend. It must be borne in mind that at a time when legal aid funding for cases of great merit is being reduced and has not been made available-and that has been the trend for a number of years-we have to give priority and ensure that citizens of Australia have access to the courts. Priority must be given to those citizens in considering the carve up of the legal aid cake. The privative clause provision came into being after much consultation with very eminent senior counsel. Ultimately, advice was received that a privative clause was the only workable option. Under section 75 of the constitution, which relates to judicial power, the High Court has original jurisdiction to consider challenges to actions and decisions of Commonwealth officers so that access to the High Court cannot be legislatively restricted otherwise it would be unconstitutional. However, it is slightly different in the Federal Court where the scope of judicial review can be changed by legislation. To simply restrict access to the Federal Court would in practice under section 75 deflect many cases to the High Court. This has the potential to erode the proper role and purpose of that court. Ultimately, advice was taken from counsel. Acting on that advice the government has accepted that a privative clause would have the effect of narrowing the scope of judicial review. This advice was taken largely on the High Court's interpretation of such clauses in the Hickman case of more than 50 years ago and, more recently, the Richard Walter case of 1995. Members may be aware that the effect of a privative clause, such as that used in Hickman's case, is to expand the legal validity of the acts done and the decisions made by decision makers. The result is to give decision makers wider lawful operation for their decisions and this means that the grounds on which those decisions can be challenged in the Federal Court and High Court are narrower than currently. In practice, the decision is lawful provided the decision maker is acting in good faith, had been given the authority to make the decision concerned and did not exceed constitutional limits. In summary, these measures are important in streamlining the migration process and in ensuring that those applicants of substance are heard promptly, efficiently and at the minimum of cost. They also ensure that those who are postponing the evil day of deportation are not clogging the courts unreasonably and extracting very necessary funds from other areas in legal aid. I commend the bill to the House.",24
18,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"We have had a wide-ranging debate on this Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997and I will also range widely on issues in relation to immigration, especially as it concerns the issues of review. Before doing so, I want to welcome in the gallery students of the Meadow Heights Primary School in my electorate, and I hope they are enjoying their visit to parliament. The bill before the House originally contained two sections. It has been split and another bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5), actually deals with the judicial review aspects that the former speaker, the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), spoke about. In fact, most of those judicial review issues have been put into that new bill. The reason is that the opposition has made it clear that we will oppose many of the changes proposed by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) in relation to judicial review. There is an important reason for that which has to do with the fact that in this bill we are going to condense two levels of review into one. What has existed until now has been a review process involving MIRO, which is the internal review by the department, plus the Immigration Review Tribunal. Persons were able if they were rejected-for whatever reason-to first go to MIRO and, in the event that MIRO rejected them, then go to the tribunal. These two categories are going to be condensed into one, which means that there is going to be only one process of review in relation to immigration. Let us assume that that is an acceptable practice. What is not acceptable is that after that point people have hardly any ability to take their case to the courts if they feel that they have been hard done by in that review tribunal's determinations. This is especially the case if you consider the fact that the minister intended that the principal member that is, the head of the tribunal-was to have very extensive powers to intervene in the decision making of the individual members of the tribunal. Fortunately, the minister has seen the error in this, and in the schedule which he has released of revised amendments we now have the acceptance of an argument put to him by the opposition. Now we have an amendment which limits the intervention by the principal member and specifies the way in which the principal member will be able to intervene in the determinations of other members. The important thing here is that if we are going to have a condensed process whereby the two former review processes become one then the right of access to the courts is needed. Let me tell you that the minister is going to get himself into a lot of trouble with this",27
19,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Automatic access?,27
20,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"No, not automatic access. That is not what he is doing. He is actually limiting the access to the court. Mr Georgiou-Who first restricted access?",27
21,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Anyway, we will debate that issue-I know that other speakers have already spoken about it-when you bring on Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5), because I think there are a lot of questions involved in this. The courts themselves might throw out that bill as unconstitutional. Certainly it is very limited in its approach. The reality is that we already are tightening up in every direction on immigration. There has never been such a tightening of immigration rules and immigration processes as there is at the moment under this government. While the tightening may have been justified in some aspects, there is also the big danger of serious injustice against people. Let me give you an example. One of the consequences of the tightening up of the marriage situation has been that Australian citizens, not permanent residents, who are legitimately married overseas to a non-citizen are being effectively placed in a queue, sometimes for six to nine months, waiting to be reunited with their wife or husband. We are not talking about illegal people. We are not talking about people who are doing anything wrong. We are talking about the fundamental human right to be together with one's partner or spouse. There is a very serious problem here. The point is that there are many serious problems when you tighten up immigration rules in this way, and the big danger is that you will create unfairness in the system. This comes at a time when immigration and migrants have been under attack in a way that we have not seen in this country for more than 20 years. The shadow minister, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), mentioned this in his comments when he referred to the Hanson phenomenon and to the way in which in this country we have had the creation of a hostility towards migrants and towards the whole of the migration program. We have to be very careful that this kind of hostility does not continue. We know of the enormous damage which the Hanson phenomenon has done to this country and its international reputation, not the least aspect of which has been the role of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this matter, which has been commented on by many people: his failure to condemn the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) when she made those comments. He continues to make doubled-edged statements and determinations-determinations which can be interpreted as being a not totally unambiguous condemnation of the views of the member for Oxley.",27
22,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Determination on cases?,28
23,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"No. Let me refer to a matter which has come up this week in the parliament: the appointment to the constitutional convention of Professor Geoffrey Blainey. I raised this matter by way of interjection in the House on Monday, and the Prime Minister staunchly defended Professor Geoffrey Blainey and his appointment. Yet this is the very same Professor Blainey who in 1984 raised the question of Asian immigration in the same way as the member for Oxley,",28
24,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,You want the right of veto?,28
25,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"What message do you think it sends to the Australian people for the Prime Minister to have put Professor Blainey onto this eminent constitutional convention? This is the same man who in a speech in 1984 at Warrnambool raised this whole ugly question. He said: Rarely in the history of the modern world has a nation given such preference to a tiny ethnic minority of its population as the Australian Government has done in the past few years, making that minority the favoured majority in its immigration policy. He was referring to Asian immigration. The views of Professor Blainey were taken up by",28
26,Mr HOWARD,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,and it is on the record-when he was the Leader of the Opposition in 1988.,28
27,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Your role is to prove him wrong.,28
28,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Are you saying that Blainey was correct in his statements? Mr CampbelI-I am.,28
29,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,I know your views. At least your views have been consistent.,28
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Mr Jenkins)Order! I remind the honourable member for Calwell to address his remarks through the chair and for other members to desist from interjecting.,28
31,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"At least the views of the member for Kalgoorlie have been consistent-unlike the Prime Minister who, having said these things in 1988, said to the Australian people before the elections that he recanted those views. He now comes into this parliament and again defends those views, indirectly, by defending and appointing Professor Blainey to the Constitutional Convention.",28
32,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Rubbish.,28
33,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"It is not rubbish. This is what the Prime Minister said in the parliament: I knew you would interject. referring to meThank you very much. It was lacking a bit of passion and feeling. Thank you, Andrew, very much. I think Geoffrey Blainey is one of the most outstanding historians that Australia has produced. I am very proud that my government has nominated Geoffrey Blainey to sit on this delegation. This is the same Prime Minister who is now trying to tell us that he disagrees with Pauline Hanson and that he is opposed to her views. This kind of doubletalk is the sort of thing that is getting Australia into trouble internationally because, internationally, nobody believes that the Prime Minister realIy is condemnatory of the views that Pauline Hanson is putting forward. That is what has happened in relation to this matter. That is why the Asian countries are very critical of Australia and of the performance of the Prime Minister in this matter.",28
34,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,It's your talk that's running this country down.,29
35,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"It is the opposition's fault! You go and talk to the ambassadors of the various Asian countries. You go and talk to the leaders, as many of our shadow ministers have done recently when they have gone to Asia, and you will see exactly to whom the blame has been given. It has been given to the Prime Minister. This is clearly doubletalk from the Prime Minister in relation to his performance on this matter. We were promised that there would be a campaign against racism in this country. Money was put aside in last year's budget and this year's budget for that campaign. What has happened? The campaign has not occurred. We have had excuses from the minister and others in relation to a campaign against racism. What has happened to that campaign? Why has the money which has been put aside not been spent on this campaign? The reason is that the government is not concerned with the promotion of multiculturalism. It is concerned with one thing-doubletalk. The Prime Minister is talking out of both sides of his mouth: on the one hand he is trying to say to Asian communities and Asian nations that he does not agree with the views of Pauline Hanson; on the other hand, in the campaign against racism he is doing things, saying things or failing to do things, which indicates that a significant number of government members, certainly the Prime Minister, agree with those views. It is about time this country gave an unequivocal statement on this issue.",29
36,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I know how passionately my opponent feels about these matters, but we are supposed to be a debating a bilI to amend the Migration Act. I know that the debate has been wide ranging, but I reckon he has had a pretty fair go on his favourite topic and he ought to come back to the issue.",29
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The honourable member wilI, I am sure, realise that he is skirting the wider path of the bilI, but he is stilI in order. I hope he will keep that in mind in the conclusion of his remarks.",29
38,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,I have made my points on this matter. When we have discussed justice for people on the migration program these issues have arisen. That is why it is very important that we debate these issues in this parliament,29
39,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,I want to hear what you say about the review process.,29
40,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"At the beginning of my remarks I made some important comments about the review process. I will make further comments in relation to the review process, but I also want to remind the House that the context in which we are working is such that the review process wilI be in danger, in the current climate, of not properly serving the people when there is pressure from the government-especially on the principal member as welI as on other members of the tribunal-that they be extremely tough with migrants as a result of the antimigrant view which has been adopted by this government. It is one thing to say that we should have rules that govern the size of the program to ensure that we stick to the size of the program which has been determined-the size of the program is another debate-but it is another thing, within the context of those rules, to have unfairness, especially towards, for example, spouses and other persons coming here on the basis of family reunion who are in fact finding it increasingly more and more difficult to get into this country. It is very important under those circumstances, if their case is just, for the review process to be just to them. The government thinks that it wilI save time and money by merging the two levels of review, MIRO and the IRT. However, this is not necessarily the case because there were many people, having been rejected by MIRO in the second stage, who felt that the costs and the trouble involved in going through the third stage of the IRT were not worth it. Lots of speedy determinations were made by MIRO through the old process. Having said that, we are not saying to the government that we will not accept the merging of the two processes. We have said-and the shadow minister said-that we will accept the merging of the two processes to see how it goes, to see whether it leads to a more efficient system and to see whether in fact it leads to a fairer system, which is something that we are concerned about. As the shadow minister has indicated and as the previous shadow minister, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), has indicated, we will not accept the idea of virtually totally getting rid of judicial review, which the government is intending to do by dividing this bill from the next bill, Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5). The reason we will not be accepting that is, as I mentioned earlier, if you have only one process of review and something goes wrong in that review, then surely it should be possible to appeal to natural justice by going to the courts. If somebody has a reason why they feel the tribunal has made a determination which is contrary to natural justice or which is contrary to their fundamental rights or where they have not had a proper hearing, all of these different reasons ought to be account of when looking at the possibility of going to a review process. Therefore, it is very important that we allow the judicial review to continue-especially in a system where we have condensed the two levels, the MIRO level and the IRT level. In considering this question of review and the role of the principal member, I mentioned earlier that the minister has now amended his original intention so that the principal member will not have absolute power in the way the review was initiated in the first place. But, when reading the amendment, it is not entirely clear to me what will be the actual circumstances under which the principal member will be able to intervene to override a member and what will be the circumstances in which he or she shall not. In that situation, perhaps when the minister sums up this debate-since he brought this amendment in rather late-he might care to elaborate and explain to the parliament the kinds of circumstances in which he envisages that there will be interference by the principal member in relation to this process.

41,Mr MCDOUGALL,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I rise today to contribute to the debate on Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997. It was interesting to listen to some of the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). We have seen from the so-called debate on racism that immigration is high on the list of issues which the people of Australia want to see changed. Let me say that I firmly believe Australians are not racists. Australians have welcomed citizens from other nations since before the Second World War when we established our first dedicated immigration program. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill that I address today is about putting our immigration program back on track. It is to assure the people of Australia that we take immigration seriously. The reason fear has been spread through our society is that the previous government did not take immigration seriously enough. The Keating government stopped asking people why they wanted to make Australia taken their home. The Keating government did not consider the long-term ramifications of a community of people who could not speak English and were without job skills. The previous government did not worry about how the community would cope with an int1ux of people who were not even sure what to expect when they arrived. As a result, some voices in the community have been able to incite fear and loathing. This will change, and I believe it has already changed. This government and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) have established firm parameters for the citizens from other nations who wish to make Australia their home. This government has already established firm rules which have confirmed to Australians that their taxes will no longer be spent on supporting people who came to this land in the belief the welfare system could support them indefinitely. Any person applying to migrate to Australia is now advised firmly and clearly that this is not a land of unlimited welfare and they cannot expect a free ride. As a result, we are already seeing a change in our migration pattern. We are seeing those who can and want to work and contribute to this country applying and receiving entry. This bill now addresses another area which had been left open to serious abuse, and that is the generosity of our legal system for protracted litigation. There is no doubt that many of the people who have applied for refugee status, have been rejected and have gone to court have had a legitimate case. Our democratic system allows such challenges and must be protected at all costs. But just as the former government allowed unbalanced and inconsiderate immigration, so it allowed for an endless and costly system for those who challenged the tribunal's decisions. We have had people from Canada, the United States, the Philippines and Great Britain apply for refugee status. We have had people on visitors visas who, once their visa expired, applied for refugee status. These quite obvious fraudulent claims have been purposely taken through the court process. It is in the interest of every applicant to delay the process in investigating their claim to refugee status. And why? Because the applicant is buying time to bed down into the community. People who have been rejected by the refugee tribunal use the challenge time to establish some form of permanency. Getting a Medicare card is a good example. The applicant has used our legal system of appeal to buy time. The more they can stretch it out, the better their chance of overriding the tribunal's ruling. It is not uncommon for people challenging the refugee tribunal's decision to withdraw their application on the steps of the court room. Therefore, this system which is so open to abuse and so costly to the taxpayer as a result is now subject to amendment as laid down in this legislation. The legislation is simple and in no way restricts access to the courts in migration matters. What it does do is clear the way for matters which are genuine. With the creation of a new, streamlined Migration Review Tribunal obviously spurious claims will be finalised at the tribunal level. Those who have set about abusing the system with patently transparent claims will no longer find a clear path through the various levels of legal challenges. Crooked agents who prey on naive people and sell them Australian visas are one example. One such scam has been the marketing schemes offering people refugee status in Australia. Naive, mostly non-English speaking people have been paying a fortune for what ended up being a $30 temporary work visa. What must be stressed is that this bill does not alter the rights of anyone for a fair and impartial review. But by merging the current Migration Internal Review Office with the Immigration Review Tribunal we are creating a far more efficient, single-tier system. This bill also gives the principal members of both the Refugee Review Tribunal and the new Migration Review Tribunal clear authority to apply efficient processing practices. This in itself will prevent many hearings from being unnecessarily delayed. Being fair and equitable is not about being tough; it is about being efficient. There is no doubt that our review system has become bogged down by the knowledge that more than every second case would be subject of a legal challenge. The current system of non-refugee applications is also a two-tier system. This major change is to streamline that process into a single review by an independent review agency. The current internal review process which is carried out by the Migration Internal Review Office and then the external review carried out by the Immigration Review Tribunal has more than 7000 cases a year to hear. Under the existing system, we could expect to get through just 2,000 of those claims. With the internal and external migration review tribunals combined to form one single body of review, the system will be speeded up. This alone is not enough, but this bill also gives the heads of the two tribunals clearer powers of authority. The tribunal's principal member will have the power to apply more efficient processing practices. Members of the new Migration Review Tribunal will be independent decision makers able to reach their own conclusions on a decision under review in accordance with law. Cutting down on the increasing litigation, most of it knowingly unwinnable, will free the process for the legitimate claims. It also help relieve the burden on taxpayers costly legal aid. This legislation is part of a wider program to balance our immigration program. EstabQuite lishing a fair and sensible immigration gram, one that is of value to all Australians, including our new arrivals, has meant change to all aspects of our program. I believe this migration legislation bill to create a single external review body is part and parcel necessary restructure of this new look for Australia. For those reasons I am pleased to some thought. support this bill.",30
42,Mr CAMPBELL,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I too support the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997. It is a start. is an effort by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock)-a minister who has I think, despite all his own inclinations, tried to address the mess that immigration was left in by the previous litigation government. When the Labor Party appointed the memcaught ber for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) as their spokesman on immigration, I breathed a sigh of relief. I thought we might get some improvided provement in the Labor Party's thinking in this area. That may be true, but so far there is no indication of it. The member for Dicksomething son (Mr Tony Smith) spoke on this bill. I merit. certainly thank him for rereading the minister's second reading speech. It did bring a few things back to mind, and for that I am grateful. The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) comes into this House and predictably runs the line of denigration of Australia, how are a racist society. I find this particularly galling. In my travels around the world-I have travelled quite extensively; I have been to China on many occasions-there is no either other country that is imbued with 'a fair go', as Australia is. We are probably the least racist of all societies. Racism exists in various forms in Australia. A lot of it falls into the category of chiacking. As a migrant I myself was subjected to this. It did not take me long the to realise there was no malice in it. I think what this bilJ does is sensible, but it up does not go far enough. We seem to be will hooked up on, 'We can't cut down on appeals of to the High Court.' Appeals to the High Court would appear to me to being made under sections 75(iii) and (v) of the constitution. frankly, I do not think section 75(v)prowhere people seek writs of mandamus-will have a lot of application. I see no need to do anything about that. But section 75(iii)-'In all matters in which the Commonwealth, or a tier person suing or being sued on behalf of the of a Commonwealth, is a party: the High Court shall have original jurisdiction' - does need In the early fifties Barwick CJ successfully in the Privy Council that there was no right of appeal for Australian citizens where It an issue was between states and the Commonwealth. So we are quite prepared to limit the options of our citizens but seem to be prepared to offer unfettered access to our system to non-citizens. We see now a situation where is about to ensue in our High Court, having been initiated by Indonesian fishermen fishing illegally in Australian zones, using the Wik ruling as the basis for their claim. I have absolutely no doubt they will be for by Australian lawyers, probably acting pro bono. In any case, it is a cost to the taxpayers. It ties up our court system with which clearly has to be without In praising the minister for bringing in this legislation I would not like to go too far. No matter what the minister does with this legislation, the minister knows-and I know the minister knows-that illegal immigration in this country is out of hand. He knows that we Fukien crime gangs are involved in impacting large numbers of illegal immigrants on to our eastern seaboard. When illegal immigrants enter Australia through my electorate they are captured or they die. It does not pose a problem: they either perish or they are captured. But on the eastern seaboard it is impossible. Japan has just written a diplomatic letter to the Chinese asking them to stop the t10w of illegal immigrants as they consider it a form of economic warfare. Of course that is exactly what it is. When the Japanese say that they know they are capturing less than one in three, with their vastly smaller coastline and their vastly superior navy, if they can only get Jess than one in three, how many do you think we are getting? It is probably less than one in a hundred. The minister knows it is a problem, but the government prefers to sweep it under the carpet rather than actually face up to it. There is another problem. The member for Calwell talked about human rights. I do not think this is an issue about human rights. I can remember when the member for Calwell and I were on the Labor Party immigration committee. He said to me on one occasion, 'Look, our views aren't all that dissimilar. I am in favour of a quota system.' I have never been in favour of a quota system. I think people should come here on merit, the justification being net value to Australia. It became clear to me that the member for Calwell was in favour of a quota system, providing he had a big say on who got in on his particular quota. It was a blatant grab for power, for patronage-something I think the member for Calwell understands. I am concerned about fairness in the system. I see a slant very much against Europe right now. I have a situation before me in the independent immigrant category-a fitter from Germany with very good qualifications. Australia desperately needs fitters. We have not got fitters because under the Keating government we stopped training these people when Keating told us the future lay in the service sector-tourism. This guy has to pass a pretty stiff test, including a test on his English. The test is broken up into four categories: spoken, written, reading and interaction. He has to get a pass mark of five in every category to be accepted. This fellow got five points in written and five in reading, only four in spoken, but six in interaction. So he could clearly communicate-yet he got knocked back. It is also clear that in the UK there has been blatant rudeness at the front counter in order to deter people. I do not believe this happens without the imprimatur of the government. I think it is encouraged by the government. They say, 'You be as rude as you can up front and discourage these peopIe.' Of course, when you are rude in those situations, the average pom says, 'Up you, I don't want to go anyway.' We then say, 'We're not getting the number of applications that we used to get.' This has recently spread to Europe. I have had quite a few complaints from people in Germany about this same phenomenon of blatant rudeness at the front counter when they apply. That has to be addressed. It is most inappropriate. It has to be understood that there is only one reason for immigration-that is, net value to Australia. We have no obligation to the world whatsoever. It is nonsense to suggest that Australia has some special humanitarian reasons for taking in large numbers of immigrants. If we were to take 100 million people from China or India, they would not even notice it, but it would give us a living standard somewhat akin to that of Bangladesh. No government has the right to impose that on future generations in this country. I am also highly amused when people get up in this House, as the member for Dickson and the member for Calwell did, and talk about the migrants who have come to this country. If they went out and talked to those migrants today, they would find that there was enormous support amongst those people for the curtailing of immigration. They understand the problem. They have seen it in their own countries. There is no support amongst migrants for mass immigration. What we do, of course, is speak to their self-appointed leaders-members like the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou). There is a problem if you believe that you can talk to 'ethnic leaders' and they will influence the votes of their fellows. That was the exact basis on which Malcolm Fraser endorsed the concept of multiculturalism. He thought he could get a few ethnic leaders to influence other people. If you believe this, then you believe that ethnics are somehow more stupid than average Australians, and I do not believe that. Clearly, it is not the case. That has to be the basis if anyone believes that you can manipulate these people by getting to a few so-caIled leaders. That has to be clearly understood. The member for CalweIl, in concert with a lot of other people in this House, has taken to attacking the member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson-shooting the messenger. Pauline Hanson is no doubt echoing the views of a lot of people. The test of free speech is when you are prepared to let people say things that you find disagreeable. That is a test of free speech and it is quite clear that the member for CalweIl and many other people in this parliament fail this simple test. Yet free speech is a cornerstone of our culture. It is not a cornerstone of many other cultures, but it is of ours, and ours is the one that we must be concerned about. Free speech is something for which we have fought and died for a thousand years. If it does not endure, we as a nation will not endure, either. So it is important that it is defended. These people openly invite Asian countries to denigrate us because we are racist. They know how susceptible Australians are to this charge. 'Oh no, we're not racist; here, have another concession.' It is absolute nonsense. If you want to see racism alive and weIl, you should go to Asia. In Malaysia, it is just below the surface. I was talking to some Indian hire car operators there who said, 'Goodness knows what will happen to us if the government changes, because below the surface it's simmering.' You would not want to be Chinese in Malaysia unless you are a very rich Chinese, because there is legislation against you. In China, the contempt with which they looked upon Indians and Malays was, I found, amusing. So it is nonsense to suggest that this country is particularly racist. It is simply not true. These people are not fools. If they can see an advantage in trade, they will press that button. We have ministers and the member for Calwell traipsing around pressing that button for them. It is an absolute nonsense. The disgraceful attack on Blainey by the member for CalweIl demonstrated both his ignorance and his lack of regard for freedom of speech. There is not an educated Chinese in this country who does not know they are much safer here than they would ever be in Indonesia. I do not think anyone would seriously argue otherwise. While we are on the subject of immigration, it is worthwhile comparing the policies of our neighbours on immigration. Malaysia has been taking a lot of immigrants in recent times. Its policy is to take compatible people. That means, of course, people from Indonesia, who speak the same language and basicaIly have the same religion. The policy of Japanuntil recently Japan, too, was a migrant intake country-was to take people of Japanese origin, mainly from Brazil but also a few from Hawaii. The policy of Singapore-and they make a virtue of compatibility-was to take them from north-east China, which was even more selective. They did not want them from southern China; they were seeking people from north-east China. While it is alright for them to be highly selective and have race based policies, I am not advocating that for Australia. What I am advocating is what is in the best interests of Australia. It is quite clear that the family concessional area is not in Australia's best interests. I believe this category should be scrapped entirely. It is simply nonsense to suggest there are human rights involved in this issue. I do not have the right to go and reside in France simply because my wife is French, nor should I; nor should my wife's family have the right to come here simply because she is here. It is a decision which people make. With the availability of travel, the world is a relatively small place. I do not believe it imposes an enormous burden. I referred to the member for Oxley. Her maiden speech in this parliament was an honest, naive, from-the-heart speech. There should be many more of those speeches in this parliament. It was not a speech that deserved the denigration she got. What happened was that there was a bipartisan approach by Tweedledum and Tweedledumber, who decided that they would combine to squash this woman. They were joined by a self-serving media in Australia, by every conceivable pressure group and by the churches, whose own record is fairly appalling. Those were the people who got together and thought, 'We'll squash this woman to such an extent that no-one will raise these issues again.' Do you see what is happening? They are allowing us to chum around the race issue, but they are intent that it does not spread beyond that. People will recall when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, said in this House, 'Freedom of speech is all right, but you can't let freedom of speech interfere with trade.' Then he realised what a foolish thing he had said and sought to cover his tracks by expounding the virtues of free trade to Australia and said that he could not see how anyone could deny the virtues of free trade to Australia. I categorically deny that. Free trade and the level playing field are not being built for Australia; they arise out of the machinations of big business-mainly American big business-to control world trade. What they have given to Australia are high levels of unemployment, a high current account deficit and a high degree of deskilling of the people in this country. That is not in the interests of this nation, nor is it in the interests of the migrants who come here seeking a better life for themselves. They probably understand it better than the average Australian because they have been there, in many cases, they have seen it and they have done it. I believe that the minister has made a start in this bill. He must keep the pressure on. It is sensible to require levels of English competency, and by that I mean a general competency. I can remember it was the member for Calwell in the Labor Party who actually took that out of consideration and it took us some considerable time to get it back in. This is certainly not racist. There are many people in the world who speak English. Many migrants say, 'We put a lot of effort into learning to speak English before we came and we believe we should be given more recognition.' I am inclined to agree with them. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has obviously got some instructions from somewhere-probably from large donors to the Liberal Party-telling him he must attack Pauline Hanson, and he is doing that now against his own inclination. The other day he talked about having a totally non-discriminatory policy in Australia on immigration. I say to the Prime Minister that if that means we are going to accept in this country people whose culture is so different as to be noncompatible with Western liberal democracy then we are doing this nation a disservice and it is a policy which is not in the interests of this nation. It is simply nonsense to argue otherwise. For instance, I cite fundamentalist Islam. You do not have to argue the merits or otherwise of it vis-a-vis their own culture; you simply have to recognise that it is not compatible with Western liberal democracy and you politely decline entry to these people. I do not see anything wrong with that problem because, as I say, the policy of immigration must be net benefit to Australia and, if it is not of net benefit, we should not do it. I have probably done as much as anyone in this House on genuine refugee work. I believe Australia has an enviable record with refugees and I want to maintain that record, but there has to be recognition that we are not getting genuine political refugees today; we are getting economic refugees. Australia cannot solve the world's economic problems, nor should it try. There is a lot of misapprehension out there which is being fed by the likes of the member for Calwell and the likes of our Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). When I was in South Africa in January I was upbraided by some obviously wealthy Indians who said to me that it was disgraceful, with Australia's large land area, that we were not having masses of migrants. I asked them if they had been up to north-west India in recent times. Of course, they had never been there. If they went there, they would find there are not a lot of people, just as there are not a lot of people in north-west China. It is a very large, barren, inhospitable land. In China, two-thirds of the population reside in one-third of the country. There is a lot of land there which is lightly populated. The reason Australia is so lightly populated is that it really cannot stand much more population pressure. The inland is arid and dry. This is the driest, oldest and probably the most infertile continent in the world. I think the government should spend a lot of time promoting that rather than a lot of the glossy images that are promoted overseas. There are many leading academics who suggest that our population is already too high. I would also say that there are indications that our population is also considerably understated. That is realised when you look at commodity consumption patterns and you find that key items would not be consumed by the number stated in the census. You would need considerably more people, at the average rate of consumption, to utilise them. And, of course, illegal immigration is a big source. I was upbraided in this parliament when a Chinese friend of mind ridiculed the suggestion that Australia has 100,000 illegal immigrants. He said there were at least four times that amount. I believe the government knows that and it is simply not prepared to act. The minister's response to me is that I should put up or shut up. (Time expired) Mr GEORGIOU CKooyong) (11.36 a.m.)-It is an understatement to say that since the arrival of the First Fleet Australia has been fundamentally impacted on by immigration. Today, around 23 per cent of the Australian population was born overseas and the overwhelming majority of Australians are descendants of immigrants. Successive waves of migrants have made a significant and lasting contribution to Australian society and immigration will be an integral part of this nation's future. This government, like its predecessors throughout the second half of the 20th century, is committed to a positive immigration program which serves our national interests and meets our international obligations. This is a bipartisan commitment disliked by some in this House, but confirmed in this House on 30 October 1996 in a motion unanimously carried by those present that we will maintain an immigration policy 'wholly non-discriminatory on grounds of race, colour, creed or origin'. This commitment reflects the strong belief that people should be judged on individual worth and merit, on character, behaviour and achievement and not on ethnicity, religion or skin colour. Unfortunately, there are some who do not share this belief; and I state again that the views of such people need to be vigorously challenged and utterly rejected. Unlike most countries, Australia has a formal immigration policy which covers a wide variety of entrants, ranging from tourists to refugees to family members to permanent settlers, to name just a few. The number of applications for entry into Australia is huge. In 1996-97, there were over 31f2 million applications, of which only 157,000 were applications for permanent residence. To administer this policy, we have a substantial bureaucracy, a wide range of laws and regulations and a body of policy guidelines for the department. The bureaucracy is expected to apply all of these in making its decisions on visa applications. For a very considerable period of time in Australia's past, migration decisions were essentially bureaucratic decisions made without the constraints of formal appeal processes. Throughout the 1980s, however, avenues of appeal against immigration decisions through both the courts and administrative tribunals were progressively opened up. However, the evolving appeal system-and I think there is agreement on this-was not without its problems. Despite several attempts at reform by the previous administration, on coming to government the coalition inherited a system which was deficient in a number of respects. The system showed signs of being inefficient and excessively bureaucratic, providing multiple layers of appeal which caused long delays in the processing of applications and imposed unnecessary costs upon the Australian community. It is also fair to say that it is seen as a system which opens up the immigration program to the possibility of abuse by some at the expense of legitimate migration applicants. It is important for the continued success of Australia's immigration program and for public confidence in the program that these problems be addressed. It is also important that we keep the issue in context. We get 31/2 million visa applications a year. In 1995-96, only about 10.000 decisions were actually appealed. Taken as a proportion of total applications, and despite the fact that a number of these applications are non-appealable, the actual appeal rate was less than 0.3 per cent. We also need to maintain a perspective on the dimensions of the abuse of the immigration program. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs estimates that the number of illegal immigrants in Australia runs at around 45,000 at the present time. Estimates for illegal immigrants in other countries, although not completely reliable, indicate the magnitude of the problem elsewhere. The USA has a gross of two million illegal entrants annually, and a stock of illegal immigrants numbering between three and five million. The ILO estimated that in 1991 Italy had 600,000 illegal immigrants, and current estimates are that Italy has about two million illegal immigrants. The estimate of the number of illegal workers-as opposed to illegal migrants-in Malaysia is 500,000 and in Thailand it is 590,000. We need to recognise the magnitude of the issue and we need to address the deficiencies of Australia's immigration appeals process. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997 seeks to do this by reducing duplication and improving procedural consistency in the reviews of immigration decisions, maximising the independent review tribunals' speed and efficiency and addressing the increased number of immigration appeals to the courts. The bill reduces duplication by streamlining the merits assessment procedure for nonrefugee applications. At present such applications are initially decided by the department, are internally reviewable by the Migration Internal Review Office, MIRO, and then externally reviewable by the independent Immigration Review Tribunal, the IRT. In some circumstances these decisions can also be appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and to the courts. The new arrangements will merge MIRO with the IRT to form a single independent review body to be known as the Migration Review Tribunal. This change will streamline the review process and make the reviews of all immigration decisions consistent with the processes currently operating in the area of refugee applications. Anyone currently able to seek a review by MIRO or the IRT will be able to seek a review of that decision by the MRT. In addition, as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) pointed out in his second reading speech, the bill also includes safeguards for applicants by introducing a code of procedure for both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. This code includes the giving of a prescribed notice of the time for a hearing and a requirement that applicants be given access to and time to comment on adverse material. It is important to note that creating the MRT of itself will almost inevitably increase the number of cases considered by the independent tribunals. The fact is that MIRO deals with about 5,000 appeals a year, and such appeals will now be taken directly to the MRT. The bill also proposes changes designed to improve the speed and efficiency of the independent review tribunals. In its present form, the bill seeks to achieve this by providing that a tribunal can be reconstituted where the principal member thinks that this will assist the efficient conduct of the review; repealing the existing provision giving applicants the right to a personal appearance before either tribunal; and requiring that the tribunal should, so far as practicable, comply with the directions of the principal member. Speed and efficiency in the review process are vital, and the above mentioned mechanisms further them. However, the government regards it as fundamental that the possibility of unintended negative consequences be avoided, and I understand that it will be moving amendments to achieve this. The existing provisions in the bill regarding personal appearances raise the possibility that the tribunal may not always grant a personal appearance to an applicant, even where such an appearance could be appropriate. It is my understanding that no express right exists in the Australian common law, statute law or the constitution for a person to be present at court or tribunal proceedings which affect them. The rules of evidence, procedural fairness and the procedural rules of the courts do, however, provide a clear presumption that justice must not be administered behind closed doors. Further, there is a body of opinion which would hold that excluding a party to a matter being considered by an administrative law tribunal, as permitted by this bill in its unamended form, may result in the denial of natural justice because the person concerned may lose the opportunity to make submissions and answer adverse allegations. I believe that the parliament should be reluctant to legislate for such an outcome and that the expected government amendments guaranteeing the right of applicants to present their case in person before the tribunals, subject to some appropriate restrictions, will enhance the bill. With respect to the reconstitution of tribunals, at the direction of the principal member a reconstitution could take place at any stage prior to the recording of a formal decision. The fact is that this might be construed as giving the principal member the ability to compromise a fair hearing. Although it is highly unlikely that such a possibility would become a reality, we should be very cautious about creating such potential. Such a perception could undoubtedly be corrected by a requirement that the principal member consult with other members of the tribunal and that time limits be put in place, prior to which no reconstitution could take place. I understand that the amendments to be moved by the government do achieve this. Administrative review tribunals such as the MRT and the RRT occupy a finely balanced position in the Australian politico-legal system. They are given the decision making powers and responsibilities of the executive arm of government. Indeed, they are often organisationally located within the executive. At the same time, however, they are required to review the decisions of the executive, within the confines of legislation but with a degree of independence from the executive approaching that enjoyed by the courts. In these circumstances, I think it is fair to say that the relationship between the tribunals and the government of the day can become a little complex. Under the current Migration Act 1958, the IRT and the RRT are required to apply the Migration Act and the migration regulations to the specific cases which come before them. They are also required to follow government policy, as laid out in ministerial directions made under section 499 of the Migration Act and tabled in both houses of the parliament. They are not, however, required to follow the bureaucratic rules of thumb which guide much of the department's internal decision making. This distinction between binding and nonbinding influence on the tribunal is very important. A good example of the distinction-and I think this is something that most of us come across in the course of our electorate duties-relates to an Australian citizen's sponsorship of a relative's application to migrate to Australia. According to the migration regulations, for Australian citizens to be eligible as sponsors, they must be both 'resident' in Australia and be 'settled'; that is, 'lawfully resident in Australia for a reasonable period'. The departmental guidelines state, 'Under policy, two years is considered to be a reasonable period.' But is an Australian citizen considered to be reasonably settled if they have lived overseas for a period of time and returned to Australia and lived here for 18 months, bought a house, transferred their assets and property to Australia and established a business here again? In this case, as in others, the legislation gives decision makers a degree of discretion. It is essential that review tribunals are free to exercise such a discretion, having regard to the specific facts of the particular case which is before them. This is supported by a strong legal precedent in Drake's case, where Justices Bowen and Deane held: The Tribunal is not, in the absence of specific statutory provision, entitled to abdicate its function of determining whether the decision made was, on the material before the Tribunal, the correct or preferable one, in favour of a function of merely determining whether the decision made conformed with whatever the relevant government policy might be. I was concerned that the provisions in this bill relating to the directions made by principal members could be used for the purpose of giving policy directions. I have, however, been assured that my concerns are ill founded and that the provisions relate essentially to the administrative processes and practices of the tribunal. The fact is that policy directions are provided for under section 499 of the Migration Act, and they should be properly introduced where they are appropriate. The third significant aspect of the bill is its introduction of measures to deal with the increase in the number of immigration cases being taken to the Federal Court and the High Court. In the early 1980s, the Federal Court was receiving around 30 applications each year to review decisions made under the Migration Act. The former Labor government responded with the Migration Reform Bill 1992. The then minister for immigration, Mr Hand, said this in his second reading speech on the bill: There are people who are intent on bypassing the established categories of entry into this country ... Owing to weaknesses which have been inherent in our migration laws for many years, these people are often successful. Many manage to stay here, even though they do not fall within the specific visa categories, which is the only lawful way to enter and stay in Australia. At the very least, many manage to delay the substantive decision on their case and, as a consequence, their departure, by using the courts to exploit any weaknesses they can find in our immigration law. This must stop. The 1992 act restricted the scope for judicial review of migration decisions to situations where the applicant had pursued all available merits review rights. Furthermore, the possible grounds for judicial review were considerably restricted. That is where I found the comments by the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) highly amusing. The member for Calwell said-and I wrote down what he said-that the further limitation proposed by this bill and by Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) would terminate the ability of people to apply to courts in cases of a denial of natural justice and that this was appalling. Well, in point of fact, in the Migration Reform Act 1992, the then Labor government excluded a number of grounds on which appeals could be made for review. The first one was an appeal based on a denial of natural justice. Other grounds which were excluded were unreasonableness, taking an irrelevant consideration into account, failure to take into account a relevant consideration and bad faith. So the crocodile tears cried by the member for Calwell are absolutely astonishing. We have a former Labor government which substantially restricted the grounds for appeal and that failed to achieve its purposes now saying the very things they excluded as grounds for appeal are things that we are now going to exclude. It would be highly amusing, if it were not so sad. Labor's hope that these measures would reduce the number of migration cases coming before the courts has not been realised. In 1994-95, almost 400 applications were made to the courts in the area of migration law; in 1995-96, this rose to almost 600; and, in 1996-97, it was over 700. The fact is that the changes ushered in by Labor's 1992 reform act had no discernible impact on the trend of increasing recourse to judicial review. It is also important to note that, in November 1992, the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), speaking on behalf of the coalition in the second reading debate on the Migration Reform Bill, highlighted the likelihood of all this when he said: I am disappointed that the government has gone to water in relation to this matter, because the system it seeks to put in place still provides access to a whole host of situations in which judicial review will be able to be obtained. That is a matter of concern to us. Prior to the election, the coalition committed itself to correcting this problem. This bill achieves this by restricting the grounds for judicial review of immigration decisions to the question of whether or not the decision maker was acting within their jurisdiction and power in making their decisions. I believe that this provision will lead to a reduction in the number of immigration cases being appealed to the courts. The Labor Party should be cognisant of the fact, when arguing against this provision, that what they themselves did in 1992 in the pursuit of particular goals and objectives through actions which amounted to a substantial truncation of the rights to appeal did not meet those objectives. I would like to make one other comment before concluding. I would like to thank the minister for his very careful consideration of matters relating to this bill. He put a lot of time and effort into getting them right. I commend the bill to the House and I look forward to the government's amendments.",32
43,Ms HANSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The government's jmmigration policy released prior to the last election contained a promise to review the efficiency of immigration decision making. The policy also stated that access to courts for the review of tribunal decisions should be restricted in all but the most exceptional circumstances. In the case of illegal immigration, the government has been not only too lenient but also all too willing to squander taxpayers' money and far too slow to deport illegal immigrants. There is no obligation by law to provide both an administrative review and a judicial review of applications, so why are you doing it? Why are illegal immigrants and criminals getting legal aid to delay their deportation when thousands of Australians are denied this taxpayer funded privilege? Approximately 60 per cent of administrative cases before the Federal Court concern immigration matters. In the 1995-96 budget, litigation cost the immigration department $7.4 million. This figure did not include legal aid, court costs or the excessive costs of housing and feeding illegal immigrants during lengthy and unnecessary legal processes. This is expenditure you cannot reasonably justify and it is a bill the Australian people do not want. It is an affront to the Australian people that so much time and money is spent expelling from our shores people who, in most cases, are little more than opportunistic invaders taking advantage of our reputation as a soft touch. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, hit the nail on the head when he said in March that too many people are using court action to delay departure. This is an urgent matter requiring not just words but action. The Australian people have had enough. As at 25 March this year, there were over 600 cases of immigration related matters before the Federal Court, the Full Court and the High Court. Many of these matters will be withdrawn before the hearing, and only about 10 per cent of cases that go before the court are successful. I repeat: we cannot afford the luxury of providing illegal immigrants-those who sneak across our northern borders-with unlimited legal aid and assistance when our own people go without. In a recent case involving illegal immigrants arriving by boat, our government provided legal aid to these criminals to resist deportation through the Federal Court, the Full Bench of the Federal Court and the High Court-without success at any stage. What an unwarranted, inexcusable and disgraceful waste of the hard-earned money of decent Australians, who expect the government to be more responsible with their taxes. We have seen people delay their departure while seeking work rights and access to Medicare. What sort of lunacy is this when our unemployment is so high and hospitals are stretched to the limit? Perhaps you will excuse your actions by claiming some relationship with humanitarianism. But this nonsense you pursue is nothing but an international invitation to take the Australian people for a ride. As at February this year, over 300 people in our prisons came within deportation provisions. What are you waiting for? How long do we have to feed these foreign criminals for, when so many of our own people are hungry and 40,000 young Australians live on the streets? The answer is to tighten up the system immediately, stop all the rorting, the waste of our hard-earned taxes and help restore public confidence in government lunatic. decisions. We should be negotiating treaties with countries to have these criminals deported they can serve their sentences in their home country, instead of in the luxury of Australian prisons, where it costs $40,000 to $65,000 prisoner per year. You and the governments before you have been extremely successful signing deals that export Australian jobs. us see if you can get it together to export other countries' criminals to their place ongm. The government needs, firstly, to act mediately to stop foreign criminals entering Australia in the first place and, secondly, to provide a quick and a cheap means of deporting foreign criminals should they manage to waltz through the gap in your security arrangements. These criminals should not get legal representation unless they for it. They should not be treated like wellsaid. meaning tourists who have lost their way. They must be treated like the criminals they are. It is incumbent on you to ensure that respect anyone entering Australia is a decent, lawthey abiding person who will in some way benefit those who are already here. If they are not some way going to benefit Australia and called racist. Australians, then we do not want them. Australians are sick of being the world's soft touch. Australians are sick of imported lems-be they crime, disease or aspects of cultural difference that will never be able accept the Australian way of life. It is not for us to change, but for them assimilate. We do not want Australia become like the places so many people want to leave. So listen to the people and take heed. Fix these problems now or the people will take your positions and give them to those who truly represent Australia. On many occasions I have been called a racist. The fact is that I am a patriotic tralian who believes in Australia and the Australian people. I want to see our unemback ployment queues dwindle down to what they should be and give Australians the jobs first, stop instead of allowing other people onto Australia's shores. It is just senseless and People should have a knowledge of how to other speak English. They must know how to so assimilate. They must respect our laws, our flag and what Australia stands for. We must take heed of which people we are going to per allow onto our shores. We do not allow in people who have diseases and we do not at allow in people who have criminal records. Let We must have people who have something to offer Australia. We do not bring in people of with health problems who are going to put such a strain on our hospital system when our imown Australians cannot access our hospitals from because they are overflowing. We have a country that so many people want to come and live in. Yet we seem to be bending over backwards to change our ways, our values and what we believe into accommodate these people. The member for Kalpay goorlie (Mr Campbell) was right in what he Go and ask some of these other countries what their immigration policies are and what their beliefs are. No-one seems to point the finger at them and call them racist. We their views, their cultures and the way want to run their countries. Yet, because I and many other Australians believe in the in same rights for our own country, we are Patriotism is something that we are losing in this country. It is not being taught in our probschools to our children. We must be proud Australians and we must all be Australians to together. Immigrants come to Australia for a better way of life. Why else would they leave to their own country? That is why we must all to be Australians together. The Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) accused me and my views of affecting trade, yet he made a statement in this House last week saying that was trade up by over $100 billion. I call on the government to please address the immigration issues of this country. AusPeople who do not and should not have a rightful place in this country should be sent immediately, at no cost to the Australian taxpayer. If these people can afford to pay their own way back, then they should be paying for it. People are going through the legal system to come to Australia. They should be the ones who are considered first and foremost for being allowed to come to Australia, not those who enter our shores illegally. I believe with this bill the government is actually tightening up a lot of areas. It is not the end, but it start and it is pleasing to see.",40
44,Mr BILSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I start by sharing my perspective on patriotism. I thought a patriot was someone who fought for their country, its people and its interests, not against them. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) hit the nail on the head when he said in the second reading speech for the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997 that the coalition faced a big problem when it came to government. In March 1996, we indicated the commencement of a program to restore credibility in Australia's migration program. Under Labor, the program lost its way. The community had lost confidence in the integrity of the immigration program. Examples of unexplained massive growth in categories of the program, exploitation of the processes, incredible claims being made by applicants seeking to meet eligibility criteria and the out and out rorting of the program fed the public's perception of a lack of confidence and competence in Labor's handling of immigration. I would like to touch briefly on the disquiet being generated within our community about immigration. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) appeals to her people through empty sloganistic rhetoric that may ring true with some people, but that has little meaning and contribution to public debate. Her words can mean whatever the listener wants them to mean. When the member for Oxley calls upon the balance to be restored, it is almost impossible to argue against such a motherhood statement because you know little about the sort of equilibrium she is talking about or how it might be achieved. This 'Coke is it' advertising language, which allows 'it' to be whatever you want it to be, is no substitute for good, sound, solid public policy. The member for Oxley is not alone in this place in contributing to the community disquiet about immigration. Those who witnessed or heard the hysterical rantings of the likes of the member for CalweII (Dr is a Theophanous) earlier in the day would know they are equally divisive. Both can be accused of seeking to be controversial, selective and, at times, ignorant of the facts and of playing to their constituencies. This approach does nothing to promote and pursue Australia's national interest. The government, by moving an amendment during the consideration in detail stage of the debate on this bill, will seek to delete schedule 4, which deals with judicial review, and will reintroduce that as a separate bill. Therefore, the main focus of the bill before the House is the proposed creation of the Migration Review Tribunal to replace bodies like the Migration Internal Review Office and the Immigration Review Tribunal. I understand that the opposition is broadly supportive of these changes, although you would have found it hard to detect that listening to the member for Calwell. It is essential that procedural fairness continues, but it is also incumbent upon the appellate that the tribunals and the tribunal members be more effective and efficient. Before I examine in detail the bill's provisions I would like to state a few facts, as I see them. Firstly, most migrants to Australia have made a fantastic contribution to our shared set of values such as a belief that hard work has its own rewards, that the pen is mightier than the sword, that politics can be more useful than having a stoush out on the playing field and that Australian democracy relies on a continuation of tolerant attitudes between settler arrivals from different nations as well as a recognition that these settlers have rights and responsibilities to work with and contribute to the country. I would suggest that the coalition government has made the most substantive contribution in building confidence in the migration program and allowing the migrant community to feel confident and comfortable about its place and its contribution to this country. We have increased the importance of English language skills in the application process for some concessional categories to ensure that applicants that come to this country can function, can contribute, can participate in this nation and make a very worthwhile contribution to the development of opportunities for all Australians. We also have the two-year onshore probationary period for onshore spouse applicants. That has been extended to people who make migration applications outside of Australia. These sorts of constructive, tangible changes are addressing the sorts of problems the member for Oxley and others are talking about but not doing a lot about. The government is actually tackling these issues which are widely known and widely despised as issues that corrupt the integrity of the migration program. To the minister's credit and the government's credit something is actually being done about these things. The government now requires a one-year cohabitation period for de facto relationships before they can qualify on that ground for migration. The minister has cancelled visas for criminals serving sentences or on parole in Australia and stopped them from being able to appeal against that decision. Action is happening. It is ignorant to suggest that the known deficiencies of the migration program are not being addressed by this government. New Zealand and the United Kingdom, each at around 12 per cent, remained the two largest sources of settler arrivals in the first half of 1996-97. While China was third, this shows that emigration from traditional sources remains very important. Changes in the migration program have not been taken lightly. I have already talked about some of the rock solid evidence the coalition government is giving to all Australians about how it is seeking to improve the program. These are driven by an acceptance by the vast majority of Australians that a sensible, well-managed, well-targeted migration system has benefits for this nation and its people. We are not responding to the noisy minorities like the lawyers picnic we saw under Labor for boat people detained at Port Hedland and Darwin. We are not going through knee-jerk decisions like the then Prime Minister Hawke did to grant virtually instant residency to thousands of Chinese as a reaction to a disturbing international event. That decision led to a large wave of family migration, without much discussion by the Australian people as to whether this was good public policy and whether other events internationally warranted similar treatment. The Dunkley community's largest source of migration is from the United Kingdom and Ireland, and it has been that way for some time. Detailed analysis of the 1996 census will soon be available. In 1991, almost 15,000 people or 13 per cent of the population were born in the UK-double the Australian average. New Zealanders comprise 1.5 per cent of the population. About 1,000 people or two per cent of the community are German and it is the same for the Dutch. Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece each have between 400 and 700 residents originating from these countries who now live in the Dunkley electorate. Lately, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, India have been new sources of migrants. In 1991, a tiny 0.6 per cent of Dunkley's population or one in every 190 people were Asian born. This hardly amounts to a wave. The comparable figure for Australia is now 4.8 per cent and will probably rise to about 7.5 per cent in 30 years time. Again, that is a long way short of claims that Australia's population will soon be overrun by Asians. While maintaining a non-discriminatory immigration program, the coalition government recognises that we have to facilitate more skilled migrants entering the country because these people are the ones who will make Australia more economically wealthy and hence provide more jobs for both our locally born and settler residents. We have some issues to confront about managing the migration program, but as evidenced by the government's decision to conduct an inquiry into the Mornington Peninsula area's settler migrant requirements, these difficulties are being addressed. The government is looking at what these self-help communities can do to help these new settlers in the community I represent and that is to be commended. The point of this bill today is to emphasise that those who seek to rort or to queue jump the migration program will not be tolerated. You only need to talk to those settlers I spoke of in the Dunkley community to find out how riled they are by people who arrive here or come here on a tourist visa and then seek to stay. It is very annoying and frustrating for them, particularly those who have come through the more testing immigration criteria that have recently been introduced. These changes are about saying to those genuine migrants who respect and honour the migration system and the processes in this country, 'There is a way for you to obtain very reasonable access to appeal rights, but do not come here thinking the processes can be rorted for you to stay longer or to stay indefinitely.' We have talked about some of the issues confronting migrants in the electorate of Dunkley. One of them is that there is apparently an increasing number of people from non-English speaking backgrounds who are arriving at the Frankston Community Support and Information Centre looking for material aid. In discussing these sorts of issues with the centre's coordinator, Vicki Martin, we looked at how important it was for sponsors to actually honour the undertakings they have given to the Australian community, and to the applicants, when they came to this country. It appears that some are not taking those sponsorship obligations as seriously as they should, and that is perhaps further evidence that under the former government the sponsorship obligations were very rarely enforced. So there are changes even coming through in our community. It should not be, and it should never be, a part of the Australian ethos that new migrants can arrive and expect to immediately have full access to social security benefits, with exception of refugees. What this is saying to the Australian community is that the choices migrants make about coming to this country have some consequences. One of the tests is that you have to make that contribution; you have to demonstrate your interest in being a part of this community. If you are coming here because of our very generous social security safety net, that'is not necessarily in Australia's best national interests. The coalition has increased to two years the waiting period for many visa categories under the immigration program for access to social security benefits. I do not apologise for this. When I speak with my community they understand that it does represent good public policy. Of course, without the hindrance of the opposition, taxpayers would have saved even more money, and that measure that we went to the election with, and gained support for, could have been more fully implemented. The bill requires the Migration Review Tribunal to conduct fair, impartial and expeditious reviews of migration decisions in a costeffective and efficient manner. Potential migrants will still have the same rights of appeal to the new MRT and the RRT as they enjoy presently. On occasions, unfortunately, I have had constituents coming into my electorate office who ask if I can make representations in support of applications from overseas relatives and the like. One of the great frustrations I have, Mr Deputy Speaker, as probably you do, is that many of them have not read the material that they have been provided with. When I examine the letters sent to them by the present appellate bodies like MIRO and the IRT, I find that the time allowed for an appeal has expired, the steps that were required to lodge an application have not been followed and, even more disturbingly, the grounds on which they seek to apply are very flimsy indeed. One example is a South African gentleman seeking just to visit our country as a tourist, not to stay here. In his application he had actually outlined the fact that he had thrown in his job, had sold his house, had no assets left, had cashed up, and that there was no the reason for him to return. He inferred, during the interview, that if he liked the place he might want to stay. It is a bit difficult for me, as an elected representative, to then go back and persuade our representatives in South Africa that this guy is seriously just coming for a visit and will turn around and go back. The same problem existed with a gentleman in Mornington who, to his and my delight, fell in love. He fell in love with a lady who told our post overseas that the reason she should be given a visitor's visa to visit here was that she was engaged to be married to someone in her town and that she would definitely be going back. It is a bit hard then to argue that she has fallen in love with another man while she has been in Australia, and to argue against all the claims that were made when she secured the initial visitor's visa. These are some of the dilemmas that we, as local members, face. But the most disturbing trend is the number of applicants who are seeking to appeal as a strategic option. They have gone to lawyers and migration advisers who have told them, 'Throw in an appeal. Follow these steps. It will take so long that by the time it is all heard the government will be shamed into enabling you to stay.' This bill seeks to say, 'No, that is not the way we are going to conduct our affairs. If you have made an application to migrate to this country on certain grounds and you have been rejected, there is a ready, affordable and quickly accessible way of having that decision reviewed, but do not view it as a tactical option. Do not view it as a strategy so that you can stay here for a longer period of time, queue jump, dishonour and show disrespect for the nation's migration system and, more particularly, displace migrants who have done the right thing.' I do not think that is unreasonable. The somewhat qualified support that the opposition has given to this bill-although I understand it is less qualified except for the member for Calwell-recognises this fact. It is to be commended on that. When the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs was discussing merits review in a speech to the National Administrative Law Forum in Canberra in May, he noted that it would be wrong to conclude from the government's desire to merge immigration review bodies that there had been any weakening in the government's commitment to review on merits. However, it was simply wrong that people could come here on tourist visas and then use the onshore protection system to obtain work and secure benefits. Not only did this undermine the processing system but it amounted to queue jumping and a profound disrespect for our immigration system. Just ask earlier migrants, and those associated with people who have gone with the system, how fondly they view those who seek to jump the queue. To reduce abuse the government is seeking to minimise the chances of people being able to use lengthy delays in hearing cases as a de facto means of working here. Tribunals will now be able to use telephones or other means of communications to conducl personal hearings or to obtain statements from witnesses. The tribunals will, of course, have to consider in their decision making if the government has altered the balance between the components of the migration program. In 1995-1996, before this coalition government was elected, the planning level for migration was 83,000, The new coalition government lowered the planned 1996-97 intake to 74,000 and turned many of the categories around in their emphasis to say that skills and capacity to contribute to this nation were of prime importance to the migration program. This was not only to reflect the community's concern about relatively high levels of immigration in certain categories but also to recognise that large groups of family migrants who came to Australia were, unfortunately, less able to obtain paid employment over time and were more likely to join the long-term unemployed queues. I will briefly talk about some of the other changes that the government has made. Of course, there is the employer nomination and business skill categories which will seek to address some of the skills shortages. There is the regional program where employers can say, 'I live in a part of the country where I cannot gain access to the skills that I need.' That has also been a change the government has made. The business skills area is paying dividends for Australia. These migrants come to the country willing to start up businesses. Invariably they do, very successfully, employing 3.7 people after 12 months or 4.5 people after two years. Almost four in every five businesses export and each new business skills migrant brings an average of $1.15 million into Australia. This is creating jobs for the people of Dunkley. These are the sorts of changes the government has already made. I applaud the changes the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is making and call on the opposition to be a little more helpful in seeing that they are implemented. While guaranteeing a continuation of fairness for applicants, this bill, together with the bills the minister has ously submitted, restores the integrity of the migration program, which for more than a decade has been politicised by those opposite, severely lowering the community's confidence in it. A cohesive society cannot be brought about by inventing politically correct words or throwing slogans at one another. People in Dunkley have to know that they are involved in the decision making and the government is responsive to their concerns. The large number of expressions of concern the government has received about the size, composition and rorting of the migration program have been taken into account and the government has implemented responsible and thoughtful initiatives as a result of hearing these concerns. The end result of the coalition's changes will be a slightly lower level of immigration, a greater emphasis on skills, a greater test on the intending migrants' capacity to contribute to this country and, above all, procedural fairness that does not replace review processes with tactical options for rorting the system. I commend the bill to the House. I congratulate the minister, the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi), the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) and others for the contribution they have made to this bill and look forward to continuing informed debate about the nation's immigration program.",42
45,Ms GAMBARO,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I would like to thank the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) for that endorsement. With the long-term immigration program it is imperative that we have in place a system that is flexible enough to respond to the changing economic, social and environmental factors in the world but comprehensive enough and stringent enough for the government to deliver that program. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) will have a great impact on that system of delivery and it needs to be highlighted and emphasised. Without controlled, efficient and appropriate mechanisms to manage and implement Australia's immigration program, its overall effect will be costly. There need to be checks previ- and balances in place in order to combat those forces seeking to undermine and exploit Australia's economic potential as a nation and to restore public confidence in the program. The coalition has a very proud history of immigration policies that have contributed to the richness and diversity of Australia as a nation. In a world that is torn apart by wars and divisions, Australia can rightly take pride in its democratic, peaceful and diverse society. We have been a nation of immigrants and we have managed to grow steadily towards the 21 st century as a dynamic, multicultural nation. That is one of the greatest strengths of this country. But all this is threatened by those who seek to abuse and manipulate the migration program in order to colonise or take advantage of this country's enormous potential and opportunity. The government must e.nsure, by the introduction of legislation and administrative measures aimed at regulating immigration controls, that it will be the one setting the migration agenda. Labor left us with this tremendous legacy of an immigration program that was out of control and unbalanced. It grew for three years in a row from 1993 to a figure totalling more than 82,560 persons and was still growing when the coalition assumed office. It was dominated by the family stream, which represented some 70 per cent of the program. It was inadequate in preventing abuse of the migration rules and allowed entry under the skill categories to persons with low skill levels and poor English ability. It served neither the national interest nor the interests of those new arrivals, whether they were genuine migrants or refugees. The fact that the debate over immigration has raged over the last year within the Australian community clearly demonstrates that the migration program did not have widespread support. There are many in the broad community who still believe that immigration is not in the public interest. More and more important, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that if we have a comprehensive, well-controlled, long-term immigration policy in place the benefits to Australia in its economic and social future will be enormous, as they were in the past, particularly in a society with such a rapidly ageing population. There are some myths that do need to be highlighted. One of them is the area of the skilled migrant category. Recent longitudinal surveys have found that, within two years of arrival in Australia, a new business migrant invests in a business an average of $393,000 and employs on average some 5.1 other people and is involved in 60 per cent of the exports of this country. One of the most important steps towards setting the proper agenda for the government through this bill is that it aims to reduce the abuse of the current system and cut down on the cost to the taxpayer to manage and control these delays. This will allow people with bona fide applications to be given a decision more quickly and much more equitably than in the past. Streamlining the program will not only mean tailoring of the needs of the intake criteria but also help to meet Australia's economic, environmental and social needs. One of the biggest bottlenecks and areas for abuse and exploitation at the moment is the merits and judicial review system. Over the last five years the cost and productivity of the present program demonstrate this perception of a program that has been allowed to get out of control and has been absolutely unbalanced. In the financial year of 1995-96 the budget for the Immigration Review Tribunal was $7,446,000 while that of the Refugee Review Tribunal was $15,207,000. The two tribunals accounted for 5,666 cases over the same period. The cost of the internal review by the Migration Internal Review Office, MIRO, was $2,854,000. More alarming is that on current predictions, if this trend continues, by the year 1997-98 the estimate is that there will be approximately 910 applications made annually for Federal Court review. Overall, so far in 1996-97, the litigation budget of the Immigration portfolio is in the order of $7.4 million, which does not take into account the cost of legal aid or the cost of running the courts. Protracted delays in finalising the migration and refugee decisions not only clog up the courts and tribunals but they also can have inhumane and inequitable consequences. As well, these delays can be manipulated by individuals as a way to artificialIy extend their stay in order to get privileges such as work rights, Medicare and other abuses of the system. When RRT matters go to the Federal Court, the average duration of the judicial process is now 354 days, while the IRT appeals to the Federal Court are taking an average 488 days to complete. To compound this situation, recourse to the courts is tending upwards. There were 398 cases in 1994, 630 cases in 1995-96 and there have been 574 cases so far in 1996-97. Based on current litigation trends and the estimated output of the IRT and the RRT in 1997-98, it is anticipated that applications to the courts may rise to an expected 780-odd applicants in 1996-97 and over 900 in 1997-98. More significantly, at the present time around 90 per cent of these appeals fail. Future immigration policies therefore need to address these impediments and, at the same time, need to continue to serve both our national interests and our international responsibilities. In anticipation of the government's implementation of a more balanced immigration program, and reflecting these sentiments and ideals, the government is set to streamline the system in the best possible way to ensure that we have a proficient delivery of that particular program. This bilI comprehensively addresses these problems with a three-pronged approach. Firstly, it seeks to limit the number of bodies that are able to review a decision. It merges the current two review bodies for non-refugee visa decisions-the Migration Internal Review Office, MIRO, and the Immigration Review Tribunal, IRT-into a new external review body called the Migration Review Tribunal, MRT. Along with other measures, this will make the tribunals much more flexible and also reduce the scope for abuse. However, Australia's continuing commitment to those seeking asylum on humanitarian or political grounds who meet the definition of a refugee under the refugee convention will still be able to seek the review of their case before the Refugee Review Tribunal. The aim of these bodies will be to deliver a flexible, efficient and cost-effective procedure relevant to their jurisdiction. Secondly, and more radically, the original bill that was introduced brings a new mechanism into the judicial review scheme to streamline this review process. It will achieve this by means of a privative clause. The government removed that from schedule 4 of the current bill and has now introduced it into Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5). This will restrict access to judicial review of a decision by the Federal Court and, to the extent that it will be able, by the High Court in all but the most exceptional circumstances: that is, where a government official or body making a primary decision has done so essentially unconstitutionally outside their jurisdiction or in bad faith. The clause restricts access to judicial review but does so while still preserving an applicant's democratic right of appeal to the IRT, its successor the MRT and the RRT. As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has pointed out, this mechanism will have the practical effect of reducing the cost to the Australian community of successive appeals by non-citizens and of discouraging those seeking to further delay their lawful removal from Australia. Thirdly, as well as other measures to be introduced, there are restrictions on work rights, review application periods and a change in the structure of the review application fees. These will complement the main legislative change to ensure a streamlined program which is democratic, efficient and cost effective in its delivery. The bill also introduces time limits in which one may apply for a review of a decision as well as restricting those who can apply. This will have the effect of ensuring certainty and efficiency in resolving outside issues. Another mechanism to aid in the control of those who are allowed into Australia is the visa cancellation power. A visa may now be cancelled where it was previously granted on the basis of incorrect information. Since being elected to government, the coalition has instituted programs aimed at resolving many of the problems inherited from the previous Labor government. Over the last year the government has moved to identify and eliminate abuse of migration and temporary entry visas and to implement a considerable number of measures to ensure that migration and temporary entry programs work well for business. It has done so while balancing a commitment to its program and policy which is non-discriminatory on the grounds of race, religion, ethnicity and country of origin, at the same time recognising the importance of the family reunion and humanitarian components. It is important at this time to make some comments about some myths that have been raised by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). It is quite interesting that the member for Oxley comes into the House regularly and speaks about our immigration program. The member for Oxley is aware that in the parliamentary system there are a number of committees. On those committees, of which I am a member of some, particularly the Joint Committee on Migration, there are a number of people from the opposition side of the House as well as from the Australian Democrats who contribute and carry out very valuable work. She would be most welcome to join some of those committees instead of speaking about things of which she clearly has a lack of understanding. I would like to mention some of those areas. In her contribution to this debate today she mentioned that migrants bring diseases into the country, which I find absolutely astounding. There is more of a chance of Australians going overseas and bringing diseases back into the country than the other way round. Migrants have, as part of the procedure for entering the country, very stringent health checks, particularly X-rays. They have a considerable number of health checks before they come into the country. Work rights and Medicare were some of the issues she also touched on. As she would be well aware, there is a two-year waiting period now for migrants who arrive in Australia after 4 March 1997. She also spoke about criminals being allowed into the country and how it was our duty to get rid of them. The member for Oxley may not be aware that in the last sitting the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill passed through the House, which dealt with the international transfer of prisoners. I would like to highlight that and bring that to her attention. This government has provided legislation to remove people who have committed a crime in this country and to repatriate them back to their country of origin. For the information of the member for Oxley, the migration committee is also investigating the deportation of people who have been found committing offences in Australia. Yes, the system does need tightening up, but there are some changes being made. Following this inquiry, people who have committed a crime in Australia will be able to ed and they will never be allowed to return to Australia. That inquiry is going on at the moment. It is quite interesting to hear the member for Oxley speak about these things when we have, in fact, introduced the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill in the last sittings. I hope she makes herself familiar with that bill. Unemployment is an important issue that keeps being raised. There is hysteria that somehow immigrants cause unemployment. The migration committee that I was on has just brought out a report titled Working holiday makers: more than tourists. That report dealt with people on working holiday visas, who make a valuable contribution to the tourism of this country. At the moment they are allowed to work for three months in Australia and a number of the jobs that they take on are in harvesting and fruit-picking areas. Nobody here wanted to take those jobs on. There is a real problem, particularly in harvest regions, with Australians not wanting to work in those areas. The working holiday program and the people on working holiday visas play a very valuable role in ensuring that we have our fruit and vegetables harvested-something that was clearly highlighted in that working holiday visa report that I was able to work on. The myths that are peddled are absolutely unbelievable. The member for Oxley should also be aware that our population is actually in decline at the moment. Australia is going to face somewhat of a crisis situation in the year 2041. At the moment our birth rate is declining at an incredible rate. I believe it is 1.8 at the moment, and we should really have a rate of 2.1 per female. This means that by the year 2041 the death rate will exceed the birth rate. We need to address that problem through a balanced immigration program. I congratulate the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on the hard work that he has put into this bill. He has proactively addressed a number of the problems through implementing a number of measures. I know that he will continue to examine those problem areas. I congratulate the minister on his fine work to date. I combe deport- mend the bill to the House.",46
46,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"in reply-I find it almost embarrassing to rise after being praised in such glowing terms. I thank the honourable member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro). I congratulate the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) on his new responsibilities and I welcome him to the task. I served a time as shadow minister for immigration in earlier parliaments and had the pleasure of developing a very close and, I think, effective working relationship with those who I can now call my predecessors as ministersSenator Ray and Gerry Hand. We accorded them cooperation to ensure that the Migration Act was capable of achieving the government's objective. On very few occasions did we dissent. In relation to some major reforms of the Migration Act, there were two amendments for which I think I can claim some credit in my discussions with Senator Ray. The major bill and the major reform in migration law were achieved cooperatively. Likewise, I can recall only one occasion when there was a disallowance of regulations. I have not had that pleasure yet. Largely, regulations go through in a cooperative spirit. I look forward to having a dialogue with the shadow minister, when I can explain the nature of the changes that we are intent on pursuing, and to achieving a cooperative outcome where we can. I would also like to thank the large number of honourable members who have participated in this debate today. In addition to the honourable member for Batman, I thank the members for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), CalweII (Dr Theophanous), Griffith (Mr MCDougall), Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), Dunkley (Mr Billson), Petrie, Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and Oxley (Ms Hanson). I welcome their contributions. I think it is important to have a debate at times and to listen to what is being said. While I was not here for all of those who spoke, I have listened very carefully to what has been said. I hope that those who are not here for this part of the reply, which is part of the dialogue that occurs in these matters, are listening in another place to what I have to say. I hope they listened well to the member for Petrie, who in her comments brought out the need for some care in the way in which people contribute to debate in this area. It is important to have the dialogue, because sometimes remarks may not be made with a deliberate intention to mislead. Perhaps people are genuinely innocent when they misstate some propositions over and over again. I would like to think that the debate in the parliament can produce an outcome where people who are perhaps in ignorance of the way in which some of these issues are dealt with can become better informed and contribute more appropriately to the debate. In that spirit I welcome the constructive dialogue we have had on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997. I hope that when I have an opportunity to talk to the shadow minister about what we are seeking to do through the privative clause we may be able to come to some accommodation. I certainly have no objection to there being a review to bring out some of the facts. If that is going to be done through a Senate committee, so be it. That does not unduly trouble me. That is one of the reasons I have agreed to the separation of this issue from the other matters-so that we can proceed with them. I would encourage the honourable member to again read the speech of the honourable member for Kooyong. He pointed out some of the problems that Gerry Hand in particular had with the issue of judicial review, particularly in refugee decisions. One of the things the honourable member for Oxley said that is in fact correct is that if you look at the international convention in relation to refugees and the various covenants and other documentation associated with it, there is an expectation that you will not only consider people's claims and you will not refuse people who are entitled to protection. That is an obligation that we accept and one which I am strongly committed to. There is an obligation to provide review, but there is no obligation to provide review both of an administrative character and in relation to providing additional access to the courts. The obligation is to provide one or the other but not both. One of the difficulties that we experience in this area-I think the only other area that has been likened to it is the area in relation to tax decisions-is that generally speaking when people access judicial review or administrative review they do not achieve their immediate outcome. If you go to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal seeking a pension, it is rejected and you take it on appeal, you do not get paid a pension in the meantime; you wait until the appeal is dealt with. But what if your principal intention is to enter Australia and work here temporarily-in other words, if people are seeking to access Australia merely as a guest worker? I have to say the people who lodge asylum claims or who use the appeal system are very often people whose principal intention is to be a guest worker, who has permission to work. We made some changes to that recently, with the cooperation of the opposition. They know they should make application immediately they come in the door; if they can delay the determination of decisions in relation to their status they can achieve what is in fact their principal objective-the objective of being here and being able to work for a period of time. I suspect that that is why the courts themselves are the subject of a great deal of abuse; abuse which is exemplified by the fact that large numbers of people lodge applications with the Federal Court and, at the end of the day, do not pursue them. They withdraw at a point in time when they realise the game is up. But that can sometimes be a year or so down the track when the objective of being here and in the work force has been achieved. I make these points because there are some important objectives that we are seeking to achieve. They are not to deny refugees refugee status. If a person has a well-founded fear of persecution I expect my department to be able to identify that in the first instance. I know there are cases in which there can sometimes be some argument. There can be some marginal cases. I do not think there are all that many, but I expect that through an independent merits review process, through the Refugee Review Tribunal, those people will be properly identified. But to go beyond that with a series of further applications which can often be pressed can, in my view, be very much the subject of abuse. I want to take the opportunity to deal with several matters that arose out of the discussion. I will not reply to all the points that have been made by honourable members, but I do want to say in relation to the matters that will be the subject of government amendments that I will propose that these matters were raised with me by the honourable member for Kooyong. The amendments were developed during the recess as a result of the points that were made by the honourable member for Kooyong. Well meaning though it may have been, I have to say the member for Calwell did not speak to me about it. I have to say that the honourable member for Batman's predecessor spoke to me about one issue; that is, the issue of separating out the privative clause, on which we reached agreement. Mr Martin Ferguson-The member for Calwell and the member for Kooyong often speak together.",49
47,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"If the member for Kooyong wants to share the credit with the member for Calwell, he may do so. But I have to say it was all his work. There were some suggestions that there may be dangers in allowing the principal member to reconstitute cases. What we have sought to do is point out the circumstances in which the principal member will be involved in reconstituting cases and provide a system of consultation in relation to those. The purpose-and there is a purpose involved in this-is to ensure that if a member cannot for some reason deal with a case-it might be because of the complexities of the issue, it might because of the capacity of the member; a whole lot of issues can lead to very lengthy delay-the matter is not delayed. It was pointed out that simply giving the principal member the power to deconstitute a member may itself, in certain circumstances, be open to abuse. I recognise that. Therefore, we sought to identify the sorts of circumstances in which it may be appropriate for this to happen and establish a consultative method by which the principal member would have to consult with the senior member in each state or the deputy and with the member concerned. In other words, this sort of issue should not arise because the principal member would go to the person concerned and say, 'Look, there's a problem here. We've identified that this matter is not being dealt with. Row can we see it through?' I imagine just the fact that there is a power there will be enough in itself to ensure that the sorts of problems that I have been concerned about will not arise. Similarly, in relation to the need for guidelines as to when matters can be dealt with without a hearing, we have essentially sought to ensure that it relates to those circumstances. I must say I am still of the view that there ought to be a wider range of circumstances. But, recognising there were some concerns, I have not pressed that I have to say that. Nevertheless, these are very minimal provisions that deal with situations where a person is deliberately not cooperating with the hearing of a matter. If the person wants the hearing, they will have the hearing, but it has to be in the context of cooperating with ensuring that it is able to occur. The other matter that I want to deal with in the few moments remaining to me relates to the comments made by the honourable member for Batman about the government's antiracism campaign. I will have some things to say about this matter from time to time. I have made it clear that at the moment I am looking at a number of submissions in relation to the way in which we will undertake the market research for the campaign. There is a wealth of material available about racism. There is a wealth of material available about community attitudes to these sorts of issues. But there is not a wealth of material-in fact, there is a dearth of experience everywhere in the world-about how you can shift public opinion on these issues. We have to be in a position, in this campaign, to do something that has really not been tried effectively anywhere in the world. I know there are some people who will not be happy unless you go out and essentially identify those who are racists and give them a whacking big thump. But the fact is that all of the experience that we have had with campaigns to date and all of the consultations that we undertook suggested that any campaign that involved going out there and essentially trying to thrash people for being racists would not achieve its objective. In fact, it would be totally counterproductive. I do not want to waste money by putting in place a program that is not going to achieve its objective. That is the only response I can offer. I know there are people who feel so hurt by a lot of what has been said and what has been done that they want to know that the government is out there with them and supporting them; and it is only when somebody is being thumped that they feel there is something happening. I know that is what they feel, and I know how hurt they feel. But I have to say that spending the money in that way would be totally counterproductive. Some other comments have been made about the immigration program. I dealt with those earlier in relation to some of the observations made by the member for Oxley. We have now produced a document-and I think it is a very worthy document-entitled 'Dispelling myths about immigration'. It is part of a fact sheet arrangement which has been put together by my department to deal with many of the myths that are propagated. I noticed that the member for Petrie was using some of this information. I want to ensure that these matters are debated in a sound and sensible way. I welcome the comments by the honourable member for Batman in his opening remarks which recognised that there can be areas in which there may be disagreement, particularly the size of the program and some of the compositional issues. I do not apologise for that. I think that is an appropriate area in which we ought to be able to have dialogue. But when it comes to this blatant misrepresentation in relation to health issues, in relation to people's criminal propensity, let us focus on what the facts are. Sure, there are some shortcomings in dealing with character issues. I have identified some of those and I hope that, with regard to the amendments that will be brought forward during this session, the opposition will accord the legislation priority status. We will try to get it in so that we can deal with those people of concern who may get through the system inadvertently. I think that is a gap that needs to be addressed and I will be bringing forward very positive proposals to deal with those sorts of questions. I conclude my remarks by saying that I welcome the very positive contributions from my many colleagues who spoke. They reflected a very significant and welcome level of understanding of the complexity of some of these issues, and some of the problems of abuse that we are endeavouring to deal with. I welcome the shadow minister's offer of cooperation in these matters. I extend to him, as I have done personally, an offer to ensure that on these questions we are not debating non-issues; if there are real questions, they can be brought out into the open. Any factual information that you need can be made readily available to you. I will be proposing some amendments which I foreshadowed earlier. I have an explanatory memorandum to table in relation to them and I will have some comments to make when we move to the consideration in detail stage. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",51

Honourable members will recall that this bill seeks to amend the Migration Act to implement a number of the government's important policy initiatives within the immigration and multicultural affairs portfolio, particularly in relation to merits and judicial review. The reforms in relation to merits review set the framework for reductions in both the time and cost of reviewing migration, visa and onshore refugee decisions. The government is putting forward amendments which will modify the proposed reforms in two areas and provide additional flexibility for the Refugee Review Tribunal in a third area. The reforms in the bill introduced on 25 June 1997 include power for the principal member of both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal to reconstitute a tribunal for a particular review. This would be done where the principal member believes it is necessary to do so for more efficient conduct of the review. The bill also provides each tribunal with discretion to determine whether a personal appearance by the review applicant would assist the tribunal's review of the case. Both of these reforms are aimed at enhancing the tribunals' ability to reduce delays in finalising reviews. Concerns have been raised that the principal members' reconstitution powers, which are proposed exclusively as an efficiency measure, could be used to influence the outcome of particular cases. In response, the government has decided to place qualifications on when these powers may be used. The government is proposing amendments which will require the principal member to consult with the member or members constituting the tribunal and a senior member of the tribunal before a reconstitution direction may be made. Following these consultations, the principal member will be able to make a direction only if he or she is satisfied that there is insufficient material before the tribunal for it to make a decision, or if a prescribed time has elapsed since the tribunal was constituted for that review. Under existing legislation, review applicants are entitled to an opportunity to appear before the Immigration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal in most circumstances. The government has been sensitive to concerns that this right will no longer exist. We are responding by introducing amendments which will retain this right but with limited qualifications. The amendments provide that applicants will be invited to appear before the tribunal unless a decision favourable to the applicant may be made on the papers, or an applicant consents to the review proceeding without an appearance, or the applicant fails to respond to the tribunal's invitation to provide additional material or comments. This may result in some loss of productivity gains expected in the tribunals, and consequently it may take a longer time to finalise cases. However, the government expects these to be minimised through the principal members using their enhanced powers to introduce more efficient review procedures. The amendments to the bill also include changes to align the minister's power to appoint persons to act in a senior office of the Refugee Review Tribunal with the existing equivalent power in relation to acting appointments in the Immigration Review Tribunal and the power proposed in the Immigration Review Tribunal. This will allow the minister to appoint persons to act as senior members of the Refugee Review Tribunal for a period of up to 12 months. Finally, as honourable members are aware, the government earlier today introduced into this chamber Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5) 1997. It provides for the introduction of a new judicial review scheme for decisions under the Migration Act relating to the ability of non-citizens to enter and remain in Australia. As this scheme is currently contained in schedule 4 of the bill which we are considering, an amendment is required to excise this schedule. Together, these bills remain an interrelated package of reforms to review immigration portfolio decisions, and I commend the amendments to the House. In relation to some comments that were made by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou)-which perhaps I should have adverted to earlier-dealing with the directions power of the principal member, let me confirm that that directions power that we are giving in the bill that is before us is only for administrative purposes. It cannot be used on merit related issues. The only person who can give policy directions within the law-and that is subject to the act of regulations-is the minister under section 499. I am not suggesting that I might not give some wider direction. That might well be the case. But I am obliged to table that in the parliament, and I am subject to parliamentary scrutiny in relation to that. The principal member is not involved in the process of determining the way in which individual members deal with merit related issues. I am not envisaging that there should be any change in relation to that.",53
49,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"To a large extent the amendments moved by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) not only take up the issues raised by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) but, dare I say, also those of the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). It is almost as if we have a unity ticket on both sides of the House with respect to some of these issues. Prior to this matter coming before the House, there were discussions between the government and the opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), with respect to these issues. There is one issue that I would like to raise with respect to amendments Nos 5 and 11. Before I go to that, I will respond to some of the issues raised by the minister today in response to the debate. I would also like to compliment the honourable member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) on her contribution today. I think it was exceptionally important that a constructive and detailed response be made to some of the issues raised during the course of the debate with respect to what I regard as very important but also extremely sensitive issues. At the outset today I referred to a speech made by the President of the United States when he visited Australia in November of last year. To a large extent his words did not fall on deaf ears. They were words that were welcomed and respected by the majority of Australians. It would seem to me from the contribution of the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) today that, while she enjoyed attending the luncheon provided free of charge by the government when the President of the United States visited Australia, she chose to ignore the comments that he made with respect to the nature of Australia and what a great nation it is. For that reason-and I hope she is listening-I would again refer to the manner in which Mr Clinton marvelled at our success as a nation when he said, 'I cannot think of a better place in the entire world, a more shining example of how people can come together as one nation and one community.' We have a wonderful reputation, and a reputation that a clear majority of members of this House will work together to maintain. Although there will be differences between the government and the opposition from time to time, it is a very important policy for Australia not only to maintain but also, when circumstances permit, to expand in years to come. I am talking about the population needs of Australia. Australia is a marvel. It is a great nation, but it has also a greater capacity to further develop in years to come. In that context, I welcome the opportunity provided by the minister for further discussions as required on what are now our joint responsibilities. Clearly, from time to time there will be differences. It is also fair to say that from time to time there are differences on these issues on his side of the House in the same way in which there are differences on our side of the House with respect to these matters. That is not to suggest that either party is going to be obstructive; there will be genuine differences. It is about developing a balanced program that represents the needs and aspirations of all Australians. There will be a debate about the size of the population intake from overseas from time to time, and a debate about the composition, but I will tell you what there will not be a debate about: the myths that exist with respect to most of these issues between the government and the opposition. For that reason, as I said at the outset, the honourable member for Petrie is to be commended. I object to some of the myths raised in the debate today by the honourable member for Oxley. In doing so, I would like to briet1y refer to our record of achievement as a nation with respect to these issues. I quote from the documentation released by the government in recent days, 'Dispelling the myths about immigration'. On page 1 it says: Does immigration really benefit Australia? Australia would not have progressed to its current level of economic and social sophistication without the contribution of migrants. They have brought new ideas and new technology to our industries and business. This is far from the ignorance expressed by some people who participated in the debate today. It continues: They have brought new skills which are not taught, or are in short supply in Australia, expanding the nation's skills base as a result. It then goes on to say: Nevertheless, the Government recognises that there are both costs as well as benefits associated with immigration. That is why the Government considers it is essential that the intake be balanced and targeted in a way which is consistent with our economic, environmental and international objectives. That is the objective, and constructive debate must occur in this parliament; it should not be about myths which are based on ignorance and a lack of understanding of the benefits of population policy in Australia. (Extension of time granted) It then goes on to suggest: This must be achieved within the Government's over-riding commitment to an immigration policyand I hope the member for Oxley is listeningthat does not discriminate on the grounds of race, religion, colour, sex or country of birth. For that very reason I again prompt the minister. The debate in the House today suggests that, no, we are not about thumping people over the head, trying to develop a sense of political correctness in Australia. But there is an obligation on the government to promote debate based on the facts so as to ensure that we dispel the myths once and for alI. That effectively means that you ought to take up, with some urgency, the issues that I raised today in my initial contribution going to the question of the anti-racism campaign that your government has promised the community. Simplistic slogans and pointing the finger by a minority in the community, at the time of a lack of security in people's lives, requires leadership at a government level. If you are to dispel those myths and build back into Australian society a sense of security, and on the basis of that sense of security create further opportunities for economic and social development in Australia, then you do not thump people over the head, you take the ball up to them. That effectively means pursuing a balanced and objective anti-racism campaign, based on a proper understanding of the facts, in an endeavour to ensure that we build even greater support into the huge support that currently exists in the Australian community, and into the achievements of our population and immigration policy of years gone by. Mr Deputy Speaker, the amendments before the House, as the minister said, pursue a range of problems with the original drafting which were raised by members on both sides of the House in the course of today's debate. The issue I raise is clearly of some concern to a number of people in the community. It goes to ensuring that, in the case of the principal member acting with respect to the new-found powers, those powers must be and used in a very cautious way. It gives the principal member significant additional powers, but I think there is an obligation ensure that the principal member is not only cautious, but that, in exercising those powers, he or she is sensitive in the exercise of powers. The person with these new-found responsibilities must go out of his or her way to avoid any undue accusation of interference of any nature. Obviously, from time to time these powers will have to be exercised, but in doing so I also suggest that an endeavour must be made by the principal member to obtain ber agreement of the member or senior member. That must be the objective of the principal member. To do otherwise than to act in such a cautious and sensitive way will potentialsincerity ly-and maybe for the right or wrong readetermined sons-leave the principal member open to accusations of interference without a proper basis. That is the issue that noon. As I said in the course of this final contrianti-racism bution, to a large extent the government has taken up a number of the criticisms and suggested changes proposed by the opposiway tion. The one outstanding issue in my mind at the moment is to ensure that the intent giving the principal member these additional powers will ensure that they are acted on a cautious and sensitive way, and that the principal member goes out of his or her way to ensure that there is agreement with the senior member or the member when these powers are exercised.",55
50,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Berowra-Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) 0.13 p.m.)-If I may, I will take up a matter about which a degree of difference has emerged between the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and myself. Let me make it abundantly clear that what I launched on Friday was a major initiative on behalf of the government dealing with the very questions that he said needed to be dealt withthat is, dispelling the myths about immigration. I have been doing this over many months, I think the arguments are getting through. Since September 1996, I have been ensuring that, when people put their heads up and to make comments about the immigration program which are clearly flawed, those matters are addressed. The reason that the governthose ment-and I on behalf of the governmentlaunched this publication was to do exactly what the member said, that is, address the myths. We are spending money on ensuring that that is done. If the honourable member wants more of those kits for distribution he can let me know; they are available. I am inviting every memto use more of these kits. If I have to go back and do another. print re-run I will do it, because I want to ensure that this information is distributed as widely as possible. Our in relation to this matter will be by how we use the material rather than by the points we try to score about what might be suggested that others are not doing I raise this afteron this matter. Let me make it abundantly clear that the campaign is not intended to dispel the myths about immigration; it is intended to try to shift public opinion in a meaningful about very complex and difficult issues, namely, racial discrimination and racial of vilification. This program was developed by us when we were in opposition to address in some underlying problems without resort to the much more draconian methods that others were proposing ought to be used-namely, criminal sanctions. Our purpose is to ensure that, when this money is spent, it is spent and achieves it objective. The real concern I have had all the way through-and it has becn compounded as I have gone through the exercise of trying to look at how we undertake the market research task-is that the ways and means of doing this could well exacerbate problems if you do not get it right. Mr Georgiou-It is complex.",57
51,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Very complex and very difficult. I thank the honourable member for his observation about it. I am happy to talk to you about the sort of process that I am going through in trying to look at the ways and means of dealing with this issue. I have to say the concern that I have, coming through a number of sessions I have had with market research consultants, is that there are different techniques and different ways of eliciting this information. A lot of what is proposed has been done before and has not been adequate for the purpose. I have to find a way through so that we will make new and meaningful advances in an area in which there is not a great deal of international literature to demonstrate that people have been successful in relation to these matters. I will deal briefly with the final matter. As I said, the honourable member for Kooyong raised these matters with me. The amendment we have is quite precise. It says that the principal member can only deal with these matters if he has consulted with the person who is involved. (Extension of time granted) You cannot give the member who is involved, where there is a concern that he or she has been unable to reach a decision, a veto over whether or not reconstitution can occur. If it is a difficulty that needs to be dealt with, then the matter will come out in the discussions that occur. If it is because the member concerned has had perhaps some difficulties in coming to grips with some complex issues and has been putting matters off-and those things do occur-then I suspect that the consultation in most cases will deal with it. In fact, what I said in the course of the debate is my view. I suspect that simply having the power here may be sufficient. What will happen is that the consultations that do occur and have to involve the principal member and the senior member will work out what the problem is, and people will find a way of ensuring that the difficulty that has perhaps not been talked about but has occasioned reaching the decision is in fact addressed and may bring other people's minds to bear as to how that shall be done. In other words, I do not expect that this power will be used. The member said that it might be used rarely. I suspect that this power, once it is there, will probably never be used, but it will be the basis upon which a member will be able to say, 'We have to consult about this. I do have certain powers; let's work our way through it' - and they will be able to achieve an outcome. But, if there is no power there, he has no capacity to approach somebody to try to deal with that situation. The reason this amendment is there is that the principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal came to me about particular cases that have gone on for numbers of years where decisions were not being reached and where he had no capacity ultimately to be able to deal with those issues. I do not think the principal member should be left in that sort of situation. It is for that reason that we have proposed it in this limited form requiring consultation, requiring discussion and also providing for circumstances which may be seen as exceptional, such as insufficient material before the tribunal on which to reach a decision, which I think is the principal matter that would be offered as a reason why a case may not have been resolved.",58
52,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I think it is now a question of testing the new powers that will be given to the principal member. Obviously from what I and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) have said, we expect these powers to be used in exceptional circumstances. I think it is also the view of this House, from what has been said on both sides, that the principal member ought to be cautious-it is a very sensitive issue-and only exercise these powers in e-treme stances. There is one issue I want to touch on in conclusion. I suppose it goes to a sense of sincerity. Obviously there are myths which in turn create problems of racial discrimination and vilification. On that note I refer to the unanimous decision of the House of Representati ves on 30 October 1996 to adopt a motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in regard to a statement on racial tolerance. From time to time. I suggest that you do need to do market research, but perhaps some people are doing too much market research and not leading. A test of sincerity, as I suppose is now promoted and supported by the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, leading business people across a range of industries and the Premier of Victoria, is whether or not all in this House have sufficient commitment to overcoming racial vilification and discrimination in Australia to make a decision that I do not believe ought to be based on market research and polling but, more importantly, based on what is in the best interests of all Australians. It is about time all political parties represented in the Senate and the House of Representatives resolved that we jointly put Hanson last. No polling-it is a question of sincerity; put up or shut up once and for all.",58
53,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Berowra-Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) 0.23 p.m.)-I thank the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) for his indication that we should allow the provisions to go to see how they operate. I assure him that we will be watching for any possible abuse of that sort. I would not want to see it occur, and I make it abundantly clear. I think the second matter is really an argument for another day. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Ruddock)-by leave-read a third time. circum- CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1997 [No.2] Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 September, on  That the bill be now read a second time.",59
54,Mr ANDREN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 [No.2] typifies the complexity and indeed the inequalities of the tariff reduction regime now in place around the world and demonstrates clearly the unwise path Australia has taken to be first out there onto the level playing field-the world series economic rationalist team from down under. This bill demonstrates the schizophrenia of the current world trade system: it increases the rate of duty from the level playing field free status on imports of certain Canadian petrochemicals in retaliation for Canada extending to several of its developing country trading partners preferential rates of duty on Canadian imports of raw sugar; it looks after the developing economy status of territories administered by the Palestinian Authority by allowing developing country tariff status to those territories; and it slices $55 a tonne off support for our sugar industry long in advance of the timetable set in our trading agreements. If we cannot strike a level playing field arrangement with our Commonwealth of Nations and former empire ally Canada, I respectfully suggest there is precious little chance of achieving the reductions in tariffs from developing nations according to the timetable set out under GAIT and the Uruguay Round. Canada's and, to the same extent, New Zealand's eagerness to disparage our quarantine protection as nothing more than non-tariff barriers show how naive we are in expecting such cooperation from more hostile trading partners. If these are your friends, who needs trading enemies? The removal of the duty on imports of sugar and certain sugar by-products has not, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) suggested, received strong support from the industry for the full implementation of the integrated package of reforms of which this tariff reduction is part. Governments and manufacturers have welcomed the removal of the duty in the name of a competitive industry and access to sugar at world prices. But growers see it as an unnecessary and unsustainable loss of revenue with nothing in return. The member for Kennedy e Mr Katter) so eloquently detailed that argument in this House last night when he argued how our highly efficient industry is being asked to compete on a level playing field against competition that has a 193 per cent subsidy. Again, the hoary old benefit to local consumers is dragged out as an argument-as it was, incidentally, in the argument about motor vehicles. Freezing protection in that industry has now created hundreds more jobs with Toyota's increased investment in the industry. As the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) pointed out in a 90-second statement this week, she does not believe that Australian consumers will complain about shoe and clothing prices if they know they are protecting Australians jobs-nor would they complain about the cost of sugar. While the confectionery and soft drink manufacturers support the removal of the tariff, I might ask: how many of these are Australian owned? The growers ask how you can take millions of dollars straight out of the bottom line of the economy, hit every other industry besides sugar in these sugar growing areas, risk an industry with 45,000 direct and indirect jobs and allow it to be replaced by highly subsidised exports, because that, inexorably, is what will occur. After questioning the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the impact of reducing tariffs on textiles, clothing and footwear and how that might affect regional areas like Lithgow which has just seen the loss of Berlei bra factory due to ever reducing tariffs, I received a copy of a document entitled Trade Liberalisation: how Australia gains from the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer). We all know what a hard working and dedicated trade minister he is, embarking on an exhausting round of trade missions to all points of the compass, and we know he is a passionate disciple of free trade. This document is a fascinating one. It states that trade Iiberalisation has increased the range of imports and made them cheaper for Australian consumers. That is exactly why Berlei is heading to Indonesia and cannot afford to stay in Australia. The imported bras from China, Indonesia and other developing countriesprotected as they are from the level playing field rules-are taking out our jobs by the thousands. We are told the gains from free trade have added an average $1,000 to the annual income of each Australian family. According to economic modeller Chris Murphy, the prospective gain in living standards from the proposed tariff reduction in the automotive industry, which the government thankfully rejected, was about $50 million or 0.02 per cent and that was at a cost of losing 21 per cent of market share and 21,000 automotive jobs. Those jobs would not be soaked up, as the economic modellers would have it, by job gains in other industries elsewhere. I accept the argument that there is no future hiding behind a Fortress Australia mentality forever. I accept the fact we cannot pull up the drawbridge, whether it be for tariffs or for immigration. But we must slow down. We are radically changing the face of the workplace at home while at the same time rapidly dismantling industry protection in the so called interests of a better world down the track. But the electorate are confused; in fact, they are angry. They are looking for alternatives, as I have suggested before, that do not have answers and they are asking plenty of questions. These people are not seeing the benefits. Even those who are not flirting with any other political persuasion are not seeing answers. This is despite the Prime Minister's assertion that we have created 1.8 million jobs in the service industries since 1984 and only 5,000 in the industrial, mining and agriculture sectors. But what sorts of jobs have been created? Financial services generating stock market analysts, screen jockeys and foreign currency dealers-granted, a highly rewarded concentration of wealth generators, but such wealth does not filter down through the labour market-or perhaps tourist industry jobs which are part time and often lowly paid, jobs where two part-time workers are far cheaper to employ than one full-time worker. That might seem okay, but we have a gross underemployment in this country. On top of our 800,000 or thereabouts officially unemployed people, we have a growing number of the working poor. The fact is that one hour a week constitutes employment. The 100 workers at the Lithgow Berlei factory were all, bar one, women. For half of them, their wages were the only income coming into the household. They were a cheap work force in a town battered by the economic rationalist forces of the past 15 years where downsizing, rationalisation. corporatisation and outsourcing-all the catchcries of the textbook economists-had carved their way through this regional city's economy. ADI, Australian Defence Industries, along with the electricity industry in the area are soon to be privati sed, it seems, with more job losses. There have been State Rail jobs and state road jobs lost-the people of Lithgow have seen it all-and now there is the impact of reduced tariffs. Forget the five per cent tariff protection by the year 2008; Berlei Lithgow is unable to compete, so it says, with imports at the current 34 per cent rate of protection. These women are super efficient at what they do. Their product is superb. So superb and so good are their work practices that they were videoed by the company. That video was then used in Indonesia to show the $5 a day workers there how the $80 a day workers in Australia do their job. 'Retrain these local workers,' say the rationalists. I ask you: how and where can we retrain people for the high-tech information industry when their skill base is machining, when they have never worked with a computer, when their education levels at school are school certificate at best and when many are middle aged? Can we really retrain sugar growers, citrus growers or banana producers in the Ord whom I met a month ago? 'Education,' I hear someone say. But this is at a time when we are cutting away the education opportumtJes for the young, the uneducated and the unskilled, let alone the middle aged. What about labour market programs? They have been gutted too. Only the cream are really catered for by the new privati sed labour market system where bounties are paid for training and jobs placement. I argue that there is no room in the new labour force for the women of Berlei Lithgow. They provided captive labour in a captive market on the outskirts of Sydney but across the sandstone curtain from where they could not escape. They were the last pool of local labour for Berlei en route to the Third World. Berlei is a company with fickle community responsibility-like BHP-and with little regard to the support it has been given by the taxpayer over the years. It heads offshore to maximise shareholders' dividends; it is too bad for the work force and the community that had provided that stable and loyal labour for 50 years. No wonder the average worker is questioning both Labor and coalition policy over the past decade and a half. The free traders at any cost might argue that Australia has made commitment in APEC to establish a regime of free trade and investment by 2010. I say, 'Some fool us.' Do we really expect China to hop aboard; do we really believe Malaysia and Indonesia will drop protection for their fledgling car industries? Some say our farmers are the ones who 'will suffer' from a continued tariff regime. They are suffering now. The low protection farm community, the most competitive and efficient in the world, is being played for a sucker by the giants of world trade-the US, the European Union and Japan. Our vertically integrated meat industry is vertically integrated in favour of its mostly foreign ownership. Our most efficiently produced meat derives a return for the farmer no farther than the farm gate, while the processor, wholesaler and retailer make a killing. But most of those are offshore. Only a fraction of that money remains to benefit Australians or, most importantly, the farmer. According to many experts the reason protectionism has flourished for so long is that free trade-although it offers overall benefits, according to these experts-can be detrimental in the short term to some sectors and individuals. This is the 'follow me and all will be revealed' philosophy. The level playing field is just around the corner. Let us exorcise these anti-free trade demons as quickly as possible, so the argument goes. I believe that just around the corner are any number of international muggers. They are laughing at our naivety at being out there on the streets alone so unprotected. For even while we preach the virtues of free trade, our Prime Minister has a bob or two each way. In October last year, he admitted that industry would be entitled to say: We have done our part, we have borne the brunt of reduced protection ... We have engaged in a lot of give-ups, we'd like a few give-ups in return. What about a 'you too' trade policy? The Australian Democrats have called for future tariff cuts to be directly linked with those undertaken by other countries. The government should produce reports comparing Australia's tariff levels with those of other countries. I endorse such a policy as a bare minimum prerequisite for any further consideration of tariff reductions. As we all know, as tariff levels have dropped in recent years, as they have been removed, governments--except ours-have turned to other ways to restrict import competition. The European market is also re-erecting quotas. The US can bung on an abattoir health crisis in this country, if it sees fit, in order to off-load an excess of feedlot beef when grain prices rise. No-one really has the interests of free trade at heart when the advantages are not all their way. And the ultimate object of import replacement-if taken to its logical conclusion-would obviate international trade anyway. People will only trade when there is an absolute advantage their way. There is a lesson in the words of Sir John Crawford in his report to the Fraser government in 1979: ... any general program of tariff reductions should not be implemented while unemployment stays above five per cent. Clearly we should be addressing the domestic problems first. Unemployment not tariff reduction is our No. I and, I would say, our paramount economic problem. To add to the uncertainty and fear of job security is callous in the extreme and also unnecessary because we have met our commitments to date. It is all very well to talk about restructuring and international competitiveness. Berlei restructured, downsized and developed new technologies but, even with 34 per cent protection, it still cannot compete. It has exported not only those 180 jobs at Lithgow but also the technology which it devised and its expertise to Indonesia. Berlei's own senior staff is now training the $5 a day labour force offshore. We are told that open economies are the best for countries that want to export. But that is only in the purest model when everyone is playing the game, which they do not. The international price, unfortunately, is not a neat intersection of supply and demand curves. It is distorted and corrupted by any number of forces worldng against those naive enough to think pure market forces are at work. We are told by the market economists that, all things being equal, market forces will prevail. But the world market is decidedly unequal. We are told that lower protection and restructuring of the industry mean that assistance is needed for employees who are disadvantaged and for new entrants to the work force who may need further training. It means the dole for the workers at Berlei. There is no training in the work for the dole scheme and there are precious little training options left in the labour market programs. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill covers the removal of duty on imports of sugar, gives favoured status to imports from Palestinian territories and penalises Canada for unfair and unlevel playing field behaviour. It covers all the issues. It gives away advantages to our own producers; it assists, perhaps rightly and generously, a country needing a trade leg-up; and it admits, as in the Canadian exercise, that the playing field is not level and never will be whenever a country wants a trading advantage-and that is all the time. The Minister for Trade points to his trade Iiberalisation pamphlet on how Australia gains from tariff reduction and to the fact that the World Trade Organisation is a benevolent institution benignly looking after the interests of all parties in the family of trading nations. As we swallow that, let me quote from some statistics in an article last year by Mr B.A. Santamaria: . . . these policies of deregulation, privatisation, tariff cuts and so on ... have been tried for more than 13 years. They have further enriched the wealthiest 10 per cent of the community ... they have simultaneously created more than one million unemployed ... 25 per cent of young Australians can't even get into the workforce. Meanwhile, during the past decade the real wage of the bottom 10 per cent of wage earners has fallen by 5 per cent. In 1973 a mere 12 point 5 per cent of the population was in receipt of social services. Today it is 23 per cent. We are assured it will all come good in the long term. But as John Maynard Keynes once remarked, ""in the long run we are all dead"". The workers at Berlei Lithgow will be economically dead long before the rest of us. The sugar cane growers are now asked to give up their remaining protection on the altar of a free trade policy that our trade department and Treasury bureaucrats believe in but which has no support out there in the regions where real products are grown, where real goods are made, where some real jobs survive for the moment and where economic theory is treated with the contempt it deserves-a situation the member for Kennedy recognised when he voted with his conscience in this House a few weeks back and gave the sugar tariff removal the thumbs down it deserves. The dilemma facing the National Party was amply illustrated last night in the diametrically opposing views of the member for Kennedy and the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) on this bill. I suspect that there are others on the government back bench caught in a bind but unwilling, unlike the member for Kennedy, to speak out. We have met our international trading obligations however distorted those obligations are. I serve notice that I will be opposing the amendments relating to the removal of customs duty from sugar and certain sugar by-products not because protection is necessarily so sacred but because the alternative-free trade-is by any judgment never likely to be free for a country like Australia caught as it is between the huge economies of scale of the major economies out there and the slave labour pay rates and no workplace controls of the developing economies against which we cannot compete . We have done enough. We must ask our competitors and trading partners to at least catch up before we give any more ground.",59
55,Mr ANTHONY,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I rise today to speak on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 [No.2] and, in particular, on the Commonwealth's decision to remove the tariff. I would like to outline to the House the reasons why the Commonwealth has made the decision, particularly the background to the decision, and the attitudes that were put in place by the sugar industry working review party-attitudes which all members of the parliament who are speaking on this bill should read. I suspect the majority of them have not. I would like to demonstrate to the House the importance of the sugar industry in Australia. There are over 6,500 cane growers in Queensland, 550 in New South Wales, and 22 in the Ord region-a much smaller number. But the real issue is the value of its contribution to the Australian economy. In northern New South Wales, the area I represent, the sugar industry is a $65 million industry directly; the multiplier effect sends it to over $200 million. In Queensland it is a $2 billion industry and the multiplier effect is far greater with a huge number of people employed in the industry, ranging from Rocky Point all the way to north of Cairns. The reason we are having this debate on the tariff is interesting, because the largest sugar producing state, Queensland, which produces 95 per cent of the crop, and its industry leaders, recommended to the Commonwealth that it remove the tariff. That is the key difference from the TCF industries, the automotive industry or other areas where industry groups have been advocating to the government to maintain tariffs. There were 74 recommendations, two of which had Commonwealth implications, and all were approved. There were over 700 submissions which went into this report by the working party that was established by the previous ALP state and federal governments. The key terms of reference were to review the need for the tariff on raw and refined sugar and to review the current legislative arrangements for the promotion and regulation of sugar in Queensland. Further, the review was to be conducted within the terms of national competition policy. National competition policy was established by the Australian Labor Party government. They were the champions of it under the Hilmer reforms. To quote Harry Bonnano, who is a leading identity in the sugar and cane growing industries, when the package was released: The balance of package measures recommended by the working party and now accepted by the Government vindicates canegrowers consistently stated argument that total deregulation would a disastrous effect on a $2 million a year export industry. There were some decisions made within that working party. They wanted to maintain a single desk and they wanted to maintain consignment within the framework of national competition policy. Yes, they had to make some decisions and one of them was the tariff. But let us look at the tariff question, because it is on that which so much of this argument hinges. Unlike what has happened to the automotive industry and potentially what is to happen with the TCF industries, there was no dissenting report by the leaders of the industry in supporting the tariff. When you go through them-whether it was Harry Bonnano; Graham Davies; Tony Gentile; the Commonwealth representative, Mr Newton; Mr O'Riley from the state; or Ron Verri from the Australian Cane Farmers Association-not one of them put in a dissenting report in regard to maintaining the tariff. This was fundamentally different from the review of automobile tariffs by the Productivity Commission. The only person who stepped out of the square there and was an advocate against the Productivity Commission was Ian Webb. Indeed, the whole industry was behind tariff retention. That was not the case with the sugar industry. The whole tariff debate was kicked off a number of years ago by that icon Gough Whitlam, who cut tariffs by 25 per cent, and he was followed by his disciples, Hawke, Keating, Beazley and Crean, in the 13 years of Labor Party stewardship. The fact is that the industry recommended to the government, even though the New South Wales industry was not a party to that group and should have been, that it remove the tariff in order to retain a number of other essential concessions. The other interesting point is that even if the tariff were put back on tomorrow, not just at $37 a tonne but perhaps at $1,000 a tonne, it would make no difference to the domestic price of sugar-a fact which has failed to be recognised by any member of the opposition or any Independent-because a fundamental change has happened to the pricing formula have for sugar. The Queensland Sugar Corporation, which regulates 95 per cent of the sugar produced in Australia-it is the buyer-has changed its pricing formula. That was signed off by Trevor Perrett, the Minister for Primary Industry in Queensland, a number of months ago. The change in the pricing formula means that by changing back from import parity to export parity the tariff will have no effect. To date the tariff has been an artificial inflator of the domestic price of sugar, and with that change in the pricing formula it will have no impact. I would like to quote the Financial Review, which puts the matter fairly succinctly: However, as part of the Queensland Government's acceptance of the report of the Sugar Industry Review, chaired by Mr Bruce Vaughan, the Queensland Sugar Corporation would only pay domestic producers the export parity or world price. This fact alone will remove virtually all of the booty of high domestic prices previously underpinned by the import tari ff. In large part, the tari ff that Labor is now trying to wring political capital out of is irrelevant. So the horse has bolted in that resp-ct. The other issue that the sugar industry has been referring to, and which is important to this debate, is the single desk. I have no doubt, and I know the member for Page (Mr Causley) certainly does not, that the single desk is a very valuable instrument in the Queensland sugar industry. The reason is that it stops unfair multinational companies giving a lower price to cane growers, and it also acts as a much more unified voice on export markets. Indeed, even Cuba is starting to think about going back to a single desk because it has a valuable influence on international markets. New South Wales, because of a decision that was made many years ago as a result of irreconcilable differences, exports on a much smaller scale, separate from the QC. It is interesting that, even with the single desk argument, many companies would like to see single desk selling removed. Bundaberg Sugar is one. There is now a defamation action against the Queensland Sugar Corporation by Mackay Sugar Corporation. Principally, the local cooperative in cooperation with the European commodities giant, E.D. & F. Mann, an enormous refiner, are now bringing litigation against QC on single desk selling. It needs to be kept. Another area in the recommendations which has caused considerable concern to growers in areas of North Queensland and around the Bundaberg district is the pooling differential. These were recommendations made by the sugar industry, not by the Commonwealth, and that is a key difference. As I mentioned before, when you look at the structure of this report you will see that the ALP put those people there under the national competition policy that they established under the son of Hilmer. The people they put there recommended that the tariff be removed. Incredibly, some of the representatives were inappropriate. Some of them represented the largest confectionary manufacturers. The great tragedy in the debate today on national competition policy is the assumption that greater competition will mean lower prices and that consumers will benefit. The irony has been that, with the tariff reduction from over $100 per tonne down to $37 per tonne, you would think that consumer prices would have fallen. The facts are that since 1989 through to the December quarter last year, the price of confectionaries has gone up 52 per cent and the price of cordials and soft drinks has gone up 34 per cent. Obviously these are key products that require sugar. The CPI, though, has only gone up 29.5 per cent. It makes you wonder who is making the profits. That is why some of those people should not have been on that working party. Let us look at some of the other arguments about free trade and global trade in relation to sugar. Sugar markets have been corrupted; there is no question about that. There are enormous subsidies-the EEC with 190 per cent and Thailand with over 107 per cent. The biggest consumers of sugar are either governments or otherwise within countries. A very small amount is taken by free traders. Australia has to live on that free trade. We export 85 per cent of our raw sugar and obviously we are increasing our refined capacity. That is the environment that we have to live in. The US market is a huge consumer of sugar. It has a regulated market and a quotawe have had the benefit of getting into that quota; we are the fourth largest importer on that quota-of 1.9 million tonnes. It is hoped that when the US farm bill comes back into Congress in the year 2001 the quota will be removed. As the member for Page has pointed out, if that quota is removed, it will effectively mean that the world price of sugar will increase by 2c to 3c a pound. Currently it is in the range of llc to 12c. We must continue to advocate the removal of that quota. In the long term its removal will mean more to Australian cane farmers and to other global exporters than its retention. We have to be careful of substitutes. As I said, we could put our tariff back on tomorrow at $1,000 per tonne. But it would make no difference because of the change in the pricing formula. We also have to be competitive against other substitutes. Com based starch represents the biggest proportion of sugar consumption. Ironically, the EEC is the largest producer of sugar-16.5 million tonnes, a major proportion from sugar beetwhereas Australia produces only five million tonnes. In the United States, com based starch now represents seven per cent of the global consumption of sugar; artificial sweeteners represent five per cent. There are other factors that we have to be mindful of in the sugar argument, not just tariffs. Currency movements, which were advocated yesterday by the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), would have a far greater impact. That is precisely the reason why the Australian government decided to go in with a rescue package to support the baht. The last thing we wanted to see was the Thai baht plummet through the floor. This would have meant that they would be far cheaper for foreign buyers to purchase and it would have undermined our sugar industry dramatically. It was a swap that was done and it was prudent. Finally, if you actually import sugar into Australia, there is a freight differential. So there are some strategic advantages, notwithstanding some of the arrangements that we put in place with the WTO. Let us look at the New South Wales industry and focus on what has been achieved since the sugar task force report. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made an announcement-and a number of members of this government were involved-to ensure that there would be an adequate package for New South Wales to compensate it for the decisions made by the Queensland industry in this report entitled Sugar: Winning globally. A number of valuable concessions were gained. One was an additional $1 million worth of infrastructure to the New South Wales industry which matches the previous $1 million from the government and the $1 million from the state. This is to allow them to get into the export market. The other area-and it will be finalised shortly-is to gain access into the US market; to get New South Wales a slice of that very lucrative market which has been denied to it since 1989. Likewise, and most importantly, the decision that the federal government has made in regard to allowing the facility for a merge between Mackay and CSR will be the best thing that can happen to domestic prices in the short term, irrespective of any other decision made in the short term. The irony is that the national competition policy, which was established by the ALP, with the likes of Allan Fels and others, actually denied the merge back in the early 1990s. If that had not happened, we would not have an excess supply of sugar now. The very reason we have an excess supply is that some refineries are producing enormous amounts of sugar. In order to gain market share they are discounting, and by discounting they are lowering the price so that all refineries lose money. I am delighted that we have been able to facilitate a situation where that merge can go ahead and where we can reduce excess supply and, in tum, the prices will move back up. There is another area within the sugar industry where there is a very positive future for sugar-this is happening both in New South Wales and in Queensland-and that is the diversification into power. A number of mills are putting in generators and, whilst the big end of town has been compensated because of national competition policy, this can also benefit the sugar industry. In New South Wales generators are being put in which can direct power directly into the grid. Of course, we are looking for an increase in production from an export of refined sugar. And, as I mentioned before, one of the key issues has been the resolution of the Mackay-CSR problem. What is interesting in this debate, though, is the attitude that the Australian Labor Party has taken. As I have portrayed, the sugar industry itself recommended that the tariff be removed in order to maintain concessions. As I have demonstrated, even if the tariff were put back into place, it would make no difference to the domestic price of sugar. Let me quote from the Financial Review of 7 March, which described Labor's approach as 'the contemptuous opportunism of the Labor Opposition' and states: The sugar decision is exactly what the Federal Labor Party would now be proposing if it were still in government. The recommendation to scrap the tariff is from the unanimous report of the Sugar Industry Review Working Party, which includes representatives of both cane growers and the sugar users, that the Labor Party set up with the Queensland Government in 1995. Labor's new stance is an example of the destructive role an opposition party can play in a populous lunge for votes. In this case, to grab a few seats in Queensland. So there you go: the ultimate hypocrisy. Even when Crean was there, that was precisely the policy that they were advocating, and now they have got this flip-flop policy. The key difference between the automobile industry and the TCF industry is that the sugar industry has recommended the removal of the tariff, and members on the backbench should recognise that. The Labor Party is potentially jeopardising the gains that it achieved through maintaining the single desk and through maintaining consignment. I think it is absolutely deplorable, and it is one of the reasons why we are having this debate, that, although the Labor Party was in government for 13 years, it allowed a further concentration of foreign ownership, which is precisely what happened in the sugar industry and precisely what has happened in the beef industry.",63
56,Mr SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Order! It being 2.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. DIANA, PRINCESS OF WALES",67
57,Mr HOWARD,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"May I have the indulgence of the House to announce arrangements for representation at the funeral of the late Princess of Wales. I have withheld making any public comment on this matter pending receipt of formal confirmation from Buckingham Palace and the British Government of the arrangements for the funeral. That confirmation came through this morning. In accordance with the wishes of the Royal family and Princess Diana's own family, her funeral is not to be a state funeral. As a consequence, heads of government and heads of state are not being invited, except in a very few cases where very close personal associations existed with the late princess. I shall not, therefore, be attending the funeral, but along with all other Australians my thoughts and prayers will be with the family on that day. The palace has indicated that, in the case of Australia, it would welcome attendance by a senior minister. Accordingly, the government has decided that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) will represent Australia at the funeral. I understand that a similar arrangement will prevail in respect of Canada and New Zealand. Australians have been deeply touched by the sudden loss of the princess and have given, in many forms, moving expression to our feelings for her and for the suffering that her family, particularly her children, must be enduring. The parliament has conveyed those sentiments to the family. Memorial services have been held throughout the country, including the one which I, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) attended in Canberra yesterday. The government naturally understands and respects the desire of the princess's family and the Royal family that the funeral have as strong a personal nature as possible and that as many personal friends and contacts from organisations with which she was closely associated should be able to attend.",67
58,Mr BEAZLEY,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker. These arrangements are entirely appropriate from the opposition's point of view. I have said in public that I thought it was important that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) attend. I happen to know from conversations with the Prime Minister and what I saw transpiring over the few days prior to his announcement today that he was making an effort to do that. He has also indicated to me that he would seek that the opposition would also be appropriately represented in those circumstances. But it is quite evident that those responsible for the funeral want to keep it very much as personal an affair as such a funeral could be, with the people attending being those who had established a very close relationship with the late princess. In the circumstances, I think the Prime Minister's response and selection is completely appropriate. I join again with him in expressing the sentiments he expressed about the warmth, the regard and the terrible sadness that there is among many Australians at the princess's death. The contribution she has made has touched all our hearts over a long period of time. So the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) will go there with all the good wishes and that sentiment behind him from the Australian people. NA",67
59,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) is absent. The Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) will be answering questions in his place. NA Member for Oxley,68
60,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Does the Deputy Prime Minister recall saying of the member for Oxley, 'I have made it very clear from early on last year, ahead of many others, that Pauline Hanson represents a very dumb and destructive agenda for jobs here in Australia and her antiAsian trade agenda.' Does he stand by those criticisms? If so, has he seen reports that the member for Dawson, in supporting the One Nation agenda, said, 'I am pleased to say Mrs Hanson has attracted enormous support for much of what she has said' and has called for the National Party not to put Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party last on the ticket at the next election? Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree with the member for Dawson and, if not, will he, unlike the Prime Minister, show some leadership and announce today that the Nationals will put her anti-trade, jobs party last?",68
61,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Firstly, I stand exactly by my comments with regard to her dumb and divisive agenda. In the last financial year ending 30 June 1997 this nation had an all-time record export effort of $104.4 billion with a surplus in both goods and services for the first time ever. Frankly, I do not think one container or I tonne of iron ore or coal has thus far been diverted because of the agenda of the member for Oxley. Equally, I want to make it very clear, if Australia is to have a bread ticket into the next century, into the next millennium. it has to maintain a set of relations based best on mutual respect with our trading partners, most notably in Asia, which command about two-thirds of our export effort. I remind this House that 345,000 jobs alone attach to our export trade with Japan, our largest export market. I do not want to jeopardise that in any way, shape or form. With regard to the member for Dawson, I have seen reports of her comments. I do not believe she would want to jeopardise Australia's trade with Asia. Her electorate is one of the great coal and sugar exporting electorates to Asia. With regard to her comments on preferences, they are premature. This is matter for the organisation of the National Party. A few minutes ago, David Russell QC, the Queensland president, and Don MCDonald, the federal president, confirmed that no decision has been made-and, frankly, why would it? The boundaries are not yet finalised with regard to the Queensland seats. And, further, we do not even know if a candidate of a more extremist nature, such as elements of the Ku Klux Klan in Australia, might be contesting. Let me just say one other thing. I am unimpressed by the Labor Party's effort in many aspects of this debate because they did so much to damage our trading effort, most notably with Malaysia.",68
62,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Absolute rubbish!,68
63,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You seem to have forgotten former Prime Minister Keating's anticomments with regard to the Prime Minister of Malaysia, and that had a direct impact on our exports to and our jobs with Malaysia. Let me add one other thing only. I need to draw to the attention of the House that there has been a recent meeting between David Oldfield, the senior adviser to the member for Oxley, and Ian MCNiven, the national vicepresident of the Firearm Owners Association of Australia, and Ron Owen, the publisher of the notorious magazine Lock Stock & Barrel, an extremist magazine which has had editions banned by the censor and which advertises anti-Semitic dimensions. This puts a new dimension on the whole question of connection in that the senior adviser of the member for Oxley is openly and publicly now meeting with people like Ian MCNiven and Ron Owen. I simply say that an account of this particular meeting has been reported in the current edition of the magazine referred to. It is very much out of character for an organisation that professes to speak for ordinary Australians to be going around meeting with people who are on the record as being anything but ordinary and fair dinkum Australians. I do not want to give these people any more of a profile than they already have, but I want to make it very clear that it seems very un-Australian to me, and many Australian families must be left wondering what One Nation as a party and the member for Oxley have in common with people who go around hanging people in effigy, including office holders of the federal parliament, in front of gunshot targets. I make the point that we will take that into account in reaching our decision at a proper time. National Accounts  the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of today's national accounts figures? What foundation does this provide for further growth in the economy?",68
64,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today's national accounts figures released for the June quarter 1997 showed strong growth of 1.2 per cent. I think all Australians will welcome strong growth in the Australian economy of 1.2 per cent in the June quarter. Importantly, what it showed was that growth was accelerating in the first two quarters of this year, recording 1.9 per cent in the first half of 1997 compared with 1.2 per cent in the second half of 1996. Abstracting from the farm sector, the step up in growth was even more marked. Across the board in relation to the national accounts we see strong welcome growth recorded, particularly in levels of stocks. We continue to see good private consumption. We saw a welcome improvement in corporate profits, going to near historical levelsincreasing from 16.6 per cent of GDP to 17.4 per cent of GDP. The figures also indicate that growth was broad based across the Australian economy. Today's national accounts also confirmed Australia's status as a low inflation country, the price deflators rising over the year by 1.4 per cent. Growth at these levels of 1.2 per cent for the quarter and over three per cent through the year to the June quarter put Australia up near the top of the list in terms of growth, both in the OECD and in the G7. Taken together with low inflation and interest rates which are now historically the lowest for 30 years and a budget which is coming back into balance next year, with strong corporate profits providing room for increased investment, this bespeaks an outlook for the Australian economy which is very strong indeed. There are real opportunities in the Australian economy. On a low inflation basis, with strong growth and with further capacity, the Australian economy is now at a stage where growth can increase, and sustain ably increase. We are dealing with the two problems that have held back Australian growth over the course of the last two decades. They were inflation, which is now under control, and our current account deficit, which is showing signs of improvement. This is a low inflation growth economy. It is a profit economy and an investment economy, and all Australians will welcome the strong news of growth for the June quarter. National Accounts",69
65,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question, which is to the Prime Minister, also refers to the national accounts figures. That description of the economy applied exactly to the four years prior to their coming into office. Today' s national accounts figures show growth of just 2.5 per cent for the 1996-97 year as a whole. Can the Prime Minister confirm that this growth outcome is a full $5 billion below the government's original budget forecast and a full $3.75 billion below your last forecast in May? Will the Prime Minister admit, as the Treasury and the Reserve Bank have done, that the government's unnecessary contractionary budget policies, which reduced economic growth last year, failed to lift confidence and produced a disastrous collapse in jobs growth?",69
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the thrust of the question is no, but let me take the opportunity of saying to the Leader of the Opposition that there are a number of things I can confirm. I can confirm that we turned your debt of $10.5 billion into a surplus of $1.6 billion. I can confirm that we have delivered the lowest housing interest rates for 30 years. I can confirm that we have laid the foundation for the conditions in which, in the words of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the speed limits can be taken off growth in Australia. The thing that has beset the Australian economy for years is unemployment. It was 11.1 per cent when you ran unemployment. Remember that? Do you remember when you ran unemployment in Australia? Remember 19917 I know you like to have selective amnesia but, when you ran unemployment in Australia, you and Martin Ferguson took unemployment to its highest post-Depression level. That is what you did. You and Martin Ferguson took unemployment",70
67,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The question was about the government's policies. If it is relevant him to put these arguments forward",70
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,70
69,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Perhaps he could explain why he left us with 11 per cent unemployment, 11 per cent inflation and a $25 billion deficit. Do you remember that, John?",70
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat! There is too much dialogue across the chamber.,70
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about the government's policy. To explain the government's policy, you first have to remind the people about what the policy is directed to curing. Our policy is directed to curing the chronic problem of debt that you left behind. In 1995-which was the year before you were unceremoniously ejected from officethe national debt of Australia was almost 20 per cent of gross domestic product. In other words, almost 20 per cent of the wealth that we as Australians generate a year represented our national debt. You opposed tooth and nail the budget policies of this government. You ridiculed them and you tried to stop them but, of course, you want to spend the surplus that is the product of the reform. Say one thing and do another-that is the Beazley mantra. You say you are against the cuts and you do another. That is the Beazley mantra. You did that on tariffs. When you were in government, you slashed tariffs and boasted about it. Now you run around to the union meetings and you say, 'Oh, don't worry, brothers and sisters, we're all in favour of high tariffs.' You were not in favour of high tariffs when you had control over tariffs. You were in favour of slashing them. You used to boast about it. You used to be hairy chested. I see you shaking your head. I do not remember you voting against Bob Hawke's 1988 tariff reforms or his 1991 tariff reforms. I think you boasted about it. I think you are a hypocrite on tariffs, Simon. That is what I think you are. Of course, when it comes to fiscal policy, your leader-who left this nation with a $10.5 for billion deficit and who helped drive unemployment to a post-Depression high when he was in charge of unemployment-has the unbelievable gall to talk to us about fiscal responsibility. Second Sydney Airport",70
72,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Will the minister please advise the House what progress the government has made on the environmental assessment of Badgerys Creek and the Holsworthy military areas as sites for a second Sydney airport? What progress has been made in meeting the key component of the government's election commitment to address Sydney'S aircraft noise problems while also catering for projected strong growth in air travel?,70
73,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. When we came into office in March last year, the former Labor government had left untouched the Badgerys Creek airport site as Sydney's second airport. You will recall that the former Labor government selected Badgerys Creek in February of 1986 as the second airport site for Sydney. However, despite that decision, 10 years prior to the change of government, they had not done one thing to develop the airport-apart from talk about it. So, when we came into office, we started to implement our policies in regard to the management of Sydney's Mascot airport as well as, of course, the second airport. We said in opposition that the coalition supported the development of a second airport for Sydney. In doing so, we supported a full and comprehensive environmental impact study which would be oversighted, for the very first time in the history of this country, by an independent auditor to ensure a proper process for that EIS is undertaken. At the time of entering government, we were aware of a number of environmental concerns that had been expressed by people in regard to Badgerys Creek airport. In light of that, we stated at the announcement of the EIS that, whilst Badgerys Creek was our first preference for the second airport site for Sydney, we would run a parallel EIS on an alternative site based at Holsworthy. Since the commencement of that EIS, a lot of work has been undertaken, and earlier today I was able to release the draft EIS executive summary and make that available for public consumption. The draft EIS completely dispels the concerns that many of us had when we came into office in regard to Badgerys Creek airport. The draft EIS clearly indicates that Badgerys Creek is a superior site. It also indicates that Holsworthy is an inferior site for a second airport for Sydney when compared with Badgerys Creek. As a result of that, I have approached the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, and sought to ensure that, from this point forward, Holsworthy will be excluded as a site for consideration for Sydney's second airport. This means that the EIS on a second airport for Sydney will proceed solely based on three options for an airport runway at Badgerys Creek. It also means that this presents Australia, particularly Sydney, with a unique opportunity to resolve an issue that has been plaguing Sydney since the end of the Second World War; that is, to develop a second airport to cope with the growth of aviation traffic in Sydney. It must be remembered that Sydney airport receives half of all Australia's overseas international arrivals. It is the most important piece of infrastructure for Australia's tourism industry, our largest export earner and our fastest job creator. As such, this unique opportunity of now being able to proceed to develop a second airport at Sydney is done with the support from the Labor Party. When in government, of course, they were the creators of the site at Badgerys Creek and, throughout their years in office, they strongly supported the development of an airport at Badgerys Creek. People like the member for Werriwa, the member for Watson, the member for Grayndler and the member for Kingsford-Smith have all stood up in this House over the years and strongly supported an airport at Badgerys Creek. We have the support of those Labor members, judging by what they did when in office, and we can also look forward to the support of a number of local communitiesparticularly the Liverpool City Council that has the Badgerys Creek airport in its boundaries. We can look forward now to strong support from the Labor Party and from individual communities for the development of an airport at Badgerys Creek.",71
74,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,71
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Prospect.,71
76,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This takes us a step further in fulfilling all of the commitments that we made in our policy with regard to Sydney airport. We have, as we have said, done everything with Mascot airport. We have reopened the east-west runway. We have changed the flight paths at Mascot to put more than half of all aircraft movements over water or non-residential land. We are now introducing an 80 movements per hour cap for aircraft. We have honoured the curfew as installed in legislation by the now Prime Minister when he was in opposition. Just as we have fulfilled to the letter of our commitment everything we have said about Mascot airport, we will fulfil to the letter of our commitment everything we have said about the development of a second airport in Sydney. Second Sydney Airport",71
77,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Why has the government spent nearly 18 months and some $5 million to determine that Holsworthy is a totally inappropriate site for an airport, when this question was conclusively resolved a decade ago? Isn't it a fact that the government's mad pursuit of the Holsworthy option upset and gave unnecessary heartache to thousands of residents in Sydney, forced many people to sell their homes at massively discounted prices and caused significant disruption to the Australian Defence Force? Isn't it a fact that much of the blame results from the coalition's desire to satisfy the Lawrence Hargreaves project? Will the minister now apologise to the residents of Sydney and advise what arrangements are going to be put in hand to compensate for the suffering as a consequence of the government's crazy pursuit of the bomb littered Holsworthy site?",72
78,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If there are any apologies that are due by anybody in this place, they are due by you and the Labor Party who for 10 years did nothing about developing an airport in Sydney at Badgerys Creek. You had 10 years to do something about it, and all you did at the time was fast talk it but slow track it. That is what you did.",72
79,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,72
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will resume his seat. There is far too much noise in the chamber. I issue a general warning. I call the minister.,72
81,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, the former Labor government in February 1986 selected Badgerys Creek as a second airport site for Sydney. In the next 10 years, you did nothing. In that next 10 years, you had every opportunity in the world to resolve this issue which you claim has vexed Sydney so badly over the years. You had your chance in 10 years and, if you had still been in government today, you would not have resolved that issue. It is worth reminding members of the House that it was the Labor government who, in January of last year, started yet another EIS on Badgerys Creek. You say that there has been money wasted on this, but the fact is that we finished the job that you started. We wanted to ensure that we could fulfil our commitment in regard to developing a second airport in Sydney as soon as was practicable. An EIS on Badgerys Creek has not been delayed by a parallel EIS on Holsworthy. The people of Sydney can be assured that the EIS on Badgerys Creek has been done just as quickly this way as it would have been done in any other fashion. So when members of the Labor Party come to the microphone in this House and claim that the people of Sydney have been cheated by the delays in developing a second airport, the only people who have done the cheating are the people sitting opposite. They had 10 years to solve this problem and they did nothing but mislead the people of Sydney over their true intentions of a second airport. Reform of the Australian Financial System",72
82,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the community and business reaction to the government's plan to improve the financial system? Can the Treasurer also advise the House of benefits for consumers, including those in rural and regional areas, of the coalition plan to foster competition and choice in the Australian financial system?",72
83,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. The government's response to the Wallis inquiry, which was announced yesterday, has been broadly welcomed by the Australian public and the Australian financial industry. It has particular benefits for people in rural and regional Australia. It is in rural and regional Australia where new non-bank financial institutions now, for the first time, will be able to compete on an equal basis with the banks. They will be giving increased services, increased competition, increased efficiency and better prices to the people of rural and regional Australia. Consumers will be the ones to benefit as a result of the government's structural reform of the Australian financial industry. Removing the second-tier status of credit unions and building societies will provide greater community acceptance for those institutions and will enhance their ability to give new financial services. This will only be helped by programs like credit care, where the government and the credit unions have teamed together to provide funds for project teams which have visited around 100 communities to see if they want full service financial institutions after the withdrawal of banking services. Credit union facilities have been established in 33 communities, with progress at various stages in around 30 of them. Direct employment has been created for 40 people, and new deposits are up $35 million. This is the dawn of new opportunities for non-bank financial institutions. But it is not just the non-bank institutions which have welcomed the government's structural reform proposals for the finance industry. The Commonwealth Bank's managing director, David Murray, said that his bank would compete enthusiastically and that there would be lower overall costs from new technology. The National Australia Bank's Mr Don Argus said, 'The proposed rationalisation of the regulatory framework and the opening up of the banking sector to other organisations acknowledges the reality of the globalisation of Australia's financial sector.' Mr Bob Joss of Westpac said, 'The government has made a bold set of policy decisions which will drive the continued deregulation of the Australian financial system.' The ANZ's Tonya Hudson said, 'The bottom line is we are happy with it.' Mark Addis from the Australian Bankers Association said, 'Adoption of the Wallis recommendations represented a milestone in the deregulation of the financial services sector.' The Australian Investors Managers Association, the Investment Funds Association, and the Life Investment and Superannuation Association all welcomed the changes yesterday. They said, 'We strongly support the government's response to the recommendations of the financial system inquiry.' National Mutual's Geoff Tomlinson said, 'Consumers are the winners from the government's adoption of the central recommendation of the inquiry.' The Permanent Building Society said, 'The building society industry is very positive about the Treasurer's announcement.' The Credit Union Services Corporation said, 'The Wallis reforms would remove the last remaining barriers to effective competition and directly benefit 3.5 million Australians who are members of credit unions. The federal Treasurer has opened the door to a major national economic reform, while preserving the integrity, security and fairness of the financial system.' Australia's largest non-bank home lender, Aussie Home Loans, welcomed the response and said that it pointed the way to greater competition and particularly welcomed the opening of the payment system to non-banks. This is a bold set of economic reforms which this government has announced. It has the potential to improve the Australian financial system for a long time in the future. It recognises globalisation and technological change. It enhances competition and efficiency. It gives better services to consumers. It has the potential to lower costs for those in rural and regional Australia. These are welcome reforms with immediate benefits. NA",72

85,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Science and Technology. Is the minister aware that the MCKinnon reactor review concluded that alternative technologies should be further considered before any decision was taken to build a new reactor at Lucas Heights? Why has the government now taken a decision to build that reactor at Lucas Heights without any updated review of alternative technologies, without any prior consultation with the local community and without any review of other possible sites away from major suburban population centres and rather than in the centre of the electorate of Hughes? Minister, why don't you just admit that Lucas Heights is now part of Sydney's urban sprawl and totally inappropriate for a new nuclear reactor?",74
86,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Every condition that the MCKinnon reactor review of 1993 laid down for a government to consider for a replacement reactor has been met. The spallation technology that you referred to has not been developed where it can economically offer as much or more as a replacement reactor. At the same time, nowhere in the world is cyclotron being used to produce technetium 99 for medical purposes, which is the basis of 80 per cent of nuclear medicine procedures. You asked about prior consultation. I have been in close consultation with the shire of Sutherland and with state and federal members, and have consulted the community. You ask about alternate sites. Another condition of the MCKinnon review is that we exhaustively examine alternate sites. We reached the conclusion that none could guarantee in a practical sense the continual supply of radiopharmaceuticals. The problem for Labor on this issue is that they are all over the shop. The shadow minister, the member for Bonython, is opposed to the replacement reactor. He put out a statement today that reads: The people of Sutherland Shire and the Australian scientific community have a right to a public inquiry into the need for a new reactor, given the alternative technologies which are now avail ablethere are no alternative technologies availableAnd if a reactor is required, other sites should be considered. Later on he goes on to say: If the public are to have confidence in the final decision about the need for a new reactor, it is essential that there is a proper public inquiry to ensure all the facts are taken into account. This reactor will drain hundreds of millions of dollars from the scarce public funds available for science. I have already designated to the Minister for the Environment the need for an environmental impact statement, which will allow for public input. But your problem is that you oppose the reactor",74

88,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is opposition all right. He will not make up his mind. All right: do we need a replacement reactor-yes or no? Mr Martyn Evans-You're answering the question. Will you table the study? Table the study!,74
89,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are all over the shop. The Leader of the Opposition believes there should be a replacement reactor-I have read his transcript of an interview today-but not at Lucas Heights. Senator Cook, the former Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, in a Senate estimates committee hearing on 25 September 1996 asked Professor Helen Garnett, Chief Executive Officer of ANSTO, when we were actually going to get a new reactor. Senator Parer interjected: Perhaps I should ask you a question: will you support us if we propose it? To which Senator Cook responded, 'I will,' and then said: I think we do need a research reactor in Australia and it does play an important role in terms of medical work that it does as well. If we are not in this game, we are out of it, and if we are out of this game we are out of a large part of the science especially of the next century. The real problem for the Labor Party is its credentials on this. What did you do about a replacement reactor over 13 years? What did you do about spent fuel as our storage space was exhausted?",74
90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They were going to do it in the 14th year.,75
91,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Always the 14th year. What were you going to do about a new regulatory regime to replace the three bodies that have one role directly or indirectly over the research reactor at present? What were you going to do about Synroc after spending $40 million on it? What were you going to do about finding a national repository for low and medium level intermediate waste? Nothing! You did nothing, although the Minister for Science and Small Business at the time, Senator Schacht, in November 1993 promised all this. In a press release he said that there would be a new Australian institute for radiation protection, which would amalgamate those existing bodies to give new confidence and certainty to the oversight process. That never happened. We have announced it today. The Minister for Health and Family Services, assisted by his parliamentary secretary, the member for Adelaide, brought that about. In November 1993, Senator Schacht also boasted that he would establish an interagency committee to report and advise on the disposal of spent fuel rods. We came to government and found the shelf bare of strategies for any of these pressing problems. There are deadlines with regard to the replacement reactor. With regard to spent fuel there is a need for a new regulatory regime. You have no credibility. Even now you cannot decide on an agreed position amongst yourself. You have ruled yourselves entirely out of the debate. Mr MCClelland- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I require the minister to table the member for Bonython's media release from which he was reading.",75
92,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I might have been making it up! Of course I will table Senator Schacht's press release of 9 November 1993, Senator Cook's estimates comments of 25 September 1996, the member for Bonython' s press release of today and the transcript of an interview with the Leader of the Opposition today. I could go on and on. You are an absolute rabble. Maritime Unions",75
93,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the threat made by the Secretary of the ACTU, Bill Kelty, that he is prepared to blockade the nation in defence of the power and privilege of the Maritime Union of Australia? Will the Prime Minister assure the House that the government will act in the national interest rather than in the special sectoral interest of the Maritime Union?",75
94,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If ever the Australian nation wanted a stark demonstration of why people are deserting unions at a rate of knots, why union membership continues to fall, why membership of trade unions is increasingly unacceptable to women and to the young, you had it today in Queensland at the ACTU congress. Instead of concerning himself with jobs, instead of giving union leadership on tax reform, instead of tackling the challenges of this nation as we go into the 21 st century, what did Bill Kelty do? He reached back into the 1930s and the 1940s and he invoked the language of class warfare. This was are-run of the sonata and the symphony speech-and you know how successful that was, don't you, brothers. Can I just say to the leader of the ACTU, the Australian Labor Party and the entire Australian community that in relation to the waterfront my government will pursue the national interest; it will not pursue a sectoral interest. In relation to the waterfront my government will pursue higher productivity. In relation to the waterfront my government will represent the interests of Australian farmers who year after year in the past have seen their produce rotting on the wharfs of Australia because of the behaviour of some of the unions that Mr Kelty now says he will bring the nation to a standstill in order to defend. My government will promote the export industries of this country. My government will defend the legitimate rights of the Australian business community to ensure that the wharfs of Australia have world's best practice instead of, in some areas, world's worse practice. We will not repeat the error of the former government. I note incidentally that the former government did not escape from the Secretary of the ACTU either. He singled out our mate over there from Kingsford Smith, Laurie Brereton, for a little bit of special treatment. The former Labor government spent $400 million of Australian taxpayers' money in order to make the Australian waterfront a world class exercise. Instead of that it still lags far behind. It is still, for example, cheapat er to ship from Los Angeles to Indonesia than it is to ship from Sydney to Indonesia. We still had train rates at 14.9 containers per in the March quarter of 1997. This is viewed against levels such as Osaka at 32, Singapore at 35 and Yokohama at 47. The amazing thing about this whole issue is that you are not talking here about the quintessential Aussie battler. The wharfie is no longer an Aussie battler. We all know that. If ever you wanted to get the latest definition of a kangaroo court in a spotlight, you only had to see John Coombs of the Maritime Union of Australia being shown photographs by Richard Carlton on 60 Minutes last Sunday night of people nicking off three or four hours early. You are talking here about the elite of the trade union movement. You are not talking about Aussie battlers. You do not have a hungry mile any more on the Australian waterfront. You are talking here about people who are paid $80,000 to $90,000 a year. Bill Kelty seems to have a passion for the elites of the community. He no longer represents the battlers of Australia. That is why they are deserting him in droves. That is why they will support the sensible national interest approach of my government towards reform of the waterfront. NA",75
95,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we also have in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Tony Rundle, the Premier of Tasmania. I extend a very warm welcome to you. NA Lucas Heights Nuclear Reactor",76
96,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Science and Technology. Has the minister's attention been drawn to the comments today of Sutherland mayor, Kevin Schreiber, whom you are supposed to have had in your words 'close consultation with', protesting your decision to advance the new reactor? Have you seen his statement which says: They seem hell bent on building a nuclear reactor Lucas Heights without looking at the alternatives and without consulting the 200,000 residents of Sutherland shire. hour Have you also seen the comments of the, I might say, Liberal Party mayor Kevin Schreiber that you, minister, have been 'sucked into building a reactor in one of Sydney'S fastest growing suburbs by selfinterested nuclear scientists and bureaucrats'? Have you also seen statements that you have not, according to this man that you have closely consulted with, addressed the health and safety concerns of residents? Will you now offer the representatives of Sutherland shire at least a public inquiry into alternative sites for that nuclear reactor and whether or not you ought to proceed with it?",76
97,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have met several times and have spoken with Councillor Schreiber, for whom I have a very high regard. He has put his views strongly and we do not agree on everything. I would think, when he made that statement, he was unaware of the new regulatory body headed by a statutory officer. Your problem is entirely: how do we guarantee the supply of radio-pharmaceuticals? Two hundred and sixty thousand Australians receive a nuclear medical procedure every year, half of which are for treating life threatening diseases, and it is doubling every three years or so. It is growing at a rate of 15 years every year. Where are you going to put the replacement reactor that can continue to guarantee the certainty of supply? Those radio-pharmaceuticals have short halflives. Technetium 99 has a short half-life of six hours, which means that every six hours you lose half of its effectiveness, so that it decays entirely. You are putting Australian lives at risk. That is the bottom line.",76
98,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,77
99,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, I see, you do not believe it. Why don't you take the advice of the Academy of Science, the Academy of Engineering and Technological Sciences, the Federation of Australian Science Technology Societies-52,OOO members and the Nuclear Medicine Practitioners Association? All have come out in support of the government's decision because there is no alternative to the Lucas Heights site. We have closely examined all alternative sites. Mr Crean-How many?",77
100,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Even if you were prepared to pay the treble or quadrupleMr Crean-Name them, you fraud!",77
101,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You name the site. Let us hear it. You have a shadow minister who will not even commit to the replacement reactor and now you have got a Leader of the Opposition who will not even commit to an alternative site. Where can you be guaranteed the supply of the radio-pharmaceuticals? They have to be close to an airport for both domestic reasons and international reasons. Quite frankly, you are scaremongering. You never made a decision in government on this issue. You cannot make a decision now. You are a coward and you are putting Australian lives at risk. Native Title Act",77
102,Mr ANDREW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Following the decision by Chief Justice Brennan today to refer the matter of the validity of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act to the Full Court of the High Court, can the Attorney-General advise the House whether there are any implications in this decision for the government's amendments to the Native Title Act and the Prime Minister's lO-point plan?",77
103,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Wakefield for his question.,77
104,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Standing orders specifically exclude the seeking of a legal opinion and plainly what the question has sought is an expression of a legal opinion.",77
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,77
106,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,77
107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is too much noise in the chamber. Members on my right!,77
108,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the plaintiffs in the case of Kartinyeri and Gollan v. Commonwealth have challenged the constitutional validity of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act. The first thing to say about that is that the government has advice that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act is a valid law within the constitutional power of the Commonwealth and that position will be put to the High Court. The High Court has previously recognised that the Native Title Act 1993 is supported by the so-called 'races' power, section 51 (xxvi) of the constitution. This was decided in the native title case. The court has recognised the power as allowing special legislation, beneficial or detrimental, to people of a particular race. The government has clear legal advice that the Native Title Amendment Bill, to be introduced into this parliament this week, is supported by the 'races' power and is constitutionally valid. The government's amendments to the Native Title Act to implement the Prime Minister's 10-point plan wi 11 not alter the basic structure and characteristics of this legislation. Mr MCClelland-On a point of order, Mr Speaker, with respect to the Attorney-General: clearly he is giving a legal opinion and clearly the question is out of order.",77
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order; resume your seat.,77
110,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When amended, the Native Title Act will still be an act which in overall terms benefits indigenous Australians. There has been a suggestion that passage of the Native Title Amendment Bill should be delayed pending hearing of the Hindmarsh Island case. I want to say here and now that the government emphatically rejects this suggestion. The directions hearing by the High Court has not involved any substantive consideration of the legal issues to be raised in the eventual hearing. It is not appropriate, therefore, to use a mere challenge to delay amendments being introduced by the government to the Native Title Act. Chief Justice Brennan, I am advised, indicated in court today that, given the changes in the membership of the court, it is highly unlikely that it will be possible to constitute a seven-judge bench for this case to be heard before February or March next year. With the retirement of Justice Toohey in February, and the retirement of the Chief Justice in May, there must be some doubt that the matter will be heard, let alone decided, before the second half of next year. The government is acting on its commitment to introduce legislative certainty in relation to native title for all Australians, following the High Court's decision in the Wik case. Any attempt to delay the passage of the bill, pending the outcome of a challenge to a completely different act, will be unacceptable to the Australian public. Legal Services",77
111,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the Attorney-General agree with the West Australian Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr MCKechnie QC, that the law is now beyond the economic reach of the average person and, if so, what can be done to remedy this?",78
112,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Moore is referring to a proposal, which I have not yet had the opportunity to study, made by the Western Australian Attorney-General relating to a reference to the Western Australian Law Reform Commission. I have to say that it sounds very similar to a number of previous exercises that have been undertaken by a number of bodies, including the Senate inquiry into the cost of justice. There is undoubtedly concern within the community about the cost of access to justice, the cost of legal services. This issue is being addressed on a number of fronts. It is wrong to look, as many people do, at the simple issue of how much a lawyer costs to do a case. There are many different ways of addressing that issue. The government has been addressing quite a number of them. In fact yesterday I released a discussion paper that will take significant steps towards addressing an issue in relarion to the provision of legal services in the family area. It is not appropriate to think in terms of legal services only in terms of litigation and resolving issues before the courts, which is the subject of the reference to the Law Reform Commission. You have to look at alternative ways. This government has strongly supported the community legal centres, which provide shopfront legal advice and resolve many issues for thousands of people on a daily basis. We will continue to do so. We are providing additional funding for marriage and relationship education services and mediation and counselling services in relation to family law. That is another means of providing access to justice. It is a big subject. It deserves widespread consideration and it is receiving very adequate consideration from this government. National Firearms Buyback Program Mr TUCKEYI address my question to the Attorney-General. Attorney, what are the most recent figures relating to the national firearms buyback program?",78
113,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I commend the member for O'Connor for his continuing interest in this subject. I also commend him for the brevity of his question-something the opposition might seek to emulate. The Australian firearms reforms are some of the most significant reforms ever undertaken in Australia. Through the commitment of the government, the opposition, I might add, and, in particular, the leadership of the Prime Minister, we have as a nation instituted reforms which will benefit our society for generations to come. On any objective analysis the campaign for buying back firearms has been a great success. First, we have in place in all states and territories uniform licensing and registration laws and laws regarding ownership and storage of firearms. Secondly, detailed research has shown that not only is there almost universal recognition of the new laws but also there is about 80 per cent support for the new laws and the compliance rate for the firearm owners so far is also at about the 80 per cent level. As of noon today, 517,766 firearms have been handed in under the buyback campaign-that is, 517,766 firearms which have been removed from the community. There are 27 days to go in the buyback. The 80 per cent support for the laws validates the Prime Minister's leadership in relation to these reforms. The compliance by the vast majority of firearm owners shows that decent minded and responsible firearm owners respect the leadership the Prime Minister has shown. Members of the House would know that the Prime Minister was last night awarded the New South Wales Father of the Year Award. His commitment to his immediate family has been recognised by this award. This personal commitment parallels the Prime Minister's commitment to all Australian families through his public work on firearms which will benefit families in Australia for decades to come. I extend my congratulations to the Prime Minister on receiving the New South Wales Father of the Year Award and on the results the government has achieved in the firearms buyback campaign. Constitutional Convention",78
114,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I will be seeking a political opinion, if he has one.",79
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Move on to the question.,79
116,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Prime Minister to his comments on appointments to the Constitutional Convention when he said they are 'an outstanding cross-section of the Australian community ... every single man and woman . . . amongst these 36 are ... distinguished Australians'. Has the Prime Minister seen reports of comments by the Liberal Party's youth wing criticising three of the eight youth appointments as unrepresentative because one is a supporter of Arthur Tunstall, one is a mate of Bronwyn Bishop, the member for Mackellar, and another was carpeted for flouting Queensland Liberal Party membership rules? Prime Minister, are these the sorts of distinguished Australians you had in mind?",79
117,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I cannot believe it. I really cannot. I don't know what they have for a tactics committee. A member of the Australian Labor Party seriously asking a question about branch stacking ! You've got to be joking. Even Laurie Brereton is blushing at that. Even Laurie finds that a bit rich. I think my government has chosen an outstanding group of people. May I say that I am even moved-and this does not happen often-to rely upon the words of the Leader of the Opposition last Monday when he arrived here. He said that they really do include a large number of 'distinguished Australians'. Lucas Heights Nuclear Reactor,79
118,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and Technology. Now that the government has made a decision on the future of the research reactor at Lucas Heights in my electorate of Hughes, can the minister inform the House of the reasons for the decision? What does the government propose to do with the spent fuel rods stored at Lucas Heights?",79
119,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hughes for her very responsible and professional question. The government is proud to have taken decisions today that secure the future of Australia's nuclear medicine capacity and Australia's future nuclear science and technology. We have, as most, if not all, members would know, announced funding in the vicinity of $300 million for a replacement reactor at Lucas Heights and the repatriation of almost 2,000 spent fuel rods to the United States and the United Kingdom with no reprocessing plant in Australia. As I mentioned earlier in question time, we have also announced the establishment of a new authority overseeing ANSTO and Lucas Heights headed by a statutory office holder within the department of the Minister for Health and Family Services. This is a very major decision and one which was quite sensitive at times. I wish to pay tribute to the member for Hughes for her very diligent representations on behalf of her constituents. She was a very constructive, responsible and helpful conduit for her constituents' views-indeed, at times passionate in representing their interests. She was aided greatly in that by the member for Cook. I found his common sense and balance to be of tremendous assistance. At the same time, a number of our state colleagues, I am very glad to say, assisted us in reaching the decisions we have which are in the long-term interests of all Australians-Peter Collins, Leader of the Opposition, Ron Phillips, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Chris Downy and their state colleagues. One thing that has come out of question time is just how disturbing the Labor Party's attitude is on the decision the government has made. Let us leave aside their inaction-in fact, incompetence-and irresponsibility of 13 years of office and the way they kept deferring any decision invoking the word 'nuclear'. They went absolutely berserk whenever that happened. What they do not seem to know is the essential need to provide radio pharmaceuticals for Australians. As I said, 260,000 Australians depend on the use of radio pharmaceuticals, half of which are life threatening. There are 340,000 nuclear procedures or doses every year. It is estimated that five per cent of the number of procedures must be, because of the extreme emergency, delivered within a couple of hours to the patient being referred or diagnosed. This equates at the moment to 13,000 patients who need radio pharmaceuticals treatment urgently because their lives are at risk. Worse still is the fact that a lot of children are at stake here, because one-third of nuclear medicine procedures at Westmead and Prince Henry hospitals are for children. Some 3,800 reactor based scans for children were carried out at Westmead alone. I have had a case study, amongst others, put to me of neuroblastoma, which is the most common form of cancer in children. That child was recently treated at Westmead. Only six children have received this important treatment since Westmead Hospital opened. This is leading edge treatment of a cancer that is life threatening. That is the bottom line. Your irresponsibility did nothing to further the interests of Australians. Tariffs: Local Government Delegations  Minister. I draw the Prime Minister's attention to a number of local government delegations in the gallery today lobbying for their local and regional TCF industries, particularly a delegation of local government from New South Wales. Why was the Prime Minister prepared to meet a delegation of mayors from Victoria but not the delegation from New South Wales? Further, is the Prime Minister aware that not one of the ministers approached or any coalition local member agreed to meet that delegation from New South Wales, your own state?",79
120,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remember your late and not lamented leader having an open door policy! I remember bumping into one of his ministers on a plane flight after the election and he said, 'I only saw Paul once in 18 months and that was at a caucus meeting.' Before asking a question like that, all you tariff slashers over there, all of you razor wielders when you were in government: where were you in the great tariff slash of 1988? Where were you in the great tariff slash of 1991? You were there with Bob total Hawke and Paul Keating and John Button. Mr Fitzgibbon- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I don't know where you were,",80
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,,80
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Move quickly to your point of order. Mr Fitzgibbon-There is not a member of the Prime Minister's front-bench who contravenes standing order 59 more often than does the Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, I ask you to ask him to direct his comments through the chair.",80
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,80
124,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a very important issue at stake here, and that is consistency. Say one thing and do another on tariffs-that is exactly what the Labor Party has done. You cannot escape the odium, and nobody knows it more than the trade union leadership of Australia, that when you were in government you cut tariffs year after year and you boasted about it. Now you are, in a completely opportunistic fashion, parading yourselves as the great defenders of jobs. As everyone knows, the decline in employment in Australian manufacturing industry accelerated enormously when you were in government. The reality is that crites on tariffs. You are complete and utter hypocrites on tariffs. We will take a decision. The report will be handed down next week, as I am advised. We will take a decision in speedy manner. In relation to meeting people, last Friday Sydney I met, as promised, a representative delegation of union leaders in the industry from all over Australia. I will also be talking to some people tomorrow. Given the other obligations and commitments that somebody in my situation has, I do not apologise at for the time that I have devoted. I think it a very important issue, and I will listen very jobs. carefully to the views that have been put to me. As I have said before, something that will be very much in our minds will be job securiand ty. Workplace Relations",80
125,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the words, Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Has the minister read reports the ACTU has retreated from its commitment to enterprise bargaining at individual workwhere places in favour of claims across particular industries? Does the government have any intention of implementing such a policy? so, can the minister advise the House of the likely outcome to Australians across the board, were such a policy to be pursued?",81
126,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for productivity LaTrobe for his question. Clearly, the governbetter ment will not be moving to implement this proposal. In fact, in the Workplace Relations Act we introduced a series of measures prevent this very sort of thing happening. example, the commission has a new power they said: under section 127 to require people to go back to work. We introduced a new power in the commisrapidly sion to terminate or suspend a bargaining period where it was clear that, as a result of workers. an industry wide approach, a union or an employer was unable to negotiate terms and conditions specific to an enterprise. We introduced section 170MM which provides that, in the case of union agreements, industrial action is not protected if it is taken in concert with persons other than the union or its members you are hypoemployed by the employer. We brought back the new secondary boycott provisions, again because we want a system where the wage increase you have is a made possible by the changes in your individual workplace giving business the ability to in afford those very wage increases. That is a pretty sensible idea. If you have a wage increase being required upon a business which cannot afford that wage increase, what will happen? Clearly, the business is likely to go out of business and, all furthermore, the people working in that is business are obviously going to lose their We have seen a development over the last few months of the policy of the Labor Party the ACTU moving away from that which they advocated when they were in office. They have said, for example, that they will remove the allowable matters list-in other broaden the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission. They have said that that they will widen union rights of entry-in other words, allow unions into workplaces there are no union members. They have said that they will abolish the Office of the Employment Advocate, and they will obviousIf ly get rid of individual contracts. You might ask what the implication is of having a policy where your wage increase is determined upon the efficiency and the changes in that business. What authority to quote than the Labor Party when they were in office? In October 1995 they released a document which they deto scribed as 'the achievements of the Labor For government', Shaping the Nation, in which With the introduction of the Industrial Relations Refonn Act 1993, workplace bargaining has spread and is producing dramatic gains in productivity and better paid and more secure jobs for In other words, they are on the public record saying that if you want more jobs and more pay you need a system of enterprise bargaining. They said that their legislation in 1993 'entrenches workplace bargaining as the centrepiece of Australia's industrial relations system'. In other words, out of their own very public statements you have the argument for an enterprise bargaining system because it means more jobs and higher pay. That is what the government is doing. Now we have the extraordinary hypocrisy of these people. However inadequate might have been their implementation of such an idea, for years they advocated that if people are to have higher standards of living then you have to go to enterprise bargaining. Now, in concert with the ACTU-basically, dictated to by the ACTU-the ALP are abandoning that which they said would be good for workers. If ever such a policy were introduced, the clear implications of it are that, as you yourselves have basically said, there will be fewer jobs and lower living standards, and people will not get the pay increases they deserve. Sadly, it is yet another example of 'Now you are in favour of it; now you are against it', as with privatisation. With tariffs, you were great tariff cutters; now you are against it. Now, on something central to the importance of higher wages for workers, you are abandoning a system you once publicly advocated. Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries",81
127,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Minister, I refer to a recent TCF Advisory Council meeting at which you are reported to have said: The tariff debate for TCF is dead. In light of the concerns that will result from these comments, are you aware that in Victoria some 10 per cent of enterprises involved in TCF are located in regional areas, and that in my own electorate of Corio there are 60 companies with a turnover of $440 million, employing 3,300 people and with over 7,500 people dependent on these industries? Will you give an immediate commitment to protect the jobs of all those people and the future of areas such as Geelong which depend on these industries for their economic survival? Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question from the member for Corio is clearly far too long and should be ruled out of order.",82
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,82
129,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am surprised at the member for Corio raising a question like this. After all, I thought he worked in former Senator Button's office-that is my impression. As a consequence of that, I am not surprised that you are up there saying something. It also reminds me of that wonderful poem in that publication The Republican that I referred to a couple of weeks ago, or whenever it was, about the guy in the empty suit. As a consequence of the man in the empty suit, says The Republican, we now have the aspiring member for Corio who worked in Button's office, who wrote the failed policy. He is up here carrying out this wonderful facade about feeling and careMr O'Connor- Mr Speaker, I have a point of order. I asked a very specific question of the minister about a comment that was made at the TCF advisory council by him. He is now dissertating on my employment history. I will take an opportunity to clarify that to the minister's embarrassment at a later time, but would you bring him to answer the question?",82
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat. The question was reasonably long and wide-ranging. The minister is responding in a similar vein.,82
131,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not surprising that the member for Corio, having been the part author--even if he only wrote it in pencil and Johnny Button filled it in laterMr O'Connor- Mr Speaker, I have a point of order. The industry plan, as I understand it, came down in 1988",82
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! What is your point of order? Mr O'Connor-I was employed in 1991.,82
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,82
134,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The unity independent faction in Victoria seems to be having some trouble. You are getting into the empty suit man as well; so much so, it was such a wonderful question which shows the tremendous strategy and consideration put into it by the front-bench that I do not think it deserves any further comment. Pharmaceuticals",83
135,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister clarify recent statements about the government's reforms to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, in particular the introduction of therapeutic premiums? Can the minister also inform the House of the background to the government's policy in this area?",83
136,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. There are some fairly wild allegations going around at the moment about the government's proposal for therapeutic premiums. Some of them have something to do with the fact that the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association is meeting in Canberra today. Some of these allegations are that this will somehow disadvantage low income earners, that it will hurt the health of the country and that it will somehow restrict access to medications. All these allegations and assertions are completely wrong. The honourable member asked for the origin of this proposal. In checking with my department, it first came to us in a paper back in 1989. I will read him some of the assertions that were made in 1989 about such a proposal. This 1989 paper suggested that the price setting for the PBS should focus on establishing a government reimbursement price based on the lowest priced representative brand in each therapeutic class; the provision for a government reimbursement price for certain brands having special characteristics should be above that for the lowest priced brand in the therapeutic class; provision for the supplier to have the option to seek a premium from the marketplace in excess of the government's reimbursement priceMr Lee-But you are not doing it!",83
137,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Excuse me. This is the person that does not know the difference between sugar pills and cholesterol lowering drugs. And all patients, pensioners, concessional and general users should have the option of being prescribed a drug or drugs in a therapeutic class that are priced at the government's reimbursement price or make a co-payment covering the excess. That is exactly what the government has done. This document from 1989 continues and talks about the benefits that would accrue from such a proposal. First, they would still ensure universal access to quality prescription pharmaceuticals and protect the interests of the chronically ill. Secondly, they would encourage more rational choice and utilisation of pharmaceuticals. Thirdly, they would encourage the introduction of important new pharmaceuticals to the Australian market. This paper does not come from some hardnosed person out of the Treasurer's department. It does not come from some right wing economic think-tank. It actually comes from the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association-the same body that today is suggesting completely the contrary view. They were dead right in 1989, and they are still right today.",83
138,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They regard this as such a fetish,83
139,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is wonderful to see the Leader of the Opposition chortling over there and talking to himself again. You must not have taken your Modicate this morning. It is lovely to see the Labor Party for the interests of big business and the multinationals and against the interests of patients. The fact is that the three assertions that the pharmaceutical manufacturers made in 1989-that it will ensure access to quality, encourage ritional choice and see the introduction of important new pharmaceuticalswere right then and are right today. We had the guts to do it.",83
140,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You silly man! You are looking particularly stupid.,83
141,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you do not stop talking to yourself, you will be carted off from here in a little white suit. ASEM: Australian Participation",84
142,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the assessment in his white paper on foreign and trade policy that most Asian participants in the Asia-Europe summit process support Australia's inclusion in ASEM. Minister, in the light of the government's self-declared success in forging closer bilateral ties with the Malaysian government, can you confirm that Malaysia alone remains opposed to Australia's participation in ASEM? Following Prime Minister Mahathir's threat yesterday to boycott next year's ASEM summit in order to secure the inclusion of Burma, what is your current assessment of Malaysia lifting its veto over Australia's participation?",84
143,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I must say I am a little surprised that the Labor Party would ask a question about Australian participation in ASEM. It is one of the things on which we have reflected in my office and come to the conclusion that you would not. And why have we come to that conclusion? It was your failure to get Australia into ASEM at the beginning, your negligence on this issue, which has led us to have to take up the task since the last election. Needless to say, we have had enormous success in winning support from around the region. I am quite happy to go through the details of the government leaders, foreign ministers and other officials who hav- given strong support to Australia. The honourable member asked about Malaysia. Malaysia has indicated that, in terms of Australia's membership of ASEM, it is not a matter of if; it is a matter of when. the question is clearly going to be a question of timing. This matter will be considered at the ASEM summit meeting in London during next year and no doubt we will learn more when that occurs. But in the meantime there will be a number of matters that will be taken into consideration by countries interested in this issue. We will follow the matter with interest. Family Dispute Resolution",84
144,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. The Australian Bureau of Statistics produced figures last year that divorce in Australia is continuing to increase dramatically. Can the Attorney-General inform the House of the government's approach to assist people facing family and relationship breakdown and what the government is doing to improve dispute resolution services for families.,84
145,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. I am advised that this morning he was elected as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. I congratulate him on that. The government is committed to families. The trauma of family breakdown has far-reaching social and economic effects for families and children. We have assisted in the avoidance of breakdown by providing additional funding for marriage and relationship education services. That was announced earlier this year. The government is also committed to helping families work their way through relationship difficulties with as much dignity and fairness as possible. No-one wants families to end up in court. Where possible, families breaking up should be given the opportunity to reach agreed solutions without having a judge impose them upon them. Yesterday, there was tabled in the House, and I released, a discussion paper suggesting possible ways to improve the delivery of mediation and counselling services to families. At present, such services are located in both the Family Court and organisations within the community sector. But in the past there has not been any overall planning or So any real consideration of whether families are best served by locating such services in a court environment. The government believes it is time to examine whether greater community focus may assist more people to resolve their problems without resorting to legal proceedings. A possible outcome may be that counselling and mediation services are provided to a greater extent in a community setting rather than on court premises. I want to emphasise that at this stage no decision has been taken on what is the best mix of court and community sector services. Any such decision will be taken with full consultation. Many issues are outlined in the discussion paper, which we expect to have wide circulation. Any changes that result will be subject to an ongoing consultation process. The government is committed to getting the mix right. As I said, the government is committed to families and this initiative is yet another demonstration of that.",84

168,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to protect the environment while developing a coherent employment and industry strategy for Australia's forest industries. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",86
169,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Over the last 20 years, Australia has developed an increasing awareness that as a nation we have to find an appropriate balance between giving protection to Australia's sensitive environmental reserves and, at the same time, protecting jobs. This was a dilemma which confronted Labor in government. Anyone who remembers the times in which this issue came to the fore and the conflict that it engendered would recall the need for us to develop a process that was far better than the ad hoc processes that we inherited when we first came into government. PAPERS We did establish a better process. That better process was the regional forest agreement strategy which was based around the premise that we would seek to achieve key objectives: to secure better environmental results and, at the same time, achieve better employment in the forest industries based on long-term confidence and a proactive forest industry strategy. Arising from this, we developed with each of the states except Western Australia-which later signed an agreement with the incoming governmentscoping agreements which set benchmarks for the way in which assessments would take place. They were to be transparent. They were supposed to develop long-term confidence. They were supposed to ensure that proper and adequate reserves for environmental needs were put in place. They were to be based on scientific criteria and the importance of that was underlined in the scoping agreements by the benchmarks under the JANIS criteria of 15 per cent pre1750 forest types, 60 per cent of old growth, 90 per cent at least of wilderness and all rare and endangered species. Those were the environmental keys that needed to be secured for a RFA to be successful. But, on the other side, there was also an obligation to support employment in forest industries, to secure a long-term strategy that would ensure that the forest industries would be sustained and that we would not continue to export jobs overseas as whole logs or woodchip, that we would move toward a downstream processing stream and establish a strategy which would commit us to a way in which we could go forward building value in what we were doing with our forest based industries. What is happening in Tasmania is a microcosm of what could happen to bring undone this very important process. I notice the Premier of Tasmania here in this House today. His mission is to speak to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the issue of TCF industries and to make representations about employment in Tasmania, particularly Blundstones and a number of industries which are under threat. Tomorrow he speaks to the Prime Minister about a funding package for the RFAs. The Premier illustrates the paucity of understanding of the importance of this issue to the government by indicating publicly yesterday-yet another Premier of a statethat this government is neglecting the state's interests by saying that the offer that has been made by the Commonwealth to date is less than half of the money that is required to underpin an adequate regional forest agreement for Tasmania. Because the Tasmanian RF A has attracted national attention and has been the focus of debate and discussion about the resolution of jobs and the environment for a decade, the eyes of Australia are upon us. If the Commonwealth does walk away from a properly funded, transparent and scientifically based outcome, it will mean that conservationists and industry representatives right around Australia will be questioning: why should we stay in this process if we are going to be stitched up at the last minute by a politically inspired fix? The Premier has indicated that the Commonwealth has offered less than half the sum required for a satisfactory Tasmanian RFA. Why does this matter? It matters because you cannot construct a satisfactory regional forest agreement in Tasmania without an adequate funding base. Why can't you do that? Firstly, the JANIS criteria will necessarirepresentatives. ly mean further reservation of forest areas on public land from industry resource availability. So, at the very least, a significant sum of money will be needed to apply to the management of those new reserves, and also transitional arrangements and-sometimes I think you have to face it-redundancy arrangements for those who are going to be affected. That is the starting point. Secondly, in Tasmania we have a unique circumstance because of the great diversity of pre-1750 forest types. It means you cannot get near an adequate JANIS criteria outcome without a proper management strategy to protect those forest types on private land. The Commonwealth has not yet accepted any responsibility for funding a management strategy and, if necessary, an acqUIsitIOn strategy for those forests whose preservation is still required to get a satisfactory environmental outcome on private land. Put those two things together-the initial costs of some additional reservations management and the transitional costs of private land management-and the ballpark figure is $100 million. Fine, you might say; that gets you a conservation outcome. But what about the other leg of the industry strategy? What about the other idea-that we are actually trying to secure long-term employment and jobs for forest industries? Currently we understand that the Commonwealth is pressing for outcomes which are on the more significant side, environmentally, of the various options which have been canvassed on the draft RF As. If the numbers go beyond four or five per cent of additional resource being taken away from the industry in Tasmania, then you will basically have to undertake a massive restructuring of the industry on the ground. You cannot just continue business as usual. It basically means we will have a lunar landscape on the employment front unless, as well as that, the Commonwealth provides an industry funding package. That industry funding package again is in the ballpark region of about $50 million to $100 million. These are figures which I have discussed with industry representatives and environmental I am certain that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) will not acquiesce to the exact figures, but I am certain they are not too far out of the ballpark. The Commonwealth is way under that. It is not committing a cent towards private forest management, without which the burden will shift onto the Tasmanian community, and it has got no dollars on the front for an industry strategy. So we continue to go down the track of exporting jobs, exporting whole logs, exporting woodchips, without a downstream processing strategy built in. Nationally, we need that. We have been dudded time and time again. When we highlighted what was happening and called in the Senate for the reimposition of controls on the export of whole logs and woodchips, the government said, 'Don't you worry about that, we are actually committed to an industry strategy.' It said that it would establish that strategy no later than July. Months afterwards, the long promised wood and paper industry council has still not been set up. Not a single dollar has been put forward on the industry side. I am also concerned because I hear rumours that the environmental issue is going to be seduced by bad politics. There is pressure to get good environmental outcomes, but we have had reports that the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, is actually proposing a crude swap to accommodate protection of some additional old-growth forests, but at the expense of areas which are required to be preserved under the scientifically neutral JANIS criteria. In other words, you do a deal, you pretend you are doing something that is environmentally credible, but when you look behind you see the magic trick. You lose those reservations of pre-1750 forest types, the rare and endangered species, and there are other crucial issues that need to be dealt with. Do not say that there is not division in the federal government now on this issue. They know how slimy this is seeming, without the willingness to put money in. Mr Miles-Ha, hal",86
170,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Miles laughs, but Mr Miles has gone to the Prime Minister and said, 'If that happens, if those additional oldgrowth forests are not available to industrythe veneer industry and the sawlog industryyou will have my resignation.' Deny it if you will. The Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, Warwick Smith, has approached key industry leaders and said to them, 'What would your attitude be if we delayed signing the RFA until after the next Tasmanian state election?' Why do you think that might be? With $100 million worth of projects held up because the RFA has not been signed-and it was due for signature two months ago, on 30 June-with all those dollars tied up, we have Warwick Smith, the minister who represents the Minister for the Environment in this House, slinking around the back door talking to key industry leaders and saying, 'What would your attitude be to holding this whole thing up until after the next state election?' I think he got the response he deserved, and I think Premier Rundle ought to get the response he deserves. He ought to be told by the Prime Minister, 'These are legitimate requests you are putting forward on behalf of the Tasmanian community. You are not making ambit claims. You are actually speaking out for a Tasmanian community that has been clipped around the ears time after timethat is facing tariff decisions, that is facing costs that have been imposed by the withdrawal of Commonwealth funding of a massive dimension. The Premier should be saying to the Prime Minister, 'We are on the bones of our arse in Tasmania.' Premier Rundle has come up here directly as a response to your contemptuous response the other day when you said that you had made a generous offer to Tasmania. He heard that. A generous response indeed! It is less than half the money that is needed to accommodate anything that approaches an outcome that is acceptable to Tasmania. This is a situation which is looming as a significant test of the federal government's commitment to the RFA process. If this process falls apart in Tasmania, we know it will not work anywhere else in Australia. If it does not work anywhere else in Australia, then it means we are back to the battlefields in the forests. It means that the issues will be resolved by sleight of hand in the backrooms through political deals. It means we are not capable of managing a scientific and neutral process. We, the Australian Labor Party, stand for that process. We created it. It is the child of our experience, which we learnt over a long and difficult period of time. We are committed to a successful outcome. We will do nothing to undermine it. I speak strongly on behalf of all my Tasmanian colleagues when I say that what we want is a successful conclusion to the RF A which protects both jobs and the environment. That is what it was set up to achieve. That is the outcome we want. The only people standing in the way of that outcome are the federal government. They are mean spirited and not committed to the necessary elements to make the process work in our state. They are not committed to an understanding that, without that being successful in this state, people will walk away from the process everywhere else in Australia. So we believe this is a benchmark of your good faith not only to the Tasmanian community but to the forest industries right around this country and to the conservation movement that reposed some confidence in you-completely wrongly-at the last federal election. They were dudded. They were dudded on Kakadu. They were dudded on commitments of funding for this weakened package that you have put together. They were dudded time and time again. Now we see this walking away from the scientific process and a failure to fund something which, after all, is going to be a benchmark of whether you succeed or not. I see the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy sitting in that seat and, when you stand up, I want to hear whether you have an offer on the table that remotely comes near the $200 million that has been requested of you. I want to hear the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who is sitting over there, deny that he has put his resignation on the table. I want to hear why the minister who represents the Minister for the Environment in this place, the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), has sleazed around the industry saying that this whole thing should be put off until the political dynamics of the next Tasmanian election are out of the way.",88
171,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I must say at the outset that I am not any more illuminated or aware in my mind as to precisely what this MPI is about than I was when we began. I am not sure whether the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) wants more money or a better environmental outcome-whatever 'better' might be in his language-or a better industry outcome or whether he simply wants to come in here and try to stir a pot, which is one that I would have thought anyone on his side of politics would have been extremely keen to stay a long way away from, given their record on forest policy. If one reads carefully the wording of the matter of public importance before us today, one will see that it states: The failure of the government to protect the environment while developing a coherent employment and industry strategy for Australia's forest industries. I have to say that I really do not think what was said by the member for Denison matches accurately what he plainly believes is the case in the wording of that MPI, because it actually does acknowledge that we are 'developing a coherent employment and industry strategy for Australia's forest industries'. That is what it says. It says we are 'developing a coherent employment and industry strategy for Australia's forest industries'. Thank you very much. You are right. That is in contrast to the performance that you put up in forest mismanagement during the 13 years of the Labor government. During that time we reached the absurd point in this country where, in direct contrast with every other major primary industry we have in the place, instead of exporting 60, 70, 80 or 90 per cent of our surplus, we are importing some $3 billion worth of our needs in timber and paper product. That is the result of Labor's forest and paper industry strategies and policies-if they can be called such. So thank you for the acknowledgment that yes, we are 'developing a coherent employment and industry strategy for Australia's forest industries'. I am interested that you really do not want that matter pursued. I will be keen, of course, to deny the other part of your proposition, which is that, although we are developing a coherent employment and industry strategy for Australia's forest industries, according to you, we are failing to protect the environment, because I do not accept that for a moment. I will come to some of your claims. I think a reasonably intelligent person who is listening might inappropriately draw the conclusion from what you were saying that you were advancing the proposition, firstly, that you were responsible for RFAs and that you were implementing them. That is not correct, and I will trace through that in a moment. You had years and years to get your act together and do something, and you failed abysmally. Secondly, although we have in fact established our credentials, we have the first RFA up. We had it up within a matter of months. After your constant stalling, constant trouble making and constant turmoil, we have a track record well in the process of being established. The first regional forest agreementEast Gippsland-is up under the coalition government. The fact that some people might have missed it is testimony to how well and how competently we handled it. It is in direct contrast to the sort of mess that we saw whenever you tackled the forest industry. Having said that, the other point I want to make in relation to Tasmania is that the RFA is in fact not completed. It is still being negotiated. So for you to assume or attempt to presume or to pretend that you actually know what is happening or what the basis for that RFA is-presumably, on the basis that you claim, all sorts of people have been telling you all sorts of things that I am sure they would not have been telling you-is wrong and inappropriate and does not add up. So the government are delivering on forests. We are delivering on forests and delivering results that the previous government was utterly unable to match. We are implementing the regional forest agreement process, not talking about it. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have the beginnings of the track record well and truly established-the foundation point from which we move on-and that is the successful completion of the regional forest agreement in East Gippsland. We are in the final stages of negotiation of the Tasmanian RF A, and work is well and truly in progress for regional forest agreements in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. We have been prepared to put our money where our mouth is: some $48 million of funding to boost regional forest agreement processes, to get them under way. I can say, too, that we have delivered on achieving national consensus for reserve criteria. Again, that is something that the ALP proved utterly unable to do in government. They procrastinated for three years. They put it in the too-hard basket while it all fell to pieces around their ears. Mr Kerr interjecting",89
172,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am intrigued. I did not have any trouble hearing, with great respect, what the member for Denison had to say. I am not quite sure why I waited around for it, but I am encouraged-that is perhaps the right word-that you obviously do not want to hear what I have to say. The fact of the matter is that in the end you tried a very, very heavy-handed approach with the states, and the states might remember that. They might remember the pressure that they were put under. They might remember the sorts of licensing requirements that they were expected to wear when those opposite attempt to offer them some succour and some encouraging words about how wonderful their forest policy might have been in the past or how constructive it might be in the future. The fact is that they have form and that form will not be readily forgotten by anybody who had anything to do with the forest industries. Mr Miles-Hear, hear!",90
173,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I know that the member for Braddon will have some interesting things to say about that form when he takes my place at this box in a few minutes. The fact is that we undid some of your heavy-handed work-some of that work that went so far to break down trust, some of that paternalistic, authoritarian, patronising attitude that filtered through with your relationships with the states that were so reflective of the way in which you approached so many issues when you were in government. We undid a lot of that and put in place a regime which, amongst other things, developed the goodwill which is driving the process forward in so much more of a constructive way now than we saw under you. We put in place a rational export licence regime for woodchips which removed uncertainty for industry and the associated threat to forest industry employment and investment. I am absolutely intrigued that, after years of doing nothing to support forest industry investment and employment, suddenly the crocodile tears are out and we are told that it matters, that they actually care about it. That they do not care about it is reflected in the fact that they do not have any rural and regional members to speak of on that side of the House. There was an election in March last year, and the people in rural and regional Australia-particularly those touched by the hopeless approach to the forest policy under the previous government-did not want to know about them any more. We have managed to revise the export regime for woodchips in a way that has ensured that environmental values are protected. This is reflective of our desire to see rational, sensible and robust regional forest agreements, and these will ensure-as in East Gippsland-conservation objectives and industry objectives are achieved. As for the RFAs, we will deliver conservation security and resource certainty, and that will provide a lasting basis for employment growth and industry investment. We are already starting to see that in East Gippsland. If you take the politics out and put sound policy in, decent results start to flow. I cannot help it but I want to come back to the ALP's record for just a moment. When I discovered that this MPI was being pulled I thought I should go back and have a quick look at their record. The national forest policy statement was signed in 1992. What happened for the rest of 1992 and 1993? Nothing. Mr Miles-How many RFAs?",90
174,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There was no progress made at all. In 1993-nothing. In 1994nothing but chaos. At the end of 1994 and early 1995, their chickens came home to roost. I am very surprised that the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) is here because I thought these would be rather painful memories for him. We saw an absolute outbreak in the papers. The headlines said 'Fresh talks as woodchip row gets nastier and out of control' and 'Loggers take swing at PM'. It is all right, Mr Howard. If you are watching on your television, that was the previous Prime Minister. They are not going to go for you. The Australian at that time had the headline 'Loggers set up Parliament blockade'. Other papers said 'Day the loggers besieged Parliament', 'Chips on shoulders, loggers lay siege', and 'Tempers flare at woodchip mill blockade'. What a record. Then we remember that, out of all of this in 1995, there was nothing but insecurity for industry and conservation. It got to the point where we had Faulkner saying one thing, we had Beddall saying another, then we had Collins dragged into the whole ugly mess, and then the Minister for Resources basically vacated the scene. We could not work out what he was doing with all those trips overseas, but we recognised that he was trying to make amends. He was flogging woodchips, we think, one at a time.",91
175,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,What about the industry strategy?,91
176,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Oh, the industry strategy! Thank you very much. I really wanted to say something about the industry strategy. We are hearing a lot about our alleged failure to introduce a forest industry strategy. It is simply not true. Let us get to the source of this rhetoric. The member for Denison knows what the source of that rhetoric is: it is the forest workers union. That is where that is coming from. The union is intensely embarrassed, perhaps even guilty, that it finds itself supporting not Labor but the coalition. That is where the forest workers union is putting its support. With us. Because we have a superior forest policy. We have got the runs on the board. There is no discredit in forest workers admitting federal Labor abandoned them long ago. It is true. Why should they be ashamed of that? But I want to say this. The government does have an industry strategy, and the wood and paper industry strategy-despite what we have just heard here-has been largely implemented. It contained a whole range of initiatives: $2Y2 million for research and development, delivered; $17 million for driving the development of farm forestry, delivered; lifting controls over exports of plantation grown wood, delivered in several states already; the national plantations inventory, completed; and sustainability criteria and indicators, being developed for each RF A. What we have not yet finalised is the Wood and Paper Industry Group-W APIG-but it is close. The terms of reference have been established. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has written to a number of key people inviting them to join WAPIG. But the name of the game is RFAs. That is what it is about. Resource certainty will be delivered by the RFAs which, belatedly, this Tasmanian representative now pronounces are what really matters.",91
177,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It's our RFA. Mr Anderson-Did you hear that') They are his RFAs. Well, I'll be! Is that why all those forest workers, having seen no action other than turmoil for four years, so comprehensively threw you out of government last time round? I am running out of time, which is a great pity because I have a lot more I would like to say. It is a pity these MPIs are so short. We could really explore the record if we had a bit longer. There are a few things I would like to say. Mr Stephen Smith-We'll move an extension.",92
178,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, why not. Let me come to the matter of plantations. It is quite obvious that there is a bit of confusion here about the relationship between plantations and RFAs. I suspect-and he has not spelt it out yet-that the $100 million project he is talking about has to do with plantations. It is worth making the point that RF As are about hardwood forests and about native forests, not about plantations. I assume someone on the opposite side of the chamber knows that. If they do not, they do now. When it comes to plantations, who is itwhich side of politics-that has put in place the 2020 vision where we are going to triple plantations in Australia by the year 2020? Who did that? Was that them? Was that done in the 13 years of Labor's forest policy? Silence, at last. Well, I'll be! Mr Fitzgibbon-I'm sorry, I wasn't listenmg.",92
179,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Don't feel obliged. Under that we will get real jobs growth and there will be a real opportunity to tum around that trade deficit that you left us in timber paper products. Let me bring you back to the question of Tasmania's RFAs. I want to make some very brief points. The member for Denison implied that there is infighting between Commonwealth ministers on the Tasmanian RF As. That is called projection: he is wishing on us failings that they so identify amongst their own ranks. Think of those names I mentioned a moment ago: Beddall, Faulkner, Bob Collins and then, when he got in the swim, the previous Prime Minister. Then you are talki ng about infighting over forestry: then you are really seeing what infighting over forestry is. The member needs to know that the Commonwealth has an agreed, united negotiating position for the Tasmanian RF A. It is not completed, but we do have a united negotiating position from our point of view. I support it. The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) supports it. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) supports it.",92
180,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,What is it?,92
181,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We know what it is and it is for you to wish you knew what it is. We can, we will and we desire to secure a positive future for the industry and employment and to deliver a better conservation outcome. We can have both: we can have our cake and eat it too. We can have a win-win. That is to say, there will be no loss in the volume of resources available to industry and, consequently, no loss of jobs. Indeed, we see the potential for significant growth in investment and in jobs-the very antithesis of what we saw under 13 years of Labor. (Time expired)",92
182,Mr QUICK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What a glib ministerial response from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). This is ridiculous. Tasmanians have had enough of this vacillating by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his relevant ministers-Senator Hill and Minister Anderson-over the whole RF A process. Tasmanians want this issue resolved right now. Tasmania has always been everyone's Whipping boy across a whole range of industry issues. With 460,000 people and only five federal seats, we are perceived as being and irrelevant and electorally dispensable. Despite what the minster has alleged, my colleague the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has eloquently put forward reasons why this is a real matter of public importance, especially for Tasmanians. The whole complex issue of forests-their usage by the timber industry, the preservation of rare and endangered species, the conservation and management of wilderness areas, and the issue of old-growth forest-has to be finally resolved. For too long, governments of all persuasions have pussyfooted around this sensitive and complex issue trying so unsuccessfully to placate both green and industry concerns. The RFA process was the only way to resolve once and for all this sensitive issue, to put some certainty back into the equation and to allow progress to take place-progress in establishing viable forest industries, progress in promoting more jobs in the forest industry, progress in establishing species reserves in perpetuity for future Australians and progress to stop the exporting offshore of jobs in the timber industry. The RF A process is the best and the only sensible way to resolve this complex issue, providing better outcomes for the environment and better outcomes for the forest industry. The process is based on science-assessment of the various forest types against the JANIS criteria. It is a transparent process which allows those participating in the process to be confident that the outcomes are properly achieved. Tasmania, however, is a classic example of how such a seemingly simple process can go so horribly wrong and leap right off the rails. All players in the process saw 30 June 1997 as the final sign-off date for the RF A process in Tasmania. The great expectation was that finally we were going to resolve this complex, sensible issue which has been a navel-gazing exercise for Tasmania for too long and has almost cleft asunder communities throughout Tasmania. We are now in the first week of September and no-one-I stress 'no-one'can say with any certainty when the signingoff will take place. The whole issue is like the gestation of a baby elephant: it just keeps going on and on. The failure to finalise this RFA process is causing unbelievable angst and anger right throughout Tasmania and is holding up in excess of $100 million worth of forest industry projects right now. With the Tasmanian Premier in the gallery, it is sad for me to say-and I do this in a bipartisan way-that Tasmania is close to becoming an economic basket case. It has the nation's highest unemployment rate, negative population growth, huge youth unemployment figures and little prospect of attracting new industries to the state with this whole uncertainty hanging over the place. One needs only to listen to Tasmanians talk about their home state. Never before-and I have been there since 1961-has there been so much negativity and hopelessness expressed by people from all walks of life. Tasmania is in a real meltdown mode. The Tasmanian Premier, who is sitting in the gallery, has unsuccessfully fought for a long period of time to convince the Prime Minister that there, is a simple and achievable solution to the whole stupid impasse. I am sure he has been listening intently to this debate. I think he has not really been convinced and reassured by what the minister has said in his 15 minutes at the dispatch box. There is a real requirement by the federal government to open its purse strings and provide Tasmania with the necessary dollars to allow the process to be finalised once and for all. In meeting the RFA requirements, it becomes obvious that it is not just about drawing lines on maps to include and exclude forest types and species. There is a real human dimension to this process, which the people in power in Canberra seem to forget. The inclusion of species in a reserve requires a management regime to be put in place, as the honourable member for Denison said, and this costs real dollars. People forced out of work as a result of this RFA process who are no longer employed in certain regions need money for transition and relocation to other jobs and other living centres. There is a realisation that Tasmania, probably because of its island status, has so many and so varied a range of forest species that it means not all of them are located on public land. You cannot have a successful RFA outcome in Tasmania without acquiring large tracts of privately owned land. What landowners in their right minds would willingly forgo private property without realistic and adequate compensation? As the honourable member for Denison said, if a successful RFA outcome means withdrawing four to five per cent of the forest resource from the timber industry then money for successful and constructive industry restructuring is urgently required. The federal government has a real obligation if the RFA is to be achieved and signed off, hopefully by the end of September 1997, to provide Tasmania with the necessary dollars. The RFA process will provide a win-win solution for jobs and the environment. The Prime Minister, Senator Hil1, and Minister Anderson, get your acts into gear and assist Tasmanianeglect our plight and you stand condemned.",92
183,Mr MILES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (4.09 p.m.)-I am very amused by the matter of public importance brought to us by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) because it must be the first time. I have heard him talk in this parliament about the forest industries. I want to quote the previous leader of the Labor Party in Tasmania. Mr Field said about the federal government in March 1995: The government's mismanagement of the export wood chipping issue had shown it was complacent and arrogant. He went on to say: Complacency and arrogance had crept into its actions and it was time it listened to the people's anger and frustration. The federal government had 12 months to learn the lesson of defeat. What happened? The Labor Party was defeated within 12 months of those comments being made. That was what the former Premier, the Labor Party leader, in Tasmania said about the record of the previous federal Labor government with regard to the forest industries. He summed it up pretty well-their record with regard to forest industries in this country was one of being complacent and arrogant. The member for Denison said that Tasmania or Australia was being dudded. I want to go back over their record. I know that the member for Denison does not want us to go back over the record. He says, 'Don't go down memory lane. Get on with it.' Of course the Labor Party do not want the Australian people to hear what their record was in trying to find a balance between the environment and the forest industries. With regard to being dudded, I want to remind the Australian people of what they did in Tasmania with the Helsham report. Let us go back and look at the record of the Labor Party just prior to that. In 1983, Kerin asked for an EIS on woodchip exports. In 1985 the EIS was completed. On 6 June 1986 a memorandum was signed between Ray Groom from Tasmania and the then federal minister for resources, Mr Kerin. Within six months that memorandum was brushed aside by the Labor Party and total1y forgotten. Because they wanted to bring politics into the whole situation the minister was instructed in late 1986 to have Mr Nix inquire into the Lemonthyme. They inquired into the Lemonthyme and got a report from Mr Helsham. I guess we ought to be reminded of what was said at the time by then Minister Richardson. He was reported on Labor in Power as saying, 'I picked Helsham because the Greens wanted him and he got it wrong.' What did Mr Helsham say? Based on scientific evidence, he said that there ought to be around 7,500 hectares set aside for world heritage listing. What did Richardson do? He just plucked a figure out of the air. With no scientific data, no scientific information, no research he said, 'Okay, 340,000 hectares. No, 7,500 hectares is no good.' He had a hand-picked committee do all the work on it and he then said, 'Sorry, that is not good enough.' That is the record of the Labor Party in power with regard to Tasmania. So they then implemented that decision. In December 1986, without discussing anything about Helsham with Tasmania, Hawke put out a press release announcing that there would be another major inquiry into world heritage values. By March 1987 what did we find? Minister Cohen had gone and Minister Richardson was in place for the 1987 election. What we found was total hypocrisy on the part of the Labor Party with regard to forest industries and trying to balance them with the environment in Tasmania. Would the Labor Party consider it on a scientific basis? No way, not the Labor Party. The Labor Party secretaries in Sydney had had a meeting and they told the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Hawke, that he had better do something about it and make sure he captured the Green vote. For the member for the Denison to come in here and cry crocodile tears about the forest industries in Tasmania is absolutely farcical. As I have said before, certainly not before they were thrown out of government did he talk about or give support to the forest industries in Tasmania. I have strongly supported the forest industries since I came here in 1984 and I continue to do it. No doubt the government outcome will create stability and security. Let us talk about W esley Vale for a few moments. That is a $1.2 billion project. You are talking about a $100 million project. What did you do? Richardson flew down and talked with the dark greens and scotched the whole deal. That is the Labor Party's record in regard to forest industries in this country. They were not concerned about a balance between the environment and the forest industries. They were not concerned about the workers. The other one was in 1992, when we had the pulp mill industrial dispute up in Burnie. We have the Labor Party here saying they really support the workers. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who was then President of the ACTU, came down there. He backed the workers. There were 1,323 working in that mill at that stage. Guess how many there are there today? Less than 500. All under the Labor Party policy. They really do back the workers! They really support a coherent employment and Australian forest industry strategy, don't they? That is their record. Mr Anderson-Never in government!",94
184,Mr MILES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Never in government. Of course, they do not want to come in here and talk about their record. Never! Because it is one of the most woeful records in this country in regard to the forest industry. In 1995 we had a series of debates in here with regard to forest industry. You could call it the coupes or the debacle in forest industries, and I want to say a little bit about that because it really was a bit of a joke. This is towards the end of the previous government. In 1995 they had a debate and they were trying to get this right. They started to talk about the forestry coupes. First of all, we had the then Prime Minister come into the parliament and talk about 513 coupes. Then he came in the next day and he talked about 509 coupes. Then Minister Lee came and said he thought 17 coupes should come off that list. Then, of course, Senator Faulkner said, 'No, I think we want 1,300 coupes.' But Mr Beddall said, 'No, we will have 85.' Do you know, when we got down to 509 coupes and we looked at where some of these coupes were in regard to Tasmania, they were out in Bass Strait. That is how much scientific work the previous Labor government did in regard to trying to find a scientifically based outcome for forestry and the environment. It was absolutely ludicrous. Mr Anderson-Remember the one that had a mine in it?",95
185,Mr MILES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, one had a mine in it. Mr Anderson-The one with the airstrip?",95
186,Mr MILES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Another one had an airstrip. Another one had a tip in it, I think. These were the coupes that they identified as pristine wilderness. The real worry for me was that you were going to have some of these nice old-growth forests floating out there in Bass Strait in a coupe as the Spirit of Tasmania went across. You can imagine what it was like. It was a shemozzle.",95
187,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Nine minutes gone and you have not addressed one word,95
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Denison will listen in silence.,95
189,Mr MILES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let me just say a little bit about what we do stand for. Coming into government, we said we would put $1.25 billion into environmental projects, and that is what we are going to do. Let me just run through some of those projects which we are going to put in, out of the Natural Heritage Trust. In regard to the land: national landcare. $280 million; bushcare: for the national vegetation initiative, $330 million; in regard to the rivers: the Murray-Darling 2000 project, $163 million; for rivercare, $97 million; under the trust: $106 million for the coast and clean seas initiative; and biodiversity, $80 million for national reserves. Of course, we are doing something about it. In regard to Tasmania and the RF A, there is no doubt that there will be a good solution come out of that for Tasmania and for the Australian people. There is one thing about this government: it has addressed this issue. It has listened to the Australian people and to the Tasmanian people. It is not complacent. There is stability coming into the forest industries and this debate, and there will be security for 20 years. (Time expired)",95
190,Mr CAMPBELL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I feel compelled to speak in this debate because the hyperbole on both sides is absolutely, gut-wrenchingly sickening. The truth is this: we are faced with a $3 billion deficit in timber products. We import into this nation $3 billion a year of wood products when we should be a net exporter. This is the result of the policies of both governments. Neither can escape the blame at all. It has not happened in the short term; it has happened over a considerable period. The hypocrisy goes on. In Western Australia, the Greens have got the balance of power in the upper house now. They have got that balance of power because they received preferences from the Liberal Party. That is why they have got control. Because they have got this balance of power you are going to see the incumbent Liberal government do all sorts of trades. I will project this: that the head of Dr Syd Shea, the Director of CALM, is on the block. The Greens want Syd Shea because he has been the one that has stood up to them, not just in Western Australia but across Australia. They want that and they will get that, I guess. They also want, of course, to split the Department of Conservation and Land Management back into two different departments, hoping that they can hijack the environment as the environment was hijacked in this place by the Greens. But who are the Greens? Let us analyse who they are. Basically, there are three people who vote Green. There is a protest voter. In my electorate most of them now vote for me. There is that great mass in the middle: largely uninformed, largely on government salaries, and they are the people who think trees are people too. Then there are the people who run the Greens. That is where the communists went when you had the breakdown of the eastern European economic model. You will all recall that when the eastern European model failed the Communist Party disappeared in Australia. The people did not disappear. They went to the Green movement, to the Aboriginal industry, to the feminists, to the homosexual lobbies, and they brought with them the Marxist doctrine of incrementalism. You have all seen that: 'All we are asking for is just a little bit here; just give us a little bit of old-growth forest, that is all we want.' The public says, 'Let's shut them up, okay.' They acquiesce and the response is immediate: 'Thank you very much, now all we want is this.' The policy of incrementalism: straight out of Trotsky. That is what we have been subjected to. You have got to look at the performance of the previous government, a government that was supposed to look after workers. Coronation Hill: it was illegal when Hawke did it. It might have taken some time, but the High Court eventually ruled that way. As the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) said in respect to Wesley Vale, that was not a great success for the previous government-workers jobs were sacrificed. The problem you have is this: Tasmania is in a diabolical situation. It is dying on its feet. But it is not dying through natural causes. Tasmania is being murdered by the policies of this government and the previous government. Until there is a recognition of the need for a manufacturing industry in this countryand I suggest that the timber industry and downstream processing are a vital part of that manufacturing industry-you will see Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia die. It will be hidden for a time in Victoria, where there is the casino-led recovery. But I can assure you that will come to a very sudden end very quickly. In this House this present government talk about providing $100 million for a railway in the Northern Territory-a railway they know has no economic foundation at all. There is no basis for it whatsoever. If the $100 million is spent, that will be only a fraction of what will be required and that will leave the taxpayers of Australia with an ongoing burden. That is simply a stunt to win a state election in the Northern Territory and the coming election in South Australia. Not one member from Tasmania got up in this House and said, 'Fair go. Let's have some resources for Tasmania.' Tasmania is much more important than the Northern Territory to the welfare of this nation. Quite frankly, what we ought to do with the Northern Territory is get realistic and whack it up amongst the surrounding states. That is the best solution for the Northern Territory. It would solve quite a few problems and, believe me, it would be much more economical. In rising to speak, we are faced with a government that says it has an industry policy. But has it? This government embraces the Hilmer report-the creation of the previous government. The Hilmer report is high school economics-it is absolute nonsense. The talk about situations where natural monopolies occur and about competition is simply childish. Unfortunately, the government also embraces the Mortimer report. It cannot have it both ways. Those reports are mutuaIly exclusive. The Mortimer report, I think, is a very flawed document but at least it is moving in the right direction. I note the Mortimer report says that the government should not pick winners, and then he proceeds to do so but of course picks all the wrong winners-like a national industry capacity in tool making. That used to exist, largely in Tasmania, but has now gone. This is something we desperately need for our national security. It is an industry of strategic importance to Australia. It has gone. We have seen under successive governments, the last one and this one, a deskilling of this nation; and it is not going to change with the present attitude. Unless we get back to a reskilling of this nation, there is going to be no end to the problems we face. I must pay tribute to the member for Franklin (Mr Quick). He got one thing right. When he said that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) was glib. He is absolutely right there. He is very glib and he is articulate. Unfortunately, he is also a fool, and there is no greater danger to a nation than a glib, articulate fool. The truth is: this whole policy of economic rationalism is what is driving this debate. We have seen an industry crippled. The minister talks about assistance and what the Commonwealth government has done. I can tell you what the Commonwealth should do: it should butt right out. The best forest management techniques in Australia probably reside in Western Australia and Tasmania-they are both very good. But any state, even the worse state, has infinitely more capacity than the federal government in respect of forest management. This is clearly an issue that should be left to the states. It is not an issue for Commonwealth intervention at all. If it had been left to the states, we would not have that $3 billion deficit. We had a situation in Victoria where the Greens would not allow logs lying on the forest floor to be harvested, whether they were A, B, C or D grade logs. The good timber could have been taken off into flitch mills and the rest could have been pulped. Why didn't the Greens want that? Because the Greens knew that this gave the capacity to establish a pulp mill at Eden and they knew that, once a pulp mill was established, they would not be able to stop it. While the pulp mill had not been established they could continue to attack forest management. They knew that once the mill was established, once so many jobs were created, they would not be able to stop it. For years, particularly under the Kirner government, this was the situation. That was also the situation under the previous government and no action was taken to stop it. If you returned the control of forests to the states, you would see better forest management outcomes in this country and you would see much better forest management. I attended a lecture today by Professor Castles. He said that it surprised was fairly obvious from his research, that governments that had centralised fiscal policies had much worse economic outcomes than those that did not. There is no more centralised economy in the world than Australia, although I think he ranks us third in the world. It is certainly a very highly centralised economy in terms of the power of the federal government, and the stupidity of the High Court has compounded that. The message is clear: you get much better economic outcomes with decentralisation. The problem is: I do not know of any political party in this nation that is going to sacrifice the power it wants for itself in the national interest. It would probably be an illusion think that would happen. However, I serve warning on this House. I, through Australia First, will be contesting every Senate seat in the next election, will contesting lower house seats across Australia and will be contesting state elections. lieve that we could have the balance of power. When we have the balance of power and drive out the Democrats, who are the left wing of the Labor Party, and the Greens, the Communist Party, we might start to get some sensible policy direction in this country.",96

192,Mr ANTHONY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Richmond) (4.30 p.m.)It is a pleasure to resume the debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 [No.2] after we were interrupted by question time. The reason the government is making this decision is that it was recommended to us by the industry to remove the tariff. If the Queensland industry, which represents 95 per cent of sugar production, said otherwise, then to I would be quite happy the comply with that. But that was a decision that they made. Many people have asked, 'Why aren't you crossing the floor?' I am not crossing the be floor on this issue because I do not want to jeopardise the very package that we fought I behard to achieve in New South Wales. To reiterate the point to this parliament, that package involves additional money which will go to infrastructure which will assist the New or South Wales industry to get back in the export market where, to date, they have been principally capturing the refined sugar market and to likewise gain access to the lucrative US quota market. There is symbolism for those that do cross the floor today-the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) is one-and I respect their wish Report to do that. In many ways, the member for Kennedy has a legitimate grievance because the abolition of the pooling system will have a significant impact on his area. From the report evidence I have presented today, even if a tariff was put back in place, it would have no impact on the domestic price of sugar because the pricing formula has been changed by the Queensland Sugar Corporation from import parity to export parity. Likewise, the tariff issue is very different to the automotive because the sugar industry were unanimous in their recommendation to remove it. Indeed, if they did feel passionately for about it, they could have put in a dissenting What is interesting in this whole debate is the hypocrisy of the opposition in arguing this case. They were the ones that initiated the very inquiry which recommended it. They were the ones that appointed the panel which was made up of the Queensland government at the time, which was ALP, and by the federal government at the time, which was also ALP. They obviously have been very opportunistic. As the Australian Financial Review said it is 'contemptuous opportunism of the Labor opposition'. They have been contemptuous of rural Australia for quite some time. Indeed, when you look back at the history of rural Australia and the added concentration of foreign ownership, it was principally because they modified the foreign ownership rules. Examples are the added concentration in the meat industry and the takeover of vertical integration by foreign companies not just in sugar but in many other sectors. They have failed also to implement anti-dumping measures. That is what this government will attempt to do to act as a legitimate barrier to foreign imports coming into this country, which is absolutely essential. (Time expired)",98
193,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I am very pleased to take part in the debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 [No.2] and to make some comments in respect of the proposal by the government to abolish the sugar tariff. The member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), who has just concluded his remarks, posed a question to himself as to why he was not crossing the floor on this issue. The reason he is not crossing the floor on this issue is that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) told him not to. He made a very technical speech which avoided the two central features of the government's abolition of the sugar tariff. The first one is the black hole which was the promise they all made. The second one is the assertion, which I will forensically disprove, that the industry generally is in favour of this proposal. Where is the starting point for this debate? The starting point for this debate is the commitment that the government made to the people of Australia and to the cane growers and sugar growers of New South Wales and Queensland in the run-up to the last election. That is found in the paper released on Monday, 5 February 1996 by the National Party Deputy Leader and the then shadow minister for primary industries, Mr John Anderson, MP, now the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It is entitled Reviving the heartland: building a sustainable future for Australia's primary industries. In that document we find the following comments: The Liberal and National Parties wish to create an economic environment in which the sugar industry continues to expand, and point out that the Commonwealth has no legislative control over the industry other than in the area of tariff protection. The Liberal and National Parties recognise the industry's tariff protection has been significantly reduced over the years to its current level of $55 a tonne as Australia has set the trend by moving protection downwards in advance of international competitors. The paper goes on to say in bold, which reflects a specific commitment: A Liberal-National Government will: not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55/ tonne as we have already met our obligations under the World Trade Organisation (GATT '94) agreements; recognise and uphold the Queensland Government's responsibility for administering the single desk export arrangements in that State; maintain the Commonwealth sugar infrastructure development program. That is an express and specific commitment given by the coalition in the run-up to the last election not to reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level. Why? Because Australia had already met its current GATT obligation or WTO obligation of $55 a tonne. That was the express and unequivocal commitment which the coalition went to the last election with. That was an express and personal commitment which each and every member in the various sugar seats gave to their constituents and to the various cane and sugar growers in the course of their election campaigns. It was personally given by the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), it was personally given by the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly), it was personally given by the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), it was personally given by the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), it was personally given by the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), it was personally given by the member for Page (Mr Causley), and it was personally given by the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), and he just told us that he is proposing to break it. It has become clear over the weeks and months that, at this stage, the only person on whom we can rely to meet that commitment to the various electorates is the member for Kennedy, Mr Katter. It will be interesting to see whether the member for Dawson, Mrs DeAnne Kelly, can find some way of moving around that commitment when she makes her contribution. One of the points made by those members of the coalition who are proposing to break that personal undertaking to their constituents is that somehow the industry has been in favour of this breach of election commitment. Let me take the House briefly through some reports which have occurred following the government's announcement of its decision in March of this year to abolish the tariff. On 4 March, under an item entitled 'Farmers Angered as Sugar Tariff Scrapped', AAP reports: Cane farmers in both Queensland and New South Wales criticised the decision while National backbenchers reversed their previously scathing stance on the tariff plan. One should of course except the member for Kennedy. That report goes on to say: Australian Cane Farmers Association general manager John Allison said cane growers had been handed an ultimatum of choosing between tariffs and singledesk selling. Mr Allison was reported as going on to describe the decision as 'unacceptable, undemocratic' and made 'without discussion'. He says: There is a grounds well of opinion and overwhelming opposition to the recommendations to remove the tariff. The report also has Australian Sugar Millers Council general manager, John Desmarchelier, saying: ... large numbers of growers and millers would disagree with the decision. On the same day, on 4 March, the transcript of the PM program records Mr Ian Ballantyne, the General Manager of Canegrowers Queensland, saying: If either side of government could have guaranteed our industry that the retention of the tariff would have also guaranteed retention of our other marketing and structural arrangements, then we would have probably had a different approach. In very subtle words, he was saying what other people have said much more robustlythat a gun was held at the head of the cane growers to choose the single desk arrangements or the tariff but not both. On 6 March, AAP records Australian cane farmers joining a 'protest chorus'. The Australian Cane Farmers Association general manager is reported as saying: Cane farmers from Mossman in north Queensland to Maclean in New South Wales have been scathing in their assessment of the recommendations by the Sugar Industry Review Working Party. There is a grounds well of opinion and overwhelming opposition to the recommendation to remove the tariff. And he repeats his comments about the undemocratic and unacceptable manner in which the decision has been made. In an earlier report in the Courier-Mail in February, 'Sugar tariffs set for axe despite Party revolt', Canegrowers Queensland chairman, Harry Banano, is reported as saying that cane growers 'had reluctantly accepted the tariff's demise as part of a compromise to retain the single desk selling arrangement.' The only member of the government in this House who can hold his or her head up high at this stage is the member for Kennedy. The member for Kennedy has been crystal clear in his approach to this matter from day one. On 5 March on the PM program he is reported as saying: There will be a loss in Queensland to about $4,000 on average of every single producer in the State, every single cane farmer. In a downturn in the industry, the industry's reasonable prices at the present moment, in a cyclical downturn the situation will be very, very difficult. Mills will be put under threat, farms will be put under threat and we'll have the same sort of situation flowing across to the sugar industry that exists in the cattle and wool industries of Australia. And the export earnings that are coming from what is a very, very successful industry that is remaining internationally competitive, in spite of subsidies of 193 per cent, that they're performing in the marketplace against. .. The reference to the 193 per cent of course is a reference to the European Union tariff in respect of sugar, which is at that level. Mr Katter is asked: What is the point of threatening to cross the floor when the Cane Growers organisation seems to be quite happy with the situation? Mr Katter replies: The Cane Growers organisation most certainly isn't. They were forced at (sic) a gun at their They were told, we'll deregulate and leave you at the mercy, the tender mercies, of the international processes and traders. Or, alternatively, you can agree to take the tariffs off'. They agreed with a gun at their head. That's absolute rubbish and it's a very scurrilous comment, if anyone says that the Cane Growers Association, or the Cane Farmers' Association, agreed to this. They most certainly did not and do not at this point of time. So the honourable member for Kennedy in a crystal-clear manner debunks, on the basis of best evidence, the notion that somehow mythically and mystically the cane growers and the sugar growers are in favour of the government breaking an express election commitment that was part of its primary industries platform at the last election and made individually and personally by the various members that I have named. Later that month Mr Katter, in an interview on Sydney Radio 2UE on 19 March with John Laws, is reported as saying: John, I don't look for these things but, I mean, I find myself once again embroiled in conflict with the sugar industry. But, I mean, I gave a personal promise before the last election. I mean, I stood up and told the people of the electorate that I that I will not be voting for any tariff reduction in the sugar industry. He goes on to say: ... I made my position very clear in the Party room. But we also gave an election promise here, John, as well. I mean, the Government, or the now Government of Australia, before the election we said on page 32 of our policy document, a Liberal/National Government will not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55.00 a tonne, as we have already met our obligations under the World Trade Organisation GATT '94 agreement. In that subsequent interview, the member for Kennedy makes the point that this was a personal undertaking given by him; it was a personal undertaking given by the various members that I have named. And he is the only one who is prepared to come into this House and say that he will do what he committed himself to do-namely, vote against the government's proposal, in breach of its express election commitments, to abolish the sugar tariff. That quote from the member for Kennedy stands in stark contrast to the head. Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), who on 11 June on the ABC PM program is asked by the reporter, in respect of the sugar tariff: You obvious Iy thought before the election that the tariffs were significantly important enough to guarantee that they remained in place? In one of those massive understatements, the minister says: Well, we indicated that we were within what was required by WTO and those sorts of parameters and that we therefore saw no need to move. He massively understates as best he can the express election commitment that the member for Kennedy has drawn so clearly to our attention. Who do we have left of the seven sugar seat holders, all of whom made express personal commitments to the community, to their electorates, to cane growers and sugar growers and to the Australian people at the last election? There is only one who we know at this point in the cycle will hold true to that commitment. We will hear shortly from the member for Dawson, but the member for represent Hinkler, the member for Leichhardt, the member for Herbert, the member for Richmond and the member for Page stand in stark contrast to the honourable way in which the member for Kennedy is proposing to conduct himself. The member for Richmond, when he concluded his remarks after being interrupted by question time, made some comments about the Labor Party's position in this matter. Our position in respect of this matter in the run-up to the last election was quite clear: yes, we had engaged in a process of reducing tariffs in the sugar industry, but the commitment that we took to the last election was to review the sugar tariff effective from July this year and we look at it in the context of the next agricultural round of the WTO. Our commitment was to review. We have done our review. We have come to the conclusion which could not be put better than the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) did in a question to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 5 March. The Leader of the Opposition said to the Prime Minister, by way of question: Is it not a fact that Australia's Uruguay Round obligation for sugar is a tariff of $70 per the year 2000? Is it not the case that the current tariff, abolished by the government yesterday $55 per tonne-an effective 13 per cent-is comfortably within that obligation? Is it not case that the sugar tariff on many of our export destinations is massively higher than that? example, the US is at 100 per cent, Thailand 104 per cent and the European Union is at 170 cent. How does the government's establishment a zero sugar tariff for Australia stand with Prime Minister's statement to the parliament year that the government would take into account what other countries are doing or, as the Australian Financial Review puts it, 'PM says we won't go alone on tariff cuts'? Why has the government given our trading partners something for nothing sugar? That is the context in which the Labor Party stands so far as the sugar tariff is concerned. I refer to one of the industry leaders said, 'If a political party had said to us, ""You can have the tariff and the single desk aras rangements,"" we'd go for that.' That is our position: you can have the tariff and you can have the single selling desk arrangements. the government had to do to effect that was to stick to the commitment that it expressly gave to cane growers in the course of the election campaign.

196,Mr MCLACHLAN,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Yesterday at question time the member for Brisbane asked me a question about Headquarters Northern Command and its provision of information about the service rank of personnel. I reported my initial findings and advice back to the House last night just after 9.30. I received further advice today from the tonne by Commander, Northern Command, including a statutory declaration from his senior public at relations officer. Following this advice, I am not satisfied that the original advice I was the given last night is accurate, and therefore I For have today asked the Vice Chief of the is at Defence Force, Admiral Barrie, to look into per the matter. In the process, I invite the member of for Brisbane to provide any material which he the might think is appropriate in this matter. I last table the most recent reports from the Commander, Northern Command, including the it statutory declaration that I am talking about. Secondly, and more importantly, I think on probably inadvertently the member for Brisbane, while raising a bit of a political stunt, has raised the issue of the Privacy Act and whether or not rank details should be released when other details-name, address and so forth-are provided by a military authority or who a military commander. I have asked Admiral Barrie whether he would look into this matter to current practice, whether it happens on a weekly, daily or monthly basis and whether the Privacy Act is in fact operating against the All good and sensible release of such rank. I will just give an example while I am on my feet: the roll of honour which was put out last in the Australian of 14 January after we rescued the various Frenchmen and the itinerant Englishmen who were 2,300 or 2,400 kilometres south of Perth. There are well over 100 names and their rank-as I see it, having briefly looked at it-for the crew of the Adelaide. I table that. As well, I notice that after Somalia an excellent book was produced called Through Aussie Eyes. There is a list of some hundreds-or even perhaps thousands; I have not counted themof people who were involved in that: their names, ranks, numbers, birth dates and so on. I just raise that because I think it is an important point and it would be a pity if the Privacy Act prevents us from releasing the names of people and their ranks in any circumstances when the commander thinks it is appropriate. Now, I do take the point about security, but I have to say that I am sure that in not in all issues is security important. I come back with a report on those issues at the next session.",102

199,Mr BEVIS,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Minister for Defence for his advice this afternoon. I acknowledge the issues that he has now raised. I must say I would not want to see curtailed the good and sensible publication of military personnel's identification in the sorts of examples that the minister has given. There are publications and reports from time to time of deeds of valour and other things of that sort which military personnel have undertaken, whether that is in peacekeeping operations or in civil defence activities such as floods, fires and the like the sorts of things the minister has referred to. I am sure it would not be the wish of anyone in the House for those matters to be constrained. If that is the case, I think there would be goodwill on all sides to address that. But I do appreciate the minister's advice today in the chamber. Thank you. Mr MCLachlan- Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the member for Dawson for her indulgence as well.

200,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997. I advise the House that I am a cane grower, as everybody around the Mackay district is, and that should be taken into consideration in the comments that I make. I will start by outlining the history of the sugar industry review working party recommendations, since that is central to the argument in the debate. There were 76 recommenwill dations but only two of them are relevant to this debate. The first was that single desk selling and acquisition should be retained for the sugar industry. It is absolutely vital to have those regulatory arrangements retained, certainly for the Queensland sugar industry. Those who were involved in the sugar industry review quite rightly made a judgment that the single desk selling and acquisition arrangements should be kept and that there was perhaps some threat to them. They decided, for their own reasons, reluctantly to relinquish the tariff. It was a sound judgment in the best interests of the industry. I will go back a little further in history and deal with what happened in 1989, because that is when the embargo on sugar being imported into Australia was lifted. And do you know who did that, Mr Deputy Speaker? It was the Labor Party. The National Party moved to introduce a tariff of $110 per tonne at that time, and it was successful. In 1991, the tariff of $110 per tonne was reduced to $76 per tonne. Again, who did that? The Labor Party did that. In 1992, the $76 per tonne tariff was reduced to $55 per tonne. Again, who did that? The Labor Party did it. While they stand over there and bleat about how sanctimonious they are, it is they, on every occasion, who have removed regulatory arrangements in the sugar industry. Let us think for a moment about those tariff reductions. Have consumers benefited? That was the argument put by the Labor Party. Again, it was the Labor Party which put forward in the Hilmer competition policy that consumers would benefit. I would like to show you that consumers have not benefited at all from reductions in the tariff under Labor Party. Since 1989, when the tariff was reduced from $110 per tonne, the price of chocolate across six states has increased on average by 52 per cent. What about soft drink and cordials? It is interesting, by the way, that you cannot get these figures from the Australasian Soft Drink Association; they will not let them out. The price increase for soft drink and cordials over that period has been 34.7 per cent. Over that period the CPI has risen by 29 per cent. What was the tariff worth? It is rather difficult to estimate over that period because of varying prices, but it would be in the order of $142 million. That is the amount that has gone from farmers-to where? Quite plainly, it has not gone to consumers. It has gone into the pockets of multinational commercial users of sugar. That has occurred under the Labor Party's policy. That is where it has gone. There has been no benefit to consumers or to farmers. Yet the Labor Party stand here hypocritically and pretend that they are on side of the farming sector. The shadow minister recently went to Mackay. Do you know what he said about the farming sector and the sugar industry? He said he was in Mackay for a free kick. He just wanted a free kick for the Labor Party. He wanted to find out what he could use in debate. He was not interested in the long-term future of the industry. Plainly, with a history like that, how could you pretend to be? What about the member for Hotham (Mr Crean)? The member for Hotham was asked recently, on behalf of the farming sector, to assist. Of course, he knows what his response was. I do not think he is very popular at the moment. I will not go into that, but perhaps he would care to come into the House and tell people how he broke an agreement with the sugar industry. The suggestion put forward by the sugar industry review working party was that the tariff be removed and that the regulatory arrangements be retained. Implicit in that was a commitment from the coalition government that the same economic rationale would apply to all industries equally. If that had been the the case, I think that would have been an equitable outcome. It would have been very hard to argue against the fair and equitable treatment of all industries with regard to the tariff. But, of course, as subsequent events have shown, that has not been the case. The car industry, which has a present tariff of 22.5 per cent, is to have a gradual reduction to IS per cent by the year 2000. It will be held at that level until the year 2005, when the tariff will supposedly go to 10 per cent. We will see whether that happens. It seems likely that the textiles, clothing and footwear industries will receive similarly lenient treatment. What does it cost the farming sector for those tariffs to be retained? An estimate from Access Economics is that, for those other tariffs that remain, every farmer pays $2,300 per year. But they have lost their tariff, so you are paying on the one hand but you are not being given relief on the other. That is a very inequitable arrangement. The commitment was not kept in other ways as well. On the sugar task force, which the has yet to report-and I do not wish to preempt their findings-the concern, certainly from cane growers in Queensland, is that New South Wales will be given access to Australia's US sugar quota. If that comes to fruition, the cost to a Queensland grower would be $300 per annum. The benefit to a New South Wales farmer would be $3,500 per annum. To a Queensland mill, the loss would be $25,000 per annum. The benefit to New South Wales mills-and I am very pleased that my New South Wales colleagues are here and, furthermore, that they are on the sugar task force; I hope that they will bear this in mind-will be $330,000 per annum. I do not recall that we had agreed in Queensland to give away part of our US sugar quota without a commensurate agreement from New South Wales that they would share in securing our single desk selling arrangements. The tariff has a limited use to the farming sector. Because of the move from import parity pricing to export parity pricing, the tariff now has one sole objective, that is, to act as a disincentive to imported sugar coming into Australia-that would be imported, refined, subsidised sugar coming into Australia. Bearing in mind that the commercial users of sugar have already got the benefit of the tariff with this move from import parity pricing to export parity pricing, the money is in their pocket. Let us not forget that they are the beneficiaries, not the consumer-and certainly not the farming sector and my regional towns. So they have the money in the pocket. Why is it then that the Australasian Soft Drink Association are pushing so hard for the tariff to be removed? Why would they be asking for that if they already have the money? Mr Gentile, who was on the sugar industry review working party-a man, unfortunately, who, while he may have an argument, certainly has no manners-has referred to the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and myself as 'sugar dogs'. When you have to resort to that language, quite plainly you do not have a very strong argument. And that is the case. Mr Gentile does not have a strong argument. He knows that it is his representatives, his clientele, who are the beneficiaries of the move to export parity pricing to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. Furthermore, he knows that he is not going to give a commitment to the Australian people that the benefit of removing the tariff will be passed on. They did not do it in the past and they are not going to do it again. So when you know that you are deceiving the Australian people, you resort to poor language. Moving back to the final role of the tariff as a disincentive to subsidised imported refined sugar coming into Australia, there is a very real threat of that, mainly because Australia is one of the few countries in the world that does not subsidise its farmers. Thailand, for instance, subsidises its farmers to a great extent. For the first five years of production, there is no tax. Imagine a tax holiday for five years. It would be pretty good-and it is in Thailand. The other thing is that the price is subsidised. When our Australian farmers are getting 10c per pound, Thai farmers are getting in the order of 23c per pound-nice if you can get it. That also means that they are in a very good position to export highly subsidised sugar into other markets. The United States likewise, because of their quota system, artificially raises the returns to their farmers. When our price is lOc per pound, theirs is in the order of 19c per pound-these are all in the same currency. What would happen if we had subsidised imported refined sugar coming into Australia? Mr Gentile and the Australasian Soft Drink Association would not only be able to keep the money from the tariff in their pockets, not only continue to raise prices to the level that they have since 1989, but they would have cheap feed-stock-really cheap feed-stock, very cheap feed-stock-which would further fatten their profits. But I bet you will not see the price of soft drink or chocolate go dowll. I bet families will not be able to buy sugar to put in their products at home any cheaper. Consumers will be no better off than they have been since 1989. What will happen to jobs in the sugar towns-in Mackay, Ingham, Innisfail, Proserpine, Home Hill, Ayr, Tully and Cairns? I can tell you what will happen. Our jobs and investment in our industry will go overseas. It is a lose-lose situation. While the opposition sits over here smugly saying, 'Oh, my goodness, look at us; we've changed,' they were the hypocritical group which allowed this to happen since 1989. They have no credibility in this debate. The only party that has kept faith consistently with the farmers, particularly the cane farmers in this country, has been the National Party. I have one further difficulty. In our coalition policy prior to the last election it said that the coalition 'would retain the tariff at $55 per tonne because it had complied with all Australian obligations as a signatory under the World Trade Organisation'. I accept that there has been a recommendation from the leaders of industry and from the sugar industry review working party; however, bearing in mind that the commitments that were made to the farmers have not been kept in full, I find it very difficult to walk away from a commitment such as that. One further matter of concern in the farming sector is the future of single desk selling and acquisition. The matter of the tariff and whether it is to be retained or abolished will finally be decided in the Senate, but there is a concern that the federal government might revisit the review. If the government is unsuccessful it might be embittered enough to go back and break yet another deal with the cane farmers of this country. I hope that that would not be the case. However, I did not just rely on the good intentions of government---either this one or the last one. In May, I wrote to the Premier of Queensland, Mr Rob Borbidge, and asked him what his reaction would be were the move to abolish the tariff lost in the Senate. Fortunately, Mr Borbidge is man who knows very clearly whom he represents and he also knows what a commitment is. Mr Borbidge wrote back to me and told me that I could assure the cane growers of Australia-and particularly of Queensland, because it is Queensland state government legislation-that the regulatory arrangements in the sugar industry belong with the state. He told me that regulatory arrangements in the sugar industry, single desk selling and acquisition, were absolutely fundamental to the prosperous future of everybody who made their livelihood from the sugar industry. Mr Borbidge also said that there is absolutely no way that a Queensland National Party state government would consider changing those. He said that, if the federal government found difficulties in implementing all of the recommendations from the sugar industry review working party, that was a matter for the federal government, but Queensland would fulfil all of its commitments. I am very pleased to say that, regardless of the debate in this House and the Senate, the regulatory arrangements for the sugar industry are secure under a National Party state government. I totally support the Premier of Queensland in his stand, and I am pleased to see that he is going to keep his commitment to the sugar industry. There has been a great deal of hypocrisy in this debate. It is very easy, like a dingo, to run into a camp and then change your mind and run out again. It is very easy to be hypocritical when those on that side of politics have been responsible, since 1989, for reductions in all the regulations in the sugar industry. I do not think the hypocrisy on this side of the House will be lost on the farming sector, particularly the cane farming sector in Queensland. I am very pleased that the National Party always keeps faith with the farming sector.",103
201,Ms HANSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Oxley) (5.11 p.m.)Australia was once a proud, strong, manufacturing nation. In many ways we were independent and self-reliant, a product perhaps of our relative isolation and need. The Second World War caused us, because of that isolation and the imminent threat of invasion, to industrialise on a scale not previously imagined for a country of our population. Today Australians face a new threat: not so much invasion from outside but defeat from within. Australians face the threat of the policies of their own government, a government that for many years has worked against the interests of the majority of the population; a government seemingly prepared to scrap its own people for reasons that are unclear, though there are many theories. While the reasons are decidedly unclear as to why so many destructive policies have been undertaken by government, the devastation that has resulted is obvious to all. In 1961, 27.5 per cent of' Australians were employed in the manufacturing industry, yet today that figure is around 12 per cent and falling. In 1961, unemployment stood at 2.6 per cent but today, even though we are told that unemployment is 8.7 per cent, no-one believes this and many suspect and believe that hundreds of thousands of unemployed people are simply hidden in various other programs. For the last 25 years, both Liberal and Labor have taken us down the path of free trade and globalisation. Though it sees countless Australian businesses and manufacturers disappearing or moving overseas to use the cheap work forces of foreign lands, though it sees farmers forced from their land and Australian companies no longer in Australian hands, though it sees untold numbers of Australians losing not just their jobs but their hope, the government continues to relish its pursuit of an agenda which fails the people who elected it. Instead of providing jobs or incentives to create employment, the government tries to make people feel better by providing counselling, the dole, sickness benefits and courses that lead to other courses. The government's policies have the effect of cold and flu tablets-you feel a little more comfortable but you are still sick. We have been sold out by our elected representatives to multinationals with trade agreements of no benefit to ordinary Australians. We are fed up with being told about the level playing field and tired of being the only ones playing this game; a game in which Australians cannot break even, let alone win, because other countries maintain their tariff barriers, quotas and other mechanisms to protect their own industries and jobs. Obvious as this is to working Australians, our politicians fail to see or feel the anguish of our own people. Are politicians isolated from other Australians and removed from the truth seen in cities, suburbs and country towns across Australia, or is it something more sinister? On 1 July 1997, our government once again exposed an agenda lacking clear explanation or understanding. They dropped tariff protection on raw sugar and certain by-products, while other countries maintained high levels of protection. Thailand-perhaps our biggest competitor in this industry-maintains a tariff of 104 per cent. The United States, where the standard of living is much higher than that of Thailand but not as high as our own, maintains a tariff of 170 per cent. Free trade and the level playing field only work when the countries involved have a similar standard of living. Pursuit of such policies between countries with vastly different standards of living will result in a change for each country. Australia's decline is the perfect example. The report of the sugar industry review working party, dated December 1995, stated that $30 million per year would be slashed from the income of cane farmers in Queensland and New South Wales. The average farm cash income of Queensland's sugar growers has now faJlen $3,000 per year due to the abolition of the sugar tariff. It is said that New South Wales sugar growers will suffer even greater losses. This money, which individually may not seem much to the very well looked after members of this House or to the directors of big business, has now been taken-one might say stolen-from rural communities. Since removing the sugar embargo in 1989, they have reduced the tariff from $115 per tonne to nothing. Yet, while they have continued to make sugar cheaper and the growers poorer, it seems that not even the Australian consumer has benefited. During these same years, the price of chocolate, soft drinks and cordials has also risen way above the CPI. The only obvious beneficiary of this tariff abolition is the almost 100 per cent foreign owned beverage and confectionary industry, which has apparently failed to pass on its savings to the Australian public. The textiles, clothing and footwear industries are also heading for oblivion. Tariff protection for the clothing industry will be reduced from 34 per cent to five per cent by 2008. On top of this, government assistance to this industry has already been reduced by 70 per cent in the past decade. Once again, while our government leads the way for the destruction of all that is Australian and Australian made, other countries are delaying. The US and Europe have introduced more quotas for TCF. Europe also makes extensive use of anti-dumping duties, and the US has modified its rules of origin to further protect its domestic market. The Industry Commission's draft report concedes that these countries will not abolish quotas on sensitive items until 2005. However, contrary to this report, the US and China have already negotiated to safeguard quotas until the year 2010. How they must all rub their hands together and laugh at the stupidity of Australia's desperate rush to destroy itself. While others continue to negotiate to protect their industries and jobs, Australians open their newspapers each day to find more of our manufacturing becoming a thing of the past as they read of closures and job losses: Berlei, 180 jobs; Gloweave, 85 jobs; Coats Patons, 170 jobs; DuPont, 160 jobs-to name but a few. With these go hundreds of indirect jobs as well. In the case of the loss of 180 jobs at Berlei from the small town of Lithgow, this is another kick in the guts for a community already isolated and suffering. For those who lose their jobs through government policies, the future is grim. Only 47 per cent of TCF workers find new jobs within two years of their retrenchment-and, of these, more than one-third accept employment at a lower wage. Each of these closures devastate hundreds of Australian families as people struggle to find work, with many forced to accept a much reduced standard of living just to survive. With more than 700,000 children now living in families where neither parent has a job, you would think our government would understand and correct this folly. Is our government stupid, simply the pawn of big business and international powerbrokers, or is their involvement an undisclosed act of treachery? If the government simply accepts the proposals of the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia, this will lead to renewed investment of $400 million to $500 million a year. Exports of elaborately processed TCF products will grow to $3.5 billion by the year 2005, and TCF industries will continue to purchase and consume domestic raw materials-further supporting local industries. Tariffs add only minimal cost to consumers. In the TCF industries, the effect of tariffs has been greatly exaggerated. The extra cost on a pair of shoes is about $2.50, and on underpants it is only about 20c. Who would object to these minimal costs when an individual's expenditure of perhaps as little as 20c or 30c a day would, according to the National Institute of Economic Research and Industry, keep another 50,000 Australians employed? Jobs will mean the security of countless thousands of families and children across Australia50,000 people paying tax instead of being paid welfare; 50,000 people with a sense of purpose, pride, self-esteem and a future. This means less substance abuse, less crime, less family breakdown and more hope for young Australians. I would pay the extra for this. Wouldn't you? In fact, surveys show that over 80 per cent of Australians are willing to pay a little more to preserve Australian manufacturing, production and Australian jobs. They know this will mean a better society and standard of living for us all. Companies that have so far survived the battle caused by government policies are to be applauded but they cannot fight on without help. Our textiles, clothing and footwear industries must have assurance of protection. But successive Liberal coalition and Labor governments, unchecked by Democrats, Greens and Independents, have shown they cannot be trusted. It is only One Nation that will ensure protection for Australian industry and Australian jobs. It is only we who have said this from the start, and our commitment has never wavered. The citrus industry is on its knees and, like a bully, the government is kicking sand in the face of these Australian growers. It is a national disgrace to see the man on the land ploughing perfectly good fruit into the ground because he cannot compete with cheap imports. It takes seven years for a tree to produce fruit and 10 years before a profit is made. When the government succeeds in destroying this industry, it will be gone forever. The tariff on oranges has been reduced from 30 per cent in 1987 to five per cent in 1996, without negotiation or equivalent cuts by other countries. Again, we see the government leading with the chin of our own people. Importation of citrus to other countries is still inhibited by heavy level levels-Thailand, over 50 per cent; Korea, 50 per cent to 80 per cent, depending on quota; and Japan up to 40 per cent. Clearly, there are many things Asia expects from us they would never expect from themselves. The United States has a specific duty on frozen orange juice concentrate equivalent to a tariff of more than 58 per cent. Brazil has an effective tariff of over 40 per cent, and Israel's tariffs range to more than 60 per cent. The citrus industry can cope with the importation of oranges from Brazil but not the price of imported orange juice concentrate. Our citrus farmers cannot compete with the low costs of the Brazilian work force. They cannot compete with Brazil and pay of $2 per day to pick fruit or about $1 per tonne, when in Australia it costs our growers $53 per tonne. When our government tells us we must be more productive to compete, what they really mean is 'survive', because competing means having the same pay and the same standard of living as countries like Brazil. I question who our government is working for. If we consumed Australian citrus produce only, the Australian citrus industry would have to double in size to meet the demand. Protecting the Australian citrus industry will create wealth and jobs for Australians. However, if we do not stop the government from continuing its plans, either the citrus industry will disappear or many Australians involved in the industry will be living like the peasants of a Third World country. Regarding product origin and appropriate labelling, I call on the government to amend the law so that 'Made in Australia' means exactly that. At present, products labelled as 'Made in Australia' may contain mostly foreign content. I say to you all: imported Brazilian concentrate plus Australian water does not equal 'Made in Australia'. This is misleading, dishonest and does not provide consumers with information allowing them to choose a true Australian product. The current law is a stupid law meant to deceive the Australian people and deprive Australian producers of their identity and rightful place. If tariffs cost jobs, then why did Toyota invest another billion dollars into the plant at Altona and create another 400 jobs after the government decided to freeze tariff protection until 2005? When these tariffs go in 2005, Australian Toyota workers will either suffer huge pay cuts or complete loss of employment-Oh what a feeling! Just as tariffs produced investment and jobs in the car industry, the same will happen in other industries. We are sick of the Liberal coalition and Labor sacrificing our jobs and the future of our children on the altar of economic rationalism and globalisation. The time is coming when the Liberal coalition and Labor, along with their political allies-the Democrats and the Greens-will pay for their policies of betrayal. Jobs that were once feeding Australian families are now feeding families in foreign lands. Millions of my fellow Australians have had enough. When government cease to serve the people, they no longer have the right to exist. The government are here only with the consent of the Australian people. So don't get too comfortable-a time of change is about to arrive. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, is bending over backwards to push us into globalisation just as his predecessor, Gareth Evans, did, and as did every foreign minister and member of the government over at least the last 25 years. They want us to become part of Asia and they will happily lower our standard of living in the process. There are still many true Australianscertainly enough to foil their self-seeking plans to discard our identity and our history, indeed to relinquish our sovereignty. Most politicians are only concerned for themselves. Their wages and standards of living have continued to rise, while their senseless and disastrous decisions have reduced many Australians to a breadline without hope. Our car industry has not been saved, merely given a stay of execution. The citrus industry is on its knees and sugar tariffs have been dropped. The planned importation of cooked chicken meat is also likely to lead to imported disease and the loss of a further 17,000 jobs in this industry alone. In coming years, countless thousands of jobs will be lost unless ordinary Australians teach the politicians the only lesson they understand, that is, by voting for someone else. It is time our government was made up of patriots, not pawns; real Australians doing a job for Australia, not career politicians working for themselves. If possible, I would gladly remove tariffs on our current crop of politicians to see how they survive when unprotected. This government, like so many before it, has pandered to the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation and has dismally failed in its primary duty-the welfare of the Australian people. You who are currently in government and you on the opposition benches who hope to replace them will never be ahle to be trusted. You have all at one time or another been eager and active participants in. or at least party to, the free trade agenda. It is only as you sense your own necks may soon be on the block that a few of you whimper with some concern-not concern for Australia, but merely for your own miserable careers. The Australian people will not forget 25 ycars of selling out this country, nor will they forgive you for what you have done. They will always remember the price you made them pay. Make no mistake, the success of One Nation at the next election will mean an end to our falling standard of living and an end to the exportation of our jobs. We are committed to policies of tariffs and protectionism that will revitalise all that is Australactions Ian. We will give our country a future that will always put the well-being of Australians ahove all else.

202,Mr REITH,FOOTWEAR INDUSTRIES,"On indulgence: the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced ministerial arrangements on Monday of this week and said that the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) would be absent from question time for the week as he was attending an International Olympic Committee meeting in Switzerland. the full IOC session. He was attending that meeting on behalf of the government to lend support to the SOCOG presentatIon which is being given, to discuss the important issue of security at the forthcoming Sydney Olympic Games and to attend the announcement of the 2004 games. During that time. the minister has been paired with various opposition members,  Baldwin). the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I raise this matter on indulgence because today the minister has been accused of failing to vote for a motion in the House moved by the opposition. He has been accused of failing to support the TCF industries. It is alleged that he supports them in his electorate but would not back his words with actions by voting for a proposal from the opposition. This does the minister a gross injustice. He is overseas attending the business of the government. He has been quite wrongly and unfairly accused by the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). The member for Hotham in his press release today named nine coalition members, including the minister, who have 'expressed support for the TCF industries in their electorates, but would not back their words with by voting for Labor's TCF plan'. He also said: The Howard Government refused debate on the issue and the nine members pathetically fell into line and in doing so failed their constituencies. The minister was not even in the country. The Manager of Opposition Business should know that the minister was away attending government business. As the Manager of Opposition Business, it is his job to know these things. Games He should have known and has, therefore, gravely misrepresented t/:le minister. I ask the member for Hotham to publicly apologise for his slur against a minister who is merely doing his job. NA BILL (No.2) 1997 [No.2] Second Reading Debate resumed.",110
203,Mr CAUSLEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I have listened with great interest to many of the contributions made on this Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 [No.2]. They have been many and varied-from a campaign speech to contributions from the opposition that bear little relevance to the facts before the House. In fact, very few of the opposition members have dealt with the real issues in this particular debate. In many ways this debate is redundant because, no matter what this House decides and no matter what the Senate decides, it will make no difference as far as the abolition of the tariff on sugar is concerned. It is a political stunt from the Labor Party and the rhetoric is quite incredible. As many members have said, the hypocritical rhetoric is quite incredible because it was the Labor Party which set up the sugar industry review working partythe Labor Party in Canberra and the Labor Party in Queensland. I listened with great interest to many members of the opposition when they were saying that the industry was forced by being told that, if they did not come up with an answer that was acceptable to competition policy, then they would lose their single desk status. Seeing that the review was set up under the Labor Party in Canberra and the Labor Party in Queensland, I need to ask: who was it that said they had to come up with that particular answer? I might come back to that later. The sugar industry review working party came to Canberra to give their report. I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs. I listened with great interest to the report, where unanimously they say they made certain recommendations. Among those recommendations was the recommendation that the tariffs should be removed. The recommendations also went further and said that the working party believed that, because the industry had had a number of investigations over a number of years and they were thoroughly sick of being investigated, the industry wanted the government to act quickly on the recommendations that were put by the working party. It is my understanding they gave the same advice to the former Labor Queensland government, which, as I said, was a party to the setting up of the working party in the first place. The Queensland government acted upon that advice. It immediately changed the formula, as the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) said earlier, for the price that is charged by the Queensland Sugar Corporation to the refineries in Australia. As the member for Richmond quite rightly said, it does not matter what the tariff is-it does not matter whether the tariff is $1,000 a tonne-the real issue is that price at which sugar is sold to the refiners in Australia is set by the Queensland Sugar Corporation. The tariff is not collected, unlike on imports of motor cars or the TCF products such as shoes and clothing. In the past the tariff was added to the price that was charged to the refiners. So it does not matter, as I have said, what happens here or what happens in the Senate because, once that decision was taken by the Queensland government on the advice of the sugar industry review working party, then the tariff ceased to exist and have any influence on the price of sugar in Australia. It has also been said--I think the member for Richmond mentioned this-that New South Wales was not represented on the sugar industry review working party. That is quite true. That is a slight on the New South Wales cane growers by the former Labor government. They never bothered to allow the New South Wales industry to have a say on an issue which is very important to the growers in New South Wales. It was mentioned by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) that this decision will have a gr-ater effect on the growers in New South Wales than on the growers in Queensland. It will. It has been estimated that it will probably cost individual growers in New South Wales between $3 and $4 a tonne depending on what the domestic price does in the next few years. The member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) mentioned that that, along with the decision that was also taken by the sugar industry review working party to abolish the pools, will cost North Queensland something like $1.60 a tonne of sugar cane and southern Queensland $1.40 a tonne of sugar cane. It is having repercussions right across the industry. That particular decision has repercussions on new growers and old growers. Established growers who used to grow for No. 1 pool in Queensland, on the Burdekin in fact, will be disadvantaged vis-a-vis expanding new growers in the industry. While these types of decisions might obscure the real issue in this debate-and they are readily used by the opposition, the Labor Party-you really have to get to the facts to understand exactly what is causing the changes in values to growers in New South Wales and within districts in Queensland. It is interesting to look very closely at some of these issues. As many members have said, quite rightly, it was the Labor Party that set up this review into the industry. It was the Labor Party in government that was anxious to pursue this as vigorously as they possibly could. The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) in his contribution, egged on by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), read a report from Mr Laurie Oakes in which Mr Laurie Oakes said that the growers were mugged. I find that rather interesting. I have had reason to question statements from Mr Oakes in the past and I question this one. The minister's sugar industry task force, of which I am a member, took evidence up and down the coast of New South Wales and Queensland. One of the things I was interested in was the fact that the statement was made that the industry had no option. They had to accept this because they would have lost their single desk status. Yet when people who were close to the sugar industry review working party were questioned they said that that was not the case. They were not forced. They were not told. They did have to take into consideration the competition policy, but they were not told that they had to come to a decision such as this. I think you have to look very closely at the representatives who were part of the sugar industry review working party. There is no doubt it was a unanimous decision. You cannot back away from that. There is no use you going back to your agricultural constituency and saying, 'We were forced,' because their representatives were on that committee. There were three growers on the committee and they were: the Chairman of the Queensland Canegrowers Council, Mr Harry Bonanno; the President of the Australian Cane Farmers Association, Mr Verri; and the Chairman of Mackay Sugar Cooperative and a refiner, Mr Graham Davies. There was also a cane grower on the committee. They were party to the recommendation that was put to the minister and to the government. For the Labor opposition to have the temerity to stand up here 'and say that if they had a recommendation from the leaders of the sugar industry to abolish the tariff they would not have accepted it they must believe that all of us believe in the sugar fairy. There is no doubt in my mind that they would have acted exactly the same way. I and other members of the government realised that the recommendation was going to have some effects on cane growers and that there would be individuals across the industry affected by this decision in a lumpy fashion. An article in the Financial Review stated: The sugar decision is exactly what the federal Labor Party would now be proposing if it were still in government. The recommendation to scrap the tariff comes from a unanimous report of the sugar industry review working party which included representatives of both cane growers and sugar users that Labor set up. I think that puts it very clearly. If the Labor Party had been in government they would have had to accept the recommendation from the sugar industry as this government has had to accept the recommendation from the sugar industry. I will now have a close look at the recommendation which says that the Queensland Sugar Corporation should sell to the Australian refiners at export parity prices. I do have a difference of opinion on this particular issue. I think in competition policy-and this comes from a simple position of having been in competition in business myself-you look closely at your competitors and you analyse exactly what they might be able to put a competitive product on the market for. Our nearest competitor is Thailand, as people have mentioned. If you take into consideration the New York No. 11 spot price, which is considered to be the world market price, and if you have a look at the cost of freight from Thailand to, say, the port of Brisbane and the cost of transferring that sugar from the port of Brisbane to a refinery, I believe that should be the price that is set in Australia. That is the price at which a competitor can put sugar into the Australian market. Mr Gentile, of course, disagrees with this because he wants to feather the pockets of the multinationals. As has been said before by many speakers, there is absolutely no evidence that these people have been passing on to the consumers the savings that they have been receiving-no evidence at all. Undoubtedly, on the committee, Mr Gentile would have been using the influence he had to ensure that the proposition that I have just put would not have been achieved. In the minister's task force we asked some questions about what was the estimated cost of transporting and delivering sugar to an Australian sugar refinery from, say, Thailand. The estimate was $US38 per tonne. I have to say that the recommendation made by the working party, in saying that the tariff would be abolished, has transferred effectively $A37 a tonne from the growers and millers in Australia across to the refiners, who have flick-passed it on to the manufacturers. It is taken from the growers and millers because, as anyone who knows the industry would know, the price that the QC gets for the sugar is what is divided up between the industry. The division of sugar moneys takes about one-third to the millers and two-thirds to the growers. That money has been taken from that sector of the industry and given to the manufacturers, I would claim. I do not see any reason why the price in Australia should not be set at export parity price, because export parity price is the cheapest price for which anyone could put sugar into this country and, of course, it would benefit the growers and millers, which the debate is about at the present time. I do not believe that it is going to serve useful purpose in this House for me to vote against this measure. I am very cognisant of the effects that it is going to have. But what I do say is that the major effect on the Australian producers at the present time has been overcapacity in the refining sector of the industry. That could have been easily averted a lot earlier by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Very early on, going back before the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, there was really one refiner in Australia-CSR. There was a small refinery at Millaquin, at Bundaberg. But there was really only one refiner until the New South Wales industry decided, because of reasons that I will not go into tonight-but it was for competitive reasons and the fact that they had been asked by people in Australia who were buying sugar who were dissatisfied with the actions of CSR at the time-that they would build a refinery at Harwood. The growers in New South Wales and their partner, Manildra, had been guaranteed a market. They did not go ahead and build a refinery out of the blue; they were guaranteed a market. They were at a disadvantage because of decisions that had been taken in Queensland which would have effectively made it very difficult for them to survive, so they went ahead in a joint venture to build a refinery. Subsequent to that, Mackay Cooperatives showed an interest in building a refinery in Mackay. CSR, which at the time had refineries in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, said it was interested in going into a joint venture with Mackay, and that was rejected. That is one reason that has caused most of the pain in the Australian industry, not the tariff. The tariff had nothing to do with it. It was the pain in the domestic industry because of the overcapacity of refineries in Australia. We had the ludicrous situation because the Mackay refinery, although not allowed to amalgamate with CSR, went ahead and produced one of the biggest refineries in Australia, without a market. They never had any a customer. So they were forced to go into the marketplace and cut the price. We have seen the situation in the last few years where the Mackay cane growers have been subsidising the refinery to the tune of about $10 million to $12 million a year. That is painful to them too. I think that is something that at least now seems to be reversed because the ACCC has said that because of the lifting of the tariff they will now agree that CSR and Mackay can merge and close down the refinery at New Farm in Brisbane, which should take some capacity out of the marketplace. That will do more for the Australian industry than all the debate here about tariffs, because really the thing that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission forgot to think about, when they refused that merger in the first place, was the fact that we cannot get into the markets overseas with refined sugar. They said there should have been more competition in the Australian refined sugar industry. There is a certain capacity-somewhere around a million tonnes-that we can use in Australia. That is not all refined; some of that goes to manufacturers. But we cannot export refined sugar because we cannot get into the markets. You will find that the tariff on refined sugar is a lot higher than on raw sugar. The commission did not take that into account when they refused the merger in the first place. I would say to the House that one of the things that we, as members of this House, must push for is to see that the spirit of the World Trade Organisation is adhered to, because there is no doubt in my mind that some of those countries that have signed the agreement will be fairly tardy about moving towards a reduction in the protection that they have at the present time. On the visits that I had to the USA, to the European Community and to Japan I did not see any willingness, quite frankly, to move quickly. I think the political reality is that they cannot. Australia will have to be ever vigilant to ensure that we are reducing protection in Australia and that we are showing to the world that we are not going to be a protectionist country. We also need to see that those countries of the world reciprocate because, as other members have said, there are very many tariffs, non-tariff barriers and subsidies around the world that make the whole trading area very corrupt. I hope that we put some perspective into this debate here today on this particular issue. I repeat what I said earlier: no matter what we do in this House and no matter what is done in the Senate, it will have no bearing at all on the price that growers and millers get in Australia because the decision has been taken and the price has been set. You can have a tariff of any value whatsoever but it will be of no benefit to the growers and millers in Australia. In many ways this debate has been a political exercise. It has been an exercise in trying to confuse, it has been rhetoric, and it has been hypocrisy. I think that most people in Australia will see it for that. I hope that some sanity will come back into the marketplace in Australia because sanity in the marketplace will deliver to the growers and millers in Australia a lot more than the debate over tariffs.

204,Mr CREAN,FOOTWEAR INDUSTRIES,"On indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek the opportunity to respond to the invitation afforded me by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). He came into this place earlier having given us no former notice of the action he was to take, and I have only become aware by way of reports of what he had to say. It is typical of the way in which this issue has been run, as well as the tactics in this place, that the Leader of the House expects cooperation from the opposition in the management of the affairs of the House but does not go out of his way to seek it. This is but another example of it. The Leader of the House will not allow debate on the issue of the textiles, clothing and footwear tariff, but he is prepared to sneak into this place, without notice, to defend the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith) who he claims has been maligned by a press release that I put out. No doubt he is in here to defend the member for Bass because he has got his vote all tied up in his pocket in this little game that is going on in this place. The position that we have adopted on the TCF industries must be getting to the government because we saw today a number of other members getting up and saying that their position had been misrepresented. Let us understand the issue that is involved here. The issue is that there are nine members that we are aware of on the government benches, the member for Bass included, who have been going around their constituencies telling members in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries that they support their cause to freeze tariffs, yet when we seek to bring that very issue on for debate in this House they vote against it. My complaint and my charge against all of them is that they are prepared to say one thing in the electorate but not match the words with action in the House. That has been demonstrated in the case of eight of those nine members who were named today. I was unawareMr Abbott- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I do not wish to aggravate members opposite but it seems very much to me that the Leader of the House came into make a technical point about pairings and whether a certain minister had permission to be out of the House. He did not come into debate the issue. I think the Manager of Opposition Business is debating the issue now. I really think that indulgence should only cover the Manager of Opposition Business clearing up an issue that he thinks has been misrepresented by the Leader of the House.",114

I would ask the member for Hotham to confine his remarks to an immediate and brief rebuttal of what he considers was inappropriate in the remarks of the Leader of the House.",115
206,Mr CREAN,FOOTWEAR INDUSTRIES,"Before the parliamentary secretary weighed in, I was making the point that in the case of the member for Bass I was unaware that he was overseas, which I would have thought was precisely to the point, Mr Deputy Speaker. I understand the point you are making and I will attend to it. I was unaware that the member for Bass had been given leave to be overseas for this week. I have checked that and that is the case. So if, indeed, I have misrepresented the member for Bass and his position in relation to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries I apologise for that. But it would have been interesting to see how he would have voted had he been here. Effectively, the charge of what the Leader of the House is saying that I have done in maligning the member for Bass is that if he were here he would have stuck up for his constituents and therefore he would have voted for our motion. If that is the case, let the Leader of the House bring on the motion and let every other of the eight members",115

210,Mr OCONNOR,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) gives effect to the Howard government's decision to abolish the sugar tariff from I July this year. The effect of this measure on sugar farmers has been well documented before in this debate, and I do not propose to go over that ground today. Quite simply put, it will mean a loss of income for sugar producers of around $29 million and will lead to some job losses in the regions which sustain this very important industry. This is the original Robin Hood bill but it has a typically Liberal twist to it: the bilI robs from the poor and gives to the rich. The bill will pull $29 million out of the pockets of sugar cane growers in Queensland and northern New South Wales and pour it into the pockets of multinational companies. Those are the facts and they cannot be denied by any member of the government who comes in here to try to defend this decision. The bill takes from the very sector in the Australian economy that can least afford itthe battlers in rural areas, the man on the land, the Aussie price taker. They are the heart and soul of rural and regional Australia. It takes that $29 million out of those rural battlers' pockets and it puts it in the pockets of the multinational companies. The sugar producers in northern New South Wales and Queensland have every reason to feel betrayed and somewhat dismayed at the actions of the Howard government on this particular issue. But we on this side of the House are not really surprised by the deceit of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or of the government and backbenchers on this particular issue. After all, this is the Prime Minister who rather cutely can go to the Australian people and categorise the promises that he makes into core promises and non-core promises. There is one thing that farmers in this country appreciate, and that is honesty and straight talking. That is what they appreciate. There are very few farmers in this country who will make you a promise and go blatantly back on their word. But, as the sug-r farmers know now, there are a few farmers In Australia who will be blatant in the deceit and blatant in breaking the promises that they make. They know that those farmers are in this parliament in the backbench and the front-bench of the Howard government. Before the last election a very specific commitment was given to sugar farmers in Queensland and northern New South Wales. That particular commitment was well documented last night by the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) in the speech that he made to this House. Page 32 of Reviving the heartland: building a sustainable future for Australia's primary industries of 5 February 1996 says: A Liberal-National Government will: not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55/tonne as we have already met our obligations under the World Trade Organisation (GATT '94) agreements; You would need to be a dunce or stupid to read that and not understand what it says. It says: A Liberal-National Government will: not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55/tonne ... I ask members opposite: you made this statement; you made the promise to the Queensland sugar growers; you made the promise to the New South Wales sugar growers. What did the words mean? We will tell you what they meant. It was another noncore promise made by the Prime Minister. Let me tell you this, Prime Minister: when farmers are made a promise, they expect the government of the day to stick to the deal. They expect them to stick to the promise. But  this bill and this measure before the Australian parliament today have ratted on the sugar producers of northern Queensland and the sugar producers of northern New South Wales. This particular measure to abolish the sugar tariff has been indeed a bitter pill for many coalition members to swallow. We have had a couple of them come into the parliament and give their mea culpas in this House already simply because they know they have been dudded by city based Liberal cabinet ministers. They have not been rolled by real farmers; they have been rolled by city slickers-the Liberal Collins Street farmers who dominate the cabinet, those in the A team who mug the B team on this issue. I will have a little bit to say about that later on. I give my dues to the honourable member for Kennedy for coming into this House and apologising to those sugar cane farmers who were deceived by the Prime Minister and who were deceived by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). I see the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) coming into House, somebody for whom I have particular admiration because of his honesty in these matters. He comes in triumphant from his win over the Prime Minister and his win over the cabinet on the issue of communications policy. I am asking this very powerful National Party committee chair to use his influence to overturn this measure and to take out of the pockets of the multinationals the $29 million and put it back into the pockets of his cane growers and other cane growers in northern Queensland and New South Wales. The honourable member for Kennedy came into this House and delivered an excellent speech coming off the back of his intimate knowledge of the sugar industry in his state. He expressed his bitter disappointment at the decision that had been taken by the cabinet. It is a disappointment that is echoed up and down the length and breadth of Queensland and northern New South Wales. It is not just the sugar growers who feel betrayed by the coalition's broken promises since coming to office. Right across rural and regional Australia, farmers and regional dwellers have become extremely angry at the cynical betrayal of their interests by city based Liberal ministers. First we had the abandonment of the rural development program. The coalition made a specific promise to retain that program and the benefits that it was accruing to regional areas. They made a very specific promise. But of course, as we know now, it was one of those non-core promises that are made by the Prime Minister, and that program was abandoned. They made promises to retain labour market programs. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) would know, because he is close to the dairy farming industry in Western District of Victoria-and I see him in this House tonight-it was those labour market programs put in place by the Australian Labor Party in government that delivered over 1,000 trainees to the dairy industry. It was a very important component of the ongoing training of dairy farmers and of bringing the skills of that industry up. Of course, the coalition made a discreet promise to retain that program-another noncore promise. They just roll off the back of the old sugar truck. It is quite unbelievableanother promise made to retain these labour market programs which benefited people in rural and regional areas. Now we find that that promise has been broken. The coalition also made a very strong commitment to export promotion programs on which many rural producers and value adding producers in regional areas have relied. That was another promise that was made and broken. Honourable members in this House know very well that the overwhelming part of the rural output of this nation is exported. Those companies-the Queensland Sugar Corporation and the other rural cooperatives that are engaged in the promotion and selling of their products overseas-rely very much on the export promotion support that they receive from the federal government. Another noncore promise! How many can you make, and how many can you break before you are struck out? The sugar cane farmers have finally woken up; the beef producers have woken up; and people in rural and regional areas have woken up that they have been betrayed-and they are very bitter about it. In rural and regional areas job losses have been initiated by this government. Workers in rural and regional areas have had their job security blown out of the water by the Prime Minister's industrial relations legislation. They fear for their economic future, as they see that the Howard government has failed to match the economic growth targets that were left to them by Labor in the previous four years. They have seen the Treasurer (Mr Costello) hop into their great rural cooperatives, trying to tax them out of business--change their taxation status. And they have seen the the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) rat on a coalition undertaking on meat inspection fees. It is little wonder that the primary industries minister is afraid to go out into rural and regional areas, and to explain the number of non-core promises that were made that have not been lived up to by this government. The problem with Minister Anderson is that he is now hobnobbing with the Collins Street farmers in this Liberal dominated cabinet. That is his problem. I think it is reasonable to ask the question: why has the government proceeded with this measure? There ought to be some inherent and overwhelming logic that propels a Prime Minister to break a direct promise made to the sugar growers of this nation. There must be an overwhelming reason. There must be some compelling reason that would propel the Prime Minister and other members of the cabinet-supported by many rural Liberals and National Party members on the back bench-to pick up the bit of dirt and throw it in the face of the sugar cane farmers of this nation. Where do we look for the answer? Could it be that there is some overwhelming benefit to Australian consumers in the measure that is now before the House and being put by the government? We have heard from National Party members in this place that there is no overriding benefit to consumers to now from this piece of legislation. So I racked my brains and thought that it must be something to do with our obligations under the World Trade Organisation; there must be some overwhelmingly compelling reason in our trading commitments for the government to have taken this action now to pull $29 million out of the pockets of sugar producers and put it in the pockets of the multinationals. When we look at the evidence-and it was well documented by the member for Kennedy-we see that in Japan there is a subsidy of 481 per cent; in Europe a subsidy tariff equivalent of 193 per cent; and in the United States it is 175 per cent. I think there is a very simple explanation for all this. It is to be found in the machinations of the Prime Minister's cabinet. I think it was the member for Murray (Mrs. Stone) who let the cat out of the bag, and the shadow minister for primary industry, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), brought the explanation to the attention of this parliament in quite dramatic fashion. There is an A team and a B team in the federal cabinet. Those are not my words; that is the assessment of the Howard cabinet by a member of the coalition. On this occasion, the B team led by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy got rolled by the A team-got mugged, as Laurie Oakes said in his article, by the Prime Minister and the A team. It is really a case of 'the tale of two muggings'. The sugar industry got mugged by the B team, as the member for Burke quite correctly points out; and then the A team mugged the B team. The upshot of all this is that a pack of mugs in the cabinet have taken $29 million out of the pockets of sugar cane farmers and put it in the pockets of the multinationals. That is the situation that has got the Queensland sugar industry up in arms. Of course, there is intolerable political pressure being brought to bear on those coalition members who occupy the sugar seats in northern Queensland. On 7 July, the Cairns City Council expressed their concern about this measure. They said: It is again with great concern that this Council, which has two large sugar mills in its local authority area and another three large mills in its immediate region, writes to express its concern in regard to the loss of the sugar tariff. They document some $5 million going out of the Cairns regional economy because of the measures that have been instituted by this government. Finally, the Cairns City Council said: It can be clearly seen that the industry and region cannot afford the tariff loss at this point in time. I think that is a very honest assessment of the situation. I have mentioned the honourable member for Kennedy. I must say the honourable member has gone up in my estimation because of his contribution to this debate. I have read it. The honourable member for Corangamite might be sneering up there at his National Party colleague and the position that he has taken, but I have read the speech closely and I suggest that he does. I have marked for the honourable member for Corangamite those particular parts of this speech which are of relevance to this debate, if he would like to see them. I really do have some sympathy for the honourable member for Kennedy. He was honest enough to come into this chamber last night and express his disappointment. This is what he said: I am deeply disappointed because, like so many people, I had such high hopes for the coalition government. When I heard our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) say, 'No more nothing for nothing,' I thought at long last we were going to become, as we once were, a very aggressive trading nation. But, clearly, with decisions such as this, that is not to be. You see, the honourable member for Kennedy has been mugged by the Prime Minister and the A team. I think it is a tragedy for those coalition members who went to their electorates in good faith, I suspect, because I know some of them personally. They stood up in their electorates before their community, before their farmers, and they gave the rocksolid promise in the coalition platform that they would retain the tariff. Then they have to come in here and apologise on the floor of this House to Queensland and to northern New South Wales for the fact that they have been dudded by the Prime Minister. They have been ambushed by the Prime Minister and the A team. This is a disgraceful measure that the government has introduced. It is disgraceful for one particular reason: farmers across the length and breadth of Queensland and northern New South Wales were looked straight in the eye and made a promise. They were then ratted on by the Prime Minister, other members and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy . You will pay a heavy political price in the sugar seats for this duplicity.

211,Mr NEVILLE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"That was a very stirring address by my colleague the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). I would like to talk about the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 [No.2]. I thank the member for Corio for his kind remarks about me, but I was not in conflict with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on this matter of the media. In opening my remarks, I would like to respond to that comment by saying that I think the Prime Minister's decision was one of good judgment and common sense. I applaud it and I endorse it. In terms of the economy, the southern half of my electorate of Hinkler has no industry as important as sugar. It involves 1,200 growers, 1,100 mill employees and a number of by-product manufacturing enterprises such as Bundaberg Rum. It goes even further to farm machinery and to port development. It is a $2 billion industry for Australia producing 5.4 million tonnes of sugar each year, 85 per cent of it for export. It is not surprising, then, matters such as the tariff and the future of the sugar industry· are of paramount importance to my constituents and to their futures. To track the history of the removal of the tariff, one needs to look back at the Hilmer process and understand, given there was a review of the sugar industry, what effect it might have. The sugar industry review working party was established in September 1995. I remind the member for Corio and others who have spoken in this debate that that was established by the Labor Party. It was representative of all sections of the industry: the growers, the millers, the users and others. The working party spent an exhaustive 14 months examining many aspects of the sugar industry, including the basis for a tariff on raw and refined sugar and the current legislative arrangements for the promotion and regulation of the sugar industry in Queensland, with the objective of investigating alternative arrangements. In the case of the tariff on raw and refined sugar and related products, the working party considered many other factors, including the export dominance of the industry; the effect of the tariff on cane growers and mill owners in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia; its effect on refiners and user industries; and, finally, its effect on consumers and Australian society in general. It looked at the international trade obligations and the effects of the tariff on the economy. Legislative aspects of the sugar industry considered included the Customs Act, the Sugar Industry Act 1991 and the Sugar Milling Rationalisation Act 1991. This was a very comprehensive study. The ultimate priority of the working party was to facilitate the sustainable development of an internationally competitive, export oriented industry with benefits to industry participants and the wider community. You cannot look at an industry like this in isolation. You cannot say that, because you made a promise at the election that has been subsumed by a report which makes a recommendation which is endorsed by the peak body of that industry, you can walk away from it-no government could walk away that from it. It is not a matter of a broken promise; it is a matter of a different set of circumstances subsuming the original commitment. The working party made a number of recommendations which ultimately would provide the Queensland sugar industry with a degree of planning certainty. Some of those recommendations were: the strengthening of the anti-dumping laws to protect the sugar industry and removing the tariff on raw and refined sugar; continuing the single desk selling arrangements in Queensland, which would ensure a strong bartering power on world markets and the stability of the domestic sugar market; restructuring the Queensland Sugar Corporation to make it the body responsible for buying raw sugar produced in Queensland and marketing it both domestically and internationally, and restricting its regulatory functions to those which are central to its marketing role; the phasing out of the price differential, to be six per cent for the 1997 season, four per cent for 1998 and eliminated for the 1999 season; and ensuring that new opportunities for innovation, value adding and downstream processing of raw sugar in the domestic market are fully explored. As other speakers have said, there were 74 recommendations. Another recommendation was that the Queensland bulk sugar terminals should be owned and operated as one entity. I have laboured that point a little because I think it is important. It was not just a matter of coalition members going back on the commitment to keep the tariff, albeit that it was down to eight per cent, but that it was subsumed by the recommendations of a very searching, balanced report. The report was called Sugar-winning globally, and so it should have been, because 85 per cent of our sugar is exported and that is where Australia's wealth comes from in regard to sugar. The report received unanimous support from the members of the working partypeople like Harry Bonanno, Ron Verri and Graham Davies, all of them associated with sugar production. In their letter accompanying the report to the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Trevor Perrett, those people said: The report, in our opinion, is a balanced package for the sugar industry in as much as the recommendations retain the best features of existing ments but at the same time recommends significant changes, gives more commercial focus, encourages innovation, further facilitates research and development, and embraces environmental and social issues. It additionally gives greater empowerment to industry participants by increasing their involveto say: ment in decision making by providing greater administrative flexibility. What could be more comprehensive and more all-embracing than that statement? That was a unanimous recommendation to the government by millers, growers, users and an independent chairman. I say that that was a reasonable basis upon which the government should not have been held to its commitment to retain that tariff. At this point let me dispel a few myths. The working party also made the following statement-and I refer now to the tariffs: While the Australian sugar tariff is significantly lower than those in other major sugar-producing countries, it is still high in comparison with other tariffs in the Australian economy. The working party sees little justification in retaining a sugar tariff at a level which is out of step with other Australian tariffs. That came from this working party. It continued: Consequently, the working party has not found a compelling case for maintaining the tariff and recommendsI stress that word 'recommends'it be removed from 1 July 1997 as part of an overall package of measures designed to improve the international competitiveness and sustainability of the industry and to implement the principles of National Competition Policy. I say to members of the Labor Party that they initiated that report, drew up the terms of reference and appointed the personnel to the study. Having received such an all-embracing recommendation, I challenge the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans): would you or would you not have accepted the recommendation of the industry? Clearly, you would have. Had you not done so, you would have been out of step with your own policy on the one hand and with the recommendation of the industry on the other. In addition, I was briefed personally by state executives of the Queensland Canegrowarrangeers Council, who asked me to support the whole package. The state chairman, Mr Harry Bonanno, in the Australian of 19 December 1996, in saying that the process was a sensible alternative to total deregulation, went on I'd love to have a protected industry, but that seems to be impossible under competition policy and our members will understand that. I again remind the shadow minister at the table that it was his party that introduced the competition policy, and it was the imperative that drove the working party and the working party's recommendations. So to come into this House and bleat about the eight per cent tariff at this stage is sheer hypocrisy. Where do I stand on this matter? We must ask ourselves just what a tariff is meant to do. Put simply, it is there to protect a local product or manufacture from an unfairly priced foreign import. That is the role of a tariff. When we look at sugar, we can see no danger of that sort of thing occurring in the medium term. Another factor that we need to look at is that the governments have constructed a price which included a $55 tariff, and that was only able to be captured because of the single desk selling status. But with the working party recommendation to move to export parity pricing-and the member for Page (Mr Causley) made this point very clearly-no matter how the Senate votes on this issue, it is unlikely that the sugar industry will ever be seriously challenged. If it were, and if there were a tariff in place, in these circumstances the penalties on the imported product would tlow to the government, not to the growers. Again, a lot of what the opposition has said is just so much hot air. Further, we should recognise that because of searing competition between refineries, bringing the Australian price of refined sugar below international levels, the New South Wales industry has virtually gained no benefit from the tariff for the last two years. I suspect that when the opposition was in government it knew this, and knew it well. Other speakers have said-and I endorse this-that there is a vast distinction between the TCF and motor vehicle tariffs on the one hand and sugar on the other. The distinction is that the sugar industry working party unanimously endorsed the removal of the tariff as part of a package and recommended it to state and federal governments. I have held the personal view for some time-and I do not resile from this-that the tariff should have been phased out at two per cent per year over four years and that the New South Wales sugar industry, which had been totally focused on refining, should have been readmitted to the raw sugar export market at l1A per cent a year over the same four-year period. I believe that would have eased a lot of hardship to both the Queensland and New South Wales industries. In desiring to have that little variation, which it was not possible to have, I do not resile from the government's role in the matter. I want to speak about the hypocrisy of the opposition and the Labor Party in general on the matter of tariffs. In Labor's economic statement of 1988 they announced that the embargo on sugar would be replaced by an ad valorem tariff of 35 per cent on raw sugar and 25 per cent on refined sugar. Following a Senate select committee report-they listened to reports, but they did not want us to listen to the working party report-this was set at $115 per tonne until July 1989, to fall to $95 per tonne in July 1991, and then to fall to $70 per tonne in July 1992. In the Labor economic statement of 1991, only three years later, they dropped that still further. They dropped the $95 level of 1991 to $76 and the $70 level of 1992 to $55. Nothing could more amply illustrate Labor's intention to progressively reduce tariffs and then to eliminate them. In fact, in the Labor Party's policy statement for the 1993 election, there is a strong allusion to this happeningby that I mean the removal of the sugar tariff. The ALP stated in that policy initiative that, subject to the Uruguay Round being effective-and they claimed in this parliament time and time again that it was effective, so we must presume that they would go on with itthey would review tariffs further, and they could only review them if the Uruguay Round was successful. The only inference we can draw from that was that they would review them downwards. What is the Labor Party's track record? Let us look at the percentage of assistance which you granted to industries in the period from 1983 to 1989 and projected to the year 2000. I will just take a few of them, seeing that clothing and footwear have been mentioned so much today. These figures are not just tariffs; they are other forms of assistance, including bounties. Listen to this. The Labor Party dropped clothing and footwear from 227 per cent in 1983 to 113 per cent in 1989 and would have dropped it to 34 per cent by the year 2000; machinery and equipment dropped from 22 per cent to 19 per cent, then down to six per c-nt; food beverages and tobacco dropped from six per cent to four per cent, and then down to two per cent. So we must assume that, had you been given another term, we would have seen clothing and footwear down to around 34 per cent, machinery down to about six per cent and food, beverages and tobacco on average down to about two per cent. My source for this is the Industry Commission report dated March 1995 called Assistance to agriculture and manufacturing industries. Let me quote a paragraph from the report: The proportion of manufacturing output receiving a nominal rate of assistance of 5 per cent or less increased from 18 per cent in 1970-71 to 29 per cent in 1989-90. By 2000-2001, 85 per cent of manufacturing export is projected to have a nominal rate of 5 per cent or less. At the other end of the scale, 72 per cent of the output received assistance greater than 15 per cent in 1970-71. This had fallen to 24 per cent in 1989-90 and is projectproduction ed to fall to three per cent by the year 2000-01. In other words, by the year 2000 your tariffs for things like sugar would have been-on your own recommendations and on the reports of the Industry Commission-on average down around three per cent; and you have the hypocrisy to come into the House and berate us! That sums up 13 years of Labor tariff and trade policies and says where they were taking us. We are told we should judge a person on their past performance, not on what they say. Let us look at what the opposition said in government. They are always saying that we broke a promise, so we will see how good their promises were and how much they lived up to their statements. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has been most vocal on this issue. On 9 November 1990, he said: ... in addition, we are winding back the protective wall that the tariff produces because the real problem with the tariff is that it makes us look internally, domestically. On Lateline on 28 February 1991 the member for Hotham said: Well, I'm not a believer in the level playing field, but I am also a believer in the fact that part of the reason that we have got into the industrial mess we have is because we have relied heavily on tariff protection in the past. Note the words 'industrial mess because we have relied heavily on tariff protection in the past'. On 28 February 1992 on the World Today the member for Hotham said: I think that many of the media do not appreciate that all that tariffs did was to make us look inward. All the tariffs did was to protect local production. There is no basis upon which there was international competition to drive innovation. That was your own spokesman for primary industries at the time. It is absolutely disgraceful. I would like to finish on the matter of how we can give greater assistance to the sugar industry. I teU the parliamentary secretary that we can give greater assistance to the industry by government getting involved in assisting industry at the input end. I suggest that governments should be looking at having more infrastructure; and by infrastructure, I refer in particular to water infrastructure. In the Bundaberg district, we could increase in sugar by 50 per cent. Most of that would go on the international market to gain hard-earned dollars for this government. We could do that with the input of a dam worth $150 million at KaUiwa, and a combined operation of growers, state government and federal government could achieve that. I call on state, federal and local government and the growers to look at a dam in the Kalliwa area at a place called Paradise, and to help the cane growing industry, not by this senseless, meaningless debate in the parliament that the opposition has conducted, but rather by doing something practical that will allow cane growers to be more productive and to integrate vertically.",119
212,Mr MARTYN EVANS,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 [No.2] epitomises the failure of the Howard government in industry policy. I say that because of two specific examples which are to be found in the customs tariff proposals now before the House. One of those relates to the sugar industry-and those areas have been amply canvassed by many of my colleagues who have preceded me in this debate. Indeed, the Howard government's intentions in relation to the sugar industry are made very clear in this bill. They are to reduce the tariff on sugar to zero and to do so in a way which will clearly threaten the viability of that industry and the efforts of many sugar growers in this country who have established a very important rural industry over decadesindeed, over generations. Those families have worked what are often smaller plots which are now moving towards a more economic form of production but which for years, for generations, have provided employment and economic growth in the far north of Queensland and, more recently, in other parts of Australia. That industry is a mature agricultural industry which has contributed to our economy over many decades. The reality is that that industry had an existing tariff in place, it had arrangements which people well understood, and the government has moved in and changed those arrangements. It has undermined the foundation on which that industry was established, in the same way that it tried to do with the motor vehicle industry and with the TCF industries. To understand the impact of the government's proposals in relation to tariff changes, you need only look at the impact on those two industries-cars and textiles, clothing and footwear in particular. Sugar is the industry immediately under debate tonight, and that is being treated in exactly the same way. But in terms of the impact across the community, and certainly in my own district of Bonython, where both the motor vehicle industry and the TCF industries are particularly strong, the impact of the government's proposed changes on tariffs would have been most dramatic and very detrimental to those local communities, and certainly to South Australia's regional economy. Before the government was forced to change its disastrous policy tack-forced to change not only by opposition from within the motor vehicle industry itself but by opposition from the Labor Party in this place and from the work force in my own district and across the country-those changes would have been disastrous. They would have undermined the confidence of investors in that industry and ensured that they would not have known where their investment would be in a few years time. The reality is that that industry is highly dependent on long-term investments. The government's proposals, as originally put forward in the Productivity Commission report which the government was forced to quickly thereafter repudiate, would have ensured that we could not have maintained the high level of investment in the motor vehicle industry which we have enjoyed to date and which has supported very substantial growth in exports and in employment. The same is true in the TCF industries. Some 1,200 people in my district work in the TCF industries, about 5,000 throughout South Australia as a whole, and obviously many more nationally. The dramatic changes which the interim report of the Productivity Commission recommended, including significant reductions in the tariff protection available to that industry, would again have decimated that industry in the way that the implementation of the report on the motor vehicle industry would have done in that case. The reality is that public opposition to this is not based just on this issue of reducing tariffs; it is based on the whole mechanism by which the government approaches these questions. Yes, it is true that the Labor Party has in the past been involved in tariff reductions. Yes, we were guilty, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, of reducing tariffs in the past, but we have done that in a context. We have done that in a framework which has allowed for rational investment in the industry, for forward looking proposals, for export incentives, for export enhancement packages to be part of that whole proposal. Yes, it is true that the Labor Party has in the past supported reductions in tariffs in various industries, but you have to see that in the context in which it was done. We have only supported that where it was part of an industry specific plan, where it was part of our overall industry policy. So yes, we are guilty of managed reform, but that is a guilt which I think we can readily accept, and it is one which the community would have supported had the government continued that process rather than diverging, as it has, into a path lacking in any plan, lacking in any basis of future investment direction, lacking in a coordinated industry-wide response. That is why there has been concerted opposition in the community. That is why the motor vehicle, TCF and sugar industries have risen up and responded to these changes in the way that they have. While we have been involved in these things in the past, it has been in the context of a managed process of reform which ensured that, as tariffs fell, investment in the industry was coordinated and rose, which ensured that export incentives were in place. In the case of the motor vehicle industry, that has allowed that industry now be a major exporter, with over $1 billion in exports; and certainly we have moved forward in the component area as well. We have done that for a number of reasons. One reason has been the export incentive packages, which the former government put in place and which in many cases this government has sought to tear down as part of its rush to zero tariffs. Another reason has been our investment in research and development and our investment in an industry policy for this nation. So the government has certainly failed its traditional industry-in this case, the sugar industry-and also those traditional industries of manufacturing, of TCF, of motor vehicles. It is also failing our sunrise industries. bill epitomises the Howard government's failure in industry policy, not only in the mature industries but also in the sunrise industries, because part of this bill is the ratification of the free trade agreement in information technology-a decision which has had very important implications for global trade and for Australia's place in that global trade and electronic commerce. What has this government done in relation to sunrise industries? The Prime Minister went to the United States and discovered the information technology industry. We all know that he had meetings with President Clinton and, as part of his discussions with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in the United States, he discovered that information technology had been a very substantial part of the increase in productivity in the economy of the United States in recent years. That is quite true, but it is a bit sad that the Prime Minister only learned that on a recent visit to the United States. Some of us have known that for quite a while. When he came back, he discovered that many of the policy settings he had put in place prior to leaving for the United States and prior to making this significant discovery and personal journey into productivity are actually counterproductive to his new policy. For example, he discovered information technology, but that was only after he had put in place an outsourcing process for IT in the to federal government purchasing process, which will severely disadvantage Australian IT producers. Outsourcing contracts now require, and are likely to require in the future, that suppliers meet various criteria, including a criterion that they are able to produce some 250,000 computer units a year in order to be eligible to be part of these government contracts. These and other tender conditions in the outsourcing process are clearly contrary to the best interests of Australia in the long term. They prohibit many of our small and medium sized enterprises which are active in the IT area from being part of the IT revolution and from enjoying the growth which otherwise they might have, had the government had a This proactive industry policy in the area of IT outsourcing. The government have also decided to privatise Telstra. As part of that decision, we will see a significant share of the contracts for the supply of telecommunications equipment again going offshore. Once Telstra is in private hands, the incentive to ensure that they have an adequate industry development policy and that they purchase their equipment and supplies from local suppliers-that is, from small and medium sized enterprises based in Australia, employing Australian workers-will disappear. Telstra will, like other communications companies, source many of their products from overseas. That will not only compound our already disastrous balance of trade problems in the IT and telecommunications area but also severely undermine local domestic industry. The Prime Minister made this discovery after he had slashed the research and development concession in the previous budget. It was 150 per cent; it is now 125 per cent. What impact do you think that would have, Mr Deputy Speaker, in IT areas and in the sunrise industries in this country? It would have a very disastrous impact. At its recent prize-giving ceremony, the Institution of Engineers-which, again, the Prime Minister was unable to attend but which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was able to attend-indicated very significantly that syndication had played an important role in ensuring that some of the more innovative ideas to emerge from our engineering community in recent times had been able to be put into commercial form, that the 'D' part of research and development was able to be brought to fruition, and syndication was an important part of that. Any elements of concern about taxation policy on syndication could have been addressed and the good parts of that policy retained, but no. Prior to making his discovery about the value of IT, the Prime Minister had already slashed the research and development concession, had already abolished syndication. So whether we look at the traditional industries in Australia-the agricultural industries, the manufacturing industries--or whether we look at the sunrise industries involving information technology and associated computer and telecommunications equipment, both of which feature in this legislation, we see that on both counts the Howard government has failed to deliver an industry policy which will respond adequately to the needs of companies in this country. The world has got its act together. Unlike this government, the world is very quick to move on areas of electronic commerce. The free trade agreement in information technology, which this legislation will help to put in place as part of that global package, ensures that there will be no tariff barriers to IT computer equipment and computer software and a number of related items. That, of course, will promote the growth in information technology throughout the world. It will promote the growth of electronic commerce. It will promote the growth of the service economy, the digital age economy, which is now upon us. We will not wake up one morning and discover that the whole of the world has gone digital. That is not the way it works. In the information technology revolution, these things do not occur overnight; they occur on a gradual but inexorable basis. If this country is not part of that gradual revolution, our children will wake up one morning and discover that the world has moved on. Unfortunately, this government comes very late to discovering the importance of information technology and the way in which that can be integrated into our economy to make the whole economy more productive. We should gain not only from the production of the boxes of the computer equipment itselfalthough that is important and should not be understated-but from the significance of computerisation and the significance of IT, the way in which it can energise our whole economy. That is the significance of it. This government has recently received any number of reports which touch on these areas. We have had the Mortimer report, the Goldsworthy report and the recent Cutler report on the information technology commonwealth. We have had all of those reports-indeed, this government is drowning in reports-but what we are not seeing is action in these areas. Goldsworthy had to spend several chapters just giving the government a conducted tour of the IT world because I am sure, like me, he was well aware of the fact that this government has a very poor understanding of the benefits of information technology and the advantages which it can bring to the productivity of our country. We expect to see some action in those areas. We would like to see this government seize the opportunity that the free trade agreement provides and ensure, through a coordinated industry policy and through a coordinated purchasing policy, that it does advantage rather than disadvantage our domestic industry in these areas. Electronic commerce and IT have an enormous contribution to make to Australia's economy and to the global economy. The global impact will occur whether we want it to or not. That reality is here and now. The important thing is: will Australia be able to seize that opportunity; will Australia's government ensure that we are in a position to be part of the global revolution-to be part of the electronic age and to have the advantages and the productivity gains which electronic commerce will bring-which is taking place even now. Those issues are very important. To date, we have only seen a negative response from this government: a removing of concessions, a slashing of programs and a withdrawal of support. In the traditional industries, again, we have seen a slashing of tariffs-a mindless drive to zero. Contrary to what the Prime Minister said, it is not 'nothing for nothing'; in this case, we are giving everything and gaining very little in return. I strongly support the move towards free trade in information technology. That is one aspect of this legislation which the opposition can strongly support. We oppose the changes in sugar, particularly on the basis that this whole debate has been conducted in the absence of an industry policy. That is the failure of this government. It is a failure which this bill epitomises and one which the opposition will continue to point out to the pUblic.",122
213,Mr MCARTHUR,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I wish to address a few remarks to this important question of tariffs in the sugar industry and the dairy industry in relation to competitive exports. I make the point that the dairy industry is similar to the sugar industry in that the dairy farmers need a factory to process their product and also, like the sugar farmers, they had an inward-looking, insular approach where they enjoyed the benefit of fresh milk prices in the domestic markets. They enjoyed a tariff of their own in the way in which they produced the milk, sold it at a premium price on the domestic city markets and then did not care too much about the export markets. A similar situation existed in the sugar industry, which was highly organised with entitlements being allocated to farms and to paddocks and with the mill being attached to the farmers' producti ve enterprise. On that basis, the sugar industry like the dairy industry developed a protective attitude that Australian consumers should assist the sugar industry in its profitability and in a form of protection. This debate here tonight is the end of the line in that whole argument. I support the government's decision to finally remove the sugar tariff. It is quite appropriate in the current debate about the TCF and car industries, which members would be aware I have had more than a passing interest in. The dairy industry gave a lead to these debates with the Kerin plan. I place on record my admiration for the Kerin plan, where the dairy industry changed its emphasis from having a domestic orientation providing city milk to becoming an exporter of excellence both in terms of price received and in the quality products it exported, especially to the Asian region. I have no doubt that the sugar industry can follow its example. Once the sugar tariffs are removed, the sugar industry will be focused on providing export quality products to all those nations around the world and on being able to compete with some of those nations which have their products subsidised. I would refute a couple of the remarks made by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) who was observing that the government had changed their position. It is surprising that he is not in the House. It is the first time during the tariff debate that he is not actually here, but he is late as usual. The important thing that the member for Corio and members opposite should understand is that, whilst in opposition, the government did agree to retain the tariff. A meeting was held with the sugar industry-and they are difficult people-and I recall the minister at the table, the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan), having long discussions with the sugar industry on this whole tariff debate. The minister at the table is well known for his views on the tariff debate. On the 74 recommendations, Harry Bonanno, who is a legendary figure in the sugar industry, agreed that the tariffs should be removed. It was quite clear. The task force agreed with a number of other recommendations-that single desk selling remain, that pooling remain and that the industry itself get an export focus. Nobody could argue with that. The change was made so that the gradual reduction in tariffs down to $55 a tonne, which was introduced by the Labor Party, would finally be removed. I am sure that the shadow minister at the table, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), would agree with it in his heart of hearts. So that has been agreed to. One of my colleagues, the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), has been arguing some case that I do not personally agree with, that in the longer run this government does not agree with and that the former Labor government did not agree with because they were for free trade and for an opening up of world trade positions. I will keep my remarks fairly precise. Could I just say that, in the current debates about the TCF industries, the car industry and the sugar industry, Australia is moving towards a liberal trade position. If you look at the figures, the average tariff on manufactured goods in the 1940s was about 40 per cent and it has now moved down to about four per cent around the world. That puts a lie to the myth that other countries are using high protective barriers to keep Australian goods out. Even China, which has often been quoted in this debate, has announced that by the year 2000 its average tariff will fall from 23 per cent to 15 per cent. The other countries which often get mentioned in both the TCF debate and the car debate-Thailand, Indonesia, Korea, the European Union, Malaysia, the USA, New Zealand, Japan and Singaporehave all substantially reduced their tariff barriers. By the year 2008 those countries will be in the World Trade Organisation and will have their tariff barriers very much lower. Australia needs to follow the lead, particularly in the symbolic sugar tariff. However, it does not really matter because, as all members of this House would be aware, sugar producers export 85 per cent of their production and even more is predicted to be on the export market. I conclude my remarks by quoting an article in today's Australian Financial Review that has the headline 'TCF tariff row rages as IC report imminent'. The correspondent talks about some of the TCF arguments and the current sugar debate. The Executive Director of the NFF, Ms Wendy Craik, summarises the debate in the TCF industries, the car industry and in the sugar industry. The article states: The executive director of the NFF, Ms Wendy Craik, warned yesterday that a tariff pause would ""send very dangerous signals to our trading partners in APEC and the Cairns groups"". ""Any wimping on continuous reductions would give our trading partners the ability to identify their special case, which in all likelihood would be agriculture,"" Ms Craik said. ""The principle of reciprocal trade balancing has gained a worrying level of acceptance. Reciprocity ignores the benefits that arise from domestic trade liberaIisation,"" she said. ""Tariffs don't save jobs. Tariffs cost jobs. The jobs are lost in other industries and in other places. ""The costs in terms of jobs lost are hidden, they are diffused and they are spread widely across the rest of the economy and in future generations ... TCF jobs are visible jobs, but the lost opportunities for other jobs are invisible,"" she said. I rest my case on the remarks of the NFF, which is well known for its very strong advocacy of the free trade position on behalf of its members and on behalf of all Australians. We need to ensure that we obey the rules of the World Trade Organisation so living standards in Australia will improve. The removal of the sugar tariff is a symbol of Australia's commitment to a freer and a more liberal trade regime. Those members opposite were part of a government that set that in train and tonight they are opposing the proposition of removing the $55 per tonne tariff. I ask what their position was. They have now changed so dramatically on the three important aspects of their policy that they had in government. I strongly support the government's position in the whole tariff debate. I regard the removal of the sugar tariff as a very important symbol of the sugar industry in Queensland and northern New South Wales-an industry which historically has always had an inward focus-having a dramatic change of heart, a change of their commitment to a freer, more liberalised trading position. I commend that position to the House.",126
214,Mr MCGAURAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I thank the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) for his usual erudite contribution to this complex and at times very difficult debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 [No.2]. At the same time. I wish to thank the numerous speakers for their own individual contributions to the debate. I have listened to the debate with great interest, as have most members, if not all, throughout the different nooks and crannies of this Parliament House. There were so many different points made, particularly in relation to the removal of the duty on sugar, which I will come to in a moment. Beforehand, I would like to stress another major feature of the bill before the House. I remind members that, in respect of the information technology agreement, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) signed the ministerial declaration on trade in information technology products on behalf of Australia in Singapore in December last. It represents a package of sectoral liberalisation which, in combination with the agreement on basic telecommunications, establishes a trading framework which will underpin the continuing rapid growth of global information and communications infrastructure. The agreement seeks the elimination of tariffs on technology and telecommunications products by the year 2000. During the negotiations the Deputy Prime Minister made clear his requirements for an acceptable and balanced package of liberalisation being achieved and for the participation by a core of our regional trading partners. We ensured that the emerging Asian markets participated in the agreement and that their participation was on a similar basis to that of Australia. Australia stands to gain substantially from the signing of this agreement. The agreement will provide Australian industry with an increased number of export opportunities so as to help redress the almost $7 billion trade deficit in this sector. I tum now to sugar, which preoccupied most of the contributors to the debate. It hardly needs to be said that sugar is a great and successful Australian industry. The fundamental issue for the industry, like all others, is the long-term competitiveness and sustainability. The sugar industry working party examined this issue at length regarding the duty, including a long process of public discussions, submissions and hearings. That working party concluded that changes were necessary to ensure the success of the industry into the future and, therefore, recommended an integrated package of arrangements for this very purpose. The recommendations included: unanimous support from all members, including industry leaders; focus on the export orientation of the industry, which is in excess of 85 per cent of production, rather than arrangements which concentrate on the domestic side of the industry; and the export of refined sugar manufactured products such as sugar as an input. In respect of the tariff, as recognised in the debate, the effects have been negated by the adoption since I July this year of export parity pricing by the Queensland Sugar Corporation. This has been of benefit to the industry through the relief of economic pressures on the Australian refining industry, which has since been given the assurance by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that it will not intervene in the proposed joint venture between the Australian sugar refining businesses of CSR Ltd and Mackay Refined Sugars Pty Ltd. I wish to make the point in this respect that the export orientation of the industry under the export parity pricing arrangement, which has been in place since I July, is consistent with Australia's position as the most competitive international producer of sugar and will mean, in addition to that capacity to compete internationally, the lowest cost domestic sugar, which underscores the obvious unattractiveness of the Australian market to foreign producers. We should remember that the level of imports of raw sugar into Australia in the 1995-96 financial year was only 762 tonnes and the tariff revenue on that sugar was a total of $772. There has been a wide-ranging debate in recent days during the second reading stage of the bill. Given that exposure, I now commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Schedules I to 3-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Schedule 4.",128
215,Mr OKEEFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I move: Schedule 4, items I to 5, page 7 (lines 6 to 20), Bradford, 1. W. omit the items. I do not intend to take the time of the House explaining this amendment in any detail other than to say that these are items that would give effect to the decision to scrap the sugar tariff. We have made it clear on our side of the House that we oppose this decision. The effect of this amendment, if carried, would be that the sugar tariff would remain in place from 1 July.",129

217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," Mr Speaker has received a message from the Senate acquainting the House that Senator Abetz has been discharged from attendance on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and that Senator Synon has been appointed a member of the committee. NA Motion (by Mr MCGauran) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries Henderson MCPherson",130
218,Ms MACKLIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Jagajaga) (7.20 p.m.)The most recent crisis facing local industries and local jobs is, of course, the removal of tariffs for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. On Monday I was one of a number of Labor Party MPs who presented thousands of signatures to the parliament on petitions protesting against the government's plans to cut those tariffs, plans which would have spelt the end of most of our local TCF jobs. Also, in the parliament, we have been visited by mayors from municipalities in areas that are likely to suffer from cuts to TCF tariffs. They are involved in the Victorian local government campaign for TCF jobs and include the Mayor of the Banyule City Council, which is in Jagajaga. The petitions have been signed and the mayors have travelled to PAIRS Canberra because, unlike this government, many thousands of Australians, and certainly people in Jagajaga, believe that tariff cuts to TCF industries would cost tens of thousands of jobs as local manufacturers react by shutting down or moving offshore. Another critical issue for a successful trade policy that I wanted to raise tonight is to have an industry policy that actually encourages and assists local industries to grow and create jobs for local people. A good local example is the West Heidelberg firm of Henderson MCPherson. This company has been in existence for over 70 years and is the main Australian producer of jigsaw puzzles and high grade board games. They also produce wall planners and packaging. Recently they embarked on a venture to export a unique version of Australian designed ultra-modem jigsaw puzzles to the rest of the world. Henderson MCPherson actually set a world record for the production of updated Trivial Pursuit board games, being able to tum around a new version of Trivial Pursuit in six weeks when the average for other producers of the game in other countries was around 10 months. The company has always tried to produce quality products with the utmost efficiency. Their main competitors are in New Zealand and Malaysia. Both competitors operate in a lower wage environment than Australia. This means that Henderson MCPherson must operate more efficiently, using the latest in high-tech equipment and with a highly skilled work force, to compete. Significantly, the management of Henderson MCPherson have also acknowledged to me that they understand the importance of a reasonable level of wages guaranteeing a reasonable level of income for their workers as part of the equation which provides a local market for their products. But they are hampered in their endeavours by a federal government that shows little interest in their problems. There is real suspicion that many of their competitors are dumping in Australia at a price below the actual cost of manufacture. There is also concern that a large amount of competition product is actual pirated material which is produced illegally in other countries. At the same time they see one of the mainstays of their business-producing games under licence for the local distributor of the American toy company, MatteI-being threatened by this government's proposals to allow parallel importing. Parallel importing is too complicated issue for this presentation, but advocates of parallel importing claim that it levels playing field by removing restrictions to trade. The problem with this argument is that restrictions referred to are intellectual property conventions and laws of copyright that underresponsible pin the operation of a large proportion world commerce. Trade in properties incorpotolerance rating intellectual property is the major growth industry that will lead us into the century. The idea that this government might remove protection in this way is something that we would certainly not want to see happen. empathy Allowing parallel importing would remove the core business that has allowed Henderson are MCPherson to employ 80 people in Jagajaga. It would be a major disincentive to the comcircumstances pany in its risky, but potentially very valuable for Australia, export endeavours. Diana, Princess of Wales",130
219,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"We were all greatly saddened by the news of death of the Princess of Wales, her compansuffered ion Dodi Al-Fayed and their driver last Sunday. It is still a shock to many of us indeed, many worldwide that we have lost courageous, unique and caring woman whom the world loved. Princess Diana has been part of all of our lives. My heart goes out her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, who still must be in a state of shock and grief while they mourn the loss of their mother. During her life Princess Diana championed many charitable causes and was genuinely interested in improving life for the poor the sick. She was held in very high esteem the people she worked with on important national and international projects. Princess Diana had most recently championed the people. cause for the banning of all landmines after she had seen the terrible effect these devices had on the innocent men, women and children who had been caught up in war. Her grief for those who suffered was real and she gave voice to those whose cries for help had been ignored. Our own Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has also championed the banning of landmines worldwide on behalf of the an Australian government. The Princess of Wales showed a great deal the of love for the children of the world. She rightly understood that they are our future and the that we should be doing everything in our power to help them to live and grow up to be and healthy individuals. Princess of Diana was also a person who showed great and understanding for those who have too often been shunned by society. Her 21 st work for the victims of AIDS demonstrated this understanding, as did her work with sufferers of leprosy. As a mother of three boys I felt particular with the late Princess during the time of the break-up of her marriage. Such times always very difficult. The difficulties were even greater for Princess Diana because of the in which she lived. Her eldest son, Prince William, will one day be King. Neither he nor his brother, Prince Harry, will ever live normal lives as we know life to be. Their lives will be under constant scrutiny by the press and we have expectations on how the they should behave, and they have now the loss of their much loved mother. We can only imagine how inconsolable and, their grief must be. When they appeared in a public with their mother, their mutual love was clear for all to see. Princess Diana was a very close to both of the boys. How utterly to tragic it is that she will never see them grow up to be men. How hard it will be for them to have lost their mother at this time in such tragic circumstances. Like many of us, the princes will have their memories of the times they shared with their and mother. We remember her visits to Australia by and the good work she did whilst here. We remember her kind words, her friendly smile, her warmth and her ability to reach out to all On behalf of the people of my electorate of Makin, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends of Princess Diana, Dodi Al-Fayed and their driver. Our thoughts and prayers are with the royal family at this time of grief and mourning, especially to Princess Diana's sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. May the 'Princess of the People', the 'Princess of Hearts', rest in peace. Tuggeranong Australian Rules Football",131
220,Ms ELLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I want to be very parochial, as I normally am, and talk about the Tuggeranong Football Club-that is, the Tuggeranong Aussie Rules Football Club. Tuggeranong Football Club is a team competitor in the ACTAFL competition. For those not local, ACTAFL is the quick name for the ACT Australian Football League. This team of young players, the committee, the workers and the supporters can be an inspiration to all of us, particularly here in Canberra. Last Sunday I had the pleasure to go and watch this team win the ACTAFL Preliminary Final, earning a berth in this coming weekend's Grand Final. It is no mean feat getting into a grand final in any competition, but this particular feat is really worth looking at. Not that long ago-in fact only five years back-the Tuggeranong ACTAFL team was consistently beaten each week by scores almost worthy of a Bradman batting innings. It was even looking possible that they could no longer maintain a position in the ACTAFL first grade competition. However, we had huge numbers of juniors playing in the Tuggeranong Valley and very good individual players were nurtured through those ranks. Of course, too many people enjoyed their football to let that actually happen. A community effort was called for and with a lot of hard work, determination and dedication the club was reborn. From the team that played on Sunday, 25 players are listed in the fixture and 18 of them have come through from the Tuggeranong junior football ranks. That is in no way taking away from the other seven, but it is certainly emphasising the strength of the sport within my community. Four of our Tuggeranong ex-juniors are now playing first grade AFL-Hamill and Anstey with Carlton, Blumfield with Essendon and Howman with Hawthorn. I do not mind that none of them happen to be playing with my team in the first grade AFL; I am just pleased to see that they have reached that level. Club This coming weekend three Tuggeranong teams are playing in grand finals-the Canberra District Finals second division, the under 21 s Colts, as well as the first grade team to which I have referred. Everyone of the players, the trainers, the runners, the volunteers, the committee members, the stalwart supporters and, of course, the sponsors should feel extremely proud of this effort. The club's finances are low. A small budget is what they work on, but the determination is very high indeed. The sponsors over the past five years deserve a lot of praise, particularly the sponsors who have been with the club this year and last year. The coach, Geoff Bartley, has given so much for so little. To everyone involved in the club and particularly in this team-Bill Miller, the club president; Geoff Bartley, the coach; Luke Jess, the captain; Sue Birks, the secretary; Canvas Kearney, the local character of the club; Bob Hughes, who is the runner each week out there on the· ground; all the sponsors; the two youngest players listed last week who are only 17, Scott Montgomery and Shaun Whitby; the Honey Brothers, who joined us this year; and Ricci Miller-thank you from a community that also happens to be struggling through tough times. I wish I could have named them all-the list is absolutely endless-but obviously I cannot. If you can get this far in difficult circumstances as the Tuggeranong Football Club has done, the whole community could learn what a bit of absolute determination and dedication against tough circumstances can produce. It will be a pleasure to go along on Sunday and watch this grand final. Win, lose or draw, the Tuggeranong community is incredibly proud of the effort that has gone into this club and into this team. On behalf of the community, thank you to them and all power to them on Sunday. Federated Clerks Union: Townsville",132
221,Mr LINDSAY,ADJOURNMENT,"Herbert) (7.32 p.m.)Tonight I wish to bring to the urgent attention of the House a serious situation facing the Federated Clerks Union in Townsville and its secretary, Jim O'Donnell. The issue relates to letters the failure of the union to account for its operations over several years the Workplace Relations Act. News reports of The the union's position broadcast on the local radio station today by journalist John Camplin have brought a sinister response. Staff of the radio station have been subjected to standover tactics when they have simply been doing ments their job as a community watchdog. I am advised that a senior union the FCU threatened a senior member radio station staff just because they are doing this job. This is un-Australian and will be most concerning as the secretary of the union has national put his name forward to be the ALP for the state seat of Mundingburra. This incident today is just another page in the sorry events within the Labor Party in Townsville. The city has been rocked with shock after shock--electoral roll details being altered for political purposes without the knowledge of the elector, dead persons voting in ALP plebiscites for the last four years, persons carrying out criminal activity for political purposes and being offered seats on the council in return, ALP members voting without ever having received a ballot paper, ALP memberships paid by candidates in return for getting their ballot papers, branch # fees stacking on a grand scale-and so it goes on. The decent, long time ordinary supporters of the ALP must be horrified that a few with personal ambitions can so rort their party's system. In relation to the failure of this ALP candidate to lodge financial documents, aims yesterday I had confirmed with the Australian Industrial Registry that the union has not effortfaith lodged its financial documents of the branch unaccountable. for the years 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996. A formal investigation should be members, requested. These documents are required by law. I understand, as I have a document from acting the national union secretary, that these docudo this? ments also have not been lodged with the national secretary as also is required by law. I now wish to read into the record a note that I have received from an apparently disgruntled member of the union. It states: There is an urgent need for the Federated Clerks Union, North Queensland, and it's branch secretary Jim O'Donnell to be investigated. The attached show that union funds cannot be accounted for and the union is in breach of the Workplace as required by Relations Act 1996. act requires that unions lodge with the Australian Industrial Registry the annual audited statements of the union. Failure to do so may result in an investigation into the finances of the union. Jim O'Donnell has failed to lodge financial docurelating to his union for the years ending 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996. Audited financial statements of the union have not been presented to official of members of the union. of the That amazes me. To continue: In addition Jim O'Donnell has not forwarded copies of his unions financial statements to the ASU office to which his union is affiliated as candidate required by branch rules. These facts raise a number of questions # have the books of the FCU in fact been audited if so why have they not been tabled with the Industrial Registry or the ASU # if the books have not been audited what is happening to union members money # were the books audited in 1997. Did the union hold its meeting in June 1997 to present the statements # has all of Jim O'Donnells and the FCUs income and expenditure gone through the books # has Jim O'Donnell got something to hide can Jim O'Donnell account for union members and justify his expenditure # has the Industrial Registry investigated the FCU. If not why not. If they have why has this not been reported to union members Union members expect unions and officials to use their fees in a responsible manner to further the of their union. The requirement of unions to be financially accountable to their members is an to ensure that members fees are used in good and that unions do not become corrupt and Jim O'Donnell needs to be able to satisfy his his national body and the Industrial Registry that he is meeting the requirements and in the best interests of his members. Can he Why is Mr Jim O'Donnell trying to get into parliament. Is this an attempt to escape his responsibilities at the union and the inevitable action being taken against him. Does Jim have to go? That is a document that I have received from obviously a disgruntled member of the union in the course of the last 24 hours. I seek leave to table the documents that have been presented to me. Leave not granted. Tariff Reform",133
222,Mr WILTON,ADJOURNMENT,"It is with great pleasure that I rise to join with 23 urban and regional mayors of Victoria who are currently in this place promoting their cause for the rescinding of the Productivity Commission's view on tariff reform. Those 23 mayors cover some 2.5 million constituents, all of whom, I am sure, would join with the mayors, many in this House and me to ask that the government look to reject its so called initiatives to date in this regard. As Victorians, these mayors know how our state has particularly suffered and will suffer at the hands of these reforms. The clothing, textile and footwear industries are at the forefront in regard to the decline of our manufacturing industry, particularly in Victoria. Whilst I suspect that most members would appreciate and accept that our industrial base does have to adapt to changing international circumstances, and that our future does perhaps lie in such new industries as communications, information technology and food processing, the Industry Commission's striving for ideological purity, which we have seen first through its report on the automotive industry and now on the TCF industry, is illfounded and has great potential detriment to reap upon the Australian economy. The honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) and I recently visited the Bekaert (Australia) textile works in Lyndhurst, within the electorate of Isaacs, to discuss with it the Industry Commission's recommendations to reduce tariffs in the textile, clothing and footwear industries. These tariff reductions would destroy the local industries and many local jobs, and are opposed by a broad coalition, including the opposition and local manufacturers such as Bekaert. This company employs some 120 people from the Dandenong and Cranbourne areas. It is the leading Australian company operating in the specialised field of jacquard weaving, producing a range of damask fabrics, including mattress ticking, upholstery fabrics, curtain fabrics, bed and table linen, vertical blinds and much more. On that day we both saw the capabilities which may be lost to Australia if the Industry Commission's report, which Bekaert believed to be deeply flawed in its method and conclusions, is allowed to go unchallenged. This company is planning to set up investments of up to $10 million between now and the year 2000 and to expand its facilities and further increase its employment. However, it has placed its expansion on hold until the future of the industry is determined. The Industry Commission recommends tariff cuts to the industry to between 11 per cent and 8.5 per cent by 2005, and to five per cent by 2008, regardless of what Australia's competitors do. If the federal government were to follow these recommendations, it would not only destroy the industry but also put at risk the jobs of more than 4,800 workers from Melbourne's outer south-eastern region employed in the TCF areas. As well as the tariff cuts to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, the commission has recommended the import credit scheme be abandoned in the year 2000. Since it was introduced in 1991, Australia's exports of textiles, clothing and footwear have more than doubled. As the shadow minister for industry, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), has made clear, the opposition would be working with the industry to gain firm commitments not just to secure existing levels of employment but to create new jobs, new levels of investment and increased exports. Labor would look at a pause in tariff reductions from 2000 to 2005 when the international agreement on textiles clothingmultifibre arrangement liberalisation is scheduled to be completed; retention of the import credit scheme or an equivalent; a review of future assistance arrangements in 2004, taking account of progress on trade liberalisation among trading partners, the industry's progress in meeting its commitments, and the effect of changes in the TCF industry on regional Australia. The clear lesson for the government in this report is that the Industry Commission has become more irrelevant and out of touch. I join with our local mayors, Greg Harris from Dandenong, Bill Nixon from Kingston and Wayne Smith from Casey, in urging the government to rethink its position in this regard. Indeed, in that matter I am happy also to join with the Senate and other speakers in this place to oppose the Industry Commission's recommendations. Public Funds for Political Purposes",134
223,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"I believe the general public has always had an idea that there are two sets of rules operating in society: one for politicians and one for the rest of the community. It is something most politicians would disagree with and a myth which I work hard in my electorate to dispel, as do many other elected members in this House on all sides of the political fence. Yet there are times when issues arise which make even the most trusting and naive constituentand politician I might add-query the level playing field of our society. Such an example arose recently, and it is not only one which affects my electorate of Gilmore or the state of New South Wales but also one that all politicians and community representatives must think twice about, and that is the allocation of public funds for political purposes. I refer of course to the recent publicity surrounding a tour of the western New South Wales region by the federal member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). While not wishing to comment on what was said or protested about during this much publicised tour, one fact caught my attention and that of the people in my electorate. There were 60 New South Wales police allocated to escort the federal member on her tour. This does not include the bomb squad and up to 20 federal police officers who also followed the media and protest circus during its tour. That makes more than 80 police officers protecting one politician. This sort of police allocation comes at an interesting time for New South Wales country residents. It comes at a time when state, territory and federal crime rates are continuing to increase, at a time when the people of the Gilmore electorate are facing a greater chance of being burgled in their homes, and at a time when vandalism, assault and drug charges are on the increase; and at a time when the New South Wales government is considering cutting back the numbers of police in rural areas. This is in marked contrast to the police presence given one politician during a media stunt in the western region of that same state. In my electorate of Gilmore, police recently formed a target arrest group, which focused on property crime, something which has risen dramatically in the region over the past few years. This has resulted in tens of thousands of dollars of stolen property being recovered and returned to its rightful owners. While concentrating on property theft, TAG has also arrested criminals wanted for a range of drug and assault offences, thus having an even greater impact on the safety of Gilmore residents and their families. These are the sorts of results the community in Gilmore likes to see from its police, and I commend the local force for the introduction and success of the group. However, these are also the sorts of examples rural residents hold up as arguments for an increased police presence in regional areas. I am aware that this is a state issue. However, my constituents do not and cannot see the fairness of a government which allocates 60 state police officers to protecting one politician when they cannot safely walk the streets at night and are forced to live behind locked doors and windows, too afraid to come out, particularly the elderly. The community is asking why there are double standards for politicians. The community wants to know how government can justify cutbacks in an area which is vital for community protection while increasing the allocation of the same services to one of their own. The community wants to know why programs with proven results in protection are being threatened by these proposed cuts and why there is no corresponding cut in services to politicians. They want to know who is paying the cost for such double standards, which are justified on the grounds of purely political motives. I believe it is high time the community received an answer. Community Aid Abroad: Human Rights Campaign Medicare Office Closure: Deer Park Diana, Princess of Wales",135
224,Mr OKEEFE,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to briefly inform the House of three matters of interest to me relating to my own electorate of Burke. Recently I joined the Community Aid Abroad group at Bacchus Marsh to sign the charter for the international rights campaign being launched by Community Aid Abroad. I was joined by the mayor and local councillors Rex Thorborn, Del Leggatt and Mike Carrington, along with members Ruth Stewart, Jean Lycette and Annette Lewis. I would like to encourage all members of the House, and certainly other people in my electorate, to take note of the Community Aid Abroad human rights campaign. I encourage them to give it the support that it warrants. On a less conciliatory note, I would also like to tell you that this week I have tabled in the House a petition, containing several thousand signatures from my electorate, protesting on behalf of the residents of Deer Park about the government's plan to close their Medicare office. I am, through this means, imploring the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to take note of the signatures on that petition and the views behind it. These people do value access to Medicare. It was a commitment of the government prior to the election that it would not dismantle Medicare, and yet 44 offices around Australia are being closed, including this one in Deer Park in my electorate. I will continue that campaign. I will continue to press the rights of my constituents, and I will continue to call on the minister to rethink this particular issue and rethink the planned closure of the Deer Park Medicare office. Mr Speaker, finally, on a more sombre note, I would like to inform you and the House that I intend to write to the High Commissioner in London, Dr Blewett, to ask him to convey to the family of Diana, Princess of Wales, the thoughts at this moment of members of my electorate. The particular reason is that in November 1985, during the time of Victoria's 150th celebration, she and her then husband, the Prince of Wales, visited Gisborne in my electorate to meet with people who were still recovering from the ravages of the Ash Wednesday bushfire. Their visit meant an enormous amount to my constituents at that time. I have had a number of calls suggesting that it would be terrific if I did convey something on behalf of my constituency. I intend to do that, and I thought I should inform the House of that intention. Medicare Office Closures Waterfront Reform",136
225,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to comment briefly on the remarks made by the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) when he criticised this government for closing a number of Medicare offices across the nation. It should be recognised that this is not a cost saving measure; indeed, the government has opened Medicare agencies situated in pharmacies. So there will be very much greater access by people throughout the country to the facilities of Medicare than previously existed. It ought to be recognised as well that, in the time since Medicare and its predecessor, Medibank, were set up, there have been substantial changes in the way in which people access the medical benefits system of this country. In the past, most medical practitioners used to bill their patients and their patients would then make a claim at the local Medicare office. In many areas, the medical practitioners overwhelmingly bulk-bill the Health· Insurance Commission. Consequently, there has not been a need for local Medicare offices in all situations-as, indeed, there may well have been in the past. The government has decided to maintain Medicare offices in most places throughout the country. The electorate of Fisher did not lose any Medicare offices, although two were suggested for closure. But the government decided that those people in rural and regional areas who were more removed from Medicare offices ought to have a facility to deal electronically with the Health Insurance Commission, and so the government placed Medicare agencies in pharmacies. Rather than cutting away at Medicare, rather than reducing access to Medicare, this government, and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in particular, ought to be congratulated because the government has brought Medicare within the geographic reach of a very much greater proportion of the citizens of Australia. I did not expect to be talking on that particular topic when I rose to speak in the adjournment debate tonight. Like most of us, I read the Sunday newspapers. I must say I was absolutely appalled at the headline in the Sun-Herald of Sunday, 31 August when I saw the words 'Water rats-It's war on our $87,000 wharfies'. This government has reformed the industrial relations system. We have tried to make this country more competitive. Successive governments have endeavoured to make it easier for people to export. But there was one decidedly obvious failure of the former Labor government, and that was the lack of any commitment to reform the Australian waterfront. We only have to look at the lack of performance of the Australian waterfront compared with the waterfronts in Rotterdam, Singapore and many other places to realise that much needs to be done. This article by Fia Cumming in the SunHerald exposed many of the rorts which are currently making our waterfront so uncompetitive. It is interesting to note that the average weekly wage at Port Botany is almost $87,000 a year for a maximum 31-hour week and just 175.5 work days annually. In some other ports workers earn up to $124,000 a year. Perks include five weeks holidays, plus 10 weeks sick leave, four days long service leave and-can you believe it?-idle time of 35 days a year. They have a system called the 'The Nick'. Under 'The Nick' system, many wharfies clock on and then clock off just a few hours later. Banking allowances can add an extra $5,000 per year to the average wage. Port companies estimate that when walking time to and from the mealroom is included, their workers are on duty for just 28.9 hours per week. Sunday penalty rates are 2Y2 times the base rate for the first 7.4 hours and 3.5 times the base rate for other hours. Annual leave and long service leave attract a 27V2 per cent loading compared with 17Y2 per cent for most other workers. Sick leave of 10 days can be accumulated over years and amounts over 28 days can be cashed at any time. Can you believe, Mr Speaker, that a laundry allowance of $13.90 a week is paid even though overalls provided are washed at work? This is one thing that really must be attacked. We must encourage exports; we must make it easy for us to trade our way out of the deficit left to this government by our predecessors. It is about time that something was done about the waterfront. It is outrageous that the Keating government did absolutely nothing, or very little. We have to make sure that we are internationally competitive and that conditions on the waterfront are comparable with those in overseas ports. Vision for Australia Second Sydney Airport Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (7.53 p.m.)-I rise tonight to speak on a vision for Australia, especially with respect to information technology. However, given the announcement today of the EIS for Sydney's second airport, I must convey to the House the disappointment of hundreds of my constituents who are opposed to the airport at Badgerys Creek. I wish to give them the reassurance that I will represent their concerns in this place and ensure that the cabinet and bureaucrats who made this executive decision are aware of the issues that they have raised with me. I will ensure where possible that those concerns are addressed. A major infrastructure project like an airport does not happen without environmental impacts but there are also good things, as I would like to point out. The member for  April 1994: An international airport in this area would create countless opportunities for the area's people and businesses. He also said, on 5 May 1994: Minister Brereton has at last broken with the FAC monopoly which was strangling the development of an international airport at Badgerys Creek. The airport will be providing the people of western Sydney with the services and facilities that they deserve. The member for Kingsford-Smith, Laurie Brereton, stated in the Hansard of 8 February 1995: As a local member near Kingsford-Smith Airport, my greatest fear is that, without the development of Badgerys Creek as an alternative to provide curfew-free access so that Sydney has an airport that can operate 24-hours a day, it is inevitable ... Laurie Brereton also said: The airport at Badgerys Creek will provide a major boost to the economy of the western Sydney region as well as make a valuable contribution to Australia's aviation and tourism industries. The construction phase of the airport provides significant employment opportunities and more jobs will be created as commercial enterprises are attracted to the airport and the surrounding area. I could go on and on. Penrith City Council, Faye Lo Po, Di Beamer, WSROC with Maggie Deahm, Jim Anderson-a number of MPs in the outer greater western Sydney area under Labor have quite supported the airport at Badgerys Creek for some time. I find it outrageous that Bob Carr made a statement today; with political expediency, he is seeking political gain out of the distress of hundreds of my constituents. I think the transparency of his political playing is quite obvious and will not be lost on the constituents of western Sydney, who have listened to Labor MPs in the west for several years now. Given this vision for Australia and given that unemployment is the major issue in my area, I need to reiterate what this government has done to address that feeling of unfulfiIled potential, of stagnation and lost opportunity, that the people in my electorate have felt after 13 years under Labor. They feel that we have not lived up to our potential here in Australia and they are seeking some relief. I have been foIlowing with interest a number of recent reports in the IT debate. One that has come up recently is that of the Information Policy Adyisory Council, relating to a national policy framework for structural adjustment of information within the Commonwealth. It is a most important document which looks at how we do business as a government, how we can do it cheaper with IT and how we can integrate various Commonwealth agencies so that they are interoperable, as weIl as building measures to cut out waste. I am keen to see measures in the Goldsworthy report, in the Mortimer reviews and also in Make or break from the MTIA being brought together by this government with a vision for a way to go ahead, in order to compete with Malaysia, India and the United States in terms of building, here in Australia, mighty enterprises that will carry us into the next century. I refer especiaIly to the future of our kids. Where they are going to be employed is one of the major issues in my electorate. Unless we continue to address these issues, battling Australians, the working poor of my area, will continue to feel that Australia is not the lucky country, but a place that has missed opportunities. I know they are with me 100 per cent as we stand here and battle to get some of those industries up and started in my electorate. We are looking at a whole framework within government, which has taken some time to unravel from the past 13 years, in order to devise some policy structure in which this can all be brought forward. It has been looked at in a number of reports and it has all been tied together for a vision for our great country. Member for Lindsay",136
226,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"When I listened to the contribution made by the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie KeIly), I was reminded of what a sensible decision the electors of Lindsay made, not only in the election in March last year, but in the by-election later in the year. As I move around the parliament, I often talk to Jackie KeIly, the member for Lindsay, and she is a relentless and fearless advocate for her constituents. She stands up and she is counted, and she is absolutely determined to make sure that the battlers of Lindsay have their concerns heard here in the federal parliament. When you look at the recycled, failed Ross Free, how on earth could the Labor Party ever contemplate putting him in yet again as the candidate for Lindsay? You have got the choice of the honourable member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, or you have got the choice of yet another failed Labor member. I urge everyone to continue to vote for Jackie Kelly.",138

House adjourned at 8.00 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Jull to move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of infrastructure on the Bradshaw Field Training Area, near Timber Creek, NT. Mr Jull to move: That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 2 September 1997, namely: Installation of glass safety barriers to the viewing ports in the curved walJs on the roof of Parliament House. Mr Williams to present a bill for an act to amend the Native Title Act 1993, and for related purposes. Mr Williams to move: (1) That: (a) the proposed changes to the Native Title Act 1993 and other Acts contained in the Native Title Amendment BiJJ 1997 presented to the House this day be referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund for consideration and report to the House by 27 October 1997; and (b) the terms of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the standing and sessional orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing and sessional orders. (2) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this reference to the Committee. Mr MCClelland to move: That this House: (1) notes that the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) has significantly enhanced the export of motor vehicles and motor vehicle components; (2) acknowledges that the current scheme discriminates against most car component exporters in the way export credits are calculated because while exporters of motor vehicles, engines and transmissions can earn credits under the EFS by reference to a formula that includes the value of raw materials in the exported goods, for all other component exports, raw materials are excluded in the application of a value added formula; and (3) given the discrimination against most car component manufacturers under the current EFS, determines that a new replacement scheme should be equitable to all exporters of vehicle, engines and transmissions and also for exporters of other car components. 7740",139

Another thing the industry could do to update mostly seem to be the ones who are coming systems.

250,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) The Department has no record of payment to the Coalition for Gun Control or its agents to bring to Australia parents of victims from the Dunblane tragedy. (2) The Department has no record of payment, jobs or other forms of assistance being provided to the Coalition for Gun Control. The Department has, however, a contract with Social Change Media for public relations activities under the National Mental Health Strategy's Community Awareness Program. Social Change Media employed Ms Rebecca Peters for about three months in late 1995·96 to undertake some of those public relations activities. As the Department's contract is with Social Change Media, the Department is unaware of what payment was made to Ms Peters. Social Change Media also undertook public relations activities in relation to National Mental Health Week in October 1996. To the Department's knowledge, Ms Peters participated in two initial meetings about the Week, but her involvement did not continue. Again, the Department is unaware of any payment that Social Change Media may have made in respect of Ms Peters' involvement. Ms Peters was a presenter at the Departmentally conducted 'Symposium on the Public Health Approach to Fire Arm Violence' on 11-12 February 1997. The Department paid for Ms Peters' airfare (Sydney-Canberra return) and accommodation at a total cost of $257.46. (3) The Department is unaware of any funding of this nature to the Coalition for Gun Control by State departments, but is not in a position to answer this question definitively and would suggest that the question be referred to State Governments. Australian Food Standards Code (Question No. 1816) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 16 June 1997: (I) Are imported peanuts being withheld from sale; if so, (a) what is the country of origin, (b) they be returned to the sender and (c) are they being withheld because of heavy metal contamination; if so, what is the (i) contamination and (ii) level of contamination.

251,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Imported peanuts found to be in breach of the requirements of the Food Standards Code (the Code) are withheld from sale. (a) Peanuts found to be in breach of the Code originate from a wide range of countries. Peanuts that have been in breach for cadmium levels originated from: Argentina; China; India; Malaysia; New Zealand; Philippines; Singapore; USA: Vietnam. (b) There are a range of options available for imported foods which are in breach of the Code. These include reprocessing to bring the product into compliance, re-export of the product and destruction of the product. Importers must negotiate the most appropriate option with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. In the case of imported peanuts, where there is no approved method of bringing failed peanuts into compliance they are either re-exported or destroyed. (c) Imported peanuts have been found to be in will breach of the Code both for aflatoxin contamination and heavy metal contamination. (i) The heavy metal is cadmium. (ii) The levels of cadmium found in peanuts that exceed the maximum permitted concentration of 0.05 mg/kg range from 0.06-0.25 mg/kg. (2) The European Union has not set levels for cadmium in foods. The Australian Food Standards Code details levels for cadmium in a range of food commodities as follows: 0.05 mg/kg 0.2mg/kg 0.5mg/kg 0.35 mg/kg 0.25 mg/kg 0.25 mg/kg 0.2mg/kg 0.2mg/kg 2.5mg/kg 1.25 mg/kg 0.2mg/kg 2.0mg/kg 0.2mg/kg 0.005 mg/kg 0.2mg/kg 0.05 mg/kg (3) The peanut entry within the cadmium category has not been altered since it was introduced in 1980. The cadmium category is contained in Standard A12-Metals and Contaminants in Foods. Standard A12 was last altered on 4 April 1996. Entries in the cadmium category of Standard A12 were last altered on 9 March 1994. (4) There is a proposal currently before the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council (the Ministerial Council responsible for food matters) to amend the cadmium category of Standard A 12 as part of the total review of all food standards. In order for the proposal to result in a change to the standard a majority of Health Ministers will need to agree to the recommendation. The statement of reasons provided by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council details the following reasons for the amendment: In developing the draft variation, the Authority had regard to the following principles: The public health principle that contaminant levels in food should be safe and as low as reasonably achievable and that maximum permitted concentrations for food should reflect this principle. This principle is based on the premise that contaminants have no intended function in food and their associated health risks may not yet be fully understood. This approach is consistent with that adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. The following additional principles should be applied when establishing Maximum Permitted Concentrations (MPCs) for contaminants. These are secondary to the broader section 10 objectives of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991: I. An MPC will be established only where it serves an effective risk management function; and MPCs will be set for: (a) all primary commodities (described using Codex food commodity groupings) which provide, or may potentially provide, a significant contribution to the total dietary contaminant intake, as indicated by dietary exposure assessments; and (b) nominated processed foods where the setting of an MPC for the primary commodity is judged to be ineffective. 2. An MPC will be set at a level which is consistent with public health and safety as determined by an appropriate risk assessment procedure based on dietary modelling I and which is reasonably achievable from sound primary production and natural resource management practices. Australian and New Zealand data will normally be used for this purpose. 3. In setting an MPC, consideration will be given to Australia and New Zealand*s international trade obligations under the World Trade Organisation*s Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) agreement and Technical Barrier to Trade (TBT) agreement. In developing the draft variation, the Authority had regard to the following additional matters: There is now sufficient information available to identify the major sources of cadmium in the diet. On the basis of all the data available, the total daily intake of cadmium for the average consumer is 9-15 micrograms/day. This is well below the provisional tolerable weekly intake established by the Joint (FAO/WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) which is equivalent to an intake of 70 micrograms/day. This is the internationally accepted safe level of exposure for cadmium. There are a number of measures, other than MPCs, that might be used to reduce contaminant levels in the food supply and consequent dietary intakes. Other measures include improving primary commodity production practices and developing appropriate education programs for population groups with potential for high exposure to particular contaminants. The proposed MPCs will control the cadmium levels in the major food commodities and also in those food commodities where there may be potential for cadmium levels to increase if MPCs were not present. The revised MPCs will provide realistic and enforceable standards to ensure that cadmium exposure now and in the future is well within internationally accepted safe levels. The drafting prepared after Full Assessment is amended for the following reasons: The reference to 'mammalian* after the foods, kidney, liver and meat has been replaced by 'cattle, sheep and pig* in order to clearly identify the species to which the MPC applies. Thus, horse and all other species are not subject to this standard. With reference to meat, the word 'flesh* has been included in order to be consistent with the definition of meat in Standard C 1. The reference to 'molluscs* has been qualified to exclude dredge/bluff oysters and queen scallops which have naturally-occurring cadmium levels above 2 mglkg. These two species do not require a specific MPC as they do not occur in areas where potential contamination could occur, and they contribute only a small amount of cadmium to the total dietary cadmium intake. A specific MPC for leafy vegetables has been included in order to continue providing incentive for responsible agricultural management practices which will not lead to an increase in the level of cadmium in these foods. The MPC for potatoes has been widened to include other root and tuber vegetables in order to continue providing an incentive for the use of responsible agricultural management practices which will not lead to an increase in the level of cadmium in these foods. A specific MPC for rice has been included because rice forms a significant and growing component of the diet and additional data has been provided upon which to establish an MPC for this staple food. The MPC has been established at a level which is consistent with maintaining public health and safety and is the same level as proposed for wheat. The proposed new MPCs set safe but more realistic levels for major commodity products including wheat and potatoes. These proposed new MPCs will rectify the current situation in which significant proportions of Australian products are made non-compliant. I Dietary modelling is a technique which combines dietary intake date or model diets with concentration data for food chemicals to estimate dietary exposure to that food chemical. Political Correctness (Question No. 1869) Mr Barry Jones asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: (1) Has he made public statements on ""political correctness"" in the context of (a) criticism of the ABC, (b) media diversity and (c) the views of the Member for Oxley. (2) If so, (a) what is his definition of political correctness and (b) how does he differentiate it from tolerance. (3) Is he able to say whether political correctness was a term revived in the USA in 1990 and used satirically and abusively by commentators, broadcasters and writers on the right of the political spectrum against advocates of affirmative action, proponents of textbooks using both male and female language, and opponents of racial, religious or gender stereotyping or intolerance. (4) Is he able to provide specific examples of political correctness being used to stifle free speech in Australia; if so, by whom and who was affected. (5) Has his attention been drawn to comments that his attacks on political correctness have been taken to give a licence to use discriminatory or denigratory language, and a move away from tolerance and good manners to a confrontationist style; if so, will he clarify the situation.",182
252,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(5) My comments about political correctness were made in a wide context. I have stated in this place (House of Representatives 30 October 1996, page 6159) my belief that people in Australia should not be denied the opportunity of participating in a vigorous fashion in open political debate. Freedom of speech, however. carries with it a responsibility to exercise that freedom in a tolerant and moderate fashion and not as a vehicle for insensitivity or intolerance. War Disability Allowance Recipients: Electoral Division of Barton (Question No. 1875) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: (1) How many ex-servicemen and women who reside within the electoral division of Barton are in receipt of a war disability allowance. (2) How many persons referred to in part (I) are totally and permanently incapacitated. (3) Will ex-service institutions such as the Lady Davidson Home in Turramurra, become aged care facilities on or after 1 July 1997. (4) Will entry to an aged care facility on or after 1 July 1997 require payment of a means tested accommodation bond. (5) Will the family home of an applicant be included in the assets test. (6) Will war disability allowances be income tested for the first time for the purpose of determining an applicant's eligibility for admission to an aged care facility. (7) Will other eligibility criteria for ex-servicemen be laid down from I July 1997; if so, what. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 1 214 are in receipt of a disability pension. (2) 137 are in receipt of a special rate (or totally and permanently incapacitated) pension. (3) Lady Davidson Hospital is currently owned and operated by the Repatriation Commission for the treatment of veterans. It is not an age care facility but a sub-acute care hospital. Lady Davidson provides rehabilitation, palliative care and other non-acute care services. The Hospital will be sold to Australian Hospital Care, a private operator, with effect from 1 October 1997. Veterans and war widows in New South Wales will continue to have the choice of treatment Lady Davidson Hospital under a long term ment between the Repatriation Commission Australian Hospital Care. Under this arrangement Australian Hospital Care will be required to maintain the current services at Lady Davidson, ie rehabilitation, palliative care and other non-acute care services, at an equivalent or better standard of care than at present. The future operation of the Hospital by Australian Hospital Care will mean that Lady Davidson Hospital will also be available to the general community. (4) Entry to an aged care facility may require payment of an accommodation bond if the ing resident can afford to pay one. The bond is not means tested although the resident's minimum assets levels are protected. Where they to pay the bond the resident has six months to pay. The implementation of this measure has been deferred from 1 July 1997 to relevant legislation passed through Parliament on 27lh June 1997. (5) Aged care residents by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (or Department of Social Security) for the purposes of determining an accommodation bond. The amount of a bond will be negotiated between the aged care facility and the person seeking care. However, there is protection for persons entering care that they are left with at least $22,500 in $45,000 for a couple. A person's home is not counted as an asset these purposes if: the resident's spouse or dependent child is living in the home; or a carer or close relative of the resident has what. been living in the home for at least five years and the carer or relative is eligible pension or benefit payable by DV A or DSS. This protection continues to apply for as long the resident remains in aged care even if the spouse, carer or close relative later leaves the home. (6) and (7) Eligibility for admission to aged care is based only on a person's need for assessed by an Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT). The person's income is not taken into account and is not known by the ACAT. Income assessment for fees purposes will use same rules as those applied by DV A (and DSS) in calculating rates of income support pensions. Under the income assessment rules for service pension, disability pension and allowances are not counted as income. Disability pension is counted as income where a at person receives any other form of income support agreesuch as age pension payable by DSS or Income and Support Supplement paid by DV A. Department of Social Security: Reconciliation Convention (Question No. 1884) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon the services of notice, on 23 June 1997: Did the Minister's Department or agencies within the Minister's responsibility provide assistance for persons to attend the Reconciliation Convention in intendMelbourne in May 1997; if so, what. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to are required the honourable member's question: Three staff from the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Area East Victoria attended the 1 October 1997. The Convention. Costs involved Travel Allowance of $508.75 for one officer and $1,200.00 for registration of all will not be assets tested three. Schools: Funding (Question No. 1895) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for ensures Schools, Vocational Education and Training, assets or upon notice, on 23 June 1997: (1) Does the Commonwealth Government for contribute a sum for each student enrolled at a government school; if so, what. (2) Does the Commonwealth Government apply criteria to fund new non-government schools; if so, (3) Must non-government schools have minimum for a numbers to apply for funding. (4) What percentage of school running costs are as met by (a) State and (b) Commonwealth funds. (5) Is there more than one source of federal funding for non-government schools. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable care as member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth Government provides general recurrent grants to State government school systems as block grants calculated on a per student the basis. The rates for government school students in 1997 are $352 per primary school student and $520 per secondary school student. The Commonwealth also provides assistance for students with disabilities of $72 for each eligible government primary school student and $105 for each eligible secondary school student. Additional funding for Indigenous students is provided through the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program (IESIP). The IESIP rates for students in remote areas are $600 per primary school student, $800 per junior secondary student and $1000 per senior secondary student. For students in non-remote areas the rates are $300 per primary school student, $400 per junior secondary student and $500 per senior secondary student. (2) To be eligible for Commonwealth general recurrent grants a new non-government school must be recognised by the Staterrerritory for lar level(s) of education and location(s) for which funding is being sought. The new non-government school must provide evidence that the body principally responsible for running the school is incorporated and is conducted on a non-profit basis. (3) The Commonwealth has abolished the unfair and arbitrary restrictions, including minimum enrolment requirements, which were in place under the previous Government's New Schools Policy. State and Territory governments are responsible for the regulatory framework within which non-government schools operate and may include whatever requirements they believe are appropriate for new schools. (4) The most recent data on expenditure on government schools to which the Commonwealth has access are from the National Schools Statistics Collection, published by the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETY A) for the 1995-96 financial year. MCEETY A figures, and therefore the figures below, do not include funds raised by schools, school councils or community organisations, or expenditure on items such as payroll tax, long service leave provisions, depreciation, interest on Commonwealth loans or teacher housing. An analysis of this information shows that the following amounts were provided through Commonwealth Specific Purpose Payments (SPPs): 10.4% of recurrent costs; and . 30.8% of capital expenditure; or . 11.5% of total costs for government schools. State and Territory governments provide the remaining 88.5% of the funding for government schooling. However, a component of the amount provided by State and Territory governments is indirectly funded from Commonwealth Financial Assistance Grants (FAGs). The Commonwealth Grants Commission estimates that around 24% of FAGs are expended on government school education. Expenditure on non-government schools is more difficult to estimate due to differences between reporting periods for the various funding sources. Payment information from State, Territory and Commonwealth sources is usually expressed in financial years, while reporting on private income for non-government schools is expressed on a calendar year basis. The figures provided are therefore indicative estimates based on State and Territory Budget Papers for the 1995-96 financial year, Commonwealth SPPs for the same year, and private income information from the 1995 calendar year. Based on this information, it is estimated that funding for non-government schools is provided the particu- in the following proportions: the Commonwealth provides 38% through SPPs; State and Territory governments provide 19%; and the remaining 43% of expenditure is funded through private income. As with government schools, a component of the expenditure by State and Territory governments is indirectly provided by the Commonwealth through FAGs. The Commonwealth Grants Commission estimates that States and Territories expend around 2% of total FAGs on non-government school education. (5) Specific Purpose Payments (SPPs) to nongovernment schools are funded through the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1996, and the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. Further Commonwealth-sourced funding is provided to nongovernment schools through Commonwealth Financial Assistance Grants (FAGs) paid to State and Territory governments. The Commonwealth Grants Commission estimates that the State and Territory govemments expend around 2% of FAGs on non-government school education. Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs: Funding (Question No. 1909) Mr MCDougall asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: (1) Did the Minister's Department or agencies within the Minister's responsibility provide funding grants to the Australian Local Government Association in 1995-96; if so, what. (2) How were funds referred to in part (1) expended. (3) Were funds referred to in part (I) fully expended for the purpose for which they were granted. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question. (I) Yes. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs provided one grant of $31,960 to the Australian Local Government Association in 1995-96 for the employment of an Aboriginal Policy Officer. This was under the T AP-Training for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders Program. (2) The funds were for the salary and associated administration expenses for this position. (3) Yes. Departmental records including the acquittal indicate that the funds were fully expended for the purpose for which they were granted. Vietnam Medical Records (Question No. 1926) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 24 June 1997: (I) Do provisions of the Archives Act restrict access to Vietnam medical records; if so, how. (2) Has he undertaken to facilitate greater access to information on dapstone as an antimalarial measure. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Archives Act 1983 provides that Commonwealth records should be made publicly available when they reach thirty years of age (often known as the open access period). Most Commonwealth records in the open access period are made publicly available. A small number are not released either partially or wholly because they require exemption for longer than thirty years in accordance with categories specified in the Archives Act. These categories provide for the exemption of material that might, for example, jeopardise national security, prejudice international relations or be an unreasonable disclosure of information relating to the personal affairs of an individual. As a result of public concern, the then Minister for Defence, the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair MP, announced in December 1982 that Commonwealth records identified as documenting the use of herbicides by Australia were to be made available immediately. The records to be made available were held by the Australian War Memorial and were aggregated into a series known as the Herbicide series, Vietnam (A WM 181). This series, which contains some records relevant to the Dapsone trials, has been available since the early 1980s. Records about Dapsone are held in series other than the Herbicide series, Vietnam. The earliest of these records (those from 1964 and 1966) documenting the Dapsone trials (1956-1973), most of which are held by the Australian War Memorial, are now in the' open period. Researchers may request that these be examined for access. The latest of the Dapsone trails records (dated to 1972) will move into the open period in 2002. There is also material associated with the Evatt Royal Commission. Mr Justice Evatt inquired into the Effects on Australian Personnel of the Chemical Agents used in Vietnam. The transcripts and reports of this Commission have been available since the release of the Evatt Royal Commission in 1985 which found it was possible that Dapsone could cause cancer. He recommended that the Federal Government should fund studies into the carcinogenicity of Dapsone.In response to this recommendation, the then Government funded research into the possibility that Dapsone could cause cancer. The major part of this research was completed in 1992, and was released by the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs early in that year. The study found no definite evidence that Dapsone resulted in cancer at any site. The Government at that time arranged for the report to be printed and distributed widely. The main report is now out of stock, but I have arranged for the Executive Summary of that Report to be placed on the Department of Veterans' Affairs Home Page on the Internet (http://www. dva.gov.au/). The full report is available from libraries, and I have sent a copy of the Executive Summary to the honourable member. Beyond this, there is the broad range of medical research that continues into drugs, such as Dapsone. My Department has advised that Dapsone is a drug that continues to be used in a variety of therapeutic roles, without further reports of carcinogenicity. US Community Re-Investment Act (Question No. 1928) Mr Andren asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 24 June 1997: (I) Is he aware of the detail of the 1977 US Community Re-investment Act (CRA). (2) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the US Department of the Treasury Report, Federal Register vol 60, No 86, dated 4 May 1995, stating that the CRA has come to play an increasingly important role in improving access to credit, both rural and urban, across the country. (3) Is he able to say whether regulated financial institutions under the CRA are required by law to demonstrate that their services meet the needs of the communities in which they are chartered. (4) Has the CRA relevance to the Australian banking system; if not, why not. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Treasury has provided me with some background information on the Act and its operation which is reflected in the following answers. (2) While the report does make the reference contained in the question, it is not reflective of the nature of the report as a whole. The report would appear to be primarily concerned with how the CRA could be improved. It also makes the point that the CRA examination system has been the subject of criticism. (3) Financial institutions regulated under the CRA are required to demonstrate that they meet community needs. (4) The Community Re-investment Act (CRA) was enacted in 1977. Financial institutions regulated under the Act are encouraged to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities, consistent with safe and sound operations. This Act would only appear to have relevance to Australia if there was considered to be community specific discrimination on the part of financial institutions. The Financial System Inquiry carefully examined the issues of choice, quality and cost of financial services available to consumers and others (such as small business enterprises). The inquiry did not discover substantive evidence of such discriminatory behaviour. ATSIC: Strelley and Nomads Organisations (Question No. 1929) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 24 June 1997: (I) Has public funding been provided to the (a) Strelley Housing Society incorporated and (b) Nomads Charitable and Educational Foundation Incorporated, if so, what. (2) Has the funding referred to in part (1) been accounted for. (3) What were the findings of the Australian Securities Commission investigation into the alleged siphoning of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) and Community Development Employment Program (CDEP) moneys into private companies. (4) Is it a fact that the (a) Strelley Community School was built with Federal Government grants at an alleged cost of $1.2 million and (b) the school has never been used. (5) Are the Strelley or Nomads group of organisations or companies to be investigated further. (6) Did Duesburys chartered accountants conduct an inspection of funds granted by ATSIC to Strelley and Nomads; if so, what has been the Government response. (7) Has ATSIC recovered repayments of surplus funds held by the Strelley and Nomads organisations as indicated in the answer to Senate question No 48 (Senate Hansard, 20 August 1996, page 2705); if not, what steps will the Government take to seek full details of grants to and expenditure by those organisations. (8) Have other irregularities detailed in the Duesburys report regarding CDEP grants in 199192 been fully investigated; if so, what were the findings; if not, why not.",184
253,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs with the following response to the honourable member's question: (1) As a result of the 1993 findings of the Strelley/Nomads Task Force this organisation nor any organisation associated with this group have neither received any grant funds from ATSIC since I July 1994, with the exception of funding for the provision of health services for the period I July 1994 to 30 September 1994. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETY A) has continued to provide funding to the Nomads Charitable and Educational Foundation for the operation of the independent school. (2) Funding provided for the provision of the health services was accounted for by the StrelIeylNomads group. The issue of accounting for DEETY A funding is a matter for the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. (3) ATSIC has received the following advice from the Australian Securities Commission (ASC): The ASC can only inspect books of a related third party which are required to be kept under the Corporations Law. The ASC, in conducting an inspection, has no express right of entry onto premises. If a related party denies entry to its premises, the ASC will be unable to use its inspection powers to enter these premises. The ASC has no power to release to ATSIC any information it may find from the inspection of books of a related party. (4) Funding for the Strelley Community School is provided by DEETY A and is a matter for the responsible Minister. (5) As a result of the advice provided by the ASC, ATSIC is not able to conduct or commission any further investigations into ATSIC grant funds that were used by Strelley/Nomads in the payment of services rendered by Strelley/Nomad related (ASC-Pty Ltd) entities. (6) Yes, Duesburys Chartered Accountants did conduct an inspection of the financial records of The Strelley Housing Society Inc and the Nomads Charitable and Educational Foundation Inc. When ATSIC received a copy of the Duesburys report it was referred to the ASC for their action. (7) ATSIC has recovered all surplus grant funds it was entitled to recover from Strelley/Nomads. (8) ATSIC has advised that it has been unable to conduct any further investigations into the irregularities raised by Duesburys in regard to CDEP payments due to the lack of available documentation. The office located at Warralong was destroyed by fire in 1995 and all records held in that office were destroyed. ATSIC further advises that the Duesburys report indicated that these records were not complete and on this basis the records would have been of no value in conducting further investigations. With the recovery of surplus funds and the advice received from the ASC, ATSIC will not be conducting any further investigations or taking any further action against the Strelleyl Nomads. Gambling Related Revenues (Question No. 1931)  notice, on 24 June 1997: (1) Is he able to say what gambling related revenues were collected by each State and Territory State and Territory Gambling Revenues. Taxes on government lotteries Taxes on private lotteries Poker machine taxes Casino taxes government in (a) 1993-94, (b) 1994-95, (c) 199596 and (d) the period 1 July to 31 December 1996. (2) What was the specific nature of gambling related revenue collected in those periods. (3) Is consideration given by the Federal Government to levels of individual State and Territory government gambling related revenues when determining the levels of federal financial assistance to be provided to each State and Territory government; if so, what. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Gambling revenues received by each State and Territory over this period are set out in the following tables which draw on data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2) The most significant sources of revenue over the period have been poker machines, lotteries, and race betting. Details for each State and Territory are shown in the following tables. (3) The pool of financial assistance grants which the Commonwealth provides to the States and Territories is distributed on the basis of per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The Commission is an independent statutory authority and is acknowledged by the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to be an impartial umpire in relation to the distribution of these funds. The Commission's methodology has been developed over many years in consultation with the States and Territories. It takes into account a number of factors which allow the Commission to establish the relative expenditure needs and revenue raising capacities of the States and Territories. This includes an assessment of their capacity to raise recurrent revenue from taxation, including the taxation of gambling activity. A State assessed by the Commission as having a per capita capacity to raise revenue that is lower than the average of all States and Territories receives a higher share of the pool of financial assistance grants.

254,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The response to questions asked by Mr Kelvin Thomson in question time on 25 August 1997 is as follows: Mr Kelvin Thomson, MP Member for Wills Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600 Received: 26 AUG 1997 Dear Mr Thomson I am writing in response to your questions without notice of 25 August 1997 on the subject of Mr Max Moore-Wilton's meeting with the IS MCMillan printing consortium. Mr Moore-Wilton met with representatives of IS MCMillan Pty Ltd, including Dr Hewson, at their request on 16 July. The Secretary meets with many people in the course of his normal duties. The meeting followed a decision by the Federal Court against JS MCMillan Pty Ltd and in favour of the Commonwealth, in which the judge found, nevertheless, that the Commonwealth had misled the consortium in failing to provide full information in the tender. The judge expressed a desire that the Commonwealth remedy the situation. I have attached the relevant portions of the Federal Court's judgement for your information. Mr Moore-Wilton subsequently wrote to the Secretary of DAS on I? July advising that in view of the importance the government places on clear and fair processes, and the judge's criticism, there would be merit in considering recommencing the tender process. I am attaching a copy of Mr Moore Wilton's letter for your information. In any event, immediately after the judgement was handed down, I am advised that the option of reopening tenders was already under consideration by DAS. There was no interference in the tender process and I regard Mr Moore Wilton's contribution as timely and proper. Catalogue No. 5506.0, published in December six months of 1996-97. The total figures shown are slightly from those obtained by summation of the table sale of licences to private operators in NSW and Vic. intangible items by the ABS rather than a tax. I have forwarded a copy of this letter to the Speaker for his information. Your sincerely (John Howard) ""IS MCMillan has remained non-compliant in that they confirmed their inability to accept the specij c terms and conditions of section 10.5 at page 29 of the RFT This matter is considered a fundamental term and condition that underpins the philosophy and strategy of the RFTi.e. to deliver services at the same terms and conditions including prices in accordance with the MOUs. While IS MCMillan has made the claim that it should not be assumed that their failure to agree to these terms will result in higher prices, the Committee did not ask for pricing structures that would return lower or higher prices. The Committee considers the IS MCMillan bid to be non-compliant and as such can not be considered further"" There are two comments which can be made in relation to that observation. The first, and most important, is that there is nowhere to be found in the Request for Tender a statement that the terms and conditions of section 10.5 are a fundamental term and condition that underpins the philosophy and strategy of the Request for Tender. The second is that the Committee's view that, because the bid is non-compliant, it ""can not be considered further"" does not appear to be reflected in the Request for Tender. For example, included in the Request for Tender is a section entitled ""Tender Evaluation Criteria"" which is, relevantly, in the following terms: ""1.1 In assessing tenders (including the best and final offers from the short-listed tenders), the Evaluation Committee will consider such other criteria it considers to be in the best interest of the Commonwealth. In assessing the tender the criteria that will be used will include the following: (I) prices tendered; (2) capability of tenderers to successfully operate the business described in each Package ... (3) any potential for creating a cont1ict of interest with other commercial activities of the tenderer; (4) the views of Client Departments; (5) the extent to which the tenderers meet the requirements of this Request For Tender; (6) developing and implementing innovative information solutions ... 1.2 The above criteria are not necessarily in order of priority or of equal weight."" [My emphasis] Thus, a tenderer may be excused for assuming that non-compliance with the Request for Tender in some respects would not necessarily be fatal to being short listed. Whether or not Mr MCMillan would have given an unequivocal assurance of acceptance of clauses 10.5 and 10.7 is a matter in issue and I shall deal with it below. However, in so far as the decision to short list was made on the basis that acceptance of the specific terms and conditions of section 10.5 was a fundamental term and condition that underpins the philosophy and strategy of the Request to Tender and on the basis that non acceptance of those specific terms and conditions rendered a tender non-compliant such that it could not be sidered further, the Request for Tender did not fairly reflect the manner in which tenderers would be dealt with. As I have said above, tenderers could be excused for assuming that it was not fundamental to acceptance of a tender that there be an unconditional acceptance of clauses 10.5 and 10.7. To that extent I consider that the conduct of the Commonwealth has been misleading. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the two other issues which are raised by the Commonwealth, namely whether Mr MCMillan would have acted differently if he had been told of those two matters and whether the Trade Practices Act applies to the conduct in question in any event. NA BY THE COMMONWEALTH'S CONDUCT? MCMillan in substance seeks relief under s 87 of the Trade Practices Act. Section 87 relevantly provides that where, in a proceeding instituted under Part VI, the Court finds that a person who is a Trade Practices Act applicable. That does not appear to me to have been the intention of s 2A. The Parliament was intending to limit the extent to which the Commonwealth would be bound by the Trade Practices Act. It could have chosen the same touchstone as is chosen for s 52, namely conduct engaged in in trade or commerce. It did not. Rather the Parliament chose to limit the application of Act to the Commonwealth, in so far as it carries on a business. I consider that that expression signifies that the Commonwealth is to be bound only where the conduct complained of is engaged in, in the course of carrying on the business. In other dealing with the Commonwealth in relation to the actual conduct of a business will have the same protection as when dealing with a private trader who is carrying on such a business but will not have protection when entering into other dealings with the Commonwealth. That appears to me to be consistent with the reason for the introduction of s 2A as explained by the Minister on the Second Reading of the Bill for the amendment which introduced s 2A (Australia, House of Representatives, Debates 3 May 1977, p 1447) as follows: ""Government Commercial Operations I announced last December that the Government had decided in principle that its commercial operations should be subject to the same restraints of the Trade Practices Act as apply to like operations of private enterprise. I then informed this House that the Government was studying the detailed implementation of this decision. This Bill gives effect to that decision in clause 4 which provides that the Act is to apply to all business undertakings of the Commonwealth Government and its authorities."" con- The conduct of the Commonwealth in issuing the Request for Tender and in dealing with prospective tenderers was not activity engaged in in carrying on the business which has hitherto been carried on by the Commonwealth, in the guise of the DAS, under the name AGPS. The conduct complained of is that of officers of the Commonwealth who have had nothing to do with the day to day operations of the AGPS. It is conduct quite divorced from the carrying on of that business. While some entities might be thought to engage in the business of selling capital assets, it was not contended by MCMillan that the Commonwealth is engaged in a business of selling assets. A once off decision to cease engaging in the activities of AGPS, to dispose of the plant and equipment relevant to those activities, to undertake not to engage in those activities in the future and, in the capacity of client, to invite private enterprise to take on those activities, is not conduct in the carrying on of a business: nor is the conduct of offering plant and equipment for sale and offering the opportunity to perform Package 3 activities for Government departments the carrying on of a business. I conclude, therefore, that s 2A does not have the effect of making the TradePraCtices Act applicable to the conduct about which complaint is made by MCMillan in these proceedings. In the light of the factual findings which I have the made, that is unfortunate. However, it is for the Parliament to determine the extent to which the Trade Practices Act binds the Commonwealth. One might harbour a wish that in the circumstances, the Commonwealth would remedy the effect of the conduct which I have found misleading. However, words, persons it is not bound to do so. Argument was also addressed to me on the possible application of s 2C of the Trade Practices Act. Section 2C has the effect that certain activity does not, for the purposes of s 2A, amount to carrying on a business. Having regard to the conclusion which I have reached in relation to s 2A, it is not necessary for me to deal with the submissions in relation to s 2C. NA In the light of the conclusion which I have reached concerning the effect of s 2A, the application must be dismissed. Because of the possibility that the parties may wish to take the matter further, I have made findings on the substantive factual issues before me. However, the Commonwealth has not been totally successful in relation to those factual issues and I would therefore not be disposed to make an order for costs before hearing the parties on that question. I therefore propose to stand the proceedings over for further argument on the question of costs and for the parties to bring in short minutes. I certify that this and the preceding twenty-two (22) pages are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Emmett Associate: Dated: 15 July 1997 Counsel for the Applicant: R1. Ellicott QC M. Walton Solicitor for the Applicant: P.A. Somerset & Co. Counsel for the Respondent: 1.S.

As your officers would be aware on Wednesday, 16 July I met with Mr Robert MCMillan, Dr John Hewson and Mr Russell Parkes on this matter. My understanding of the situation is that while Justice Emmett dismissed the MCMillan case under Section 2A of the Trade Practices Act, he stated that the Commonwealth had misled the tenderer in failing to provide full information in the tender document and in the letter of 5 May to Mr MCMillan seeking clarification. In particular, I note Justice Emmett's comments that a tenderer may be excused from assuming that non-compliance with the Request for Tender in some respects would not necessarily be fatal to being short-listed and his concluding comments that ""One might harbour a wish that in the circumstances, the Commonwealth would remedy the effect of the conduct which I have found misleading"". I am sure you appreciate the importance the Government attaches, not the least because of the very large sales in prospect over the next year or so, to ensuring clear and fair processes in relation to asset sales and related transactions. In light of this judicial criticism and subject to constraints associated with any appeal of Justice Emmett's decision, I consider that there would be merit in urgent consideration being given to re-commencing the tendering process for this particular initiative. While I accept that this may result in delay and that your Department has assiduously handled previous disposals of business activities, the criticisms made in the Federal Court decision suggest that a fresh start and an obviously arms-length management of the process would reduce the likelihood of this matter embarrassing, the Government I understand that re-tendering is one of the options that your officers have under consideration. In relation to the policy question of the coverage of the Trade Practice Act presume that your Department is consulting with the Treasury. Given the time-frame involved I would appreciate your advice on progress in regard to this matter. Yours sincerely MW Moore-Wilton",192
