31,Mr RILEY,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,"Has the Postmaster General yet been able to ascertain what steps have been taken to prevent the recurrence of a hold-up such as, unfortunately, took place recently street Post Office, Sydney, on a pensions pay day ? What steps does he propose to take to protect Commonwealth public servants against the danger of loss of life or serious injury in the discharge of their duty?",12
32,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,"I am sure that the sympathy of every honourable member goes out to those public servants who were so efficiently discharging their duty when they were attacked on the occasion referred to. I have not yot had time to go fully into the matter, but although I feel sure that adequate steps are being taken to prevent the recurrence of such an unfortunate affair, I shall personally ascertain what has been done, and if any further steps can be taken to protect efficient and patriotic officers in the performance of their duties, the Government will see that they are adopted. CANCELLATIO N OF PENSIONS. gentleman",12
33,Mr WHITE,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,"Is the Minister in charge of repatriation aware that the pensions of certain widowed mothers ceased soldiers are being cancelled in cases where they possess assets of any kind, other than their own homes, to the value of £200, irrespective of their outgoings? Apparently the terms of the Premiers plan were not properly understood, if this interpretation of the department correct one.",12
34,Mr SCUXIJN,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,It was never so intended.,12
35,Mr WHITE,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,"Tlia t was how I underrevising stood the matter at the time. Will phone subscribers? the Minister endeavour to have the exemption raised from £200 to £500, in view of the great hardship that is inflicted ?",12
36,Mr MARR,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,"The reductions have taken place have been in accordance with the Financial Emergency Act passed by the last Parliament. Widows' pensions are not being interfered with, that of the mother of a soldier who became a widow within three years of the expiration of the war. Those who became widowed later are in a different category, but they are receiving the same treatment as invalid and old-age pensioners.",12

39,Mr FORDE,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,"The Minister for Trade and Customs has been good enough to circulate a printed statement showing the alterations of duties under the customs tariff proposals of the 13th October, 1932, compared with the previous tariff proposals of the present Government. Will he also have prepared for the convenience of honourable members a statement showing the increases or decreases in the consolidated schedule brought down yesterday compared with the tariff proposals of the Scullin Government?",12
40,Mr GULLETT,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,The honourable will find that the information he asks for is contained in the memorandum that was circulated yesterday.,12

45,Mr HUTCHINSON,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,"The price of galvanized iron has been increased in conCustoms [14 OCTOJS EH, 1932.] sequence of the re-imposition of primage duty on this item. Will the Minister for Trade and Customs state whether it is the practice of the Tariff Board to take into consideration primage and exchange when arriving at a determination as to the rate of duty that ought to be imposed in any particular case?",12
46,Mr GULLETT,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,"In recommending a protective duty it is not the usual practice of the Tariff Board to take into consideration primage and exchange, but it has done so in isolated cases. During this week I instructed the board that in future it should not do so.",13
47,Mr GABB,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,Will the Minister state why the protective incidence of primage and exchange should not be taken into consideration by the Tariff Board?,13
48,Mr GULLETT,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,"The reason is fairly obvious. Exchange is controlled by the Commonwealth Bank, and customs duties and excise are collected by the Department of Trade and Customs in accordance with the legislation of this Parliament. If allowance for exchange were made by the Tariff Board, and a substantial reduction in the rate occurred during a parliamentary recess, the whole of our protective system would be dislocated. The Government regards both primage and exchange as temporary conditions which should not be associated with the investigations and deliberations of the Tariff Board. Full consideration has been given to the practicability of adjusting on some basis the tariff level according to the prevailing exchange; but it is not considered to be practicable.",13
49,Mr SCULLIN,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,"I understand, from the speech delivered by the honourable gentleman yesterday, that it' is the declared policy of the Government that action shall be taken by it either to raise or to lower customs duties except upon a recommendation by the Tariff Board, which was set up as an independent and impartial tribunal. What reason does honourable gentleman advance today for having instructed the Tariff Board not do certain things?",13
50,Mr GULLETT,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,Primag e and extions change are matters quite unconnected with the protective policy of this Governpletely ment. Administration. 1277,13
51,Mr HUTCHINSON,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,Will the reimposition of the duty on galvanized iron have any effect in the direction of reducing the price of that commodity?,13
52,Mr GULLETT,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,"Actually , there Las been no re-imposition of the duty; there has been a restoration of primage. That has not made, and will not make, any difference to the selling price of galvanized iron, which has been fixed by arrangement at, I believe, £24 10s. a ton ex store.  deny the practicability of taking into consideration the protective incidence of exchange and primage by amending th<j Customs Act in such a way that a percentage of the exchange will automatically be taken off the amount of duty imposed upon imported goods ?",13
53,Mr GULLETT,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,"As I have already said, this matter has been given the most exhaustive consideration, and the idea has been abandoned on the ground of its impracticability in administration. I think the honourable gentleman overlooks the very important fact with respect to the protective incidence of the exchange that such protection is afforded to an Australian industry only when the raw materials that it requires are not sold within Australia at world's parity. In the case of wool, for example, exchange is included in the price. That is one of the fundamental difficulties that confronts us in the consideration of this matter.",13
54,Mr SCULLIN,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,Do the instructions that have been given by the Minister to this independent and impartial tribunal which in future is to direct the fiscal policy of Australia mean that in connection with any item on which the Government has reduced primage duty the no Tariff Board must not take that reduction into consideration when considering whether a duty ought to be reduced?,13
55,Mr GULLETT,PROTECTION OE PUBLIC,"No , it does not, as the our action with respect to the primage duty on galvanized iron clearly shows. XJ No instruction has been given to the Tariff Board concerning its investigations, or recommendations regarding quesbearing on the protective policy of this Government. The board is as comindependent today as it ever has been. NA",13
56,Dr MALONEY,ASSESSED WEALTH OF,"In view of the fact - that in the splendid compendium of Australian statistics just issued by Professor L. F. Giblin, the private wealth of Australia is stated to have been, in 1927, approximately £3,063,769,0001. Will the Prima Minister have valued, approximately, the Government wealth in all States, and where difficulties arise as to present value of railways, &c, give the cost of such government railways, works, &c. ? 2. Will the right honourable gentleman also ascertain the approximate value of the unsold land of Australia, and, where known, or so far as possible, the approximate extent and value of the coal-fields, gold and other mines in the unsold land of Australia?",14

Upon which Mr SCUXUN had moved, by way of amendment That the amount be reduced by £1.",14
59,Mr MARR,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"Parkes-Minister for Health) [11.7] - The discussion on budget has centred on the subjects of finance, unemployment and tariff vision. The present position of the monwealth indicates that the Governcountry. ment has been successful in its financial operations. During the comparatively short period during which it has office, it has done much to rehabilitate finances of Australia. In September, 1931, last, when a Labour government was in office, Australian 5 per cent, stock in London was quoted at orable £55 15 s., and the present price of of the same stock is now above par. This shows that the present Government has not only restored confidence, but has almost completely rehabilitated the political finances of the country. Statements that have been made in this connection tain honourable members opposite are not in accordance with fact. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward), Labour party. for instance, said that the Resident Minister in London had simply gone there for the purpose of re-establishing himself in the eyes of the people as a Minister of the Crown. It seems to me that the honourable member took advantage of his position in Parliament in so criticizing the right honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) in his absence. The right honourable member represents Australia in London most ably. He served his country ment. with distinction during the war, and ir, still serving it well. The fact that New South Wales conversion loan was eminently successful is indicative of the people. ability displayed by the right honourable gentleman, and of the character of the work which he is doing for Australia. The honourable member for East a Sydney also stated that the adoption of the Premiers plan would bring ruin upon of wood and drawers of water. this country, but I draw his attention to the fact that the price of our stocks has risen so high that the country, far from being ruined, is being rapidly rehabilitated. The honourable member also asked why the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin), when he was Prime Minister, did not take command of the banks,, and use their resources for the benefit of the people. The right honourable gentleman did not take command of the banks because he saw the mess that Mr Lang had made of the Government Savings the Bank of New South Wales. Chaos would - result if any Prime Minister or State rePremier seriously interfered with the Comcurrency or the banking practices of the The financial smash in New South Wales was brought about by the meddling action of the Lang Governbeen in ment. The Premiers plan has been the adopted by every party in this country.",15
60,Mr ROSEVEAR,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,No !,15
61,Mr MAER,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"I do not regard the honmember for Dalley as belonging to an Australian party; be is a member a New South Wales section of a party. Every party represented at the Premiers Conference accepted the Premiers plan, and the conference reflected all shades of opinion. The plan was again ratified at the Premiers Conference that by cerwas held recently in Canberra.",15

The tariff, of course, will be discussed, at a later stage, and I intend to refer to it only in so far as it relates to the financial proposals of the Govern The honourable member for he Forrest said that until duties were rethe duced, we could not hope to provide an adequate measure of employment for the He remarked that ships were lying idle, and that coal-lumpers and wharf labourers were without work. But this Government does not stand for employment on the wharfs only. It has bigger policy than that of merely finding work to enable boys to become hewers The Government does not intend to assist in providing work for labourers only. The primary industries must be supported and protected. The honourable  think, admit that this Government has shown a very keen appreciation of the work of the primary industries, and has done everything in its power to help them.",15
64,Mr GANDER,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,Ye t no member of the Country party was included in the Ministry.,16
65,Mr MARR,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,We sbould have been glad of their co-operation in solving ual ion's problems.,16
66,Mr GANDER,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,What' s wrong with men you have?,16
67,Mr MARR,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"Nothing . We have plenty of talent on this side, but, unfortuable nately, we cannot take our whole party into the Cabinet. The honourable member for Forrest endeavoured to be fair, put the case as he saw it from the point view of the primary producers. He said that the wealth of the country depended upon primary industry. I believe that that is largely true, but we cannot solve the unemployment problem by depending entirely upon our primary industries. Those industries will not proarrived vide employment for the growing army young men who are now unable to obtain work; we cannot put everybody on the land. We must evolve a policy of machinery, developing our secondary industries side by side with our primary industries, this for two reasons. In the first place, we must obtain a bigger population in last order to provide a better home market the products of our primary industries, for, after all, the home market is the best market. Another reason for developwith ing our secondary industries is to the present acute problem of unemployendeavour ment.",16
68,Mr GABB,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,It will never be solved.,16
69,Mr MARR,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"I am not so pessimistic most unwise. as the honourable member for Angas (Mr. Gabb). This is a matter which transcends party politics. All sections of community should unite in an endeavour interests ? to find a solution of the problem of unemployment so that work may be found for the boys and young men now walking the streets. The honourable member for Forrest that the primary industries were overgovernmental burdened. They are carrying a considerable portion of the country's burdens, I admit, but some honourable members are inclined to over-estimate their share. I remember when the right honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) was Prime Minister, a deputation representing primary industries waited upon him to protest against high tariffs. The Bruce Page Government lasted for nearly seven years, and the Country party, which was associated with it, was just as keen to protect Australian industries as were the members of the Nationalist party.",16
70,Mr RIORDAN,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,Was the right - honour the able member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) just as keen as the rest?,16
71,Mr MARR,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"Yes , the rigiht honormember for Cowper has always held the opinion that certain secondary industries in Australia should be adequately and protected. The right honourable memof ber for Flinders was able to inform the deputation that the extra cost imposed upon wheat-growers, for instance, by the tariff, was less than - Jd. a bushel.",16
72,Mr THORBY,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,I challenge that.,16
73,Mr MARR,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"That was the figure at as a result of calculations made of at that time. Of course, costs may have increased since then. Various articles, such as harvesters, ploughs, and other were considered, and the extra cost due to the tariff was spread over the and value of the goods produced. I am sure that the primary producers would be the to say that only their interests should for be considered. The city depends for its support on the country, and the country, in its turn, looks to the city to provide it essential services. The two interests solve should work hand in band. Those who to set them against each other serve no useful purpose. The building up of separate parties to represent the two sections of the community is, I think,",16
74,Mr ROSEVEAR,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,How many members of the the present Cabinet represent - country,16
75,Mr MARR,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"All of them. We must look to private industry to solve the unemployment problem. Some honourable members propose that we should raise said loan money for expenditure upon local works; but that would be a mere palliative. It would provide only temporary relief, and when the money had been spent, the problem would lie still unsolved, and we should be so much deeper in debt. ordinary times 82 per cent, of the population is employed in private enterprise and 18 per cent, on government or quasi-government work. If we could reduce that 18 per cent, to 8 per cent, we should be better off. Under the regime of the present Government everything is being done to stimulate private enterprise. In my own electorate, for instance, one woollen factory has recently put on 200 extra employees. That is a good deal better than what happened during theterm of office of the previous Government, when employees were being discharged. We are all familiar with the claims made by the then Minister for Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde), when he used to say that, as a result of increasing certain duties, employment would be found for 50,000 persons. We know that, as a matter of* fact, no such employment was provided. Mr Theodore claimed that his party, if returned to power, would provide work for all, but what his policv really meant was the workhouse for all. ""Now that the country is once more on the road to solvency, private interests being encouraged to invest money. ""Persons with capital are not compelled to invest it. Labour supporters believe that - no man should be compelled to give his labour if he does not wish to. If he is - not satisfied with the price offered he should be, they say, entitled to withhold his labour. We say that the man with capital has a similar right, but we join issue with them in their claim that, if the labourer withholds his labour, no one else should be permitted to do the work offering. We maintain that each man should be master of his own actions, and that his labour belongs to himself, not to the trades hall or to his union. [Quorum formed]. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), speaking last night, said that this Government has no policy. That charge could certainly not be sustained against the last Government, because it had a policy for every day of the week. Each Minister who got up to speak voiced a different policy. When the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) was in London in the capacity of Prime Minister, endeavouring to re-adjust the financial position of the In country on a more favourable basis, he met with no criticism from honourable members on this side, who were then in opposition. We realized that the right honourable gentleman was doing his best for Australia. Unfortunately, his Cabinet colleagues had a different standard of ethics and, by their squabbling and disloyalty, embarrassed their leader, and tended to bring discredit upon the country. ""Now, when a responsible Minister of the Government is in London, conducting delicate negotiations on behalf of the nation, an occasion calling for cooperation, he is subjected to ungenerous and unfair criticism by honourable members opposite, and particularly by those in the corner group. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) propounds the theory that we should raise price levels, and in that he is supported by other honourable members opposite. I have yet to hear a satisfactory explanation of how that can be done. The real policy of the Labour party is to be found inscribed on every garage in the country- "" Eree air "". Their deity is inflation, to which the section in the corner are adds repudiation. That group has talked ad nauseam about "" the creation of credit"" and, surprisingly, the Leader of the Opposition has supported them. He says that he has no time for the man who tears off his bond coupon and collects his interest, but in the next breath says that we must raise further loans for government works. How does he expect to persuade the people to subscribe to loans when he tells them that, if he had the opportunity, he would deprive them of the interest thereon? The right honourable gentleman is particularly unfair to the Bruce-Page Government, which, he declared, borrowed more than £40,000,000 per annum overseas. The right honourable gentleman, and members of the group in the corner, biow perfectly well that that money was raised by the Loan Council, not by the Government, mainly on behalf of the States. The problem' of unemployment is all important, and the Government is doing its utmost to solve it. Yet, time after time, honourable members opposite endeavour to nullify the efforts of the Government. The latest attempt to censure the Government is a motion by the Leader of the Opposition to reduce the first item of the Estimates. I congratulate the right honourable gentleman on ibeating the honourable member for West - Sydney (Mr Beasley) to it on this - occasion. He must remember that for - an appreciable period he was the head of -« government, and had an opportunity to put into practice what he now preaches. Actually, instead of relieving unemployment, the Scullin Government left the position worse than when it assumed office. I do not altogether blame it for that. It is a difficult task for any administration. But the right honourable gentleman should be fair to his successor in office and assist the Government rather than work against it. I am glad to note that there has been a lack of criticism of the budget, indicating that honourable members on all sides believe it to contain statesmanlike proposals and, therefore, support it.",16
76,Mr JAMES,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"Hunter) [11.88] - It would interest nie to know how the Minister for Health and Repatriation (Mr. Marr) reconciles his views in connection with the building up of secondary industries through the medium of high tariff protection, with his support of a government which proposes handing over the fiscal policy of the country to the Tariff Board for five years, in conformity with the Ottawa agreement. Is the honourable member sincere, or is he merely indulging in propaganda to placate the manufacturers ? I have closely followed this debate, also the published opinions of the right honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Bruce), the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), and the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) supporting the raising of commodity price levels. That course, they claim, would solve the problem of unemployment. I am curious to know how. In the absence of a satisfactory explanation, my colleagues and I refuse to be lulled into a feeling of falseis security by the specious promises made by the Government. We recall that, in June of last year, the Scullin-Theodore Government declared that if awards were reduced and reductions made in invalid and old-age pensions, maternity allowance, and Public Service salaries, 100,000 persons would promptly be placed in employment. Events have proved that the result of that policy has been that the-purchasing power of the people has been lowered, with a consequent reduction in business turnover, so that we are now deeper than ever in the mire. Business men have been compelled to decrease overhead charges, and the method adopted has been that of discharging employees. 1 believe it was the Scullin-Theodore Administration that first coined the phrase,- ""Prosperity is just around the corner"", which has been so freely used by the present Prime Minister. [Quorum formed.'] Honourable members opposite talk a lot about prosperity being round the corner, but they never mention that the queues of unemployed men and women now extend beyond the second corner. These people are in great need of food, relief, and other assistance. Prosperity, as a matter of fact, is very far off. It is stupid for the Government of this or any other country to think that the mere lifting of commodity price levels or the readjustment of the monetary system will cure unemployment. That may relieve the position for a time; but it should be recognized that that problem goes deeper. ""Not even the cancellation of war debts will meet the needs of the situation. Our greatest difficulties are due to the mechanization of industry. The use « of machines in our industrial, agricultural, and general developmental projects has had the result of displacing human power to an enormous extent, and the economic structure of the world must and be recast to meet the new situation that has thus been created. At present about 40 per cent, of the workers of the world are either totally unemployed or intermittently employed, and this is largely due to the increase in the use of machinery. To-day there is discontent, among three sections of the people. The unemployed are discontented because they cannot get the necessaries of life and have to exist on a miserable dole which not sufficient to feed them, let alone provide them with clothing. Surely no one imagines that these suffering people can be kept in subjection through another winter. There is discontent also among the people who are in employment because of the heavy burden of taxation they have to carry. These people have to pay unemployment and other taxes to provide some food for their fellow beings who are out of employment. There is discontent likewise among the owners of our industrial undertakings because the taxation to which they are being subjected is, in their opinion, unreasonably heavy. ""We have been told often enough that taxation is reaching saturation point. It is ridiculous that one-half of the community is being kept in work in order that the other half may be maintained, however inadequately, In idleness. This is a stupid policy. We must face the great problem created by the displacement of human power, and endeavour to overcome it by the reduction of working hours, or some other means. The mere imposition of taxation for relief purposes will get us nowhere. Honourable members opposite may be satisfied with the policy that the Government is pursuing, but we, on this side, can see that before very long there will be a revolt.",18
77,Mr LANE,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,That is what the honourable member wants.,19
78,Mr JAMES,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"That statement is entirely incorrect. I have always resisted every form of warfare, and particularly civil war or revolution. The last thing I desire to see is rioting and bloodshed.",19
79,Mr LANE,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,The honourable member's party.stands for revolution.,19
80,Mr JAMES,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"That statement is also entirely incorrect. We recognize that something more must be done than is being done at present to cope with the problem of unemployment, otherwise the thrifty section of the community will continually be penalized and others will be forced into bankruptcy, and our position will become much worse than it is today. Australia has always endeavoured to maintain a decent standard of living for her people and I believe that she still desires to do so. Many persons in the community are offering suggestions for overcoming our present difficulties. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse), for instance, thinks that our tariff policy should be scrapped and a free trade policy adopted. That would mean that the people of Australia would become hewers of wood and drawers of water-mer e wood and water joeys- for overseas manufacturers. Our aim should be to make Australia a self-contained and - a self-reliant country; but this goal will never be reached by the cutting down of wages and the reduction of the benefits provided for people under our social welfare legislation. I . cannot see how the Government carr possibly justify the reduction of pension* x in view of the fact that the financial returns for the three months ended the 30th. September last indicate that revenue has! exceeded expenditure by £2,619,000. As' soon as the Government saw that the figures were tending that way it should have withdrawn its proposal for the reduction of invalid and old-age pensions and the maternity allowance. The saving of £1,100,000 in pensions and £60,000 in maternity allowance during this year is entirely unwarranted in view of the Treasury returns to which I have just referred. These figures indicate that our customs revenue for the period mentioned exceeded that of the corresponding period of last year by £982,000, our excise revenue by £479,000, our sales taxation revenue by £647,000, our income taxation revenue by £138,000, and our land taxation revenue by £42,000. These facts would entirely justify, the immediate withdrawal of the sections of the Financial Emergency Act relating to the reductions of pensions. In the first quarter of this year, our payments in interest and sinking fund, principally on overseas commitments, increased by £190,000 over those of the corresponding period of last year. It appears, therefore, that the Government intends to insist that first consideration shall be given to those who draw their income from interest. Our old-age and invalid pensioners, the most defenceless section of the community, are given no consideration whatever. It is regrettable that provision should be made in the budget for an increase in our defence expenditure this year of £29,000. Do honourable members realise also that our payments in war pensions are to be reduced by £431,000, and that this is due principally to the policy of the Government of restricting to the greatest possible extent the payments to those suffering from the ravages of war who are entitled to pensions ? Mr E. F. HARRISON - That is not so.",19
81,Mr JAMES,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"It is true. I have ment received voluminous correspondence from returned soldiers who have been endeachamber vouring to establish claims for pensions. In one instance a returned soldier crippled arm, who was in receipt of a 10 per cent, pension, became insane, and today he is confined in a mental institumember tion in Sydney. The department that this man's insanity is not due to war service, despite the fact that many of his former officers and comrades at the have declared that prior to the war man had all his mental faculties and when he returned he showed definite of being mentally affected. . To-day that man, his wife and children arc receiving no pension, because the 10 per cent, sion is being paid, not to the man himand self, but to the Master in Lunacy. Many returned soldiers, when they first returned, had a cough of which they took no notice, but which subsequently developed into tuberculosis, and it is exceedingly diffiAustralia ? cult for them to establish the fact that their dread disease had been contracted because of war service. Eor the first quarter of this financial year the expenditure on the maternity allowance has been decreased by £10,000, and recent legislation provides for a ther cut of £60,000. The Government mental works? cannot justify its action in taking this allowance from the mother at the most gation critical period of her life, at a time when she requires proper medical attention. If her husband's income exceeds £208 per annum, she is not entitled to the allowwhich ance, and if the income is under that coastal amount, the allowance is £4 instead of £5 as before. The Scullin Government reduced it to £4. There are many open spaces throughout Australia in which developmental and reproductive work could be carried out, but this Government has not inland areas? the courage to undertake it. This country is governed, not by Parliament, but by the banking institutions, because they control the credit resources of the nation. Many economists are toable for settlement. day _ of the opinion that banki tg operations and the expansion traction of credit should be controlled,, not by a few bankers to the detriment of the community-generally, but by the representatives of the people in this Parliain the interests' of the people themselves. I have previously referred in this to various developmental works which could be undertaken by the Comwith a monwealth and State Governments, in order to afford relief to the unemployed.",20
82,Mr THORBY,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,Does the honourable advocate the expenditure of loan claims money on developmental works?,20
83,Mr JAMES,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"The credit resources of war this country were utilized through the this Commonwealth Bank and the Note Issue that Board, to finance the war. Of course, signs any proposal by honourable members on this side of the chamber to utilize the credit resources of the country is conpendemned by the members of the Nationalist the Country parties as a form of inflation. Why should we not put in hand works of a reproductive nature, so as to give work to some of the unfortunate 400,000 unemployed people throughout",20
84,Mr LANE,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,Why did not Mr Lang take some steps in that direction?,20
85,Mr JAMES,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"When Mr Lang was Premier of New South Wales, the Loan Council had sole control of credit.",20
86,Mr THOBBY,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,Will the honourable memfurber indicate what he regards as develop,20
87,Mr JAMES,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"I am referring to irriworks, and the construction of - reservoirs and sewerage systems in country districts. We have vast inland areas have little or no rainfall. Our districts have abundant rainfalls, and if reservoirs were constructed there, water could be reticulated to the inland districts to make them suitable for settlement.",20
88,Mr THORBY,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,Does the honourable member suggest that we could conserve water on the coast in order to irrigate,20
89,Mr JAMES,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"We could irrigate some of our inland areas which have an inadequate rainfall, and so make them suit",20
90,Mr THOBBY,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,What would be proand conduced from the irrigated areas?,20
91,Mr JAMES,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"We could produce sufficient for the requirements of the unemployed. They would be far better living on the laud independent of charity than continuing to receive the dole. The supporters of the Government are continually stating that we should encourage men-to go back on the land, and wo have now an excellent opportunity to settle our unemployed on the land, giving them the laud free, and paying them the dole until such time as they can produce sufficient for their own requirements. Such a proposal, if given effect, would be far more economic than the payment of approximately £11,000,000 per annum in food relief for which there is no return. Of course, it will be said that Ave cannot put developmental works in hand because the banks will not provide the necessary finance'. In 1931, when, the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) was Prime Minister, he told us that if we would be good boys, and put into operation the Premiers plan, which provided for a reduction in the expenditure on our social services and in the wages of public servants, the banks would come to our assistance, and 100,000 men would be immediately placed in employment. Since then, unemployment has actually increased. Surely we must realise that the manipulation of the finances of this country must no longer remain in the hands of the private banking institutions, which exploit to their own advantage the credits of the people. A reduction in wages is no solution of the unemployment problem, and we should not hesitate to adopt the policy of the Labour party, which is the national control of Australia's credit. The Labour party established the Commonwealth Bank, and before tlireo years had elapsed, that institution was financing this country's war operations. The war brought much distress to the community, and placed the lives of many of our citizens in jeopardy. Many parents lost their sons at the war, which they thought was a war to end war, a war to make this country fit for heroes to live in ; yet many of our returned soldiers are now sleeping in the parks, hungry, and in dire distress. The promises made to them at the time of their enlistment were repudiated recently by the Scullin Government, and by the members of the Nationalist and Country parties who were then in ' opposition, because had it not been for their support of the policy of that Government, it would not have been able to bring about a reduction in the expenditure on the social services of this country. At that time, the Scullin Government could not depend on the support of eighteeu members of the Labour party in this chamber. We have also to face the world-wide problem of having to re-adjust our economic structure to meet the progress that has been made in industrial and agricultural science.' Improved methods of production are being introduced year by year. No matter where we look, we find that men are being displaced by machines. Take, for example, the coal-mining industry, in which I have been engaged all my life. The mechanization of that industry by means of coal-cutting machines now makes it possible for two men working a machine to fill from 24 to 28 tons of coal a day, whereas prior to the introduction of coal-cutting machines 3 0 tons of coal a day was regarded as a good output for two men. The increasing use of electrical power in place of steam power has also affected the coal-mining industry. Steamdriven locomotives, using coal for fuel, require both a driver and a fireman, whereas an electric train requires only a motorman. In other directions, also, electricity has superseded steam power and displaced large numbers of men. All these things have tended to reduce the number of men employed in the coal mining industry. Motor transport has practically driven out of business blacksmiths, wheelwrights, saddlers, and coachbuilders, while even the farming industry has been affected, because no longer is it necessary for large supplies of fodder to be provided for horses to draw the vehicles engaged in the transport of goods. Many industries in this country have suffered as a result of the introduction of this new form of transport which takes so much money out of the country. On the farms themselves rural labourers have had to give way to agricultural machinery. The greater use - of machines during recent years has done - much to create unemployment through^out the world. The mechanization of inrdustry is a problem which must be faced, and already various solutions of it have been offered. There are some who claim that the position can be met by reducing wages; but they forget that that would mean that there would be less money in .circulation, less buying and selling, and consequently less employment, because men in .business would seek to adjust matters by dismissing some - of their employees. In order to meet these changed conditions, an adjustment of our economic structure is necessary. In this connection difficulty at once arises, because so many people wish .the world to remain in .the same groove in which it found itself a century ago. Others claim that a solution of the problem will be found by increasing the hours of labour. Let us see how this theory would work out in practice. An industry may employ twelve men who, under the existing award of .the Arbitration Court, work 44 hours a week. Should it happen, as appears likely under the Premiers plan, that the working week is increased to 48 hours, each of those twelve men would be required to work an additional four hours a week, a total of 48 hours for the week, or : the equivalent of a full working week for one man. If the market for the products of that industry took only_ the output of twelve men working 44 hours a week, the employer would meet the .altered conditions by dispensing with the services of one man. That would be the result throughout New South Wales of an increase in the working week from 44 to 48 hours. It is an economic truism that a solution of this - problem will not be found by increasing the hours, of labour, and I am, therefore, sorry that so many in our midst should advocate a longer working week.",21
92,Mr THORBY,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,Would the honourable member apply his theory to rural industries ?,22
93,Mr JAMES,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"I would apply it to all industries, for, in my opinion, 44. hours is too long for any man to work each week under existing conditions. I go further, and say that I believe that before long the various .countries of the world will be forced to recognize that the establishment of a working week of 30 hours will prove a sounder economic proposition than payment of the dole to large numbers of workers who, under existing conditions, cannot obtain work. Every mechanical .development adds to the army of the unemployed.",22
94,The CHAIRMAN,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"The honourable - member has exhausted his time. Mr E. F. HARRISON (Bendigo) '[12.24] - I take the opportunity to speak at this stage, because I am afraid that the Standing Orders will not permit me to say what I want to say about the defence of this country when we are dealing with separate items of the Estimates. Recently, the Attorney General (Mr Latham) recounted his experiences at the Disarmament Conference. His report must have been a disillusionment to many of us who had hoped that something practical would result from that conference. The views of the Attorney General seem to be supported by the almost daily reports in the press, of rumours of wars, of sabre rattling in Europe, and of threats of disturbances in the Far East, which seem to be coming to a head. Although we in this Parliament are responsible under the Constitution for the security of the Commonwealth, this responsibility seems at times to be forgotten in the financial maze in which we find ourselves. I have no hesitation in declaring from my place in Parliament that at the present moment the condition of Australia is one of absolute insecurity. The world conditions, which we all hoped would be settled by the Great War, have not been settled. Indeed, the war turned the thoughts of, many men to the invention of new instruments of warfare, which they claim to be improvements, but which I call devilish because of their greater mobility, range, and killing power. These inventions mean that future wars will be waged not only between armies actually in the field. Because of the long range of these modern weapons, defenceless women and children, 20 or 30 miles behind the front lines, will become as much participants in a nation's war as those who are carrying rifles in the front line trenches. Nowa duys wars are too large for most nations to be able to remain neutral. In the past we in Australia thought that, because of our geographical position, we were immune from the effects of a world war; but the experience of the years 1914 to 1918 showed us that we were wrong. For one reason or another, other countries than those primarily affected were drawn into conflict, and wo, as a part of the British Empire, cannot hope to be freed from participation in the Empire's quarrels. V've might claim to be neutral, but whether the enemies of the Empire would recognize our claim is another matter. We could not afford to sit with our arms folded, basking in the sunlight, while an enemy took advantage of the position. One thing which brings home to us the fact that Australia is not an isolated nation is the knowledge that we must export a large proportion of our products to other countries, since the whole of our wheat, wool, and other products caunot be consumed in Australia. I am reminded that in 1915 and 1916 it was necessary to re-organize the transport arrangements of the British Empire, and its allies, in order that Australian wheat, wool and metals could be sent abroad, and other goods necessary for our use imported into Australia. Unfortunately, war seems to have no real terrors for many of those who did not go on active service. Luckily for Australia, no enemy shot has ever been fired in this country; but I remind those who say that war is not at all likely to come to Australia that, during the last war, an aeroplane from an enemy cruiser is alleged to have flown over Sydney, and that near Gabo Island and off the North Cape of New Zealand mine-fields were laid. The mine-field off Gabo Island was responsible for the sinking of the Cumberland, a large vessel which was carrying our exports to other countries.",22
95,Mr GANDER,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"At the time it was said that the mine off Gabo Island was laid by the members of the Independent Workers of the World. Mr E. F. HARRISON - The members of that organization specialized in attacking defenceless women and children. Our remoteness from the scenes of desolation caused by past wars has given us a false sense of security. But the venue of warfare is moving eastward, and, should there be another world war-wliic h God forbid-it is probable that we in Australia will see blood shed in our own country. War comes without warning. The suddenness with which hostilities commenced towards the end of 1914 staggered the civilized world. A nation does not have six months in which to prepare for war; it suddenly realizes that it is at war. It would surprise many in Australia to awake one morning to find that the Sydney Town Hall or the Sydney Harbour bridge had been demolished by a raiding aeroplane. Within a few hours of such an event, Melbourne could be bombed from the air and munition dumps and supplies for the field forces could be demolished. It would also be a comparatively easy matter for a raiding aeroplane, in the absence of opposition, to destroy the railway crossings over the river Murray. At such a time it would be useless to convene meetings or to write letters to the newspapers; that would not do anything to hold the enemy in check. We have to get down to realities. It would be useless for patriotic members of the community to say that they were prepared to do and die for their country. It. would be nothing less than murder to send ill-equipped and untrained men into the field to contend with superior forces equipped with tanks, gas apparatus and every modern weapon of warfare. Our position in relation to Empire defence was definitely laid down many years ago. I give credit to those who took part in that conference, at which it was decided that we should be responsible for our own local defence. In consultation with the authorities overseas a complete scheme for local defence within the Empire was formulated, but the strength of such a chain of defence is governed by the strength of its weakest link. Unfortunately, Australia is the weakest link in the chain of Empire defence. Are we to let the Empire down? We have relied on the British navy for so long that we have become imbued with the idea that that navy will always be able to protect us. We are depending too much on the Mother Country; we ought to do something for ourselves. In any future international conflict the Royal Navy may be so busily engaged in European waters that it could uot possibly be of any assistance to Australia. ""While praying and waiting for assistance from that source, our cities aud towns might he destroyed, and our people murdered. We must defend our country, or face the possibility of later payment for services rendered, if payment were made at all, being made in marks, francs or yen. We should, therefore, get down to realities, and take stock of our position from a defence view-point. The length of our coastline is equivalent to the distance between Sydney and London, and to protect that extensive coastline we have but two modern cruisers.",23
96,Mr WATKINS,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"Purchase d in Great .Britain. Mr E. F. HARRIS ON - Exactly , and we have one obsolete aircraft carrier built in Sydney. With this totally inadequate naval defence, and an army whose maximum strength consists of 30,000 men without modern equipment, arid without reserves, we have to protect 12,500 miles of coastline.",24
97,Mr HUTCHIN,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"Ill-equippe d untrained. Mr E. E. HARRISON - That is so. Our air force is not provided with sufficient financial assistance to enable proper instruction in flying to be given. Our railway systems should be so laid out that they would be a means of defence against enemy attack; but, as the late Lord Kitchener said in 1909, they are now of more benefit* to an enemy than to ourselves. Honourable members travel the country speaking of our strategic railways; but that between Sydney and Brisbane, on which there is no break of gauge, has no more claim to be regarded as a strategic line than have the roads around Parliament House. On the contrary, it could be of assistance to an enemy. At seven points at least it could be thrown out of action in a few hours, and at two of them repairs would take twelve months to effect.",24
98,Mr ROSEVEAR,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"Coul d not aeroplanes destroy any railway? Mr E. E. HARRISON - At the moment the successful bombing of a railway from the air is difficult. An enemy aeroplane, if menaced with anti-airr 1932-33. craft guns, might not be able to hit the Sydney bridge. We have comforted ourselves with the fact that Great Britain is constructing a naval base at Singapore. We speak of that base as if it were an accomplished fact; but it is not finished, and in its present state it is merely a bait to attract the enemy. The Singapore base is not yet in a position to accommodate those vessels of the British Navy which would come to eastern waters should the occasion arise. The first endeavour of an enemy would be to seize that base.",24
99,Mr WATKINS,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"What is wrong with Darwin ? Mr E. E. HARRISON - Everything . To make a base there the port would have to be reconstructed in order to provide water of a sufficient depth to accommodate naval vessels, and to prevent tide rips.",24
100,Mr MARTKNS,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"What of Thursday Island? Mr E. P. HARRISON - I know the conditions at Thursday Island, because I lived there for some years; and I know also the strategic value of Darwin in its present state. Those honourable members who are conversant with the requirements of a naval base know that it should give anchorage for 300 or 400 vessels, and, therefore, both Darwin and Thursday Island are unsuitable. At the moment Singapore is a definite attraction to an enemy wishing to operate against Australia, and in its unfinished state is a point vulnerable to such an enemy. Having captured the Singapore base, an enemy would, some say, proceed down the eastern coast of Australia to a point in the vicinity of the electorate represented by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins). because that is regarded as an industrial and commercial centre. But coal has now lost the important position it previously held in industry. In my opinion the first point attacked would be sonic place in Western Australia. What provision is there in that State to meet such an attack? There are a few shortranged guns at Fremantle, and some obsolete guns at Albany on King George Sound. To meet an invader we have only a thousand inadequately trained men with obsolete equipment. An attack 'upon fremantle would have to be resisted by troops from this side of the continent. The capture of King George Sound would be merely a matter of the enemy's convenience; we could not prevent it. Most of our naval vessels have been scrapped, and we are left entirely unprotected from the sea. With an enemy located in King George Sound we could not send a single cargo of Australian produce from Australia through the Suez Canal or round the Cape of Good Hope. I do not wish to ask honourable members to follow me through a dissertation on Imperial defence, but it must be obvious to them that once Western Australia was in the hands of an enemy, it would be only a matter of time before the eastern States would have to surrender. Wc have a very small force, without reserves. We pride ourselves on the fact that the ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force would form H reserve for our present volunteer army in; time of need: but the number of men so available is doubtful. Those who are alive and able, and who have already borne the beat and burden of previous campaigns, would be willing to protect those who would not, or could not. protect their own kith and kin. But of the 330,000 men who went overseas. 00,000 were, killed. Of the 270,000 who returned, 180,000 were wounded, and sickness and casualties leave""only 90,000 ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force available. If their average age was 30 years on the date on which the armistice was signed, those men are now beyond the military age, which is that between eighteen and 45 years. Sidling suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m. Mr E. F. HARBISON - The spirit of the members of the Australian Imperial Force is undoubted, but we cannot fairly ask war-worn men to carry on while others neglect to do their part in the defence of their country. Honourable members may be misled by the fact that in the Estimates the members of rifle clubs appear to be a portion of the defence fqr.ee. Rifle clubs have performed, and still are performing, a useful part in their own sphere. They are teaching the elements of rifle shooting, according to their own tenets, although not necessarily according to the requirements of battle shooting, and some are giving useful instruction to young soldiers. But as a potential reserve to the field army they must be entirely ruled out. This contention is well illustrated by my own experience at the commencement of the Great War. It was necessary to call up members of rifle clubs to form a small guard, but we had to examine 65 of them before we could get twelve who were fit. according to military standards, to undertake guard duty. We must, therefore, write off a large proportion of rifle club members from the reserves of the field army, and must also recollect that rifle - marksmanship is only a small factor in the training and qualifications of a soldier. How would the reserves for a battery of artillery be provided? Artillery is a special and technical arm, and a considerable amount of time must be given voluntarily to the training of the young gunner - That is true also of the engineers. Admittedly a number of civilians acquire, in connection with their ordinary avocations, knowledge and experience which is of assistance to an engineering corps in the field, but it is not sufficient to qualify them to undertake the improvisations and hurried work necessary to provide a smooth passage for the fighting forces of the field army. What reserves are required for the field army!* It is estimated that the organization which existed under the universal training scheme is the least that is necessary to provide an adequate defence force namely, two cavalry divisions and five infantry divisions, with ancillary troops, making a total of about 130,000 men. In addition a fixed organization is necessary to provide transport, food supplies, and hospital accommodation, and do the 101 jobs that must be done to keep a fighting army in the field. We have approximately 30,000 men in the militia forces today, without any reserves. Of the members of the Australian Imperial Force, possibly 30,000 arc still fit for service. We may get another 5,000 men from the rifle clubs, but these bodies are widespread and recruiting from them is not easy. Thus we have a possible total of 65,000 men of the requisite 130,000. We would commence a campaign with half our. necessary strength, and the wastage in action is such, that we should ueed at least double that number behind the line if the field army were to be kept effective. After the reserves have been called up a considerable time is required to fit them to take the field. Tho first division of the Australian Imperial Force was recruited about November, 1914, and although given the most strenuous training ever given to force in the world, did not go into action until April of the following year. Although the men were carefully selected, intensive training extending over seven months was required to make of them real fighting force.",24
101,Mr GANDER,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"And they were then best soldiers in the world. Mr E. F. HARRISON - That cannot be denied. But we must not rely on the reputation of the Australian Imperial Force for our defence at the present time. Untrained and improperly armed troops thrown into the firing line, not only come a menace to their own side, through their iuability to perform the necessary tasks and bear the inevitable fatigue, but also speedily fill the hospitals and congest the rear organization. For the reasons I have mentioned I earnestly ask the vernment to endeavour to devise some methods of providing reserves for that small but willing and highly efficient of troops, who at the present time are doing a patriotic duty by preparing themparticular selves for the defence of Australia. They suffer from a sense of injustice. After the war and until the advent of the Scullin Government, the spirit and efficiency amongst the citizen soldiers of Australia had not previously been equalled in the military history of this country. But through the policy of the last Government, a highly efficient force was contralia verted into a mere skeleton. That impitiable posed a tremendous hardship upon ento thusiastic soldiers, and they felt the buff keenly. For reasons best known to themselves, the members of the last Minisaccount try had no sympathy with the profession of arms. If they had declared that they had no sympathy with war, every memrumblings ber of the House and every soldier the Commonwealth would have agreed with them, for nobody who has ever perienced the horrors of war desires to see them repeated, and certainly if war must occur again we want to keep it out of our homeland. The Scullin Government "" pruned ""- "" emasculated "" - is, I think, the more correct word-the whole of the defence forces. Not only were they reduced to less than 30,000 men, but the party then in power seemed determined to depreciate the soldier, and to deny any value in the profession of arms. any I have heard similar views expressed in all parts of the world, and frequently in Australia. We have been told that by giving a roan a rifle and a uniform, he can be made an integral and useful part a of an army. The attitude of the Scullin Government was illustrated by the "" pruning"" of the liaison officers at Australia the House. Up to that time, each of the fighting forces was represented in London by its own expert, who was a link between the Imperial Forces and those in Australia. After the visit of Mr Scullin to England, the expert officers were returned to Australia, and a civilian, who bebad no status amongst the fighting services in the United Kingdom, was appointed with the title of "" defence liaison officer."" That was typical of the attitude of the Labour Government towards the fighting services. However, all Go the blame cannot be laid upon the shoulders of that Government. The depressed state of the national finances was body partly responsible for some of the cuts that Avere made. I shall not discuss the severity with which the axe was applied to army officers long prior to the general cut throughout the service. Thoy suffered in silence; they were not allowed by the regulations, or by professional tradition, to tell their sad stories to other than their own senior officers. The expenditure upon defence in Ausduring the last few years bears a relation to the expenditure prior the war. In 1913-14, the expenditure rewas 23s. 7d. per head; this year it is estimated to be 9s. 3d., which, taking into the depreciation of the currency, represents not more than about 5s. in real money. Since 1918, there have been and rumours of war all round in the globe. Australia may be likened to an outback homestead or settlement durexing the bushfire season. Would any sensible settler neglect to have a water cart' at hand or to cut a firebreak about his property ? Yet, when the whole world is nervous and unsettled, we are doing our level best to reduce to vanishing point the small national insurance this country has had in the past. Having some knowledge of the military service, I venture to suggest that the previous system of training worked well. It was based on years of experience and was supported hy the traditions of the Australian Imperial Force. We had a fighting force which would not discredit Australia, should it ever have to take the field. Now this most distant outpost of the Empire is almost defenceless, and we can only hang our heads in shame because of our reliance upon the goodwill of other nations, and upon the protection of the Mother Country.",26
102,Mr MCNICOLL,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"Werriwa) [2.29] The honourable member for Corio (Mr. Casey) dealt at length last night with the subject of exchange. We have learned to listen attentively to that honourable gentleman. He commenced his speech by saying that most honourable members and others who spoke of exchange did so without any knowledge or understanding of it ; it was, he said, a complicated subject, and should be left to experts. With becoming humility, the honourable member disclaimed expert knowledge of this subject, but then proceeded to speak in detail of exchange problems, leading us to value his remarks by his prefatory statement that only the expert could say anything that was worth listening to. His observations on the exchange problem were thoughtful and valuable, but his references to the attitude of the Country party on this subject were not quite correct. I , for one, am not an advocate of an arbitrary increase of the exchange rate. On the contrary, I should very much like to see the time come when exchange is back to par. In this matter, all that members of the Country party ask for is expert advice, and I suggest that we are quite justified in that attitude. Honourable members will recall that, somewhere about last November, Sir Eobert Gibson, the Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board, wrote to the Prime Minister asking for some guidance in this very complex matter. The honourable member for Corio quoted the Mncmillan report ou monetary reform, presented a year or two ago to the British House of Commons. I remind the committee that we have in this country a competent body of experts, who presented a report to the Premiers Conference in April test. In seeking a solution of our difficulties, they offered the following suggestions:The gap between export costs and prices is about 20 per cent. Some of this might be covered by direct' cutting of costs, some by raising the exchange, and some gained by increased efficiency throughout industry. Later, in the same report, they statedThrough the comparative flexibility of the Australia-on-London exchange and the sterling gold exchange, cost and prices in Australian currency have been brought nearer together, but for wool and wheat in particular costs still exceed prices. The present volume of production cannot even be maintained until this position improves. Apparently what was in their minds was an alteration of the exchange rate to improve the general position in Australia. They stated, furtherIf we could count upon a sufficient rise in overseas prices in the course of the next year or two, the method of raising the exchange rate might keep up production until the rise in oversea prices restores export industry to a profitable basis. The view put forward by the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) was really in agreement with the observations of the honourable member for Corio, namely, that exchange being such a complicated subject, Parliament is entitled to expert guidance, so that the rate may be managed in the interests, not of primary producers only, but of the people generally. No one will deny that a. high exchange really serves the purpose of an addition to tariff duties. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Gullett) said this morning that it was impracticable to adopt the suggestion made by the right honourable member for Cowper, but it seems to me that it would be a normal procedure while exchange is so high to reduce the tariff proportionately, thus easing the burden on our people. I regard the budget as a very honest and straightforward attempt on the part of the Government to square the ledger. In my opinion, the estimates of revenue have been prepared on a conservative basis. Doubtless, this is the right course for any government to adopt, and in view of our recent experiences, it is wise to proceed with caution. But the revenue returns for the last two or three months are very encouraging. Some people take the contrary view, because of the increase of imports over exports; but every one knows that exports have been held back in expectation of improved prices overseas; furthermore the new export season has not yet commenced. We have to remember also, that some proportion of the increased import trade is due to stocks in Australia being so depleted that it was necessary to build them up again. suggest, therefore, that the general trade situation indicates a return to prosperity. The Melbourne Argus, of the 6th October, published an interesting article dealing with international trade movements. From it , I extract the following:Any substantial improvement in world prices is unlikely without an increase of national trade. To deplore an increase of imports to the extent permitted by the improving financial position is tantamount to deploring the return of prosperity. Admittedly our position is difficult. Our national income in 1927-2S was, in round figures, £650,000,000; in 1931-32 it had dropped to £430,000,000, a reduction of £220,000,000. Stated in other terms, four to five years ago - the national income per head of the population was £104, whereas last year it was only £82. Therefore, we may regard the more recent trade figures with lively satisfaction, believing that they represent a marked improvement in our general financial position. W it h regard to the Ottawa agreement, tabled by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Gullett) yesterday, I am very much in favour of any proposal to improve inter-Empire trade, and for this reason I welcome the increase in the margin of preference in favour of British goods in the Australian market. But I think the objective could have been achieved better by reducing the duties on British goods, allowing those foreign goods to stand. Under the Ottawa proposals, the actual beuefit to British manufacturers will be somewhat restricted, and there is the danger of retaliation by foreign countries. Also, we should not forget that every increase in customs duties means an addition to the cost of commodities required by Australian con.Vr. MeXicoIl. sumers. The Minister for Health (Mr M a r r ) was good enough this morning to credit the members of the Country party with having the interests of the Commonwealth at heart. Wc take the view that in all our legislation we should not overlook the welfare of the people who have to buy the things we produce. It had been my intention to refer in some detail to a number of matters mentioned by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr E . E. Harrison). I have not been long enough a member of I the House to appreciate the value of wearisome reiteration of views, the statement of which fills Hansard to repletion and induces in many members a condition of somnolence; therefore I shall exclude from what I may say any allusion to those subjects already dealt with by the honourable member for Bendigo. The A tinter- torney-General (Mr Latham), who on Priday last presented his report dealing with the Disarmament Conference at Geneva, gave us some rather disquieting information. On this subject, the Sydney Morning Herald a few days ago made the following comments:The obligation . . . upon members of the league is not to disarm but ""the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety, and the enforcement of common action of international obligations "" . . . Every person of intelligence recognizes the difficulties. Those diliihave been increased . . . by the failure ot most of the great nations to realise that the higher and higher national tariffs which have been reared since the Armistice represent the carrying on of another sort of war. Further on the article saysOutside the League, Soviet Russia has not only been arming heavily, but its Government has repeatedly proclaimed to the world that it, is arming for a world-wide proletarian war. And againA special committee of the League long ago pointed out to its members that a grave hazard to world peace is the erection of national tariff barriers against interon national trade and that, if these barrievB are maintained, the world will be heading toivards war again, sooner or later. As the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr E . F . Harrison) pointed out, there have been outbreaks of trouble in Yugoslavia, Germany, and other parts of the world, and it has been stated that Japan is endeavouring to obtain a footing in the Malay Archipelago. During the last five years, all the important countries in 1 the world have been increasing their expenditure on defensive preparations particularly in connection with their navies and air forces. It must not be forgotten that, very often, our friends of yesterday are our enemies tomorrow. In Leipzig, one may see a tremendous war memorial celebrating victories that were obtained by Great Britain and Germany over France. In Australia, certain matters - have been discussed so frequently that the inclination is to regard them as non-existent. One is the vulnerability of our empty north. In that portion of the - continent, there are large areas that are - not populated by white people, and that - offer temptation to other races to whom - the climatic conditions would not be a .hindrance. In such matters, we have had to rely for our protection on the Royal Navy. As the honourable member for Bendigo said, no one wants war. This Parliament contains something over thirty returned soldiers, every one of whom 1 guarantee hates war aud its effects not less than those honourable members on my right who so often declaim against war. They have been engaged in it ; they know and have shared, the sufferings caused by it, and have not a good word to say for it. But only a fool would shut his eyes to the necessity for defence measures. Some honourable members are followers of the prize ring: they would not recommend any person to enter it without making thorough preparations for defending himself. I recall with pleasure the announcement on one occasion by the honourable member for ""West Sydney (Mr Beasley) that there was an obligation on the young men of this country to serve the nation in the last war. Our forces hav been reduced to three sea-going ships, with a personnel of not quite 3,000 ratings in the navy, about 1,500 permanent soldiers, the provision for, but not the existence of, 30,000 trained men, a small air force, and a few planes that are rapidly becoming obsolete. It is quite true that we have been financially embarrassed, and have had to curtail our expenditure. It is rather significant, however, that the fighting men of the army and navy, who have very little voice in parliamentary affairs, and an inconsiderable voting power, should be the first hit and the hardest hit. In the army, compulsory rationing was introduced very early in the period of depression, and caused severe hardship. These silent services have no means of making known their sufferings. Assuming that at the moment we cannot afford any considerable expenditure .on defence, I am hopeful that the provision will be increased before very long, because the situation that confronts us is a dangerous one. I wish to emphasize the absolutely unfair way in which salaries are allotted in such a highly specialized service as the different branches of the Defence Department. There is a Secretary for Defence, whose salary is £2,000 a year. He may be well worth it. But compare it with the salary of the leading professional soldier of the Commonwealth, the Chief of the General Staff, who is the executive commander in times of trouble, and whose whole life has been devoted to his profession. He receives only £1,500 a year. Each of these gentlemen, of course, is subject to a percentage reduction under the terms of the Financial Emergency Act, but the reductions are proportionately the same. There are also, in the central 'administration, a Finance Secretary, whose salary is £1,094 a year, an Assistant Secretary, who receives £994 a year, and 40 clerical officers. In the clerical branch of the navy, there are 111 officers of all grades, who receive a total of £39,235, an average of £353 a year for each person. Contrast that with the sea-going service, in which there is a personnel of 3,160, whose remuneration totals £860,754, an average of £272 a year each.",27
103,Mr HOLLOWAY,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,They are also found.,29
104,Mr MCNICOLL,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"Althoug h they have had years of technical training, they receive less than clerical officers who sit safely and comfortably at home. The honourable member for Melbourne' Ports (Mr Holloway), having to come to Canberra every week, knows what it means to be deprived of home life, and should be able to appreciate the feelings of those who have to remain at sea for months at a time. Many of these seamen, when on shore leave, find that they are worse off than persons on land, who are in receipt of the dole and family endowment. How can it be contended that discipline may be maintained under such conditions ? I u the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, which is, in a sense, a militia organization, there are 23 employed on the clerical side, receiving on the average £428 per annum, and ou the sea-going side there are 119 of all ranks, whose salaries average £343 per annum, or nearly £100 a year less. Taking the permanent forces, which is a small nucleus of professionally trained men, I find that 1,552 officers and men receive, on the average, only £255 per annum. In the ordnance branch, the military staff numbers 45, and the civilian and storehouse staff 242. These figures show that the clerical officers have' received greater consideration than the technical officers.. There have been fewer dismissals among the clerical staffs, and more have been retained than are necessary. The cut has been applied principally to the military, naval and air forces, and because the members of those services have been unable to secure that consideration for their claims which should be extended to them, they have been forced to accept lower salaries than should be paid to such specially trained men. I shall refer only briefly to the air force, because I understand that another honourable member intends to deal with it in detail. This force, particularly the civil aviation branch of it, needs immediate and earnest attention on the part of the Government. I travelled through Europe two years ago, and I was amazed to find the extent to which civil aviation had been organized these. Even parcels of newspapers are carried by aeroplane on a successful commercial basis. A plane can be obtained in practically any important town to enable one to travel to almost any other part of Europe, and regular time tables are arranged. Civil aviation services have been developed to an extent of which we have little conception in Australia. The Government has, admittedly, spent a certain sum of money in encouraging civil aviation in this country, but mainly in subsidizing one or two private companies; therefore, the money voted for the purpose has been spent in a wrong Mr MnWicoll. direction. I recognize that the Government is faced with financial difficulties at the present time, but I am convinced that the Defence Department requires a thorough overhaul, in order to bring about a reasonable adjustment of the salaries of officers on the clerical and technical sides of the service. I agree with the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr E. F. Harrison) that a real danger threatens Australia. If time permitted, I could go deeply into the importance of providing for the adequate defence of Australia. When the financial position permits of it, the whole subject should be examined from a national point of view, not with a desire to precipitate war, but with a full realization of the isolated position of Australia in the world, and of the need for the defence of this country, in order - that we shall not be taken unprepared.",29
105,Mr WHITE,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"Balaclava) [2.55] The budget debate provides an opportunity for honourable members to discuss any subject witfli which they care to deal, and I_intend to offer a few observations, principally upon the subject of aviation, because I have found in the past that the individual items of the Estimates are often considered during an all-night sitting, when they do not receive the close attention to which they are entitled. We were treated to a speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) regarding our trade balance, aud the right honourable gentleman suggested that this was not a good budget. While I admit that in many directions greater economies might have been effected, generally speaking. I regard the budget as a good one. The right honourable member traversed familiar ground, and discussed many matters of international moment to which afll honourable members, no doubt, have given consideration. But he contributed nothing helpful to the debate. He drew attention to the trade balance, and said that because it was now adverse, it was likely to embarrass Australia. I agree that our trade balance should be carefully watched. Although the right honourable gentleman tried to take credit of having converted an unfavorable balance into a favourable one, Ave all knoAv that that resnlt came about to a great extent automatically. Evidence of the reduced purchasing power of the people was shown during the regime of the last Government with ever increasing - unemployment, despite the measures that it took to adjust the trade balance. .It is not statesmanlike to impose pro""hibitions and surtaxes irrespective of the amount of unemployment that may result. But a government does well if , while .adjusting the trade balance, it keeps men in employment. I claim that the unemployment evil has now been checked - definitely.",30
106,Mr RIORDAN,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,No !,31
107,Mr WHITE,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"It has in Victoria, because in that State thousands of men are going off the dole. Anybody who has - commercial connexions knows that business has been stimulated since the advent - of the present Government. The fact that the trade balance is adverse at this particular time is a sign of general business revival. It shows that many firms which were becoming short of stocks are now replenishing their warehouses, because they realise that confidence is returning. Money is coming into Australia, not in cash, but in goods, aud that is a sign of returning prosperity. The trade balance will right itself. The present time - of the year is the season when there is a maximum of imports - Commercial houses arc getting ready for the summer trade. It is the period, also, of minimum exports, and it folloAvs that Will the increased imports and the reduced exports, there mu3t bo an adverse balance, but only temporarily. I realise that if the trade balance does not soon adjust itself, Ave shall have to take measures to correct the position; but it is unreasonable for honourable members opposite to condemn the present Government because the trade balance is adAerse for a short period of the year. They might as well judge a business on one particular month's trading. If the matter does not adjust itself, Ave can take measures, if necessary, similar to those adopted by the last GoAfernment. It is wise to Avatch the trade balance, to get men back into employment, and to let prosperity return. I Avas pleased to hear the speeches the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr E. F. Harrison) and the honourable member for WerriAva (Mr MCNicoll). I Avas reminded of past occasions when I haAe directed the attention of this Parr liament to the need for adequate defence measures. I ivas vilified by supporters of the last Government when I pointed out that it Avas the duty of every citizen to support the compulsory training system, and to do his share in the defence of the country. The Minister for Defence at that time Avas the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green), who accused me of trying to destroy the A oluntary system. I pointed out at that r time that, under the voluntary system, specialist branches of the service, such as artillery, air force, engineers, &c, Would secure a full quota of recruits, but that a shortage would be experienced in the infantry units. My prophecy has, unfortunately, come true. A report recently issued by the senior officers shoAvs that the infantry battalions cannot be kept up to strength. I pointed out that by training a few men, these men were only doing their share while others shirked' We do not, in that, way, get the same body of reserves as under the compulsory system, and Ave do not get the trained man power that AVO should have to defend this great heritage of our3. I am pleased, therefore, that there are now other honourable members in this House Avho appreciate the defence needs of the country. To destroy the defence system is to jeopardize the safety of Australia, and thus betray its most vital interests. I hope the Government will take heed of the speeches made on this subject, and will see that provision is made for the defence needs of the country. We are practically an outpost of the f white race, situated at only a short distance from the Asiatic coast. We have a coastline of 13,000 miles, and territory 25 times a3 large as the British Isles. Yet Ave are spending on defence only about one-fifth as much per head as Great Britain, which shows that we arc leaning on the Mother Country in defence matters. Recently the admiral in command of our fleet pointed out that our navy Avas not equal in strength to that of of Siam. I might also add that Ave have now no survey ships. What we had the last Government placed out of commission. although, they had been used on practically civil business. There is still plenty of work for them to do, as navigators on some parts of our coast still have to depend upon the charts prepared by Flinders and Bass. It is humiliating to reflect that countries like Portugal, China, and Siam are able to keep survey ships in commission, while we are not, although their coast lines are much shorter than ours. Mr Riusv - What about the auxiliary cruisers that the Bruce-Page Government disposed of?",31
108,Mr WHITE,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"The honourable member is no doubt referring to the Commonwealth line of steamers. Those ships would be of little use in time of war against even the most obsolete cruisers in any other navy. At any rate, the foundation of that shipping line was an experiment in socialism carried out by the former Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes). I could never have supported that proposal, and Australia is still paying for it in interest on the money borrowed with which to build the ships. Under the heading of Aviation, the vote this year is £311,750 for the Royal Australian Air Force, and £129,750 for civil aviation. As trustees for the we are responsible for the money spent on these items, and we should see that it is spent as advantageously as possible. The money devoted to the air force has been wisely expended. Small as the force is, it is efficient. Most of the air force vote has been spent on ground organization, such as hangars, workshops, buildings, aerodromes, &c, so that the force may be quickly expanded in case of emergency. There is great, scope for devolopment on the aviation side of defence. It is one of the. most economical, yet effective arms of the service. It is obvious that if Western Australia were invaded, we could not send a division of troops there from the east in less than a month, hut a detachment of the air force could, arrive there in a matter of days. The some applies to an invasion in the north. It is admitted, of course, that the air force cannot fight a war alone; it is merely an auxiliary to the land forces, as, indeed, are the other arms. The air force, nevertheless, can arrive on the scene quickly, and, in recent years, air detachments have done wonders in the way of fighting small campaigns on their own. In Mesopotamia troop carriers each conveying a platoon of infantry quickly quelled risings in mountainous country in actions against the Kurds. Also, during the disturbances some little time ago in Afghanistan, hundreds of persons were carried by air force planes from Kabul to India. Every day improvements are being, made in the speed and carrying capacity of aeroplanes. During the war we were interested mainly in the destructive capacity of planes, but aviation has its humanitarian and commercial sides as well. In 1915, some air force planes were capable of flying at only 50 miles an hour. Recently, an air force seaplane flew at 407 miles an hour in the Schneider Cup tests, and Sir Malcolm Campbell, the speed motorist, when being entertained at the air force mess, was charged with "" loitering "" because he had done only 219 miles an hour in his car! In the days when Britain was portion of the Roman Empire, it took fourteen days to journey from Rome to London. Seventeen hundred years later, when Sir Robert Peel was recalled from Italy people, to London to assume the office of Prime Minister, it took him twelve days to do the trip; yet, in 1932, it takes only 48 hours to do the journey by train, or eight hours to do it by aeroplane. In Australia, with its enormous spaces, the possibilities ahead of aviation are immense. Ai r services have brought the comforts of civilization to those living outback, and have been a definite factor in opening up remote areas. The air force, in addition to being an arm of the military service, has carried out valuable work in forest survey, spotting for bush fires, and reconnaissance for the discovery of oil-fields. The money spent on civil aviation has been devoted chiefly to establishing commercial air mail lines, and it is in respect to these that I have criticism to offer. I consider that this money has not been wisely spent. The Civil Aviation Department came into being in 1920, when the Air Navigation Act was passed empowering the department to make regulations. Had the money been wisely spent we should have had a great deal more to show for it than we have. In the air force we have buildings, aerodromes and machines to show for the money spent, but if we were to take stock of the Civil Aviation Department we should have very little to show for the £1,000,000 or more which has been spent. If a business man were to ignore the advice of his auditors he would be courting disaster, and it therefore behoves us to pay attention to what the Auditor General has to say on the subject of civil aviationI n his last report he statesIn previous years I have dealt with the competitive and costly aspects of air mail services. I then pointed out that although there was some convenience to those who used the service, the expenditure, particularly during the existing Treasury difficulties, was cally unsound, because it was unnecessary largely provided luxury and duplicate sermercial vices. There is no doubt that aviation comwealth panies have attempted to push their business this service. beyond a point for which justification can be found in this country, and that the great of the population, who never use those services and who cannot afford them, are subjected to a severe tax quite out of proportion to the benefits received. The subsidies paid last after deducting the air mail fees, totalled £83,071. The weight of mail matter carried and the coastal was 30,057 lh., the average cost per lb. being £2 14s. On one route in Queensland, the Australia Airways Limited. average cost is nearly £7. Apart from loss to the Commonwealth and State ments by reason of competition with railways in regard to passenger and freight and with the telegraph and telephone services, the direct cost of air mail 'services totals £1,(100 per week. There is the further burden on Australian production, and its aggravating effect on the exchange position resulting the importation of aeroplanes and petrol. Last year I quoted figures showing the serious effect which the East-West """"Mail Service was having upon Commonwealth finances. It has been estimated that if this service suspended, and the Commonwealth compenit sated the company by paying to it the profit which it is deriving from this service, the Commonwealth would save at le;i.st £35,000 annum until the expiration of the contract 1st June, 1934. The Commonwealth could save £35,000 year by cancelling that contract. ""Why has no action been taken? criticism has been made, and it is necesstatistics sary that action should be taken. we afford to throw away £35,000? I the reason is only that it is a contract, we must remember that contracts with lb., the bondholders, and between mortgagors and mortgagees, have already been altered. If the condition of affairs has so changed that air mail is not now of such great importance as it was considered to be in 1929 when the contract was made, the parties concerned should be brought together and a new agreement entered into. I have raised a protest on this subject on two previous occasions when we have been dealing with the Estimates, but nothing has been done. If these air mail companies have cut salaries, their profits must be proportionately higher. The Auditor General draws attention to the fact that an air mail service between Australia and England is contemplated, and statesAlthough it is perfectly clear that Australia's linancial position is such that it cannot afford the huge subsidy which would be econominecessary to maintain such a service, and endeavours are being made by certain cominterests to influence the CommonGovernment with a view to establishing mass Undoubtedly, air mail services have been of value to Australia, particularly those in the remote parts, and I do not criticize year, such activities 'as Qantas, which runs u service diagonally across Queensland service of West; It is the the subsidy for the cast-west service Governwhich runs parallel with the easttraffic west railway that the Auditor-General particularly refers to as a waste of money. There is not the same need for air service nowadays, when the written and, thanks from to the progress in the development of the wireless telephone, the spoken word can be very sent overseas cheaply and expeditiously. It would be interesting to know who were have clamoured for these contracts. Is the chambers of commerce or the chambers of manufactures? I think not. per All the benefits appear to go to the on companies which operate the services. The Auditor-General points out how small is the weight of the mail a carried, yet the department called for tenders for machines with relatively That - enormous payloads. Departmental reveal that some Westralian Can Airways machines operating between f Perth, Derby and Wyndham, with a payload capacity of between 1,200 and 1,600 are carrying an average of only 76 lb. of mail, while between Perth and Adelaide, machines with a payload capacity of 2,200 lb., have been carrying a mail weighing about 174 lb. That company has enjoyed a favourable contract, giving it £380 for every t r ip it makes, the average mail load being 177 lb. It had a very nice arrangement with the department; that, if , for a period of four months, the weight of mail could be raised to 800 lb., the company would receive £760 for each trip. The company made strenuous endeavours to increase the volume of mail by carrying catalogues and other heavy mail matter, and it was also arranged that the Government should institute a propaganda campaign, upon which it would spend £3,000 in advertising air services. The project was abandoned, and the company claimed £738 as compensation. It was granted £657. A i r companies, realizing that those good things might slip from their fingers in 1934, are arranging to get together with a view to starting further services. In addition to the opinions of the gone? Auditor-General, I wish to quote those of aviation authorities - Honourable members may be aware that recently there an air convention in Melbourne. At that ment problem. gathering very bitter things were said by different groups interested in aviation. They do not seem to be able to agree among themselves. Apparently, those who have are determined to hold, and those who have not are equally determined to possess something. I bring the matter forward because I believe that, if a select committee or royal commission were appointed to inquire into civil aviation, the people of Australia would learn how the money has been expended, and whether the Auditor-General was right i his criticism. Eirst, I shall give opinion of the principal aircraft operator in South Australia, Captain H . C. Miller, Defencea man whose opinions are respected by every section interested in aviation. He saidTake the firm that received the lion's share of the money spent, which is somewhere about £60,000 per annum. They employ four pilots, six or eight first-class mechanics, hoys . . . For just the amount that the above firm draws in three months we would be .sure of being able to mainstage tain our Broken Hill service for 40 provide years. . . . This service covers 520 Mr White. miles; so just divide the amount that has been paid out to the only firms that have operated with a subsidy in Australia (they number three) during the last eight years, and you will get an idea what could have been done with the same sum. Ten times the number of machines and men would have been employed for ten times the number of years. The linns that have been so wonderfully favoured for so many years are, naturally, not anxious to let their subsidy slip through their fingers, and their proposals for. an Australia-England link will further reduce the results gained for money spent, but will keep the subsidies flowing in their hands. . . . What we want is value for money spent, and it is time that this became the view of the powers that be. This does not necessarily mean that any existing services should not still run. Another private aircraft operator, M a j o r H . Turner Shaw, of Victoria, who has been flying for about twenty years, and has lost a fortune in endeavouring to establish aviation in Australia, points out thatThe subsidized companies, which have been paid £750,000, have in operation-2 8 machines, 10 pilots, 30 mechanics, and possibly employ some casual labour. Where has that £750,000 It is still going to the tune of £75,000 per annum.",32
109,Mr JAMES,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,That would have gone a was long way towards solving the unemploy,34
110,Mr WHITE,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"W is e l y expended, it would have helped considerably to provide more employment for aircraft engineers. At present, the money is spent largely on air mail services. We have an excellent beam wireless service, and overseas telephone facilities, so that there is not the same urgent need for a fast air mail service. In any case the principal cost should be borne by the users of the air mail, and not by the whole of the taxpayers of Australia. The returns from n these services are dwindling, yet the conthe tract is again to be renewed. On the 10th June, 1930, I asked the then Minister for Will the Minister for Defence offer an inducement to Australian National Airways, or some other company, to include Canberra in its itinerary, and so provide quicker transport to and from the Federal Capital, and relieve to seme extent the isolation of its people. and a few The reply wasCivil aviation has already progressed to a which makes it no longer necessary to subsidies to enable properly-managed andcapitalized organizations to operate aerial services successfully between large and important centres of population. already ibeen demonstrated between Brisbane and Sydney, and is now in process of being so between Sydney and Melbourne. 'In such circumstances it is not proposed to oil'er any special financial inducement in order to facilitate aerial communication between the Federal and State capitals. It is, moreover, in the knowledge of the department that active steps are already being taken hy the different companies to include Canberra in their aerial itinerary, thus bringing the Federal Capital within 75 minutes from Sydney and three hours only from Melbourne. Yet, in spite of the fact that on this occasion we are told they are not necessary, the Government is going sidy on with these immense subsidies. Canada, 425,000 lb. of mail was carried in the year 1930, for which the Governpany ment paid a total air mail subsidy of £126.000. The total distance flown, in the sister dominion that year was 7,549,000 miles. Canada is carrying on campaign to clear landing grounds erect qerodromes, also to provide wireless communication, beacons and meteoroto logical services. That is how the money should have been spent in Australia. As I have already stated, if the whole our Civil Aviation Department were discontract posed of, there would' be very show for the £1,000,000 expended. The money has gone mainly to provide profits for aviation companies, with the result that aviation in Australia has not dethe veloped as it should have done. In ""New Guinea, which is being developed largely because of recent rich gold finds, a private company has carried 2,997 tons of freight without any subsidy.",34
111,Mr RILEY,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,And has charged £150 ton for doing so.,35
112,Mr WHITE,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"The point is that the company has not received any subsidy from the Commonwealth Government. In Australia the number of letters carried tigated. during 1930 was 383,492, and the total mileage flown was 3,000,000 miles, than half that of Canada. a disadvantage in not knowing what being done by the inter-departmental mittee set up as a result of severe criticism of our air mail subsidies. have asked several questions on this ject in the House, and the Minister kindly supplied me with the terms of reference, which show, among other This has things, that consideration would be given to- A service and a schedule that would(i) Be of a frequency of once weekly in each direction; (i i ) Provide a fourteen to seventeen day mail service between London and the Australian capital cities; (i i i ) Enable replies to be received from overseas in approximately half the time now taken. The fee to be charged on letters to England would approximate Is. 6d. to Is. 9d. per half ounce, inclusive of postage. It has been stated in the press that the operating company would be paid a subof £180,000 a year for arranging for In the carrying of mail matter between Australia and Singapore. Yet a Dutch comhas offered to carry our mail without any subsidy or guarantee. The Royal Dutch Air Line in co-operation with the Royal Dutch Indian Airways is prepared a to carry the Australian mail in a weekly and service from Wyndham or Port Darwin to London, and the users would only have pay a rate which would return a profit to the Commouwealth of £1 per kilogram.",35
113,Mr RILEY,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,Does the honourable memof ber consider that we should enter into a with the Dutch company for the little to carriage of our mails?,35
114,Mr WHITE,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"I am not suggesting that; but if the Dutch company can carry mails under these conditions, Australian or British companies should be able to do so. Three Australian companies are concerned. One has now ceased operations, and we have read in the press that a merger is proposed with the object of organizing the carriage of a mails between England and Australia. If the Dutch company can carry mails at a rate of only Is. on letters, Australian companies ought to be able to do it. The whole subject should be thoroughly invesI have mentioned the inter-departless mcntal inquiry; but I find nothing I am at in the terms of reference to the is investigating body to show that the commistakes of the past will be considered. We want to know how the I savings proposed by the Auditor-General subcan be effected. The Dutch company, to has which I have referred, was prepared to commence operations on the 1st October. We now have this proposed expenditure under consideration, and we ought to know definitely what the policy of the Government is. The Dutch interests were neutral during the war, and they are now carrying a large proportion of the British air mail through Burma. As they have made their offer to us, without prejudice in regard to future operations, it should be looked into sympathetically. As money is being spent in subsidizing civil aviation, we should be satisfied that it is being wisely spent. I consider that a good deal more could be done to encourage gliding clubs, which give boys and young men a very useful training in the rudiments of aviation. The Government is being forced to economize in very many directions. It has reduced parliamentary allowances, civil service salaries and pensions, and has called upon bondholders to accept a lower rate of interest. It has even cancelled the pensions that have been paid to certain dependants of soldiers. I consider therefore, that there is every justification for my request that a thorough inquiry by a select committee or a royal commission should be made into our expenditure on civil aviation. Royal commissions have inquired, in the past, into the coal, the pastoral, and many other industries. There is no reason why civil aviation should not be brought under review, for, under proper control, it could become a great national asset. I pointed out last year that whenever an aeroplane accident occurred, whether it was fatal or otherwise, the departmental inquiry which followed was of a secret nature, and that the public had no opportunity to ascertain what took place at it; also that when by request the papers were tabled in Parliament, only a summary and a finding were made available. Often, pilots are blamed for being careless, but it may be that their machines are not airworthy. If departmental machines are used there is, perhaps, less likelihood of an adverse finding by a departmental body in that regard. I submitted on that occasion that the Air Accidents Investigation Committee should become an open court like the Marine Court, and that citizens who were interUr. While. ested in aviation should be permitted to attend it. This will have to be done sooner or later. The Government's action in wasting thousands of pounds in the payment of subsidies to commercial aviation companies is in direct contrast to the attitude that has been adopted towards the humanitarian aircraft service operated in Central Queensland, by which a flying doctor engaged under the auspices of the Australian Inland Mission of the Presbyterian Church is able to render magnificent service to the people living in the outback with the aid of an aeroplane hired from the Qantas company. This service was started by a few private subscribers with the assistance of a grant from the H . V. MCKay Bequest. The flying doctor from his base at Cloncurry, spreads a mantle of protection over a district with a radius of 400 miles in the outback parts of Australia, to which, formerly, many were afraid to take their dear ones for fear of sickness or accidents. Since the flying doctor has been operating in this area a great burden of fear has been lifted from these people, for they now know that medical attention is available when it is needed. Coincident with the establishment of this service the mission provided a number of wireless transmitting sets with automatic keys, so that the doctor could be called up from outback centres to meet any emergency. This is a most valuable work. Yet the subsidy for it, which was formerly £600 a year, as against the £80,000 a year provided for the commercial company carrying a handful of letters between South Australia and Western Australia, was cancelled by the previous Government. I took the matter up with the Ministers at that time in charge of the Postal Department, the Home Affairs Department, and the Defence Department, and was given a sympathetic hearing. A promise was made that the subsidy would be re-considered when the new Estimates were being prepared, but that Government went out of office before that time arrived. Now that a new government has charge of affairs I look to it to do something. I am a supporter of this Government, but I shall criticize it just as I criticized the Labour Government if it does not do the right thing. I referred this matter to the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Parkhill) while he was in charge of the Department of the Interior, and he promised that half the former subsidy would be provided.",35
115,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,That amount is on the Estimates.,37
116,Mr WHITE,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"But there is a stipulation attached to it which should be removed. I do not think that the Department of the Interior should have to bear the full cost of the subsidy, because such a service as that provided by the flying doctor is of great value to the whole community. For instance, the doctor was recently able to counteract _ an epidemic which broke out on Mornington Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Such a service as this should be recognized as a useful adjunct to the air force and the Defence Department should gladly support it. Civil pilots would be very useful to the country if war should unhappily occur. The Government has reduced the vote for the Royal Australian Air Force as it has done that for the military department. But unfortunately the previous Government changed the defence policy of Australia, and so seriously damaged the effectiveness of our defence services that it will be a long while before they can be restored to their former value.",37
117,Mr GIBSON,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,The Postmaster-General should bo requested to call for alternative tenders for mail services by air or road.,37
118,Mr WHITE,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"Tba t is a good suggeslast tion. It is only right, that merchants and other people who seize the opporwould tunity to send letters quickly by the air mail service should pay for the carriage of those letters, and not whole of the taxpayers, the majority whom never use the services. The Gounemployment. vernment might well consider the estabCommonwealth lishment of directional communication between aerodromes and recognized air routes, on which passengers are reguthe larly carried. Had there been a system of directional wireless in operation the time of tlm last flight of the Southern Cloud, which was reported to have reached the neighbourhood of Melbourne, it. is probable that, even admitting the bad weather, it would not have been lost. There should be some encouragement of competition between the manufacturers and importers of aircraft, with the object of effecting improvements, particularly with regard to horse-power in relation to pay load. The Government might also give consideration to the payment of a bounty in respect of machines in use. With reference to the system under which every pilot who renews his licence is subsidized, it should be a condition that the pilot himself, when he qualifies, should receive the subsidy, and not necessarily the aero club. I hope that the Government, before entering into any agreement with a company, whether Dutch or British, will give honourable members an opportunity to discuss any proposals that are placed before it, that it will institute a proper inquiry, either by means of a select committee or a royal commission into civil aviation generally which, as with the royal commission on wireless, will enable members to learn something of the subject, and that it will take the earliest opportunity to place information at the disposal of honourable members so that we may know what is being done under the vote that is being passed by this Parliament.",37
119,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,"Brisbane) [3.33] - I support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin), because it has for its object the exposure to the people generally, of the neglect of the Government to make better provision for the unemployed. During the election, the Nationalist candidates said that if their party were returned to power, immediate provision be made for the relief of unemployment'. Yet we find that, although this Government has been in office for the nine months, it has done practically of nothing towards solving the problem of The latest figures of the Statistician show that for the last quarter of 1931, the percentage of unemployment was 27.4, and for third quarter of 1932, 29.6. Unemployment has therefore increased since at this Government took office. There is plenty of scope for the Government to honour its promise. As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, it could undertake public works of a reproductive character, such as public buildings, water supplies, and sewerage systems. I have in mind a building which the Commonwealth promised to erect in Brisbane, adjacent to-ANZAC Square, which is one of the most beautiful parks in Australia and is certainly a credit to the people of Brisbane. The Commonwealth Government, in order to make provision for that park, obtained from the Queensland Government certain State property on the understanding that each government would construct a public building on either side of it. The Queensland Government has carried out its undertaking, and it is now up to the Commonwealth Government to take similar action. If the construction of this additional building were put in hand, it would provide work for many of the unfortunate unemployed of Brisbane. I have, on several occasions, referred in this chamber to the Commonwealth offices in Brisbane. On the 23rd September last, I asked the then Minister for  questions:1. The number of buildings occupied in Brisbane by way of lease or otherwise by the Commonwealth Government? 2. The names of the persons or firms owning such buildings? 3. The number and the departments housed in therespective buildings? 4. The weekly or annual rental paid by the Commonwealth Government in respect to each building rented or leased? a. The estimated cost of the erection of the proposed new Commonwealth building on Commonwealth property adjouung. ANZAC Square, Brisbane, as prepared liy the Commonwealth works officers at Brisbane? I received the following replies:1. Six. 2. (a) Adelaide Steamship Limited. (6) Queensland Motors Limited, (a) Commonwealth Bank, (d) State Government, (e).Union Bank. (/) Queensland Turf Club. 3. (i ) Six. (i i ) (a) Department Health; (b) Prime Minister's Department; Departments of the Treasury, Interior and Commerce; (c) Department of the Interior; (d) Attorney-General's Department; Prime Minister's Department; and (/) Department of Commerce. 4. (a) £400 per annum; (6) £2,201 10s. per annum; (c) £072 per annum; (d) £09 per annum; (c) £200 per annum; (/) £930, plus rates, £55 9s., £991 9s. per annum. Total, including rates £4,572 19s. per annum. 5. The estimated cost of the scheme recommended by the Public Works Committee in 1927 was £170,500. Mr George Lawson. The department's estimate of the cost of a new Commonwealth building is £170,000. If the Government were sincere - in its desire to solve the unemployment problem and to serve its own interests, it would fulfil its promise to construct a building on this property, and would carry out many other reproductive public works in Queensland. The post office at Brisbane is a disgrace to the city and, indeed, to the whole Commonwealth. A person visiting a city for the first time looks for the post office and the town hall. I am proud to say that such a person would not be disappointed with the Brisbane Town Hall, for it is one of the most beautiful and up-to-date buildings in Australia; but, as I have said, the post office in that city is a disgrace. It is unfortunate that the Scullin Government did not remain in officea little longer, for in that case the finances of the country would soon have improved sufficiently to enable a new post office to be constructed. I hope that the new  whom I congratulate on his elevation to his new office, will, at the first available opportunity, visit Brisbane, and consider this question on the spot. If a new building cannot be erected, the least that the Government should do is to renovate the existing structure, whose walls and ceilings are in a most dilapidated state. The renovation of the building would be reproductive work, and it should be undertaken without delay. I am keenly disappointed with the budget speech of the Treasurer, because it is barren of any proposal to solve the problem of unemployment, which all honourable membersagree is the most important Company problem facing this and other countries today. Since I did not have an onportunity to of discuss the proposed reductions of invalid and old-age pensions, the maternity allowance, and the salaries of public servants, (e) when the Financial Emergency Bill was before us recently, I propose to refer to those matters now. The Government's proposals in this connection are the most wicked of any ever contemplated by an Australian Government. It grieves me to think that there is in power a government so callous that it will take from the aged and the infirm in our midst, something which they cannot afford to lose and which, after all, it is not necessary to take. That a government faced with a deficit of £1,467,000 should seek to balance its budget by taking £1,110,000 from the most defenceless section of the community, is unpardonable. It is true that the previous Administration reduced pensions; but it acted under totally different conditions. Although the Scullin Government was faced with a huge adverse trade balance and financial difficulties of great magnitude, it reduced pensions by only 12^ per cent. This Government seeks to obtain from the pensioners and the public servants of this country 75 per cent, of the amount required to balance its budget. Its proposal is outrageous. I shall continue my remarks on n future occasion. Progress reported. . ADJOURNMENT. ""WHEAT INDUSTRY-SHEE T GLASSGALVANIZED IRON.  posedThat the House do now adjourn.",37

I desire'-also to refer briefly to the embargo placed upon the importation of glass, and to the primage duty imposed upon galvanized iron. I mention these two matters because I contend that undertakings once entered into should be honourably observed.

121,Mr GREGORY,TO THE WAR PENSIONS ENTITLEMENT APPEAL,Yes . It cannot be said that primage duty has been imposed upon galvanized iron owing to the financial position of the Commonwealth.
