2,Mr BEASLEY,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE,"H as the Acting Treasurer perused the statement of the Auditor-General in his annual report, that Commonwealth revenue accounts are misleading, and carry with them suggestions that a new era of surpluses has begun, and that those surpluses aro available for expenditure, although they really do not exist? Has the honourable gentleman any comment to offer upon this* criticism? When the next monthly statement of receipts and expenditure is published by the Treasury, will he make to the House a statement setting out the correct financial position ?",9
3,Mr CASEY,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE,"I have not yet had an ment opportunity to read the report of the tn Auditor-General, but I propose to do so offhand at the earliest possible moment. heard, however, that that gentleman has seen fit to make criticisms of the characfigures, ter indicated by the honourable member. Although I have no knowledge of the preshortened cise terms of the criticism, I should that the position referred to was dealt with by the Prime Minister in the budget speech that he delivered to this House, I think, two years ago. I take it that the reference is to the fact that the fortuithat, to us excess of receipts over expenditure for the three years that preceded the statistics current financial year WAS not, applied in reduction of the accumulated deficits the preceding years, totalling approxisupplement mately £17,000,000.

Exi'ECTANCY OV LlM : PEBSONAL EXPLANATION-ELIGIBILIT Y FOB OLD AGE PENSIONS.",9
4,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE,"In this morning's issue of the Canberra Times, the following paragraph appearsReplying to Sir Donald Cameron, the MinBell) ister tor Health (Mr Hughes) said in the House of Representatives yesterday that be had investigated the published statement that ex-soldiers, as a class, died rather earlier than those who had always been civilians. His information, however, showed that the average age of both at death waB 49 years. The propagation of statements that war service caused invalidity had a serious effect on the minds of those who had undergone serviee. His information also showed that the diseases from which ex-soldiers died were similar tu those suffered by civilians. That paragraph completely misrepresents what yesterday I said at some length in this House. Ou the previous day the honourable member for Lilley (Sir Donald Cameron) had asked me the following questionIn view ot a recent statement by the Chairman of the Repatriation Commission, Colonel Semmens, that statistics definitely prove that expectancy of life by ex-sailors and ex-soldiers has not been affected hy war service, is the Minister for Repatriation in a position either. to confirm or deny this assertion? I repliedMy attention has been drawn to the statereferred to, but I am not in a position m'ake any comrneiii: upon it beyond saying that it does not commend itself to me. I bave However, I propose to institute inquiries with a view to ascertaining by an analysis of the and by a review of the whole of the facts, whether the expectancy of life for men of the Australian Imperial Force has been as-the result of their war service. say Yesterday I supplied the honourable member for Lilley with certain information furnished to me by Colonel Semmens, and addedI think it inadvisable to offer any comment beyond that which I made yesterday, namely, taking a general view, I do not agree with the opinions put forward, but as I have not yet had an opportunity to probe the from which these somewhat remarkable deductions are drawn, I ask the honorof able member to allow me further time to what I have now said. Subsequently, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn) asked me the the Governfollowing question:Does not the Minister for Repatriation considor that the latest statement by Colonel Semmens, that returned soldiera who haa died had an average age the same as that of those who had not gone to the war, proves the incorrectness of his previous statement that the expectancy of life of ex-soldiers had not been reduced? Is it not strange that, if returned men who were passed as fit are dying at the average age of 40-i years, ihe average death age of those who for the most part were rejected as unfit for service should be the same ? I repliedMy attention was not drawn to the previous remark by Colonel Semmens, but it would appear to be reasonable to deduce from later statement that a war might be regarded aa a kind of health resort, and that the to prolong life, was to go to war. However, I shall look into the matter. I desire to repeat that this newspaper paragraph completely misrepresents what I said. It is perfectly true that I did not commit myself; but no one could posGovernment sibly deduce fro m what I said, or f r the surrounding circumstances, that I gave any support whatever to the statealthough ment made by Colonel Semmens. I said quite plainly that I was entirely opposed to it .",9
5,Mr MCEWEN,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE,"Following upon the statement made by the Minister for intervention Eepatriation I desire to ask him whether, if his investigations show that the expecfrom tancy of life in the case of ex-soldiers less than in the case of civilians who have not seen active service he will use his undoubted influence with the Government to secure an amendment of the Old-age Pensions Act making ex-soldiers eligible to receive an old-age pension on reaching the age of 55 years?",10
6,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE,"Tb e honourable memister ber's question is on the border-line policy, but I may say that inquiries being made along the lines suggested by him. If it is found that the expectancy of lif e is materially shortened by war vice, one of the remedies would appear to be a reduction of the age at which exreceived, soldiers and sailors may qualify for an old-age pension. I am sure the honourable member will realise the magnitude of subject, and that it would be improper f me at this stage to make any further comit ment upon it . MELBOTJBNE AIE - POE T. Mr FAIEBAIEN "" - H as the Minister for Defence any information concerning negotiations with the Government of toria in regard to the proposal to develop the Fishermen's Bend site as an airport with unemployment relief moneys?",10
7,Mr AECHDALE PABKHILL,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE," This matter has been raised in the House on several occasions, and the view has been expressed that the project was one that was entitled to favourable consideration. Communications were opened up with the Premier of Victoria, as the land 'is held by the State Government. The the Commonwealth made an offer to that Government to assist in a survey of the way position and in the development of a scheme. In order that there might be no misunderstanding, a further letter was sent to the effect that it was neither the intention nor the desire of the Commonwealth to acquire the land if the State wished to retain it , but that o m the scheme could be developed and perhaps ultimately brought to f r u it i o n the land still remained the property of the State. The correspondence was acknowledged, and the Commonwealth was advised that the matter was being inquired into. I believe that the of the State elections in Victoria has prevented further consideration being given to it . I propose again is to direct the attention of the Premier of Victoria to the proposal, - with a view to arriving at finality in one way or another as speedily as possible. ' BUTTEE EXPOETS. Mr E . GEEEN - Has the Acting Prime Minister, in his capacity as M in for Commerce, received from the of Dair y Produce Control Board the recomare mendation that certain butters usually regarded as first-class shall be stamped with the national brand, as is the case at serpresent with choicest grades of butter? If such a recommendation has been will be say whether it has been given his ministerial approval? Will he consider an alteration of the personnel the of the board, seeing that Victoria has a o r predominating influence upon it , and that is mainly in Victoria that the trouble in regard to lower grade butters is experienced ?",10
8,Dr EAELEPAGE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE,"I have not received officially any recommendation from the Dair y Produce Control Board, but I Viehare noticed in the press a statement similar to that which the honourable gentieman has just made. I may say that the whole question regarding the method of standardizing quality and of control of the dairying industry is to be one of the matters considered at a conference of all dairying interests to be held in Sydney on the 13th April next. MOTOE-BODY PANELS. Mr E. J. HABBISON - Has the' must be checked. attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs been drawn to a statement Sydney Sunday Sun, of the 10th March last, that General Motors-Holden's Ltd. has paid a dividend of 24 per cent, in last twelve months, and that there is little doubt that the profits for 1934 in excess of a threefold cover? Is he a-ware that, notwithstanding the supthe posedly low prices of bodies supplied distributors, the profit made last year be in the vicinity of £400,000? Does know that, despite that excessive profit, the company has increased its prices bodies by from 11 per cent, to 17 cent. ? If he has not a knowledge of facts, will he give consideration to these excessive profits when discussing with Gabinet the report of the Tariff Board motor-body panels?",10
9,Mr WHITE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE,"I have not seen the statement to which the honourable gentlemember man has referred, nor do I know whether the company made either profits or. losses in previous years. AU these matters were investigated when the Tariff Board its inquiry into motor-body panels. Doubtless the financial position company was taken into account. Mr E. J. HAKBISON - There was no consideration of this year's profits.",11
10,Mr WHITE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE,"I have no doubt that the Tariff Board would have before it trading accounts for the year, and that the matter of prices t,o competitors would be investigated. These factors will be taken into consideration by the Governmeans ment when making its decision. NA COMMENT.",11
11,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,"Hon. G. J. Bell) I wish to make some observations upon a growing practice in connection with the asking of questions without notice. Honnot orable members frame their questions in such a way as to indicate clearly their own point of view. The question just asked is of that type. The object of questions, is to elicit information, and they should not be framed in such a way as to convey the personal opinion of the questioner, nor should they contain argument. I have referred to the matter because the practice is a growing one, and in the EESTEICTIONS ON AUSTBALIA N EXPOETS.",11
12,Mr LAZZARINI,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,"Has the attention the of the Acting Prime Minister been drawn very to a statement made in Sydney by the were Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), just before leaving for England, that the Leader of Opposition in the New South Wales to Parliament, Mr Lang, was on the wrong will track when he declared that outside inhe fluences were being brought to bear to restrict the marketing of Australian proof ducts overseas? Seeing that the Acting per Prime Minister in his policy speech these said that sueh restrictions would be resisted to the last ditch by his party, and that the Prime Minister himself quite on recently declared that they must be (strenuously resisted, and having regard also to the fact that not an honourable on the Government side of the House will declare himself in favour of such restrictions, ""will the right honourable gentleman say what, other than outside made influence, is responsible for them?",11
13,Dr EARLE PAGE,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,"It seems to of the me that the honourable member has endeavoured to answer his own question and that in putting it he has succeeded in setting out his own point of view, despite the objection to such a course the taken by Mr Speaker a few moments ago. The Government is resisting all restrictions, by every means within its power. Ef the Opposition can suggest any further of resisting them the Government will be pleased to have its assistance - As to the forces that arc bringing about the restriction of our exports honourable members can judge for themselves who and what they are.",11
14,Mr AECHIE CAMEEON,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,I ask the Minister for Commerce whether it is a fact that the Opposition is not prepared to grant to Great Britain and other countries the absolute freedom to export to this country which it is asking for our exports to those countries.,11
15,Dr EARLE PAGE,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,Judgin g by its actions the Opposition is not prepared to do that.,12
16,Mr FORDE,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,"Since the Acting Prime Minister bas shown his readiness to join in the gibe at the Opposition because it is not prepared to allow unrestricted imports from Great Britain to Australia, will he state whether he himself is prepared to allow imports from Great Britain to come into this countrj free of all restrictions 1",12
17,Dr EARLE PAGE,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,The policy 1I have always observed is well known to every honourable member of this House.,12
18,Mr HOLLOWAY,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,Does the Acting Prime Minister think that the efforts now being made by organizations outside Australia to restrict the exports of Australian primary products are in complete accord with the Ottawa Agi'eement?,12
19,Dr EARLE PAGE,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,"Differen t parts of the Empire are parties to the Ottawa Agreement, whereas the pressure to restrict exports comes from outside the Empire. Every action so far taken by Great Britain has been within the scope of the Ottawa Agreement. OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",12
20,Mr JENNINGS,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,"Is the Acting Treasurer aware that a claimant, born in Australia 60 years ago, who has lived in this country for 45 years, but has spent the last five years in Norfolk Island, has been declared ineligible for a pension because of his residence on that island, although it is under Australian control ?",12
21,Mr CASEY,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,"It is a fact that a claimant for a pension must be resident in Australia. I do not know the actual facts of the case referred to by the honourable member, but if he will supply them to me I shall be glad to have them investigated.",12
22,Mr GANDER,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,"Can the Acting Treasurer indicate the date from which the increase in invalid and old-age pensions, consequent upon the rise in the cost of living, will operate? As the cost of living has been going up over a period of months prior to the 1st January, will the Government confer a much deserved benefit on pensioners by making the increase operative as from the 1st January ?",12
23,Mr CASEY,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,TJnde r the terms of the act if the increase comes about-and it appears now to be quite certain that it will-it will become operative as from the 1st July next. The Government regrets that it cannot make the increase retrospective.,12
24,Mr GANDER,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,"In view of the fact that the Government proposes to increase the old-age pension by 6d. per week, will the Minister see that the inmates of institutions get the additional 6d., and that it is not paid to the institution ?",12
25,Mr CASEY,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,"When , unfortunately, it was necessary to reduce the amount of the pension some time ago, that reduction was, I think, made in the amount paid to the institution for pensioner inmates. If my memory serves me aright, the institutions now receive 2s. a week less than formerly in respect of each pensioner inmate. In those circumstances I think that the honourable member himself will agree that, if there is to be a slight increase of the pension, it should go to the institution.",12
26,Mr WATKINS,QUESTIONS CONTAININ G,Has the Government yet considered the advisability of excluding the pension received by the mother of a deceased soldier when calculating the income for old-age pension purposes ?,12

33,Dr EARLE PAGE,OHARGES FOR POSTAL BOXES AT,"The examination was on lines exactly similar to those folducted lowed by both our Labour and nonthat Labour predecessors in office.

43,Dr EARLE PAGE,OHARGES FOR POSTAL BOXES AT,"I think that it most people know that the officer who undertook the inquiry on behalf of the Government is Mr Townsend, of the Trade and Customs Department. The concluding remark of the honourable - member is an insult to this Parliament.",13

The Granites, under conditions which certainly constitute an evasion of the industrial laws of the territory.

In this case the clear intention is an exploitation of the labour of youths, and the imposition of conditions that definitely evade industrial laws. According to Mr Lowe, an authorized agent for Mr Chapman at Port. Adelaide, and responsible, I understand, to Mr. Chapman for the recruiting of a certain number of lads and young men, the proposal is that'they shall receive a wage of £2 a week, and that, it shall be increased cmarterly by 5s. a week un til such time as the amount becomes equivalent, to the basic wage set down for Western Australia. Surely this Government will not countenance, such a proposal! There are awards which apply to miners, as well as a basic rate for the Northern Territory, and the Government should see that tliese rates are duly observed. It, should use all the power at its disposal to discourageany action which would contravene industrial laws.. The basic wage for the territory awarded, by Judge Drake-Brockman is £4 10s. 3d. a week, and there is a special award of 2s. OJ-d. an hour for those engaged in mining operations. The ages at which these young men are to be rerruited show that a, number of them will he entitled to the adult rate applying to the territory. Starting at £2 a week, they will receive quarterly increases, as I have said, until they are paid the basic rate, not of the Northern Territory, but of Western Australia. The evasion, it, appears, is not. merely to be at the outset; at no time can they expect to receive the wages to which they will be lawfully entitled in the Northern Territory; because in Western Australia the federal basic wage is only £3 8s. a week. Since these young men will be engaged in mining operations, they will be entitled to marginal increases over the basic award rates. The rate for mining operations is 2s. Ofd. an hour. These men will have to face the hard work of mining life. Mr Chapman has indicated that tliey must be prepared for tough experiences, so his intentions are quite clear. It is highly dangerous to put a man such as he in a position in which he will have power to prevent these youths from returning to the railhead at Alice Springs, if they are dissatisfied with their conditions of employment.  correct.",17
82,Mr MAKIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"I understand that they are required to give an undertaking that they will remain in the territory for at least twelve months.  gram from Mr Chapman, who says, "" Statements made by Mv. Makin and Mr. Lacey that youths sign twelve months agreement incorrect. Youths able to leave at any time.""",17
83,Mr MAKIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"Then let us deal with that position. To the best of my belief I have not stated that they must actually sign an agreement, but they will ba required to give an undertaking to remain for at least twelve months and that is quite the equivalent. These young men will have to travel by rail to Alice Springs nt their own expense or with Government assistance. Mr Chapman will then provide transport, I understand, from Alice Springs to The Granites, a distance of a little under 400 miles. What, means would these youths have of returning from The Granites to Alice Springs, unless Mr Chapman were willing to convey them back? They would perish in any attempt to make the journey themselves. This matter must arouse definite feelings of concern on the part of those who wish to see these young men properly protected. This is a clear case of exploitation. The young men are to be maintained by Mr Chapman at a charge of 22s. 6d. a week, and this amount must be provided, either by arrangement with the Government, or out of the £2 a week to be paid by way of wages. Mr Chapman has charge of the store at The Granites, and he the sole person from whom supplies can be secured. The fare provided will no doubt be of the meanest character, the proposed charge for keep is a ridiinto culous one. At the end of their period of service these young men will no doubt find that they are in debt to Mr Chaphome man. It is particularly desirable Government sliould not countenance the enterprise in view of the fact that the inbringing dustrial laws of the territory are to be evaded. I have never met Mr Chapman, while and there is no personal difference be Mr Anderson addstween us, but I am intensely desirous that we should do our utmost to protect and 150 safeguard our youths from exploitation, and maintain for them the wage rates and working conditions provided by the approful priate legal tribunals set up by this liament to determine such matters. I challenge honourable members generally to show their willingness to co-operate i achieving tliese ends by ensuring that proper conditions shall be observed regard to any work that is done at The Granites. The Minister for the Interior has intivision mated that he intends t.o visit, The Granites during the coming recess. That being so, I ask that his approval to the proposal of Mr Chapman, shall be hold until he has visited the locality personally investigated it. I understand should that Mr Chapman has his own aeroplane at The Granites, and he would doubtless our young manhood. facilitate an early visit by the Minister for this purpose. It. is highly desirable that proper accommodation shall be provided for men who go to The Granites to work, and the health and well-being of any young men who go there should be a particular concern of the Government. Certain formation that has reached us from persons acquainted with the conditions The Granites gives every cause for disassist. prospectors satisfaction as to the prospects of young men who may go there. Mr Chapman's proposal has been severely criticized by Mr T. Anderson, a gentleman who had wide experience in the district. Anderson was for seven years a prospector and dingo scalper in that area, and also associated with several geological peditions as well as with the land search party for the lost airmen, Anderson and is Hitchcock. His remarks make it abundantly clear that unless very careful provision is made to protect the physical and and moral well-being of young men who go that area disaster is likely to overtake them. One statement in particular by Mr Anderson, which should bring to us the seriousness of this aspect that the of the subject, is as follows:Tho health-shattering climate and conditions, on dysentery, barcoo rot, and enteric, can scarcely bo withstood by hardened miners, the half-caste problem is beyond control. 1 guarantee that if these lads go out there, per cent, will return morally and physically broken for the rest of their lives. The outlook is so serious that very careinvestigation should be made before Parany proposal of the kind is approved by the Government. I earnestly request the Minister to promise that in the interests "" of our young men be will not in any way encourage Mr Chapman's project until in he has made a personal visit to The Granites, and satisfied himself that every condition essential to the maintenance of correct industrial standards, and the proof health and medical comforts, as well as suitable accommodation, and protection from other influences peculiar to the Northern Territory, will be assured withto any young men who go there. and Nothing less should satisfy us. ""We not sanction any evasion of our industrial laws or a cruel exploitation of  ter for the Interior) [11.35],-Honor any able members will recollect that some little time ago Parliament voted £333,000 for the purpose of assisting goldmining and providing for greater inemployment in the industry. Of that total £50,000 was made available for at the Northern Territory to be used to there to| bore for water-in which connection something has already been done at Tennant's Creek-to construct roads, to give access has to mining fields, and also to make Mr advances to mining companies to enable t.hem to provide additional employment. was Applications from two companies, the exGolden Dyke Gold-mining Company and the Pine Creek Enterprise Company, have already been granted. Provision is made in the agreement with each company that additional employment, under conditions satisfactory to the department, shall be guaranteed. Tentative arrangements have recently been made for an advance up to £3,000 to Messrs. Chapman & Son, of The Granites, on a £1 for £1 basis, for the purchase of a large battery, over which the department will hold a bill of sale as a security for the repayment of the advance from the gold recovered from the battery; and also for the employment of an additional 30 men, making 50 in all. Mr Chapman, like all other participants in these advances, will be required to conform to the wages rates and conditions ruling in the territory. This surely is a complete answer to the part of the honourable member's complaint which related to wages and conditions. A new award has recently been made for the territory, which, although not yet given general application, may quite possibly be made a common rule, in which case Mr Chapman will, of necessity, be required to conform to it. Mr Chapman's scheme for the employits ment of youths at The Granites is his own conception, and my department not directly connected with it ; but understand that it is by no means new experiment, for Mr Chapman has been employing youths there for the last twelve months with, I understand, satisreads as follows:factory results. He has a substantial equipment at The Granites, which includes several small batteries, eight petrol Youths and crude oil engines, four trucks, two utility trucks, three cars and a good .deal of otlier equipment. He also has his aeroplane and a wireless transmitting and receiving set, so that communications may be sent to and received from the mine.",17
84,Mr MAHONEY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,How many perienced miners has he on the mine ?  honourable member for Hindmarsh seemed to be somewhat apprehensive as to to the dangers and temptations that Anderson might meet young men who go into that locality for work. I may that there is no liquor licence at The Granites. It would be impossible for outpostCallander young men to obtain liquor there withhuts out having it transported over considerslept able distances and from my personal knowledge of Mr Chapman I know that he is very keen on preventing youths who go to work on the mine from becoming the victims of drink. He realizes the dangers of life in that part of the Northern Territory.,19
85,Mr ROSEVEAR,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,Is that why he wants to keep down the wages?  of the tentative agreement that he must adhere to the wages and conditions provided in the appropriate awards.,19
86,Mr SCULLIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"Is there no foundation for the statements that have been made about the payment of a wage of £2 a week?  thing on that point except that the agi'eement will provide for the observance of award rates and conditions. It will be generally admitted, I think, that the provision of employment for youths constitutes one of the biggest problems that we have to face, and any person who can make a contribution to solution, even if such action be profitable to himself, is rendering a good seris vice to the community. The telegram I that I have received from Mr Chapa man in reply to statements that have been made as to the conditions of work at The Granites should be reassuring. It Statements made Makin Lacey that youtha sign twelve months agreement incorrect Stop able leave at any time. In reply to the views of Mr Anderson, own which the honourable member for Hindmarsh quoted, I direct attention to the following statements which appeared in the Melbourne Herald of the 13th March which, I suggest, should carry at least equal weight to those quoted by the exhonorable memberMr J. A. Callander, 19, of St. Kilda, who employed at The Granites for six months last year, as a batteryman, said today in reply criticism of the "" health shattering"" conditions at The Granites made by Mr T. yesterday, that life as a miner there was fully as pleasant and as healthy as on inform him any Victorian field. Living conditions on The Granites, Mr. said, were remarkably good for an of civilisation. The men lived in tin and cooked from open fire places. They on comfortable camp stretchers. Although the summer temperatures frequently rose to 110 and 115 deg. the humidity was low, and the heat easy to bear. At night there was always a welcome cool change that demanded thick sleeping rugs. STORE ON FIELD. Foodstuffs, Mr Callander added, were supplied at a store specially established for the convenience of miners by the owner of the fields, Mr Chapman. PriGes were the same as those charged in capital cities, phis freight charges, which were heavy. He supplied the following table of charges for provisions:Tinned meats, Is. 9d. a lb. t in ; ; flour 18s. Gd. a 50 lb. bag; jam, 2s. a lb. tin; honey, 2s. Gd. a lb. t in ; potatoes and onions, Od. to lOd. a lb., salmon Is. 3d. a small tin. Our water supply is drawn from a bore, 179 feet deep, ho said, and during my six months on the fields there were no cases of dysentery. There is ample water for drinking, cooking and washing. The miners have all the recreation they want with cards, shooting and an occasional concert. The greatest advantage, lie claimed, for Tho Granites over Victorian fields was the higher rates of pay. This is an expression of opinion of a man who has heen to' The Granites as Mr . Anderson claims to have been.",19
87,Mr MAKIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"Is there any reason why this matter should not be delayed u n t i l the Minister has personally visited the district ?  that in a moment. The honourable member for Hindmarsh suggested that young men going to The Granites would be in danger of suffering moral deterioration. That is, I suggest, a danger to which .young men in the cities anxious to obtain employment and unable to get it are just as much exposed. If I had a son who was unable to obtain work in the big centres of civilization I should prefer that he went to the Northern Territory and did what he could to secure it there rather than suffer the moral deterioration which must ensue from enforced idleness in the cities. I refuse to believe that there are no young men in Australia with sufficient back-bone to stand up to the difficulties that may beset them without being in danger of moral deterioration.",20
88,Mr MAKIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,But why expose them to it?  men always to be tied to someone's apron strings ?,20
89,Mr MAKIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"But it is not for the M in ister to expose them unnecessarily.  to do so. All that the Department is doing is to provide the means whereby this mining concern may purchase additional machinery which will ensure more employment. It is, I am sure, not»only the desire of the Government, but also that of the Opposition that additional employment shall be afforded to men and youths at the earliest possible moment. That is an answer to at least some of the points raised by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. The honourable member has further suggested that the whole matter should await my visit to the Territory and has RECREATION. asked, "" Why this haste?"" We are all anxious to lose no time in providing additional employment - We should do everything to provide that additional employment at the earliest possible moment. In fact the honourable gentleman himself has often spoken most eloquently of the necessity for avoiding delay in the provision of work from funds provided by the Parliament.",20
90,Mr SCULLIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,Does the Minister approve of the payment of £2 a week to these youths?  prove of the Government making an advance to a mining concern which did not adhere to the awards.,20
91,Mr SCULLIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"But apart from the advance proposed to be made, has not the Government other responsibilities in that regard ?  measure of responsibility and that point wil l be settled before very long when the question of making a common rule for the Northern Territory is decided.",20
92,Mr SCULLIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"Is there an award for the Northern Territory?  that is not a common rule. The right honourable gentleman knows the limita tions that operate in the States' spheres with respect to the making of a common rule by the Arbitration Court. I do not pretend to be a lawyer, but in the sphere of federal jurisdiction, for instance in federal territory, these limitations do not apply, and it is possible for the court to make a common rule if it so desires.",20
93,Mr MAKIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"There is a mining award.  would apply only to employers cited in the award. I understand that the question as to whether the award shall be made a common rule or not is at present under consideration by the judge. However,' I give honourable members this assurance: whether the award is made a common rule or not, the attitude of the department will not be affected; this advance will be conditional upon award rates being paid.",21
94,Mr BEASLEY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"West Sydney) [11.50]. - Every honourable member will agree that it, is desirable that employment should be found for the youths of this country; but side by side with that desire is the anxiety of every honourable member to prevent anything being done that might tend to facilitate the exploitation of the youths so employed. Yet, obviously, that very thing is contemplated under this Chapman scheme.  answered that charge.",21
95,Mr BEASLEY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"- I do not think so. The Minister has merely said that award rates will be observed, whereas it is common knowledge among those associated with industrial organizations that proper protection is not always provided in awards to cover the employment of juniors, with the result that many employers employ youths on work previously done by adults and pay a rate of wage equivalent, to one-half and less of the adult rate.  special provision is being made for the payment of certain rates to youths of certain ages. Mr E. J. HAKRISON - Does the honourable member suggest that certain classes of work should be done by men only and should not be touched by youths?",21
96,Mr BEASLEY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"No ; but we all know the part machinery is playing in industry. TJnder mass-production methods, youths are employed in, say, the operation of drilling machines and stamping machines, and so on, to such an extent that this class of work is done almost exclusively by juveniles. Tbey have displaced the adults-me n with wives and families to keep. This exploitation is being carried on to sueh an extent in some industries in Sydney that boys and youths are being called upon to work overtime three or four nights a week as well as Saturdays, and are receiving only about Is.' 6d. or 2s. a week extra for the additional half-day's work. Something should be done to stop this practice. Therefore, whilst anxious to see something done for young men, we must, at the same time, see that the unscrupulous employer is not allowed to "" get away with it "" . A system of the employment of juveniles pro rata to the number of adults employed should be adhered to. The proposals of Mr Chapman savour a good deal of the methods of the unscrupulous employer operating as I have just described under arbitration awards. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) has made a very reasonable request, and I suggest that the Minister for the Interior might examine the aspects of the case as the honourable member presented tbem; because I am sure the Minister is not aware of the dangers that may be ahead. Without intending .any discourtesy to him, I remind him that his associations have not, in the main, been with industry in its secondary sense; he has not dabbled very much with awards and conditions. All honourable members have their own particular avenues of effort in life. They cannot be expected to have a knowledge of all things. Employers associated with industry know all the ins and outs of the awards and are working out in every conceivable way methods of defeating their purpose. I believe that Mr Chapman is doing this. The next point which I desire to make is the fact that the Government proposes to provide a £1 for £1 advance.  back.",21
97,Mr BEASLEY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"It may not be paid back if, subsequently, a position arises which renders the repayment impossible.  ning some risk in order to secure more employment ?",21
98,Mr BEASLEY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"I do not complain about that. It is impossible to achieve anything without being prepared to take some risk. We may have a repetition of what occurred in respect of the guarantees made to Messrs. Chambers & Treganowan in connection with the shale oil industry in New South Wales. Things do not always work out to the programme laid down. The Minister should examine this question from the - angle of the - views expressed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh and from what I have tried to supplement in reference to the extent of the exploitarealizing tion going on in regard to the employment of youths. The Minister seemed to rely on the fact that the existence of award conditions disposed of the whole matter. In answer to that I say that Mr Chapman could still carry on a form of exploitation despite the award, which I do not think the Minister would approve, particularly as the Government has been called upon to finance the venture. Mr E. J. HABBISON (Wentworth) [11.57] - I have listened with interest to the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) in regard io the exploitation of youths by Mr Chapman. I think honourable members can agree with him in the main that mass production methods in the cities, brought about by the scientific advancement of machinery, have resulted in a certaiu amount of exploitation in the employment of youths. But drastic action applied individually is not a cure. Effective action can be accomplish ed only by dealing with these matters collectively, and only then by a re-orientation of our employment position, such for instance as a reduction of working hours. In any case we should not look askance upon any individual attempt to give employment to youths in order to keep them away from the temptations of city life while  son) has effectively answered the argument put up by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), and I am perfectly satisfied with his reply. He has already outlined the fact that an vance on a £1 for £1 basis would be made with definite specific objects and subject to the payment of award rates and conditions. Mr Chapman, the man concerned, has been described iri various ways by honourable members. We are told on the one hand that he is exploiting youths, yesterday we were told that be was a "" claim-jumper "" and a "" go-getter."" I do not know him, but I think that with respect to The Granites gold-field, he has shown tenacity of purpose which should be recognized. When, following the remarkable boom at The Granites some time ago, the value of the shares dropped from £85 to 4d. within a few days, it seems to me that Mr Chapman, the damage thai; had been done, concentrated his best efforts at The Granites with the object of bringing about the rehabilitation of the industry there. He has taken labour from the capital cities to The Granites, and I have never heard any adverse report from those who have gone with Chapman and returned. Rather have I heard that those who have once accompanied him are prepared to do so again, being satisfied with the conditions prevailing there. He has succeeded in re-establishing The Granites as a gold-mining area, and is winning ever-increasing quantities of gold.  of gold out of the area last year. Mr E. J. HARRISON - All this publicity will not do The Granites gold-field or the Northern Territory as a whole any good. In the last paragraph of the Madigan report the following occurs:The whole boom was a tragedy, and not the least pity of it is that the Northern Territory has received an undeserved setback as far as prospecting is concerned, from which it may take years to recover, though tin's report only concerns a mere patch of the territory. The statements of some honourable members in this House tend to throw undeserved suspicion on the Northern Territory as a gold-mining area, and that such suspicion in regard to The Granites is undeserved is evident from the quantities of gold which Chapman is obtaining. No doubt conditions are hard, but those who go there do not expect feather beds, or the amenities of the city, and there is nothing which will harm the youth of ad- Australia. . I have no doubt that even worse conditions have been faced and overcome by prospectors in other parts of Australia in their search for gold. The young men who go to The Granites field will learn a lesson in fortitude, and will, as the result of their experience, be and fitted to take their place in the life of the nation. It is definitely better for them that they should go on the goldfields than that they should hang about the streets receiving the dole, and suffering that gradual demoralization which a life of that kind too often involves. I have no doubt that the wage of £2 a week, less sustenance, which they are to receive will be supplemented by a share of the gold they help to win. However, whether that is so or not, the conditions must be agreeable to the men, because, as I have said, those who have worked on the field at one time are prepared to return. This applies to university men and others, who have expressed their willingness to return to the realistic conditions which prevail in Central Australia. I commend the Minister for his statement on the subject, and I believe that he is doing everything in his power to see that award conditions are observed. We have heard a great deal about award conditions; but may I remind honourable members opposite that, in the capital cities at the present time, many industrial awards are being violated with the unofficial consent of the unions concerned. The officials of those unions know that, if they objected, the rank and file of the unions might take a hand in the proceedings. Why, therefore, do we hear so much about this particular award? agree that, the Government should not be a party to the wilful breaking of an award : but the Minister has answered all objections on that score.",21
99,Mr SCULLIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"Yarra) [12.5] - I do not think that any objection can be taken to the statement of the Minister for the  went,; but something was left unsaid about which we should be given an assurditions ance. The Minister said that the adman vances proposed to be made under a tentathe tive agreement with this mining proprietor will be conditioned by a requirement that the industrial .awards operating in the territory shall be observed. That is all right. He went on to say that the arrangement regarding the employment of youths from 18 to 24 years of age was that there should be additional employment. As far as that goes, that also is satisfactory. Then he said that the arrangeinents regarding the employment of youths are a matter for Mr Chapman.  youths.",23
100,Mr SCULLIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"Yes , and their payment. ",23
101,Mr SCULLIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"I understood that the Minister did. The one thing lacking from the Minister's statement was an assurance that the Government would see that the award for mining in the Northern Territory would be observed. He said, merely that a condition for the advancing of the money was that the awards should be observed, but there was noundertaking that, with or without a subsidy, the awards would be enforced. I am not here to prejudffe this case, and I shall be satisfied if the Government will state that any employment given, whether as the result of a subsidy or not, shall be in the terms of the award. I have here a telegram-of which, I understand, the Minister for the Interior has received a copy-fro m the secretary of the North Australian Workers Union. It is as followsPress reports state Commonwealth decided subsidize pound for pound basis £5,000 battery for Granites gold-fields and Chapman owner arranging f if t y young men aged 18 to 24 I to go Centralia learn prospecting mining £2 week rising 5s. quarterly until reach Westralian basic wage. There is recently made mining award Northern Territory observance of which my union claims should be made conditional subsidy granted as he notorious exploiter of inexperienced workers. My union strongly protests as Chapman's wage, view cost living and living conditions and extreme hardships, grossly inadequate. Wired above Minister Interior. Glad your assistance - Toupein , secretary North Australian Workers Union. I do not know anything about the conobtaining there. I met Mr Chaponce, when he was on his way from territory, and he impressed me as a man of great efficiency and enterprise, who was doing considerable work at The Granites, and was bringing much ingenuity to bear on his task. In my company he expressed a desire to provide an opportunity for the young men of Australia to go out to the territory prospecting. To the extent of that conversation he impressed me, and I agreed that it - would be a help if he were able to do what he said, but I join in the protest of otlier honourable members if , on the pretence of helping the youth of Australia, he is really exploiting them. If there is work to be done by young men in far - distant places like The Granites the least we can ask is that the Government shall see that award conditions are observed. I am not impressed when honourable members speak of these youths as inexperienced, and therefore not deserving of full award wages. A youth of eighteen years of age, if physically fit, can do work of a mature man in the mines. I , myself, worked for a short while in the mines when I was eighteen years of age, and I did the work of a man, and received the wages of a man. It is true that these youths will not have the knowledge and - experience of older prospectors, but it is not intended that they shall spend all their time prospecting; they are also to be employed in the mines. The honourable member for Wentworth { Mr E. J. Harrison) said that, no doubt, these young men will receive a share of the gold won, but does he know that for a fact? It may be quite true, but we have had no assurance to that effect, and it is a matter which can be quickly resolved if the Minister will make inquiries. There has grown up in the mining industry a practice which provides for a system of - sharing between the miners and the proprietors. The miners receive a certain wage which is supplemented by a share of the gold obtained.",23
102,Mr BLAIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,That is the system in operation in the territory.,24
103,Mr SCULLIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"No doubt it is a fair system, provided the agreement is properly safeguarded, but it is liable to abuse. Under that method we. had the tributing system in the Ballarat and Bendigo mines, and it constituted the worse form of Commonwealth sweating. However, in the present case, we know nothing for certain beyond the fact that these youths are to receive £2 a week, with certain stipulated increments.",24
104,Mr BLAIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,Chapma n is picking the eyes out of country that old prospectors have located for him.,24
105,Mr SCULLIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"I know nothing of that, but we know that these youths are going to work in the mines, and that they will do the work of men. Therefore, they should receive the wages prescribed by the court.",24
106,Mr FAIRBAIRN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"Flinders) [12,13] I address myself to this subject with some diffidence because I cannot claim to be an authority on gold-mining, and I have no first-hand knowledge of the area under discussion. I do not criticize the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) for raising the matter, because a the project of this kind should be watched closely by the Government. Every effort should be made to prevent the exploitation of youths in an original venture of this kind, but I think the honourable member for Hindmarsh went too far in saying that it was a disgraceful thing to take young men of 18 to 24 years of age to The Granites gold-field.",24
107,Mr MAKIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,I did not say that.,24
108,Mr FAIRBAIRN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"The honourable member suggested that they would be exposed to all sorts of moral temptation, and would be in danger of meeting with disaster. In theory, this venture seems to be an extremely good one. I know nothing personally of Mr Chapman, except that he is an adventurous man, possessing original ideas, which he is trying to carry out. Any project which offers an opportunity to young men wbo, through no fault of tlieir own, are out of employment, to go out and learn a calling and develop their characters is worthy of the favourable consideration of the whole community. I remember a similar venture to this being carried out in Victoria on a smaller scale in the early days of the depression. A landowner, appalled by the difficulty which youths were experiencing in finding employment, offered work at £1 a week to five youths from a country town who had never before been in employment, and who seemed to have no prospect of obtaining employment for a long time. The greatest criticism of that venture was that it would be used to exploit youths, although actually they were to be engaged on what was not ordinary station work. As a result of that scheme, however, three out of the five youths engaged have since been in continuous employment, and since they reached the age of 21 have been receiving the basic wage payable to station hands. The experience which they gained made thom not only employable later at the basic wage, but also ""very excellent men at that wage. Thus, thanks to that scheme, three out of those five youths today hav» every reason to believe that life has something to offer them. The other two have not since been in continuous employment, but because of the experience they received under this scheme they have been able to get a considerable amount of intermittent work. The success of that venture illustrates what the proposal now under discussion may hold for these 50 youths. It should have sympathetic consideration, although I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that it and similar schemes should be carefully watched.",24
109,Mr ROSEVEAR,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"Dalley) [12.16] - I have listened attentively to the arguments advanced for and against the proposal to subsidize this mining venture. After hearing some of the speakers one would imagine that Mr Chapman was a modern Simon Legree; on the other hand, the remarks of the Minister and his colleagues suggest that Chapman is a benefactor to the unemployed. One aspect of the employment of labour in this venture has been overlooked. If this gentleman is sincere in his professed desire to provide work to relieve unemployment, there are, scattered throughout Australia, thousands of experienced miners with family responsibilities who would gladly accept this work if, as the Minister said, the promoters are prepared to observe award conditions. In every State there are not only experienced metalliferous miners available for this employment, but also thousands of coalminers who could readily adapt themselves to this class of work provided that the conditions under which they were asked to accept employment were as has been outlined by the Minister. If employment on this work is to be governed by award conditions, which in the Northern Territory include a wage of £4 10s. 3d. a week, the opportunity is open to this gentleman to get thousands of experienced men to do the job without having to exploit boy labour. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) that there seems to be a flaw in the negotiations which have taken place between the Minister and the promotors of this venture, and that, as a result, the way is definitely left open for the exploitation of juvenile labour at £2 a week. Also associated with this scheme is one of the greatest abuses prevalent in the outback country of Australia, viz., that the employer is also the storekeeper. It is all very well for the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison) to recite a romantic story as to how many men return to the outback country for further employment, but I would like to know what opportunity the young men, who will be involved in this scheme, will have to leave Central Australia. They are to be paid only £2 a week, and out of that amout 26s. will be deducted for their keep, leaving a margin of 14s. with which to purchase clothing and other necessaries of life. The Minister stated that the charges for food in that particular area will be at city prices, plus freight charges which are very heavy. Judging by the prices that are usually charged for employees'"" "" keep "" in the cities, and allowing for the probable cost of foodstuffs and other necessaries in The Granites area, not many of the necessaries of life will be provided for 26s. a week. Mr E. J. HARBISON - The Minister said that award wages would be paid.",25
110,Mr ROSEVEAR,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"The Minister certainly said that award rates would be paid to adult employees. I have no doubt about that, but the scheme so far as it involves the transportation of 50 youths to the area, on condition that they receive £2 a week out of which the storekeeper who is also the employer, will retain 26s., is open to exploitation. Mr E. J. HARRISON - The ages of these youths will range from 19 to 24, and a big percentage of them will be over 21.",25
111,Mr LANE,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,The Minister said that there would be only a small proportion of juniors to seniors.,25
112,Mr ROSEVEAR,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"In my view there is, definitely, the possibility of gross exploitation of juvenile labour under this scheme and I cannot accept, what apparently has satisfied the Minister, the mere statement of Mr Chapman, an interested party in the matter, that the charges against him by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) are not corUntil rect. If the statement of Mr Chapman, an interested party, is good enough the Minister, honourable members on this side of the House are content the statement of the secretary of the Australian Workers' Union in his telegram to immaterial. the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) that Mr Chapman is notorious exploiter of labour and any proposal he puts to the Govcertain ernment should be viewed with suspicion until such time as the Minister positively satisfies himself that this gentleman is prepared to carry out his proposal to the speculator. letter. In this case, Mr Chapman's promise is that labour will be employed under award conditions. Any doubt could easily be removed by demanding undertaking from this gentleman that he does employ juvenile labour he will pay them adequate wages. I do not think he has yet given that assurance. Under such circumstances the pious hope of Minister that award wages will be will not be realized, for Mr Chapman can safely give an undertaking to the Minister to observe award conditions then, after having secured the subsidy, employ boy labour at low wages. .",25
113,Mr RIORDAN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,*No employer will award rates to boys in preference to experienced miners.,26
114,Mr ROSEVEAR,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"That is so. As have already pointed out, there are thousands of miners who would eagerly avail themselves of thcopportunity to take this work were Chapman compelled to observe award conditions, and there no necessity for Chapman to embark a benevolent scheme to train youths. knowledge of mining. If Mr Chapman is sincere in the assurances he has given to the Minister as to the conditions that will apply to this work, he should give a definite assurance to the Minister that he pared to absorb some of our unemployed miners; - alternatively, if he desires for benevolent reasons to engage youths, he should undertake to apply to them the same conditions as would apply to adult able members. employees. Unless that undertaking is given, it will be very easy for Mr. Chapman to evade any promise he has made to the Minister, or even the implied made undertaking lie has apparently given that he will observe award conditions. that pointis definitely settled, the Minister should tread very warily before for be grants any public money  to accept is a loan, an advance.",26
115,Mr ROSEVEAR,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"That is quite I contend that before the Minister disburses public money a in any way he should investigate Chapman's bona fides and be absolutely that he will observe award conditions. Otherwise, there will remain a suspicion that juvenile labour is to be exploited solely in the interests of this",26
116,Mr BLAIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"Northern Territory) [12.26] - I support the motion. Yesteran day, when I had spoken on mining if ventures in Arnheim Land and resumed my seat, I thought - I had said enough of personalities to last honourable members quite a while. However, know the ing full well that honourable mempaid bers opposite had no sympathy with the people referred to, I was diffident about raising the matter. I myself did and not know very much about them until they trod on my corns ""a short while ago, and then I felt impelled to deal with them in this chamber. Although pay yesterday I determined to say nothing further on this matter, I am constrained to rise again to support cordially the objections voiced by the honourable memI ber for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin). My only criticism of his speech is that he said too little. Discussing mining in the Northern Territory I feel that I am at a great disadvantage in this House. Yesis terday I learned that there are few men on in this chamber with a technical Certainly soms honourable members have some knowledge of the subject, but most of them have never visited the Northern Territory. I , on the other hand, have had full opportuis prenity to study the situation at The Granites by .virtue of my technical work in that area. Eor that reason, possibly, I speak with a fuller knowledge of the subject than is possessed by other honorThe questions that have arisen with regard to Chapman will have to be dealt with promptly. I admire h'im for his euergy and pertinacity, but he has other characteristics I do not admire. If it were not for him I would not be a member of this House. Having been sent officially to survey the go-getting shows launched by Chapman, who gloriously fooled legions of Australians, this Parliament and the Department of the In terior, I feel I am justified in ventilating some facts concerning him. I will not go into his reputation in connection with Roma oil. Honourable members should be aware of that. I was sent officially, in a hurry, to The Granites from the northern end of the Territory. When I got there found myself humping an 80-lb. theodolite about this inhospitable region, and spending most of my time in surveying what were nothing more than wretched spinifex farms for public companies which had been floated by Chapman, with the aid of the usual stock-intrade of the mining company promoterrich specimens which he had obtained by boring on a leader. He professed to be "" letting the public in on a good thing "". Thousands of pounds were wasted in this venture and it did much damage to mining in the Northern Territory. As a result of my visit to this area I am able to assure honourable members it is an inhospitable country for youths or even for men."" However, I sympathize with the Minister in his troubles in this I, myself, have in mind a scheme for developing this area thoroughly. It will take about two years to carry out. What the territory needs first of all is boring for water. It also needs a cheap aeroplane service, but an adequate supply of water must be the first consideration. I await the day when Australians will honour the memory of Alan Davidson, who, in 1900, travelled by camel team along the 20th parallel of south latitude, with his nearest railway base at Adelaide, 1,000 miles away. In traversing that country Davidson nearly perished, but on his return he expressed the opinion that there was a potential field at Tennant's Creek, and hoped that sufficient money would be found to develop it. His prophecy is coming true today. I have seen £14,000 worth of ore at grass Nr. Blain. from a shaft 5 feet x 3 feet and 40 feet deep waiting for water and battery to treat it. I do not approve of government money being advanced on mining ventures until they are examined and the ore has been estimated by a competent government expert, yet I feel certain of the value of this field. But let me direct the attention of honourable members to this latest scheme at The Granites. The proposal which I would like to see put in hand is preliminary expenditure on Government bores from Tennant's Creek to The Granites and I Tanami, then out north-west through the saucer of No Man's Land, which is surrounded by Marblebar, Hall's Creek, the De Grey River and Port Hedland right to the Indian Ocean. To the east bores should be put down from Tennant's Creek to the Queensland border through Curranalli. Expenditure on this scheme would take about two years, and when completed it would give access to the known auriferous areas in the Northern Territory and make it possible for legitimate miners to develop their different shows. This man Chapman has gone back to The Granites. We all know that there is gold there, but I should like to impress upon honourable members the difference between an ordinary show, which can be worked profitably by a syndicate, and a mine to be developed by a company. I object to what are purely syndicate matter. propositions being foisted on a gullible public as "" mines"" This is what Chapman is doing. He tells a pretty story and has gloriously "" put it over"" the department. Happily, I have been able to attempt, at all events, to prevent him from doing the same thing with the investing public. He has shows and prospects at Burdekin and Big Bunker's Hill, and out to the North he has a number of leases upon which, it is reported, was found a .seven-ounce slug.",26
117,Mr HOLLOWAY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,What is the width of the lode at The Granites?,27
118,Mr BLAIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"I do not know that there is a lode there. It is, I think, simply an injection or residue from a higher area. Further down there are other shows and he has got his hands on to the in also. He has other propositions at Tanami, and I should like to know how much of tad Tanami gold has been mixed with that of The Granites in order to make a better showing of the latter schemes. Mr E. J. HARBISON - Is there some means of determining the characteristics of gold from different areas ?",27
119,Mr BLAIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"I have suggested police supervision, but in the circumstances I suppose that is impossible. It is possible 4o distinguish between gold produced in New Guinea and from other areas, but Tanami is only 65 miles from The Granites. I appreciate the difficulties of the Minister, who has not at his disposal a technical staff to guide him; but I hope that it will not be long before more reliable information is readily available to him when dealing with these matters. I suggest that the proposal made by Mr. Chapman be delayed until more adequate provision is made for water supplies by means of bores so as to make the country more hospitable for prospectors. Mr. Chapman should not be allowed to retain his monopolistic grip on Tanami and The Granites, but the legitimate miners should be allowed to return and take over the properties which they had located and worked. If reasonable provision is made for water supplies, there need be no doubt about the ability of the miners to develop these mining shows.",28
120,Mr ROSEVEAR,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,Does the honourable member think that The Granites is a place for boys of eighteen years of age?,28
121,Mr BLAIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"I do not think it is. What I would impress upon the House is the fact that so many of these mining shows are proposals for syndicates of working miners. They are not mines in the true sense of the word, but unfortunately they are being foisted upon a gullible public as big mining propositions. I hope that honourable member's minds are quite clear with regard to this aspect of the matter. I should like the Minister to stay his hand with regard to Mr Chapman's scheme; but, as I have said, I appreciate his difficulties. Thousands of pounds have been spent on the Golden Dyke as a mine, because it was approved by an authority, and probably there will be similar expenditure at The Granites, despite the fact that as a mine it has been turned down by the authorities, and has been described as a fiasco. A technical examination is not necessary to put the hallmark of science on any venture upon which public money is to be expended. The Government should see that not one penny of public money is expended on these schemes 'before a thorough inspection is made by competent geologists to estimate the ore in sight. Inquiry into a genuine show - can do no harm. It can do nothing but good.",28
122,Mr HOLLOWAY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"Melbourne Ports) [12.37] - The fundamental principle involved in this motion has been missed by previous speakers. I commend the Minister for what he has done to provide finance for the development of the mining industry, but I warn him against the proposal which has been put before his department by Mr Chapman. In the Northern Territory there are scores of people carrying on mining operations who are prepared to pay full award rates. The scheme propounded by Mr Chapman will mean the exploitation of adult labour because there is no guarantee that those who will obtain employment will not be of full adult age. Mr Chapman has given an undertaking to employ 50 youths, but there is nothing to prevent him from employing 50 men .under this scheme, and paying them only half award rates. At the end of twelve months the men will hi entitled to £3 a week, assuming that their wages are advanced by 5s. quarterly as provided for in the agreement.  that Mr Chapman will not get financial assistance from the Government unless he complies with award conditions.",28
123,Mr HOLLOWAY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"I am not blaming the Minister for what he has done, but I warn him not to be a party to this scheme. The argument advanced by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr E. J. Harrison) takes us back to the dark ages in industry. He would favour the employment of cheap labour in connection with any scheme, in the hope, possibly, that when better times come the conditions and pay will improve. Experience has shown that if we lend ourselves to proposals of that nature, we shall never get back to better conditions in industry. Mr E. J. HABBISON - I have not advotable cated cheap wages. The honourable mempany ber is misrepresenting me entirely.",28
124,Mr HOLLOWAY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"The Minister in grappling with one problem-that of the employment of youths-is lending couragement to a proposal that will rise to several other problems of more evil effect than the one which ho seeks to solve. We want to help the developditions ment of the Northern Territory, and. impossible for this I think all honourable members comcarry on. mend the Minister for getting so into his stride. He has begun to dn something, and I hope that he will conthe tinue the good work by making it possible for people to invest money in the Northhappen ern Territory on an equitable and petitive, basis. But I tell him already there is competition amongst labour in the territory, and if he allows one man to employ workers at less than award rates of pay, he will make it possible for other employers to carry on, except on the same conditions. He nine ivould not allow any men to come m from New Guinea or F i j i to give employto ment at less than award rates, so there no reason why a citizen of the Commonkeeper wealth should be allowed to do this. I Mr Chapman is permitted to employ labour under the conditions indicated, he will be breaking the law, because will probably be employing adults at. half award rates of pay. The undertaking is that the wages of these youths will be increased by 5s. a quarter. This means that a young man will have to work for eighteen months at below award rates, whilst otlier employers, in the same territory industry possibly, arc paying full wages to their employees. if the Minister wishes to protect the interests of the employers in the Nortliern Territory, should make the award rates of pay a common rule, as has been done in Cangiven berra. If this were done Mr Chapman or any one else who came forward with scheme for the employment of labour would operate under the same conditions as regards wages. Before I paid a visit to Central Australia a year or two ago, the recognized wages. I negotiated with a company in Collinsstreet on behalf of men employed on the mica-fields, which are not far distant from The Granites. We had a roundconference, and as a result the comconcerned undertook to give employment to a considerable number of men at the agreed-upon rate. We succeeded in getting an award through the court in enVictoria to cover the mica-fields in give Central Australia; but shortly afterwards a group of Italians started work in the same territory, and as award condid not apply to them, it was company to Consequently, this Goquickly vernment had to find a sum of money to enable the stranded miners on mica-field to return to Adelaide and Melbourne. This is what I fear may in connection with The Granites comfield if Mr Chapman's proposal is that endorsed by the Government. There is no need to make so much fuss about recruiting labour outside the imNorthern Territory for the development of mining shows there. It is only about months ago since I sent a wire from Alice Springs to Mr Lyons, urging him give employment to a number of men is at Alice Springs, because the local storeand hotel keeper told me and Mr. f Nelson that they could not afford to carry these people on any longer. It appears that some one had informed the Governhe ment that these men had not been long in the Northern Territory, and were not proper citizens-bu t were, in fact, hoboes and half-castes. I called them together at the hotel, and, after questioning them, learned that all of them had been in the for at least eighteen months, and that only one was a half-caste, and he had an excellent reputation. As a result a telegram signed by Mr N'elson and myself he was sent to the Lyons Government, and shortly afterwards 23 of these men were employment. I assure the Minister that a considerable number of men with a long experience in mining operations are travelling about Central Australia looking for work. Mr Chapman can get experienced miners if he cares to pay The honourable member for ""Wentworth (Mr E. J. Harrison) approves the proposal to send youths to this field. Mr E. J. HARRISON - Yes , under conditions outlined by the Minister.",29
125,Mr HOLLOWAY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"If men are emresults ployed at Tke Granites at one half the wages received by miners engaged on other fields in the locality, they will become dissatisfied, and eventually the Government will have to defray the cost of bringing them back. In endeavouring to. overcome one stacle the Government will encounter other problems the solution of be extremely difficult. We have been informed that £10,000 worth of gold has been recovered from The Granites. ",30
126,Mr JIOLLOWAY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"At Pine Creek and Katherine River where men are employed at award rates gold valued at ten times that amount has been obtained. Mr Br.AtN - At Tennant's Creek, £10,000 wortli of gold has been obtained from a hole ten feet deep, and those controlling the show are not saying anything about it.",30

130,Mr MAHONEY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"Denison) [2.15] - I have listened very closely to the debate. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) deserves commendation for having brought this matter forward, but the Government cannot be congratulated upon the steps it proposes to take to fulfil the promise it made to the electors of Australia that it would look after the interests of the youth of this country. If the prospects of producing gold in large quantities in the north are as good as has been stated, it is not necessary to employ boys on the fields under sweating conditions. I claim that a youth of 24 should bo classified as a man and should enjoy the wages and conditions prescribed for adult labour. If inexperienced boys are employed, the Government should insist upon a certain number of practical miners working with them. That is the case with apprentices in every other industry. The individual to whom reference has been made will be subsidized by the the Government without any guarantee from hirn that employment will be provided for a definite period, or that any will be obtained. Statements of company promoters should be heavily discounted. The Minister for the Interior  taken from the cities and made good citizens. I contend that when they return from the Northern Territory they will obbecome a burden on the nation. I do not favour the employment of boys in which will the mines of Australia.  that anything of the kind is to be done.",30
131,Mr MAHONEY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"Are they to be made alluvial workers ? If they are, they should be sent out with an old prospector who will give them practical tuition, and should be allowed to share in any profits gained from alluvial prospecting. The money that is to be expended in the Northern Territory could, with greater advantage, be utilized in producing the gold that can be mined in Tasmania. I can show the Government expert alluvial gold close to towns in that State, the production of which would give much better results than can be obtained in the interior of Australia. TJnder the industrial laws of this country a youth is classified as an adult worker when he reaches the age of 21 years, and is entitled to award rates of wages. The Government's proposal, however, is to send youths to the Northern Territory, pay thom £2 a week, deduct from their wages £1 5s. or £1 8s. a week for rations, and place tbem under the control of an unscrupulous individual without any chance of getting away; they will either have to work under those conditions or starve. That is a shabby policy. Would any honourable member like his son to be placed in similar circumstances? I would not allow my son to be placed under the* control of one who is described as the most unscrupulous man in Australia. If the. Government has money available for expenditure along these lines, why does it. not put the youths in some of the gold mines of Western Australia under apprenticeship conditions? Is it thought that gold-mining is likely to become a big industry in Australia? It is not. It is a thing of the past. Gold is not needed to carry on the essential work of a nation, and the industry must decline immediately the price of gold drops from its present level, which must happen sooner or later. Yet the Minister for the Interior defends this policy, honourable members invite the House to consider what has been done in the direction of placing boys on farms. Nationalist party in Tasmania adopted a system of slavery when it set boys to learn farming operations at a wage of 5s. a week, working from daylight to dark. Can a boy be made a man in that way?",30
132,Mr STACEY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,He should be left to walk the streets?,31
133,Mr MAHONEY,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"W do not believe in their being left to walk the streets. Our idea is that they should be fitted to undertake work for which nature inhonorable tended them. We contend that the hours of labour should be shortened and the wheels of industry kept moving so that all available labour may be abconsiderations. sorbed. If the Govermnenit advances knowledge money under the conditions here profield, posed, every company promotor will have an open go to take up a "" dud "" show apply for assistance. No steps are being taken to prevent exploitation. It has been practically proved that that is is intended in this case. It is of no to say that the Northern Territory conrights tains gold in large quantities, and that a year or two the boys will be absorbed big mining ventures. Had there been gold there it would have been produced long ago by men who are prepared to invest in any enterprise that is likely to prove profitable. But what else can be expected from the present Government? It has no sympathy with our boys, referred ? because it believes in child labour and in sweating the worker under the most damnable conditions it is possible for human beings to endure. Some honormining able members contend fhat trade union movement should protest. Throughout the ages it has protested against this sort of thing, but the ment of the day, representing as i the financial institutions, has had to do their bidding ond depress the standard of living. That has been the policy of the Government.

139,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"The honourable member cannot draw me off the track. The question of subsidizing the industry has agitated the minds the of governments drawn from all parties during the last few years. I recollect that when the right honourable member Governfor Yarra (Mr Scullin) was at t has the head of a Federal Government, a sum of £5,000 was voted by this Parliament as a grant to Soutb Australia to help a Labour government there to develop the copper-mining industry at Moonta.

140,Mr SCULLIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,They do not say that Moonta.,32
141,Mr AROHIE CAMERON,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"I repeat that the money was practically thrown into the sea. At that time copper had reached the lowest figure in history, while the price of gold was rising to the level. Copper was worth only £27 ton at the smelting works. In connection with that scheme men were employed in Moonta at the princely remuneration 10s. 2d. a day and limited to a maximum of four days work a week by a Labour government imbued with a desire velop the copper-mining industry . Soutb Australia! But let us consider a moment the position of other activities. Let us take that of the fishing industry, organized in the honourable member for Hindmarsh's own electorate, by a Labour Minister in South Australia, whose name their own terms. for the moment I forget. The men and youths employed in the industry are receiving the basic wage; yet I have not heard a word of protest from the position regarding the conditions under which they are employed in what is ally a seafaring venture. ""We to expect from the South Australian Labour party, that in all conditions of employment men shall receive the full basic wage whether the industry can afford it or not. Despite that fact I not heard any protest from the honourable member for Hindmarsh regarding the conditions under which youths are ployed in the Kuitpo colony as well other relief colonies in my electorate members of which are generally known by the collective name of "" feather-bed volutionaries. squatters."" There is no suggestion the honourable member that the basic wage should be paid in connection with those schemes which were set up during the be imposed upon. regime of a State Labour Government and partly during the regime of a Eederal Labour Government.",32
142,Mr SCULLIN,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"""We did not set them up.",32
143,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,UNIVERSIT Y EDUCATION AT,"It would appear, therefore, that honourable members opposite do not suggest that every type of employment-ever y endeavour to reduce unemployment in this community-shal l be conducted in strict accordance with the principle of the basic wage. As I have already mentioned, I have no experience of The Granites field, at but if the Opposition think that Northern Australia can be developed on the principle of the basic wage they are mistaken. It cannot be done. Australia could not have been developed if the principle of the basic wage had been in force from the inception of settlement in highest this country - Honourable members of a the Labour party know that is so.

I shall always stand for reasonable safeguards, so that these young men will not But the Commonwealth has police and mining wardens and other officers in this territory, and surely those officers of the Crown, who have no axe to grind, and nothing to gain from the success or failure of a gentleman named Chapman or any one else, will see to it that citizens who go up there enjoy fair and reasonable conditions. Naturally conditions in the Northern Territory cannot be easy. The man who goes up there to work should not expect to have a feather bed with a carpet at its side. I speak as one wbo has had some experience of the back blocks of this country; I knew nothing of any of our big cities until I entered politics. In the light of my own experience I say that a man who goes into the Northern Territory expecting to receive the basic wage and to enjoy first-class living conditions is either foolish or very green, and the sooner that idea is combated and fought definitely by members on this side of the House the better for the community generally. It is only under conditions that allow of a certain amount of elasticity that we are likely to secure reasonable development in the Northern Territory and other remote parts of the Commonwealth. Before raising a question of this kind, the Opposition should have taken care to see that the records of their own party are not open to attack. There are other points with which I should like to deal, but I shall refrain from doing so in order that other lionorable members may have an oprjortunity to speak t.o the motion.",32

We are not because asking that these men should be vided with feather beds, but that they be paid the award rates to which they are entitled.

Those men were stranded in Sydney in the dungarees in which they left Darwin, and without a penny in their pockets. They were not even able to get the dole, because they had not been in State for six months. That is typical the treatment of unemployed men by Minister some sections of the community. Now the Minister says that he believes in policy whereby youths from the cities shall be sent into the back-blocks. He said that they would be better off there [5] than in the heart of a city. They would, at least, have a home to go to if left in the city. What will be the result if these youths are sent into the interior, as is Would the Minister allow his own son to go there? ..Not on your life! He would first ensure that certain were observed if his own son were concerned. Apparently, in the case in of the sons of other people, the Minister thinks differently; but I remind him that to their parents these youths are as he dear as his son is to him.  that I would rather my son went there North than be without a job in a city.",34

If that be so, is the only place in Australia that has day temperatures ranging up to 115 degrees and cool evenings.

The following paper was presented:Commonwealth and State Ministers-Con ference held at Melbourne, February, 1934, on Constitutional Matters-Proceeding s and Decisions, wit h Appendices. NA (UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF ) BIL L 1935. Motion (by Mr CASET) agreed toThat he have leave to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Loan Appropriation 20 (Unemployment Relief) Act 1934. 36 Bill brought up, and read a first time. 16 SECOND READING. ATES. Mr Casey (Corio-Actin g Treasurer) [2.55] - h y leave- I move-yThat the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this measure is to amend the Loan Appropriation (Unemployment Relief) Act 1934, principally to provide for an additional appropriation of £531,000 for the relief of unemployment. The principal act appropriated a total sum of £1,533,750. The additional appropriations included in this bill totalling £531,000 will increase the total appropriation of the act, as amended, to £2,064,750. The bill provides for the granting of nnancial assistance to the States for forestry to the extent of £322,000, and for the expenditure of £9,000 for this purpose in the Federal Capital Territory. Except in the cases of South Australia and Tasmania, the. assistance granted by the Commonwealth will be on a £1 for £1 basis. As South Australia is already spending a considerable amount on forestry, and the amount to be made available to South Australia, by this bill is not large, the Commonwealth Government, did not insist on a like contribution by the State Government. In the case of Tasmania £5,000 was ithe limit which the Tasmanian Government felt that it could contribute towards this scheme. The amounts to be provided by the Commonwealth for each State, and the State contributions are as follows:New South Wales 50,000 . . Victoria 100,000 . . 100.000 Queensland 30.000 . . South Australia .. 17,000 . Western Australiai 100,000 . . 100,000 Tasmania 25,000 . . Total 322,000 .. The general principles and conditions of the scheme of assistance to the States in respect of forestry include the following :(a) To provide reproductive employment, which will be in addition to other measures for re-employing men, and will ultimately contribute to an increase in the national wealth; (6) Funds made available under the scheme are to be supplementary to thoie funds normally provided by the State for afforestation; (c) Of the total amounts provided by the Commonwealth and the States, 20 per cent, is to be used in absorbing in en> ployment youths under 21 years of age. The scheme is to be administered by a trust consisting of two or more trustees, one of whom is to be appointed by the Commonwealth. This follows the lines of the scheme of assistance to the States in respect of the metalliferous mining industry. This assistance is to cover a period of one year only. The continuance of the assistance on these lines for a second, and possibly a third, year, will be considered wben results of the first year's work become known, by which time the Commonwealth Government will be in a better position to gauge the extent of the funds which can be made available for this and other methods of providing employment. The principal act included as one of it* provisions the appropriation of £200,000 for relief works under Commonwealth departments. This bill provides for an additional £200,000 to be appropriated for the same purpose. The manner in which this amount will be expended is indicated in the schedule to the bill, from which it will be seen that the allocation for works and services of the various departments is as under£ Treasury .. .. .. 6,250 Commonwealth 8t»te Attorney-General's .. 5,050 contribution. eontrlbutlon.

The Commonwealth departmental officers have carefully examined the works proposed to be put in hand, and Cabinet itself has also examined them, so honourable members may rest assured that all the works will be of a useful character; in any event they would need to be put in hand at some future time, but by undertaking them now substantial relief can be given to the unemployed.",35
168,Mr GREGORY,LOA N APPROPRIATION,Hav e the State Governments been consulted regarding the £1 for £1 contribution for the forestry work?,36
169,Mr CASEY,LOA N APPROPRIATION,"Yes . A conference of forestry officers was held in Melbourne a few months ago under the chairmanship of the Minister for the Interior. Mr. Lane-Ppole, the Commonwealth Director of Forestry, alsq was present.

Most of the schemes are splf-contained, so the Commonwealth Government will not necessarily be obliged to make further grants tp the States in respect thereof.",37

171,Mr BEASLEY,LOA N APPROPRIATION,How were the amounts allocated to. each State arrived at?,37
172,Mr CASEY,LOA N APPROPRIATION,Eac h State put forward its own proposals and no doubt had in mind the amount of money already being spent on afforestation. The schemes were discussed and reported upon by technical advisers and gradually the proposals of this bill were evolved.,37
173,Mr BEASLEY,LOA N APPROPRIATION,"'Coul d each State government have obtained £100,000 for this purpose as the governments of ""Western Australia and Victoria are doing?",37
174,Mr CASEY,LOA N APPROPRIATION,"I would not say that, for the amount of money the Commonwealth Government has available is limited.",37
175,Mr BEASLEY,LOA N APPROPRIATION,What was the basis of the discrimination between the States?,37
176,Mr CASEY,LOA N APPROPRIATION,"The various schemes wore considered in the light of other proposed works. Honourable members may rest assured that the State Governments are generally satisfied with what i i being proposed. It will be seen immediately that the allocations are not on a population basis. That statement applies also to grants made to the States for other purposes during the last yoar or eighteen months. The proposals of each State have been considered on their merits. There is a disparity, of course, also between the total grants for each State for all works, and it will be seen that the total amounts proposed to be voted are not on a population basis. It is the intention of the Government, however, gradually to equalize the grants to the various States for all purposes, so that at some time in the future they may be placed on, approximately, a population basis. Each of these claims' has been dealt with on its merits. The original act appropriated the sum of £50,000 for assistance to the metalliferous mining industry in the Northern Territory. Since that act of the was passed by Parliament consideration has been given to the desirability of assisting and developing the metalliferous mining industry in Papua, where it is not in a flourishing condition. The Papuan Government is not able financially tp assist the industry, but the discovery of a payable field would be of considerable benefit to the territory. In New Guinea the mining industry is more prosperous and is providing full time and well-paid occupation for over 500 white men, whereas in Papua it gives employment to only 58 white men. The extension of the industry in the territorial would provide a field for the employment for a large number of Australians. The present bill provides for £5,000 to be appropriated for this purpose and thi* amount is being diverted from the £50,000 appropriated in the original act for the mining industry in the Northern Territory. It is thought and hoped that if a beginning is made in this way w« may in time develop mining in Papua by prospecting and other means. It may be of interest to record the total extent to which assistance has been gives by the Commonwealth during this financial year for the relief of unemployment, including that provided in the bill now before the House. I have had compiled a table which shows the amount of money appropriated from revenue and loan under each of the several measures that have from time to time been before the House. It gives a proper conspectus of what has been done and how the appropriation in the bill now before the House fits in with the general scheme; it sets out clearly works from revenue under the ordinary estimates and subsequent appropriations and the various loan NA Parliament 12,980 Prime Mlnlstn Treasury . .

I am using the word "" forestry"" advisedly, because the proposed work does not necessarily mean afforestation.

Has the South Australian Governmentagreed to a similar condition?",38
182,Mr CASEY,STATEMENT OF APPBOPRIATIOHS,"The South Australian Government has not provided any amount for this purpose. The provision of £17,000 is a straight-out grant to South Australia and will not be supplemented by any additional amount from the State Treasury.

185,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,STATEMENT OF APPBOPRIATIOHS,"Darlin g Downs) [3.15] - Althoug h the question raised by this bill is chiefly in regard to the position of married women under the law relating to nationality, it is interesting to realise that that is only part of a bigger issue raised at the League of Nations Assembly. In 1924, at the General Assembly of the League of Nations, meeting in Geneva, the introduction of - a system for the progresive codification of international raised. It was realized that there were branches of international law which might be found capable of codification, and it was considered desirable, in the interests of peace and good relations between nations, that everything possible should be done to bring about, if possible, a gradual process of codification. The matter was referred by the Assembly of the League to the committee which dealt with constitutional questions, of which committee I was chairman. The rapporteur of the committee was M . Rolin, of Belgium, and he reported to the Assembly in the following terms:Accordingly, we recommend that this work should be carried out step by step, and that international conferences should only be called to deal with particular questions of public or private international law. If these questions seem sufficiently urgent in themselves to demand immediate consideration, and at the same time appear to have reached such a stage of development, either in legal knowledge or in special interstate agreements, as to render an international solution practicable. As chairman of the committee I put the matter before the Assembly in these wordsNations have to live in this new brotherhood of man just as citizens in a community possessing rights and duties, and the peace of the community is better established when those rights and duties are clearly defined. It will, therefore, be better for the nations of SCULLIN) the world as they progress to have their mutual rights and obligations clearly denned, so that they know exactly what are their rights and duties to each other. This is our Every one realizes that at present, when one seeks for an authoritative exposition of international law, many branches of the law, as sot out in the text books are very complex and in authoritative expositions conflicting views occur. That was the objective of the League in setting up a body of experts who were charged with the duty of recommending what particular branches of law seemed ? suitable for codification, and in 1926 the committee of experts for the Progressive Codification of International Law selected nationality as a suitable subject. The ' Assembly referred this subject to the Codification Conference which met at The Hague in 1930, and it was taken in hand as part of the codification of international law. The law was difficulties arising out of statelessness and double nationality of married women were full y realized, and it was endeavoured to frame a convention acceptable to the nations by means of which this branch of international law could be set out and defined. The conference met and framed an international convention, the text of which may be found in the English House of Commons papers of 1932-33, volume 28, and cited as "" International Convention on certain Questions relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws."" Underlying the principles of nationality in different countries are certain fundamental ideas, some of them apparently opposed to one another. For instance, one view, which is Very strongly held, has to do with the status of a woman, based on the unity of family life. Opposed to this is the conflicting view regarding the freedom of women. The conference framed conventions dealing with a number of matters, including the rights of children, but it also framed those particular articles, Nos. 8, 9 and 10, upon which this bill is basedArticle 8 - If the national law of the wife causes her to lose her nationality on marriage with a foreigner, this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring the nationality the husband. Article 9 - If the national law of the wife woman causes° her to lose her nationality upon a acquire change in the nationality of her husband less; occurring during marriage, this consequence nationality shall be conditional on her acquiring her husacquire thatshe band's new nationality. Article 10 - Naturalizatio n of the husband during marriage shall not involve a change the nationality of the wife except with her consent. The distinguished secretary of the in General League of Nations at that time, vided Sir Eric Drummond, summarized the in position in a report on the Nationality married women. of Women which is filed among the documents of the League. It is included in the legal volume, Nos. 1 to10, of the year 1931. Opinions were invited from the various United governments, and the replies received contained in the legal volume, Nos. 1 5, of 1932. There is shown the conflict which exists among the nations. The of British position is summarized in theso wealth of Nations. wordsArticles 8 to 11 of the Convention appear to represent the greatest measure of agreeof ment that is likely to be reached for the present in regard to the nationality of ried women, and constitute an advance on present situation. That is the considered view of the British Government, whose opinion always carries considerable weight with the League of Nations. Various women's organizations throughout the world are pressing strongly to go further than that, however, and are insisting on the prin ciple of the equality of the sexes in regard to nationality. The First Committee of the Codification Conference reported on article No. 8 as follows:As already observed, this text forms a compromise between two diametrically opposed conceptions-that of the countries which consider that, in the matter of nationality, there should be complete equality between the sexes, and that of the countries in which the Btatus of the husband governs that ' of the wife. Although some countries admit the former principle in their laws either wholly or in part, and apply it more or less completely, the laws of many countries provide that, from the point of view of nationality, the wife must, as a rule, follow her husband. It was observed that the co-existence of these two principles-the freedom of the wife 1 on the one. hand and the unity of the family on the other-ha d the effect of increasing the of number of cases of double nationality and also of statelessness. In point of fact, a can lose her nationality through marriage with a foreigner, and, being unable to that of her husband, can become statewhile, on the other hand, retaining the possesses by birth, she can also of her husband. For that reason the committee, without attempting to decide in favour of either of the two existing in systems-indeed , that is rather the duty of the legislatures of the different countriessimply endeavoured to remedy some of the defects resulting from existing conditions and, particular, the case of statelessness profor in the text of this Basis. If States adopt this text, progress will have been made eliminating cases of statelessness among Great B r it a in accepted the principles in articles Nos. 8 to 11, and regarding the future statedWhether His Majesty's Government in the Kingdom will be able to go further in the direction of giving effect to the prinare ciple of equality between men and women to must depend upon the extent to which that principle receives the support of the governments of other countries, and especially those the other members of the British CommonI t would appear that these articles, Nos. 8 to 11, represent the greatest extent agreement that was obtainable at the marConvention. Australia, a member of the the League of Nations, is now considering this matter of common interest to all nations which are members of the League.",39
186,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATEMENT OF APPBOPRIATIOHS,We should not allow our judgment in this matter to be influenced by that consideration.,40
187,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,STATEMENT OF APPBOPRIATIOHS,"The honourable member is not doing himself justice in making an interjection of that - nature. In a world which is seeking to establish international brotherhood and adopt uniformit y of rules with a view to achieving the best results in international relationship, we must sometimes pay deference to the views of others. idea behind the League of Nations is to afford representatives of the different countries means of conferring with each other on matters of common concern. Such discussions enable nations to appreciate the other nation's view, to see how differences can be overcome, and then endeavour by agreement to do what is best in the interests of humanity.",40
188,Mr BRENNAN,STATEMENT OF APPBOPRIATIOHS,"That is & deserved and dignified rebuke to the honourable member. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - This bill represents an advance, and is therefore welcome, but it does not preclude women from pressing further towards their goal of complete equality. I have mentioned so far the agreement which has been made in this matter among the nations of the world. Last night the honourable member for Lilley (Sir Donald Cameron) dealt with the discussion on this subject up to the end of 1932. But the matter again came before the League of Nations in 1933 and 1934. It is interesting to examine the resolution of the League in 1933, incidentally referring to the question as to whether a nation could go on legislating upon the basis of equality of the sexes notwithstanding its agreement to the Convention. Honourable members have had an opportunity to peruse a copy of this resolution, but probably they have overlooked the facts set out on page 11 of the report of the Australian Delegation which details the resolution of the Assembly in 1933. In the resolution, the League recognizes the rights of individual nations in dealing with this subject, and statesConsidering that any amendment outside the normal procedure for revision would prove impracticable, and, therefore, that it is not possible even to eliminate from the text the words that seem to have created a misconception as to a discrimination of sexes in regard to nationality. Being satisfied, therefore, that the coming into force of Articles 8-11 would in no way prejudice further concerted international action, when such action becomes practicable; Recognising that their coming into force would not, in the meantime, place any restriction upon the freedom of action of any State that may desire to give further effect in its nationality laws to the principle of th« equality of the sexes. The present position is that in the Convention a stage has been reached The which represents a very considerable advance in international co-operation, and if the articles of the Hague Convention of 1930 are adopted, that will not prevent further advance being made at a future assembly towards meeting the demands of women for equality of the sexes in nationality law. Examining this international convention we find that a certain uniformity has been reached very among the representatives of the nations of the world, but in the meantime, according to the statement. I have just read, individual nations who adopt it retain freedom of action to give effect to a national law expressing the principle of equality of the sexes. The Government is taking the proper course in bringing down this amending bill, the object of which is to harmonize our laws with tbose of other nations which are agreed on this particular point. At the same time we are keeping in step with Great Britain and Canada. This is a progressive move. The objections of those women who protested against such & step will be found set out in the book* from which I have cited. Some have expressed the fear that if a measure of this nature be passed it may be difficult to progress any further in this matter. I do not think tnat that fear is well founded. Why should we condone the injustice of allowing married women to remain in a condition of statelessness, merely because we cannot yet accomplish the ideal ? I urge that in matters of this kind we should be prepared to go step by step in order that we may the more quickly progress in the general interests of civilization. That is what the Government is proposing in this measure. If the Governments in the British Empire should agree to effectuate further the principles for which the women are contending there will be nothing in this legislation to prevent them from doing so. The Ministry is to be commended for having brought down thi» bill. I would like to see it adopted because it is another step in the removing of injustice and in the progress towards international harmony. This branch of law reveals a considerable conflict of opinion among the nations of the world. Each State has the right to enact its own laws relating to nationality and Article 1 of the International Convention of the Hague, on the conflict of nationality laws, sets outI t is for each State to determine under its. own law who are its nationals. This law shall he recognized by other States in so far as it is consistent with international conventions, international custom and the principles of law generally recognized with regard to nationality. Nations can come to an agreement, however, in regard to the matter. Eor the reasons which I have given, therefore, it is highly desirable that this legislation be passedObjections have been recorded against this convention and honourable members no doubt will desire to study them. These will be found in Volume 5, 'Ligal, Leaqne of Nations, 1934. A study of paragraph 2 (Opposition to the Convention) will reveal that this matter has been thoroughly reasoned out, and that the objections raised by the women are based on substantial grounds. This paragraph readsTlie incluson in the Hague Convention of ; Articles giving an inferior position to women is a matter of the utmost gravity because of the psychological effect of the adoption df such a convention upon the status of women all over the world. Women deeply resent the writing into an international agreement of articles founded upon a theory of the subjection of women. To recognize in practice this old idea is a refusal to treat a woman as a citizen in her own person. It is to deny her the of an adult. Furthermore, it gives recognition to a system which has serious practical as well as .spiritual consequences; a system which may deprive her of the vote; may deprive her at home and abroad of the protection of her own government; may subject her even in her native land to the restrictions placed on aliens; may deprive her of the benefits of State insurance and other State assistance; may make it impossible for her to hold public office, to exorcise her profession, to obtain paid employment, to own and inherit property, and may place her under other disabilities.",41
189,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATEMENT OF APPBOPRIATIOHS,"Not only does place her under other disabilities. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM-There was a further statement by women's organizations in 1932. It was with a desire to reach uniformity that the conference was held. It was felt that it might be possible to remove some of the disabilities and enable the nations to move forward together in harmony. But there was a conflict of views. For instance, the view of Belgium is 1932 wasAfter the long discussions at the Hague in 1930 it may be said that articles 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the general convention represent the maximum which can at present be attained internationally. The statement of the Japanese Governm e n t was to the following e f f e c t : Since the principle of the equality of men and women as regards nationality iB contrary to that family unity which forms the basis of the Japanese social system and since i l creates many difficulties, the Japanese Government regrets that it cannot support the adoption of this principle. The course now is to persuade the different nations to move forward by agreement. It is, of course, the inherent right of every State to determine its own laws of nationality; but if it is possible to bring other nations into line and so achieve uniformity and progress by all means let it be done. The Minister, by this bill, indicates that progress has been made so far as British countries are concerned, and has hinted that further progress might be possible at a future meeting of the Prime Ministers of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Honourable members will, I hope, realise that the issue involved is of paramount importance, and that what we are doing in this Parliament will be noted elsewhere. Our action may possibly help statusother countries and thus further the development of international law and the spirit of brotherhood among the nationB. Debate (on motion by Mr Holloway) adjourned.

190,Mr MAKIN,STATEMENT OF APPBOPRIATIOHS,"Hindmarsh) [3.40] Towards the end of last session I brought under the notice of the Acting Treasurer (Mr Casey) a matter which affects certain constituents of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Stacey), namely, the method of paying pensions in lower. North Adelaide. I am sure that the honourable member will not take umbrage at what might appear to be an intrusion by me into affairs which, perhaps, more intimately concern him, but they are also my care. I should like the Minister to give us an assurance that steps will be taken without delay to improve the arrangements. I have been approached by members of the Invalid and Old-age Pensioners Association who are anxious to know if better arrangements can be made for their convenience. I trust that the matter will receive early consideration.",42
191,Mr CASEY,STATEMENT OF APPBOPRIATIOHS,"Corio-Actin g Treasurer) [3.42] - The matter mentioned by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) had been brought to the notice of the Government and it is receiving attention. It is admitted that, generally, the submission of the honourable member is quite justified, and 'we are doing what we can to improve the position in the interests of the pensioners concerned. I am in active collaboration with the Postmaster-General, and hope soon to be in a position to inform the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Stacey) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh of the action to be taken.",43

If it is the practice to send this questurers tionnaire to pensioners, the department should, at least, see that tbose who are hopeless invalids are not harassed in this Belgian way. JSx. STACEY (Adelaide) [3A41] Honourable members may recall that durso ing the last session when the proposed duties on glass were being discussed, the statement was made that the Australian Glass Company could supply all the requirements of Australia. It has been stated that sufficient horticultural glass was available to meet requirements for, I think, about two years. In South Australia there has been a strong demand for this kind of glass, but when inquiries were made in Sydney those requiring supplies were informed on numerous occasions that it was impossible to obtain them. During the past week or so I have asked the Minister for Trade and Customs to permit the importation of additional quantities, but as I-understand that the quota for this year has already been arranged, I have found it rather difficult. Quite recently the Minister for Trade and Customs said that he would arrange for additional per-, mits to be issued. I have had a number of telegrams from interested persons in South Australia, and only a few moments ago I received telegraphic advice to the effect that the Australian Glass Company in New South Wales is now able to meet all our requirements. A few days ago we were informed that it was impossible to obtain further supplies for some time; but we are now advised that all requirements can be met. In view of these circumstances, a fuller investigation of the position should be made. Those needing horticultural glass have had their frames ready for some time, and must obtain supplies by the first week in May. I should like the Minister conto ascertain why such contradictory An invalid reports are received. Mr Casey"" - I shall bring the matter under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs.",43
193,Mr BERNARD CORSER,STATEMENT OF APPBOPRIATIOHS,"Wide Bay) [3.47] - In fairness to the Australian glass industry I consider it necessary to or carstate that, under the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the Belgian Government, Belgian manufacare to supply their quota of horticultural glass, which does not return the same profit as ordinary sheet glass. The manufacturers have been endeavouring to evade the exportation of their quota of the cheaper glass, and by doing compel the Australian manufacturers to supply more than their quota of the product on which a lower profit is made. The Australian manufacturers have supplied their quota of the cheaper glass, and it is now the responsibility of the Belgian manufacturers to adhere to the terms of the agreement, and to supply thoir quota. The Australian manufacturers aTe willing to meet the Australian requirements; but arc not disposed to relievo the Belgian manufacturers of their responsibility in the matter.",43
