0,NA,Unknown,"- JQouse of Rrprrsentattbes. Wednesday, S June, 190S. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. PERSONAL EXPLANATION"".",12
1,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"To make a personal explanation, I wish to call attention to a statement made by the honourable member for North Sydney on Thursday last. He is reported to have said I know that when the division came onThe division upon the tea dutythe honourable member for Eden-Monaro was looking for the Attorney-General, because that Minister had left the House in the face of an important division without pairing. Jt is possible that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was looking for me, and that I was not in the chamber, but I have reason to remember, because of the surprise which occurred in connection with the division, and because I have since consulted my diary, that I was within the precincts of the chamber from the commencement to the close of the sitting. I have not the least doubt that the honourable member for North Sydney made the statement in good faith in consequence of something which he heard. I am concerned only with the fact that I was in the building during the whole evening, and did not leave until after the division, was taken. I was paired for the division to oblige a member of the Opposition.",12
2,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"As a matter of personal explanation, and in repty to Attorney-General, I wish to say that it duty and a pleasure to accept his statement unreservedly. What I said was in reply to an unexpected interjection, and it might excusable if, under such circumstances, I did not speak with the close accuracy which might have been expected had I made a deliberate statement. I do not put my explanation upon that ground, however. I had ample justification for the statement, for on the night of. the division - upon the tea duty, and shortly before division took place, the Government Whipthe honourable member for Eden-Monarostated that the Attorney-General had left the House and had not paired. He then endeavoured to obtain a pair for him, and put down the name of a representative of New South Wales, who at the time was absent from Victoria. I objected to the name being used, because the honourable member to whom it belonged had told me in a recent conversation that he was - in favour of the duty upon tea, and another pair was found. The Government Whip was certainly seeking a pair for theAttorneyGeneral, although, I accept the statement of the latter, and that he was within the precincts of the House. I could support my statement as to the seeking for a pair by the testimony of other honourable members if I chose to bring them into the question, but I do not feel justified in doing so. I am quite satisfied to leave the matter where it is, and stop at the statement of facts within my own knowledge.",12
3,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"W it h reference to the statements made by the At torney-General and the honourable member for North Sydnej , the fact that the division T alluded to was takennearly twelve months ago makes it impossible for anyone to be very clear as to what members were or were not within the precincts of the House at the time.",12
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is impossible to allow a debate to take place upon a personal explanation. The Attorney-General was within his rights in making such an explanation, but I am not sure that the honourable member for North Sydney was in order in following him, and I am certain that the honourable member for Eden Monaro will not be in order in proceeding to discuss the matter further. RELIEF TO THE CROTTY MINER S. Mr OMALLEY , - In view of the fact the that the Commonwealth Constitution is is a similar to that of the United States of America, and that the American Congress voted £200,000 for the relief of the victims be of the Mount Pelee disaster, and that now at Crotty, in Tasmania, over 1,000 people are almost destitute because of the amalgamation of two mines there, will the Prime Minister place upon the Estimates the sum of £10,000 to assist those pioneers ?",12
5,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"I am under the distinct impression that it is not within the the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to vote money for such a purpose. The honourable member speaks in a good cause, and I shall give the matter further consideration ; but I hope that what I say now will not be supposed for one instant to be an intimation that I think that what he will be granted'. EEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLLS.",12
6,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"Wit h reference to the alleged omissions from the Eederal electoral - rolls, I wish to ask the Minister for Home Affairs if he proposes to take steps to have Opposition. the names of electors who are said to have be'iii left off enrolled prior to the of the State divisions being finally decided upon ?",13
7,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have already taken what action is possible. The lists names-whic h are really the rolls been printed in New South Wales, and I hope to have them exhibited at every post office in the State within the next day two. I believe that they are to be sent today or tomorrow. I have also inserted notices in the press, pointing out the discrepancies to which the honourable member alludes, and asking electors to inspect rolls and to send in their names to the officer in Sydney if they' find that they been omitted. GENERAL ELECTIONS.  Minister indicate to the House what measures he considers are of such importance as to warrant the prolongation of the session until such a time as will make it impossible to hold the elections to this House and to the Senate upon the same day ? Sir EDMUND BARTON' - T n all courtesy to the honourable member, I do not feel called upon to make a Ministerial explanation on the subject at this stage. 'There will be a proper occasion for a Ministerial explanation as to the-course of business. ELECTORAL ACT AMENDMEN T.",13
8,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Hav e the Government decided whether they will introduce a Bill to amend that provision of the Electoral - Act which prevents State members from contesting federal seats ?,13
9,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"Step s were Defence, upon noticetaken in some of the Parliaments of' the States to prevent federal members seeking election to the State and when the Electoral Bill was before this House a provision was inserted in i .making State members ineligible as candidates for the Federal Legislature. The 'whole matter involves a wide question of - prior to federation ? policy, and I am not at present prepared to asks say that the Government will consent to any amendment in the law, but the matterwill be taken into consideration at an early date. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - And heads counted. Sir EDMUND ' BARTON - No . Tocount heads is the peculiar province of the * boundaries PERMANENTSTANDING ORDERS..",13
10,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister when the adoption of the of new standing orders, prepared last session, - have is likelv to be moved ?",13
11,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"I have not discovered any such great difference beor tween the standing orders provisionally out adopted and those which have been prepared by the Standing Orders Committee - althoug h the latter are, in some respects, an improvement on the former-as will, the warrant me in a session like the present, in .taking up the time that I can see would have be occupied in their discussion by putting them before honourable members. NA STAMP.",13
12,Mr CLARKE,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeV. Whether the Government has .yet considered the desirability of introducing an uniform Commonwealth postage stamp. 2. If so, what is the result of such deliberations. 3. If not, will he consider the matter as soon as possible. Sin EDMUND BARTON - The answers to the honourable member's questions are-as follow :(1) Yes, so far as the Commonwealth postage stamp can be made uniform during the bookkeeping period. (2 &3) A decision will shortly be arrived at and made public. RIFLECLUB REGULATIONS.",13
13,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"the Minister of 1. When the new regulations re rifle clubs orefrom likely to be issued ? . 2. Whether any of the new rifles are to be Parliament, issued to rifle clubs ? 3. Whether it is his intention to increase the t price of ammunition to members of rifle clubs ? 4. Why it is that requisitions for passes over Queensland railways may not be signed by the nearest Defence Force officer, as was the case - - '",13
14,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The answers to - the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. At an early date. 2. Yes, when available. 3. Not at present. 4. Inquiry is being made into the matter. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH: ADDRESS INREPLY . Debate resumed from 2nd June (vide page 384), on motion by Mr L . E. GHOOMThat the following address in reply to the - Governor General's opening speech be now adopted :MAY IT PLEASE Youn EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Representatives of the Parliaof ment of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Excellency for the speech which you have pleased to address to Parliament.",14
15,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I should have been very willing under ordinary cumstances to co-operate with other able members in saving the time of Parliafederation, ment by curtailing this debate, even to extent of refraining from making any obyond servations, were it not that I feel that although the leader of the Opposition has not tabled any motion in the nature .a challenge to the Government, I could not, in view of my duty to my constituents and in self-respect to myself, forego making tain observations upon the administration of the Government since the conclusion of last session, and upon the Ministerial programme contained in the speech of the Governor General. I feel sure that every one who heard the speech delivered last night by the honourable member for worth must feel that the most serious most damning case was made out against the Minister for Trade and Customs as. direct administrator of his department, and against the Government as a whole. Ministers have not denied the challenge of the honourable member that they have all individually taken exception to their colleague's administration, and yet allowed him to continue in his control the Customs, to the detriment and disto credit of the Commonwealth'. Any one who reads that speech must admit that the Ministry stand committed for trial before the bar of public opinion. desire in the first place to deal with or two questions of administration, and I shall afterwards direct my attention briefly to the programme put forward by the Government. In the first place it is to be noted that when Parliament prorogued the Prime Minister had not returned from Eii£rland. It will be recollected that a number of honourable members of the Opposition, myself in particular, had taken most marked exception to what I have never had any hesitation in characterizing as an immoral breach of political obligation on the part of the Prime Minister in connection with his Maitland manifesto. I do not wish to go over the old ground again, although some honourable members on this side of the House have thought it desirable, but I desire to repeat my belief that quite outside the tactics of politics, for which I am preour pared after twenty years of political experiYonr ence to make great allowances, the been Prime Minister has by his action forfeited all claim to respect. Great as was my admiration for the Prime Minister, and cirwilling as I was to stand by him and help honorhim to consummate the great scheme of I say now,' and I shall say to the the end of the chapter, that he went right be the bounds of political allowance with regard to party movements, and committed a great moral delinquency in deceiving the of people of New South Wales in regard to the Tariff. It is all very well to say that the fiscal question should not be raised in cerNew South Wales today. I admit that if the Maitland manifesto had been carried out in its letter and spirit, we, as a party, would have no right to disturb the commercial and industrial affairs of the Commonwealth by again bringing that question before the people; but when we can prove Wentout of the mouth of a member of the and Government, that the Maitland manifesto was intended as, and was taken to be, an the assurance to the people of Australia-because Maitland was, so to speak, the Mount Sinai of the Commonwealth-that the fiscal question was not to be raised, and that, therefore, it ought to be put aside as irrelevant to the election, the have charge goes home in such a way that of it cannot be refuted. I need only refer the statements reiterated by the A^icePresident of the Executive Council that we ought not to allow the wretched fiscal issue to enter into our consideration, but choose I the best men, not from the fiscal point of one view, but in every other sense of the word to take part in the great and responsible work of carrying on the business of the Commonwealth. If further proof were wanted of the impression that was created by the Prime Minister's speech, is it not contained in the memorable event which took place in this Chamber when the honourable member for Kooyong, the honourable member for the Grampians, and the honourable member for Flinders, who were intimate friends of the Government and sab on the Government benches, speaking in pathetic terms, told us that they had been deceived by the Prime Minister and the Governmenb, and that, in order bo pub bheir protest into the most definite and form, they would cross the Houseand sit in opposition ? Does it need any torrent of language to bring the position home to the minds of the public? I started upon my federal career with a fixed determination to help in the carrying through of the greab work of federabion, but when, after believing for years in the high ideals which the Prime Minisber, above all men in Australia, had pub before the public as bo our future nabional life; I find him.stooping down from.his pedesbal of perfection bo acb the groundling in political life, how can I repose any further confidence in him ? I shall continue bo lose confidence in him. have wabched bo see how far he has realized his own high sbanclard of political idealism. The Prime Minister proceeded to Great Bribain as a kind of emissary from the Australian people, to represent them at what may be looked upon as an initial form of Imperial Council, which may in future years determine the destinies of the Empire, of which we are a part. I watched to see how far he would show himself fit to occupy that high position. We all rememberand it has a bearing upon our present day politics-readinghis utterances as reported in the English newspapers from time to time. It litis been claimed as a subject for credit that he spoke frequently at great functions, and that he never in the whole course of his circuit of representation committed tralia to a single opinion. I submit thab bhis reflecbs no greab credib upon him, because, albhough he was nob authorized to commit this Parliament to any particular measure touching the interests of the Empire or the Commonwealth, he had full authority to express his own opinion as to what ought bo be done. We find, however, that from firsb to last there was a series of swollen speeches, Mr Bruce Smith. speeches full of swollen Imperialism, regarding what ought to.be done in the interests of the Empire, in absolute forgetfulness of the fact that the policy of his own Government was calculated bo completely undermine theunion of the Empire. What could one think ?' I was reminded of the process adopted by some enterprising butchers when they wantto sell veal. They blow it out for exhibition in their shop windows. That seems to me to afford a forcible illustration of the kind of ubberance we had from the right honourable gentleman. His speeches; were redolent of Imperialism of the most swollen character, as if he had not a thoughtdramatic for that insignificant corner of the worldcalled Australia. The Empire was bo beeverybhing, and yeb the righb honourable genbieman had broughb forward a programme under which the subjects of his own King were absolutely barred from passing from one part of the Empire to another. Afterwards we'find him actually stooping, in deference to the socialistic parby in bhis country, to shut out for daysbogebher men of his own flesh and bloodcoming from the very country in which bhese swollen utterances of his were delivered. We are told that under the provisions of the ImmigrationI Restriction Acb the Prime Minister'shands were tied, but the section which ib is said prevenbed him from exercising a discretion, and which should nob have been passed, was accepted in the most mild and meek manner by the AbborneyGeneral without reference to the Government, because the honourable member for Bland had suggested it.",14
16,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Was the honourable and learned member in the House at bhattime ?,15
17,Mr BRUC ESMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No ; bub I haveread Hansard with greab care, and I know exacbly whab book place. The leader of the labour parby rose and said-"" I have an amendmenb bo make,"" and the AbborneyAusGeneral said-"" I should like to hear it . "" He did hear it, and it was accepbed, and was passed into law. It has been said that once thab section was passed the Prime Minisber had nobhing bo do bub bo carry out ibs provisions ; bub whab does the section provide ? That no man who has been contracted for shall land in the Commonwealbh unless the Prime Minister has first of all - ascertained that he is required for the industrial purposes of the Commonwealth"". I have paraphrased the section of the Act, but that really is the effect of it : It was aimed at keeping out large bodies of men, who might be contracted for in other countries, and brought Out under engagement against the interests of the working classes already here. It was quite open to the Government to say that they would be no party to such a provision. They might have said that they were entirely at one with the socialistic party in preventing men from being brought here under contract at rates of pay below those current here, and ib would have been an easy matter for them to hold as null and void every contract which had been entered into in other parts of the world. Taking the section as ib sbands, however, the Prime Minister is made the arbitrator as to whether men, who are broughb out here under engagemeufe, are required in the country. Required by whom-by Mr . Anderson, or by the workmen? Was it ever intended by Parliament that the Prime Minister should, on every occasion that a man or a number of men happened to be landed here under contract, be constituted a kind of Royal commission to make an inquiry into the economic circumstances of the trade affected? That is .what the Prime Minister undertook to accomplish. He undertook to solve the problem without making any inquiry of a widespread character. Thus these English artisans were detained for six days in of moral quarantine whilst the Prime Minister formed an opinion as to whether half-a-dozen additional hatters were required amongst 4,000.000 of people. For the right honourable gentleman to adopt such an attitude afber his grandiloquent utterances upon Imperial affairs in London was a fall for which no parallel is to be found in the history of public men. I have no desire to speak generally of the prohibition imposed upon the advenb of black labour bo bhis counbry. I merely say that that circumstance alone points to the right honourable gentleman in his speeches in London having played the hypocrite to a nicety before the British people. He may or may not have meant all that his utterances implied. It is much more charitable to suppose that he went to England and made his speeches with these provincial nobions in his mind bhan that he made bhem in good faibh, and upon his reburn suddenly fell from the lofby position which he had occupied. In this connection ib is worthy of note that quite recently the Government actually blocked the advent to the Commonwealth of three natives of a counbry which Australia very much desired should enter the Federation- I refer to New Zealand.",15
18,Sir EDMUND BARTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Does the honourable and learned member say that we abbempbed bo block bhose men ?,16
19,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I say that they were blocked.,16
20,Sir EDMUND BARTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I b is absolutely untrue.,16
21,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I must ask the Prime Minister to withdraw that expression.,16
22,Sir EDMUND BARTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not accuse the honourable and learned member of untruth, but I say that the statement which he made, wherever he got it from, is an untrue one. I do nob in any way accuse the honourable and learned member of untruth.",16
23,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I am quite sure that the Prime Minister will set the House a good example by wibhdrawing the expression.,16
24,Sir EDMUND BARTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If you, sir, think thab I oughb to withdraw it in the face of what I have said I do so unreservedly. Perhaps I may be allowed to say, however, thab the expression was nob aimed ab my honourable and learned friend, bub ab bhose who make such ""sbabemenbs wherever they a sorb are bo be found-probabl y abroad.",16
25,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I quite reciprocate the Prime Minister's desire that we should not indulge in any personal altercation upon a question of this sort. I do not say that the right honourable gentleman blocked bhese men by physical force, but the administration of the Government certainly blocked them.",16
26,Sir EDMUND BARTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Has the honourable and learned member 'seen the papers bearing upon the subject ?,16
27,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I have seen the papers, and it is from them that I gained my information. I repeat that three natives of New Zealand are living in this country only upon condition that they remain here for a limited time to assist in a particularentertainment. Good God ! to what a state of things have we come in Australia when, on the eve of entering into a great partnership with the British Empire for Imperial purposes, the natives of a country close to our shores, and with which we have sought a local partnership, are permitted to enter the Commonwealth only upon condition they do not permanently remain here. my early days I may have formed altogether too high ideals of public life and public men. I may have built up expectations in regard to State and Commonwealth politics that the big men of Australia gradually come to the front, and that the leaders of the people would endeavour to conduct the affairs of this great country upon lines which reflected credit upon us as a State, and upon the Empire to which we belong. But can decadence, can personal declension, have a finer illustration than is afforded by the spectacle of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth preaching this Empire ideal in England, and returning to Australia to carry out a policy of wretched, miserable parochialism that would be unworthy of the smallest South American republic ? I admit that I have formed too high ideals, and that, after twenty years of political experience, I shall have to lower the standard which I had set up. When I see important questions treated in this way-when I see our fellow beingsmembers of our own nationality, treated in this fashion, how, I ask, can a man like Mr. Chamberlain, if he knew the facts, hope that we shall sacrifice our miserable local ambitions to fall in with his great Imperial scheme? So far, he has only visited a Crown colony, and he does not appreciate the character of the public men with whom we have to deal when lie imagines that we aie ready to cast aside our local affairs and rise to the level of the Imperial policy which he pictured in his recent speech. So much for the general administration of this country. I come now to the question of the Customs administration. Although I have had many years experience in different phases of commerce, I do not intend to enumerate all the cases of Customs persecution-I hesitate to describe them as such-which have taken place under the regime of the present Government. I have heard of many instances of hardship some of which are stronger than those which have been placed before the House. When the Customs Bill was under consideration I remember that I was one of the first to. draw attention to. the clause in it which reversed the old time honoured provision that a British citizen was presumed to be innocent of any crime until he was proved guilty. I commented strongly and frequently upon that principle, Mr Bruce Smith. and received satisfaction only when the that House was assured by the Minister for In Trade and Customs, in the most measured language, that although this arbitrary vjower was being placed in his hands it would be exercised with discretion, and that justice would be tempered with mercy. What has been would the result? The right honourable gentleman is reported in the British AnstroJasmn-as was stated by the honourable member for Wentworth in the speech which he made last night - to have admitted his belief that the great bulk of the merchants of Australia are honourable men who are a credit to Australia and to the British Empire. Yet, although a similar provision was contained in the Victorian Tariff Act, no one in the history of that State, since 1866, when its Customs laws were changed, ever heard of any series of persecutions which approached in hardship those which have occurred under the Commonwealth administration during the last two years ? I do not object to any provision for the detection and punishment of dishonest men. I have no sympathy-and. I know something about the work of the Customs department-wit h merchants who attempt to defraud the revenue. I do not object to offenders in cases in which blank invoices are brought to this country for fraudulent purposes being punished, not by fine, but by absolute imprisonment. What I do protest against is the fact, which was commented upon with so much eloquence by .the honourable member for Wentworth last evening, that hundreds of highly reputable merchants have been hauled before the police court with drunkards and criminals, compelled to remain there-sometime s hours-until they could be charged, and fined £ 5 for having committed a miserable error which the prosecutor fertile Government has admitted did not contain an element of fraud. What is the do not effect of such administration ? Its effect is to put the rogue upon an equality with the honest man. Not merely is a member of this great and honourable class'of the community treated as a rogue, but the real rogue, who ought to be punished by imprisonment, is practically consoled by being reminded that hundreds of reputable merchants are upon an equality with him. Thus, in addition to the insult which has been offered to the - mercantile classes of Australia, the Government have offered an incentive to crime in that they have made it less heinous and objectionable. It is a very regrettable circumstance that there has been introduced into the Customs administration o i this country a man admittedly of very .great ability in his own walk of life, but with no knowledge of commercial practices. For aught I know to the contrary, the Minister may be a very excellent advocate - and lawyer in his own State, but I say un-. hesitatingly that it was a mistake to introduce a gentleman of his calibre and training into the mercantile operations of Australia, .seeing that he could not possibly have acquired any knowledge of value concerning - commercial practices. To me it is perfectly - clear, as a man who has had years of commercial and legal experience, that the right honourable gentleman entered upon the work of his department in the full conviction that the mercantile classes of Australia were cel of unprincipled individuals who were attempting to rob the poor man by evading the payment of duty upon their goods. No one could have listened to his deliverances upon the Customs Bill and the Customs Tariff Bill without feeling that he entertained the ""belief that he was called upon to make provision against a class which was cunning - and astute to a degree, and that he was a .sort-of magnified policeman or detective appointed by the Commonwealth to catch them.",16
28,Mr RONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,He was right.,18
29,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member for Southern Melbourne knows less of commercial affairs than does the little finger of the Minister for Trade and Customs.,18
30,Mr RONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"But I know something «,bout common honesty.",18
31,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,If that is the - attitude which the right honourable gentleman assumed upon undertaking the administration of the Customs department,18
32,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Is the honourable and learned member referring to any particular statement of mine ?,18
33,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No . If I were to quote from the utterances of the Minister, I should not be able to catch my train to Sydney, as I intend doing, today. I have other occupations besides politics, And I am pleased that I have; I should be sorry to depend on the latter. What I say is that this is not the attitude in which to approach the mercantile classes of this country. What has been the result of all this administration 1 Honourable members ought, in all fairness, to ask themselves whether 2 F in the whole of the two years during which the right honourable gentleman has been at the head of the Customs administration of Australia one substantial case of fraud has ever been brought against any member of the mercantile community. I know that the Minister will mention the Queensland case, and, no doubt, that is a case for which he may take some credit. It was a very complicated case, and whether or not the offence was driven home to the head of the firm I am not prepared to say. But if we compare the administration during the last two years and a half with £32,000,000 of imports per annum, what have we as the result of this wild and savage administration ? People have been prosecuted for a series of pettifogging errors, so a parclearly errors that the Crown Prosecutor has over and over again had to admit in court that there was no charge of fraud. Yet, in these cases, it was asked that a fine of £ 5 should be imposed, and, without it being realized what it meant to the heads of great firms who have en joyed an unblemished reputation for perhaps half a century-fro m a time when the Minister.himself was in knickerbockers-thes e firms have been brought into police courts and subjected to this humiliation. The Minister may depend that the people of the Commonwealth will not forget his administration. There is no doubt that when the Government next appeal to the people for an endorsement of their administration, the effect will be felt-per haps silently-bu t it will astonish Ministers as showing how what may appear to be little things lead to great results. I now pass to one other matter under the head of administration. We all remember that when the Customs Bill was under discussion, we understood that a distinction was to be made between sugar grown by black labour and sugar grown by white labour. It was perfectly clear to me-thoug h there may have been some subtle language used-that the intention was that every ton of sugar should pay an excise duty of £ 3 , but that where it was grown by English or white labour there should be a rebate of £ 2 . We find, however, that thousands of tons of sujrar which have not been grown by white labour but by black labour-the mere harvesting being done by white labour-hav e earned this rebate over and over again. Although I do not like the law, when a law is once made. I like to see it honestly administered. But we find that in the case of hundreds of thousands of tons of sugar the rebate has been allowed, although, as I say, only the harvesting has been done by white labour 1",18
34,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Does the honourable and learned member make the charge that the rebate has been allowed to people not entitled to it?,19
35,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I say that therebate has been allowed to people who are not entitled to it, and the matter has been commented, on in the columns of the Times, from which I get my - information. That is an act of administration which ought not to be tolerated. If we make a law, no matter how objectionable, it should be carried out; but I say that in this relation the law has not been carried out, because side by side with the drastic provisions on which I have commented, we had an undertaking from the Minister that this enactment would be used only in case of actual fraud.",19
36,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The honourable learned member never had anything of the sort, and I defy him to point it out.",19
37,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I now pass to the Government programme contained in the speech of His Excellency. My first observation is that the speech, in its very opening,, contains a remark of a very prominent character, which I say is unjust towards the free-traders of Australia. The paragraph of His Excellency's speech to which I refer begins thusIt was found impossible, by reason of the haustive discussion of the Federal Tariff, to with any but the most urgent of the proposals then brought before you, and renewed demands must now be made on your industry and patriotism before the Commonwealth machinery can be deemed complete. I ask any members on this or any side of the House to put fairly to themselves the question-What was the cause of nearly two-thirds of last session being occupied over the Tariff? We have had a boast in the interval, by the Prime Minister and by the Minister for Home Affairs, that the present Tariff is a fair compromise. But where does that lead us ? Does it not lead to the conclusion that it took twelve months of probest and debate on the part of the Opposition in order to produce a fair compromise ?",19
38,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The Tariff, as introduced, was a fair compromise.",19
39,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am not talking of what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports may think. I am talking of what the Prime Minister has said.. I am further talking of what the Minister for Home Affairs has said, and the claim made by these right honourable gentlemen is that the present Tariff is a fair compromise. Why did it take twelve months of hard fighting on the part of the free-traders to produce a fair compromise? Was it not because of the notable breach of faith by the Prime Minister - a ' breach of faith which the members of the Opposition and the people of the country who support bhem protested against? Were these bwelve months nob occupied in. brying to bring the Governmenb bo a recognibionof the promise which was made ab Mai faland ? Ib is brue that we did not succeed,, though we obbained recognition bo a cerbaiii exbenb. Ib is certain, however, thab the question will be raised at the next general election.' The leader of the Opposition has. given due nobice to the people of the country that it will be raised. Are the Governand menb nob in a logical cui-de-sao when I pub this question to them, protecbionisbs as. they may be--Why should ib have taken twelve monbhs bo get this Tariff, excepb for the facb that it was, when introduced, not a fair compromise ? 1 b was only by twelve monbhs' protest and debate that it was put in the condition now boasted of by the Prime Minisber. There is another aspect of His Excellency's - speech to which I would like to refer. Ib will be remembered bhat when the original programme of the Goex- vernmenb was pub forward, the people of. deal Australia were bold that bhere was bo be am old-age pension scheme. I quibe. recognisethat that was merely the political cheese for the brap-bha b ib was merely the old practice of offering the bundle of political, carrots in order to attract theunthinking portion of the population. Bub now that two years have passed away, the Government had dropped this particular bait, and the matter of old-age pensions is not mentioned. But the question was not dropped until it was pointed out to the members of the Government that such pensions were impossible, for the reason that it would benecessary to raise £ 2 in taxation for every 10s. required. We find the speech of His Excellency, which is the programme of the Governmenb, full of padding. Half of the - speech, ab leasb, promises measures which even the least .intelligent member of the Government must know to be a farce There is an endeavour to catch the crowd,. and persuade them that after all the Government is a liberal Government, because it promises 20 or 30 measures in the near future. We see here pursued the same old practice of - I am now talking of State politics, and of practices which I thought would be abandoned in the federal atmosphere-proposin g everything it is possible to conceive, in the hope that some day the opponents of the Government may adopt the programme, and lay themselves open to the charge of stealing their proposals.* No one who knows the Constitution, and who lead the original programme of the Government with care, can liave failed to see that every conceivable legislative measure was crammed into it, whether or not there was the means of carrying it out, in the hope that the Government might hereafter bo able to accuse the Opposition of taking part of that programme. That is a very old trick in State politics - a n old trick in the lower grade of politics-bu t it was adopted at the beginning by the Federal Government, and is repeated now. Who can say, for instance, that the Inter-State railway to Western Australia is likely to be carried out during the reign of this Government or of this .Parliament?",19
40,Mr GROUCH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,We should like to have it .,20
41,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"AV e should all like to go to heaven, but whether or not we shall all get there is another matter.",20
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The leader of the Opposition said that he would carry the work out at once. .,20
43,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"AVh o can that the question of rings and trusts, which presents one of the greatest problems of the present day, will be taken into serious thought by the present Government during to the Prime Minister. their term of office ? Who can suppose for moment that the enactment of the navigation laws-whic h are modestly put down in Excellency's speech as a matter in regard which the Government are not sanguinewill be seriously attempted by this Gohe vernment ? AVho can suppose for a moment that banking laws for all AusPrime tralia will receive serious consideration AVho can suppose that the Bonus B i l this session be the subject of any serious effort on the part of the Government have a very low opinion of the faculty of the Government for estimating public to feeling, but I do not think their faculty low enough to induce them totry another 2 F 2 and a third fall in regard to the Bonus Bill . Who can suppose for a moment that the question of preferential trade will be in troduced by the Government? This reminds me of the extraordinarily paradoxical attitude of the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman took part in a discussion in Great Britain with the Premiers of the other dependencies on this subject of preferential trade, and he gave an assurance that he would make a proposal to his Parliament with a view^ to its adoption. Where is that proposal ? A long cablegram was sent, no doubt at the expense of the Commonwealth, to Mr Chamberlain, informing that gentleman how much the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth approved of this magnificent Imperial scheme of preferential trade",20
44,Sir EDMUND BARTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The honourable and learned member was not present when I denied that I had sent any telegram to Mr Chamberlain, and when I said that the telegram was sent by a press agency after an interview with myself. The telegram was sent entirely at the cost of the press agency.",20
45,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That only refers to the cost of the cablegram.,20
46,Sir EDMUND BARTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,There was no telegram sent by me to Mr Chamberlain. The honourable and learned member's remarks are full of misstatements.,20
47,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"AAU 1 the Prime Minister deny that the words contained in the telegram were from an interview with him, and that they involve his own persay sonal opinion on the question ?",20
48,Sir EDMUND BARTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Exactly ; that is so.,20
49,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Then the dilemma is just as important or just as fatal AVhat does it a matter whether the £ 1 0 or £ 2 0 which this cablegram cost was paid by the press His agency or by the Commonwealth, whether to it was addressed to Mr Chamberlain directly or to the British press, so that might see it ? I ask what sentiment or opinion it expresses on the part of the Minister ? And I couple it with the ? assurance to Mr Chamberlain in England l will that he. had the support of the Prime Minister. But now the right honourable ? I gentleman has counted noses. He is aware of the reception which the proposal is likely get in this Chamber, and he has therefore is quietly left it alone. It is quite possible that his assurances when in London as to his intention to introduce the matter to the notice of the Commonwealth Parliament may have given Mr Chamberlain some hope that he would meet with that reciprocity which we are told today he looks upon as indispensable to his scheme; but he has now learned through the press that in the speech of the Governor General, which contains the Government policy, the matter is one which has been left to the sweet by-and-by. So we have the announcement made by this man, who now stands at the very apex of the British Government, that he cannot go on with the .scheme unless he has the sympathy and .reciprocity of the British colonies. But he has not got it. He finds that the Australian statesman who faithfully promised to recommend the scheme to his Parliament, - and who inspired the telegram which went to the English people to show that he is in ""favour of it, has not the political courage to introduce it in this Chamber. We are coming to a pretty state of things in Australian politics, when the head and front of our political life goes to England like a great ambassador, and leads the people aud statesmen there to believe that we are prepared to join in this great Imperial policy, to rise to this great Imperial height, and, when he comes back, is afraid to introduce the subject to Parliament. The measures which I have mentioned are mere padding, not in the sense that there is no merit in them, but because they have been crammed into the Government programme with no possibility of realization. Just as a miserable tradesman will dress his shop window with empty biscuit tins, or cigar boxes, to make a show to impress his customers, the Government, to impress the public, not. to impress the members of this House, place a number of empty promises in their programme, merely to be able to point to the large stock of legislative measures of a practical character they say they are going to pass. In addition to those I have mentioned, we have the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company's agreement, upon the banking laws, and legislation in regard to preferential trade aud the conversion of State debts. Out of twenty proposals which are solemnly put forward as if they were really part of a practical scheme of legislation which the Ministry to introduce, ten are palpably impossible of realization this session. The Government, however, think that in this way they can Mr Bruce Smith. mislead the people of the country. I should like now to say a word or two in regard to measures which I think are of a practical character. I take first that which, to my mind, is of the most importance. I regard the mere choice of a capital site as unimportant, but I consider it of the most profound importance to the whole Commonwealth that its Parliament should not sit in any one of the State capitals. If we were meeting in Sydney, I would be as averse to the arrangement as I am to our meeting in Melbourne. As the representative of another State, I have seen the great injury which is done to the interests of the Commonwealth by having its politics immediately under the criticism of the local press. I have seen, too, the effect of the present arrangement upon the attendance of honourable members. While the State from which I come is entitled to a representation of something like one-seventh more than that of Victoria, the actual attendance of honourable members last session gave Victoria a representation of something like one-seventh more than that of New South Wales. Why is the capital kept in Melbourne t It is not because of the action of Victorian members that nothing has been done. But do not the Minister for Home Affairs and his colleagues know that within half-an-hour every Victorian supporter can be rung up by telephone and brought here to vote in a division, while it takes the representatives of some of the other States, such as Western Australia, who have to come thousands of miles to reach Melbourne, days .and weeks to get here. It is a crying disgrace to the honourable member's department that the federal capital question has not been pushed further.",20
50,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Where is the money for building a capital to come from ?,21
51,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I deprecate the statements which have been made as to the expenditure of millions of money being necessary to create a federal capital, legislation because I believe that £50,000 would do all that will be required for years to come; but I am averse to the meeting of the Parliament of Australia in one of the State capitals, where it can be largely influenced by the local press, and intend where its members are placed in such a position that one State gets a larger proportional representation than it should get, while another State is proportionately unrepresented. What has occurred during the last two years to justify the delay in settling the question ? What has been done within that time to settle it ? Two and a half years ago the Government were in possession of a full and most able report upon all the sites in New South Wales which had been submitted for consideration ; but all that has happened since is that there have been two excursions to those sites, in which a limited number of members of botli Houses took part. I said, two years ago, that the visits of honourable members to the sites would be useless, and I will give an illustration to show why they have been useless. One cannot by a mere cursory view of any site judge as to its fitness. Take the matter of climate alone. A party of members visited Albury on a very bad day, and the people of Albury were so struck with the unfairness of' a mere cursory judgment upon the suitability of that site that they have since protested that the day upon which honourable members visited it was not af air day by which to judge it. Now, if the weather, which we breathe and live in, ctinnot be judged by a visit extending over one, two, or half-adozen days, how can an opinion worthy of the name be formed of the water supply of a site, its accessibility, or the character of its soil-whic h is a matter for chemical analysis-o n the cursory visit of a few people who go there with every comfort provided for them ? The arrangement was a farce from beginning to end. Put that farce aside, and what has been done in the last two and a half years ? A commission has been appointed of gentlemen taken from four of the States, whose president, although a very capable architect, when looked at from the point of view of the people of his own State, and in comparison with a man like Mr Oliver, is not a fit person to lead the Government of the Commonwealth to a conclusion on the matter. So that, practically, absolutely nothing has been done for a period of two and a half years. No one can help drawing but one conclusion from this delay, and that is, 'that as the policy of the Government is a protective one, it is to their interest to set their face against a move from undoubtedly the most protectionist corner of Australia, and to stay there until they are forced out of their position by a charge of dynamite. This great question, which affects the whole body politic of the Commonwealth, has been allowed to go on from week to week, from month to month, and from year to year, without any attempt on the part of the Government to settle it. Then the question of conciliation and arbitration is mentioned in the speech. As - a free-trader, I do' not want to be suspected of taking a bigoted, individualistic view of that question. Personally I expect no good from it ultimately ; but it is a question which involves so many aspects that I have always been prepared to hear all that could be said on its behalf, to consider the opinions of all outside authorities upon it , and even to go the length of watching with great care its actual operation in countries like New Zealand and New South Wales. These reasons carry great weight with me, quite apart from the actual merits of the question looked at economically. The working classes of the United States and the British workmen will have none of it .",21
52,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"AVh v ? Mr BRUC E SMITH - Because they do not like it. AVe are now ascertaining what certain large nations of workmen think of these questions, and it is a suggestive, if not a conclusive, fact that in a country which is essentially a commercial and in dustrial community, having a population of 80,000,000 people, the workmen will have none of it .",22
53,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,They give their reasons for not accepting it .,22
54,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"AVithi n the last few months, a very valuable commission, composed of 23 trades unionists, was sent from England to the United States to ascertain how far and in what respects the conditions of the workmen of the United States differed from those of the workmen of Great Britain. In an edition of the Times issued a few weeks ago, there is a most interesting summary of the evidence taken, and of the report of the commission, under the heading "" Relations between Employer and EmployeBoards of Conciliation."" A Mr Mosely was charged with the conduct of the commission.",22
55,Mr OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"He paid its expenses. Mr BRUC E SMITH - Yes , and he is regarded by the Times as a most able and competent guide for the 23 trades unionists, who were selected as representatives of the more important industries of Great Britain. They were taken in November and December of last year on a tour of the United States, that they might have an opportunity to see for themselves something of American industrial methods, and of the relations between capital and labour in America. In a two-page summary of the result of that commission, published by the London Times, I do not find a word about compulsory arbitration. There are, however, some very significant remarks, which show that the' United States workmen assume towards employers of labour an attitude entirely different from that taken by the working classes of Australia. One of the delegates saysThere was a time in our trades union movement when a jingo spirit was dominant. Saner methods now prevail. I would commend that to the working men of this country. The 23 trade unionists who formed the commission must have had a distinct bias in favour of the working classes, but we find this very significant statement by Mr MoselyIn many trades a joint committee of employers and employees meet periodically to settle rates for piece-work by mutual consent, and if such an arrangement were adopted all round I am sure it would be found beneficial: and this is * what is practically done in all American industries. Mr Cox, one of the members of the commission, remarksIn wages disputes and the relations between employers and workmen's organizations they have much to learn from us. It would be helpful if a committee of the leading trades' union leaders were to come over and make a personal investigation into our trade union methods and their relationship with the employer sections. There was a time in our own trade union movements when the jingo spirit was dominant. Saner methods now prevail, and a strike over a wage question is the exception rather than the rule. I do not make my observations upon this question without having great experience to guide me. I was one of the two originators in Victoria of the Employers' Union of Australia. I was president of the Employers' Union of Australia during the whole of the time. I lived in Victoria. was one of a body, composed of representatives of the Trades Hall of Melbourne and of the Employers' Union, who drafted a constitution for a voluntary board of conciliation between employers and workmen. I have sat in the Trades Hall, Melbourne, . as president of the Employers' Union and as president of the Conciliation Board, and I have, with the workmen of Melbourne, settled on the most amicable lines quarrel after Mr Bruce Smith. quarrel between employers and employed. Without any legislation whatever, and with only the exhibition of a fair and honourable spirit between employer and employed, I have witnessed the. amicable settlement of what promised to be some of the biggest industrial struggles in Victoria. During my experience I have gained a great deal of knowledge of unionists and of employers, which is not altogether useless to me when I am endeavouring to think out this question, and with such experience, backed by 35 years of economical reading, I assert that the same thing that I have described could be' done today if only the jingo spirit were not so dominant in this young country. It has disappeared from the United States and from Great Britain, and when it ' disappears from this country, and the workers recognise that capital is, after all, in the same relation to the workman as is the plough to the farmer-the means by which he carries on his work--the y will see that instead of treating capital as an antagonistic element which should be driven out of the country, it should be looked upon as a friend to be courted, to be invited to stay and try its hand in furthering the interests of the community. Then the days for compulsion in anything will disappear. It must be taken as an axiom of political economy that capital is as timid as the shyest of game. It can fly away, not upon wings, but upon cable wires. It may also be laid down with 'equal emphasis that capital will never stay where it does not receive the best treatment. The best treatment is the most conciliatory spirit and the fairest attitude towards it . If this is the fact why should this jingo spirit be displayed ? Cannot our working men see that in showing this spirit they are merely discouraging the advent of new capital, and encouraging the departure of old capital from the country, and so forcing themselves to return to first principles and elementary forms of work. I The capitalist puts his money into a venture admittedly in order that he may secure a reward for the use of it in the form of profit. The workmen of Australia say to the capitalist;- "" It is your capital and you put it into this business, but we are not going to allow you to manage it . AVe are going to appoint a board-it does not matter whether it is called a AVages Board together or Arbitration Court-to determine the wages which you shall pay to your employees. We know that you can go to other countries, such as the United States and Canada, jind there find employment for your capital, but you happen to be in Australia and your draft for £1,000 is here. therefore ask you to put that money into an industrial undertaking, and we shall manage it for you. We shall decide the rates of pay to be given to your workmen, the number of apprentices which you shall have, and the number of hours which your workmen shall be called upon to work. All these things will be decided by three men."" Now, who are these men? Not great industrial masters who have had years - of experience. In New South Wales one of them is a Judge of the Supreme Court- a lawyer-possibly , a man who has no more notion of practical commerce thanhasaclergy-jnan. I am not referring to the sitting President of the Arbitration Court in New South Wales, because it so happens that that .gentleman had some storekeeping experience before he went to the bar. I am speaking of what may happen.",22
56,Mr EOWLEU,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Is it a fact that the Aroiration Court manages the business ? Is it not true that it simply decides questions of justice between the two parties ?,24
57,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I say that it termines the rates of wages to be paid, and the honourable member will admit that this - must prove a very important factor in determining the prosperity of a business. The Arbitration Court also determines how - many apprentices the employer shall be allowed to train for carrying on the industry, and also the number of hours for which the workmen shall be employed. In fact, it would be difficult to name a single feature in the conduct of a business which does not come within the province of the court, Let me give an instance. In the southern, coal mining districts of New South Wales, only within the last six months, a mine manager found himself called upon to dismiss a certain number of hands. The question then arose whether he was the proper person to determine which of his hands were of least use to him, and which ib was most desirable to retain. The question was brought before the Arbitration Court of New South Wales, which solemnly declared that the manager - of the mine must, perforce, discharge the men last employed.",24
58,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That is the general custom. Mr BRUC E SMITH - What would become of our general commerce under such conditions ? Who is to have the management of our businesses ? I am pointing We oub whab will be the effecb upon the management of business when capital is supplied by an experienced individual, and when the management is taken out of his hands, and left to a body of men who may have no knowledge of business. I am giving instances of the comprehensive way in which the management of a concern is taken out of the hands of the owner of the capital, hy the decision of the Arbitration Courb, that, although an employer may consider that A and B are the least competent men in his employment, he must nob discharge bhem, bub musb choose from obhers, because they were the lasb taken on.",24
59,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"E v e n though matters of life and death may be involved, as in the case referred to.",24
60,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Yes . Although an employer may consider that certain men have been careless, and are not as competent as others to conduct their work with safety to their fellow employees, the court has said that the men who were last employed musb be firsb discharged. Would any honourable member who is nob steeped de- in bias say that that is nob practically managing the whole business of the capitalist for him, whilst requiring him to supply the wherewithal to carry ib on. I ask honourable members who are very much abbraoted by the compulsory arbitration scheme to first of all admit, that capital cannot be controlled, thab ib can coine or go ab will. Unless we are going bo pass a law laying an embargo upon all capital that comes into the country, the capitalist is free to take away his capital or leave it with us. We want it here. We cannot carry on our mines, or our shipping trade, or our manufactories without it . We can do nothing bub scrape the earth wibh our fingers unless we have capital, because even a spade or a plough represents capital. Wibh a full experience of trades unions and their methods, and of employers generally, I assert most positively that it is suicidal for the working classes of any country to take up an at.titude of antagonism towards capital, it is calculated to cause those who have money to invest it in other parts of the world where they are treated more fairly and more in accordance with the traditions of British commerce.",24
61,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Shoul d there not be a spirit of reciprocity between the two parties ? "" Mr BRUC E SMITH - Yes , I think there should be. We cannot look to the experience in Great Britain or the United States without finding that where employers have accumulated great wealth, they have displayed the utmost magnanimity, and the same spirit will be evinced all over the world under similar conditions. The moment, however, that the working classes adopt a jingo attitude towards their employers, the. breeches pockets of the latter are buttoned up, and they say- "" You shall have your pound of flesh, but no more."" I have watched the progress of industrial movements very carefully, and I can see the jingo spirit everywhere in Australia. We saw it displayed during the last great strike in Victoria. The jingo spirit will never generate in the employer those kindly feelings which lead to the expenditure of money in providing for the comfort and happiness of employees. When, however, that spirit disappears from Australia, as it has done from England and the United States, and we have a voluntary system of conciliation, such as has been adopted elsewhere, there will be a sort of millennium matters. It seems to me a very feasible and practicable millennium, in which theemployer and emploj c will shake hands, as I have seen 7 them do in the Melbourne Trades Hall, and become the best of friends. But I have also observed-and this is part of Victorian history-that as soon as the president or secretary of a union abandoned their jingoistic attitude, and adopted a more moderate tone towards their employers than did their predecessors, they ceased to satisfy the younger jingo spirits of the next generation, and their places were filled by some much more intractable individuals. Thus this feeling of antagonism was perpetuated.",25
62,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Surely that cannot be the case when the officers of the unions change everv twelve months.,25
63,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"During the term that I have mentioned the most harmonious relations existed, and even the Melbourne Age declared that I had been the greatest menace to the working classes of this country. But so far did I engender a feeling of good-will in this State that upon leaving it I carried with me one of the most complimentary letters from the president and secretary of the Trades Hall that a man could carry- a letter stating that I had brought about a better feeling between the two classes than had ever existed before. Although Arbitration Acts are in existence in New Zealand, - New South Wales, and Western Australia, honourable members are aware that quite recently, at a large meeting of trades unionists held in the firstnamed State, the Act was denounced as the greatest legislative curse which they had ever known. Those very words appear in the report of the proceedings published by the daily newspapers ; and so strong was the feeling of trades unionists in regard to several decisions, that Mr Seddon informed them that unless they exercised greater care they would break up the whole institution. We have the further testimony that quite recently in AVestern Australia the Chamber of Commerce passed a resolution, the effect of which was that as. its members were compelled to tolerate an arbitration board for a certain period, and to pay the artificially high wages which it produced, they did not see why the whole of the Commonwealth should not submit to the same ordeal.",25
64,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,-That was the Chamber of in industrial Manufactures.,25
65,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Its members wished the system to be extended to other States, not because of its beneficence, but because they had to tolerate its effects in artificially raising wages. If the result of such legislation in AVestern Australia is to artificially raise wages, thereby placing the employers of that State in an unfair position, what would be the effect of similar legislation upon Australia in its relations with the outside world 1",25
66,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,There are distinct signs of progress in AA estern Australia. 7,25
67,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"But it is still problematical whether that State will retain the capital which has hitherto been invested there. When we remember that this question is undoubtedly in its experimental stage, we ought to pause. I find that the New. Zealand correspondent of The Times, in a letter whiqh is referred to in a leading article, saysMeantime it is patent to any impnrtinl observer that there is a considerable amount of dissatisfaction with the working of the Arbitration Act, and once more the question may bj asked-""If these things'are done in the green tree, what maybe expected in the dry ?"" Although I am not prepared to commit myself to any definite statement as to the ultimate effect of this measure, the fact that it would practically compel the individual who provides the capital for any industry to submit the management of his business to aboard, whose members have no sympathy with him, induces the conclusion thab if the proposed legislation be enacted capital will cease bo How into the country in the way that ib has done, and much bhat is already here will depart. I heard of a little incident the other day in regard to Victoria which is worth repeating, especially as I can vouch for its truth. A representative of the company which manufactures such splendid woollen goods in New Zealand visited bhis State soon after the Tariff was passed. He had authority to look around Victoria, and ascertain if it were possible to embark -£100,000 in a similar industry here. Whilst here his attention was directed to the existence of wages boards, which are equivalent bo the Arbitration Court of New Zealand. A fortnight after commencing hi-s inquiries, in reply to a question pub by a friend, he used bhis impolite language-""No b one damned copper will be sunk in the industry in this State."" Sir. STAUOHR - Ye the has to submit to an Arbitration Court in New Zealand. Sir. BRUCE SMITH - That is so ; but whethei: the £.100,000 will be invested in New Zealand I do not know. I repeat that honourable members oughb bo pause before attempting to extend bhis system bo the whole of Australia. I know bhat the intention is to make it applicable only to industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State : but I hold that we might well defer the consideration of it until we ascertain whether the operation of similar measures in New Zealand, New South Wales, and Western Australia can be regarded as a success. Passing from thab question, I come to that of the Inber-Sbabe Commission Bill. Most honourable members must be surprised to learn that, notwithstanding all the protests made by the Government regarding the sufficiency of the Bill submitted to Parliament last session, they have tai-dily admitted thab ib was wrongly conceived in bhat ibs provisions were made applicable bo ocean-going steamers. They now confess that it was wrongtoattempt a sort of inquisition inbo the financial arrangements of the different companies whose steamers ply between other countries and Australia. The objectionable provisions referred to have now been eliminated from the Bill. In this connection I feel somewhat complimented that a libtle production of my own, which was republished by the Shipping Federation of Australia, pointed oub the enormity of those proposals. The* idea bhat, in order bo guarantee the equitableadjustment of freights between the differentStates, we should havearrogated to ourselvestherightbo control such greab companies as the SI essageries Maritimes, the P. and O., and Orient, and to pry into the whole of their financial conditions, was a preposterous one. Those provisions have now been» abolished, and the measure, I apprehend, will come forward in a somewhat similar form to that adopted in the United States. No one can question the wisdom of seeing that no means, of carriage between one State and another is allowed to exisb which would have the eileob of neutralizing thab absolute free trade which we wish bo establish. If the Bill, when it is submitted, is true bo the principles which I have indicated, instead of opposing ib, I shall do my besb to assisb the Governmenb in passing ib into law. A b this stage I do nob wish to deal with the question of preferential trade. 1I have commented upon the facb that the Prime Minisber had promised bo submit some proposals to us in bhis connection. I think that they oughbtohave been submitted. The Ministry,, however, having resolved to keep them back, I should have been very' glad indeed to have heard a speech upon the subject from the Prime Minister. Sly opinion is. thab by adopting preferential trade relations with the mother country, instead of binding ourselves to ib by means of stronger cords, we should have made use of a. mechanical contrivance which would have been irksome. The bies which bind us bobhe mother counbry are those of blood, affection, and common interests, and theseconsiderations are more elastic than would be any written agreement at which we could arrive. Sir. Chamberlain's attempt to introduce this sysbem, however wise ib may be upon high Imperial grounds, was quibe premature as regards these States. AVe must remember that, so far, the Secretary of State has visited only what are practically Crown colonies, namely, the South African States. He has nob had any experience of Sbates like our own, where we have fiscal Arrangements peculiar to ourselves, and which Are not alterable at a moment's notice. I suppose that he was not aware that under - our Constitution we were bound during the next seven and a-half years to carry on all work of the Commonwealth Government and to provide the States with sufficient revenue for the maintenance of many of their institutions through the Customs department. Had he realized that twelve months or more were occupied in enabling members of this Parliament to agree to a so-called fair fiscal compromise, he would have understood the practical impossibility of the people of the Commonwealth re-opening the Tariff - question at a moment's notice with the idea of settling it in two different columns-one for the British people, and one for foreign - countries. I hold that the electors of Australia aie too busy to rise to these great Imperial considerations at the present day. The change must come in a settled community, where there is a large majority of people of leisure. Then local affairs can for a moment be put aside, and great Imperial aspirations can be looked into And considered. To suppose that we can shut our eyes to the necessities Arise out of the Braddon clause ; that we can sit down at a moment's notice and .settle our Tariff in a double column to suit the British Empire on the one hand and foreign countries on the other : to assume that we expect Great Britain to change her fiscal policy and tax the whole of her foods to realise this aspiration, is ridiculous. I formed the opinion days and weeks ago, and I hold that opinion today, that the primary purpose of this proposal was that Mr Chamberlain might offer a menace to the people of countries like Germany,, who are trifling with the British people in regard to their Tariffo, and, secondly, that there should be a political move in .anticipation of the next general election. When we see the lande.l classes of England - offered a sop in the shape of protective duties on foods, which means an enhanced, value to their lands, and the working' classes offered an unconditional pensions scheme, we can readily believe that Mr Chamberlain considers he has laid the bait for the two great extremes of British society, and that he deems them sufficient to secure the success of the present Government at the next general election, which we may depend would have come much sooner if the bait had been taken, Mr Bruce Smith. and if the people had responded to the call ' made on them. The scheme of Mr Chamberlain is impracticable, and the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the his Government think so. I am willing to endorse that view of the Government, but at the same time. I think ib is a great pity for Australia that the Prime Minister should have inspired a cablegram which seems to confirm the assurance he previously gave to Mr Chamberlain lhat the people were with him, and thab a sympabhebic response mighb be relied on if the proposal were adopted by other parts of the British Empire. I have already said that the reference to the Inter-State railway to Western Australia is a parb of the padding in the speech of His Excellency, and most honourable members will admib that I am right. T have seen the report of the gentlemen who visibed Western Australia in connection wibh bhis proposed railway, and I have spoken bo some of them ; bub taking the report itself, whab does ib amount to ? Months ago, when discussing the question, I said that such a railway would cosb £6,000,000; and the reporb that shows that, albhough the gentlemen to whom I have referred have never been on the line of railway except as approaching it from the greab Australian Bighb, and although they know nothing of - the later capabilities of the route-the y do not know today whether water will be found on any part of the line of railwaythey, without that knowledge, and after making what is necessarily a wild estimate of the possible trade across this great continent, estimate the cost at about £5,500,000. We all know what estimates are when they are made in the dark, and this estimate is confessedly made in the dark. On the face of it this is an interim, report made on the most meagre and insufficient data. There has been no survey, but if the Government are sufficiently impressed with the preliminary report of the commission to justify a further reporb, and if. the further reporb is sabisfacbory, there may be entered on a old-age survey which I am told, on good authority, will take years to make.",25
68,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,No .,27
69,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Such a survey would certainly take two or three years. - Mr FOWLER - A couple of years.,27
70,Sir JOHN FOHHEST,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That depends on how many men are engaged on the survey.,27
71,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The Minister for Defence is a man for whom I have the most profound respect, but I am afraid he has what Emerson calls ""an inflammation on his mind,"" and it is this Inter-State railway. We .all remember the drastic way in which the Minister for Defence threatened to break up the Government and the Commonwealth if this railway were not constructed. That - of course was done in the spirit of Gilbert - and Sullivan, because we know that such a line is an impossibility.",28
72,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Startin g simultaneously from each end, the survey could be made i u .a vear easily.",28
73,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I admit that in the future this railway may be constructed ; but to speak of it as required for defence purposes is to advocate it on its weakest ground.,28
74,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Militar y authorities regard the line as necessary to defence.,28
75,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In order to construct a .railway capable of carrying troops across, what I shall not call a desert for fear of offending the Minister for Defence",28
76,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Cal l it waterless country.,28
77,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In order to construct a railway across waterless country for a distance of something like 2,000 miles",28
78,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"IS o \ no. Mr BRU CE SMITH - I am taking the whole distance from Fremantle to Adelaide, And I say that to use the defence argument in favour of its immediate construction is to put the question on its weakest and most laughable ground. There is no doubt that in the future a railway to Western Australia, like a railway connecting Adelaide with the Northern Territory, or a line fiom Bourke across to the north-western corner - of Australia, may be constructed. But it is of no use for the Government to play with the Western Australian people by pretending that this Interstate railway is really within the domain of practical politics. Mr FowLER -^-The right - honourable member for East S\ dney says that the line is within the domain of practical politics ",28
79,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In my opinion, the right honourable member for East Sydney is no authority on such a question. The right honourable member, when he expressed the opinion, was a guest of the Western Australian people, and we all know that it is one of the conventions to say pleasant things to one's hostess or host, even if we stretch the truth a little.",28
80,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Wester n Australia will not forget the expression of opinion.,28
81,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am sure that none of the honourable members for Western Australia regard the promise of the Government as a serious' one. However glibly, with their tongues in their cheeks, they talk, to their constituents about the time when the great west shall become connected with the great east, they know in their hearts that such an undertaking is for future years. It is for that reason, I say, that the reference to the Inter-State railway is a piece of padding in the speech of His Excellency the Governor General. I do not want to go on at much greater length, but I should like to say a word about the mail contract. We are told that great companies like the P. and 0. and the Orient companies are to be compelled, if they are to retain their present subsidies, to change their black labour to white labour! I can quite understand, although I cannot altogether sympathize with the desire to keep Australia pure. That is an aspiration as to which I may keep my tongue in my cheek ; but for electioneering purposes it is a very fine cry. We have now measures designed to preserve a white Australia, and I hope we shall be all the better for our racial purity; but it is proposed to take a step further in a direction which no man can call practical. It is ridiculous for us to say- "" We are . not content to keep Australia free-no t only from alien races, but from our fellow subjects in other parts of the Empire-w e must also insist on our shores not being contaminated by a steamer with black men aboard."" Is that not a most degrading sop to the wildest socialism of Australia 1 Why do we not say that we will not use anything touched by black hands 1 Why not, just as Mahomedans do in regard to Christians, refuse to touch a plate from which an alien has eaten 1 Why not go to these wild extremes ? These great steamship lines do not depend on Australia for their great profits r",28
82,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Does Australia depend on them ?,28
83,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No ; but we must depend on somebody to run our mails, and it is a question whether this cry for racial purity is going to be carried to such an extent that we shall be compelled to pay £200,000 or £300,000, or perhaps only £100,000, more 460 Governor General's Speech: [REPRESENTATIVES.] in order to prevent any steamer coming to our ports with black men in the forecastle.",28
84,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,This matter does not affect our racial purity.,29
85,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The law was passed on the ground of racial purity.,29
86,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,On what ground was it passed ? Mr G. P.. EDWARDS - On the ground of getting British ships maimed by British seamen.,29
87,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Are British ships now manned by British men ? If the honourable member for South Sydney will look up any recognised authority, he will find that a large proportion of the mercantile marine of England is manned by Germans, Danes, Swedes, Norwegians, and Scandinavians generally. That only shows that the British"" ship-owner has to run his ships on the most economical lines in competition with those of other countries. It means thatthegreat national asset of England, her mercantile shipping, of which we are never tired of boasting, must, if the conditions are unfair, go to the wall, and the marines of other countries be allowed to dominate us.",29
88,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Whit e labour on these vessels is advocated by some of the most influential newspapers in England.,29
89,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That may be so, but I do not think m'uch of the advocacy of newspapers; it is usually coloured by subscribers and the editors' motives.",29
90,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"And by advertisements. . Mr BRUC E SMI TH - And by adversure tisements. The success of the merchant shipping of England depends on its being able to compete with other countries, and carry on its work with a modeof rate profit. We know that if instead of using foreign sailors, who seem to suit better and do the work for less wages, ship-owners were compelled to take Englishmen at higher rates of pay, it would mean that ou one side of the balance-sheet there would be a much larger debit than there is at present. That increased debit must mean that the ship-owners cannot compete with .foreign ship-owners, and that the latter must finally dominate the shipping interests of the world. Do we want that? Is our desire to avoid contamination and to see ships manned wholly by white so strong that we are prepared to pay 13,000,000, £100,000 or £200,000 a year more to the mail steamers ? Are we satisfied to see English shipping go to the wall in competition Address in Reply. with theshippingof other countries ? Are we satisfied toseethecarryingtradeinthe hands of German and French steamers, which are subsidized to three or four times the extent not of the P. and O. or Orient steamers ?",29
91,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The German and French steamers are manned wholly by Germansand Frenchmen. Mr BRUC E SMITH - Ver y likely ; but I am talking of the business aspect of the question. Lot ships be manned by pure Germans, pure Frenchmen, or pure Japanese; but it must be remembered they come here in competition with British ships. We propose now not only not to subsidize British shipping companies, but to place an incubus on them, and render their position more difficult than before. I may, of course, be wrong in the views I take. I know I am out of touch upon many of the great problems of the day with ninety-nine hundredths of honourable members, but this lean bear with the utmost good nature. 1 know that in many cases I beat the wind in this Chamber, and I sometimes feel like a child crying in the wilderness ; but I think I do sometimes strike a key-note which may send home an honourable member who will think that at least I mean what I say, and that there is, may be, some truth and genuineness in the suggestions I make. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",29
92,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I would like to say, in order to put the other side of the shield, that I shall have the utmost pleai n supporting the High Court Bill . I do not know whether honourable members think that after the speeches of the kind I make, there is much chance any return being made to me for my supp-ji-t. I think not; at any rate I do not want any return. I shall give my hearty support to the proposed increased contribution to the naval defences of the Empire. I cannot get over the great looming fact that Great Britain spreads her protecting wings over us, as she does over all parts of the Empire, and that she spends annually about £32,000,000 on her navy. Great Britain - has a population of about 40,0u0,000, and the annual expenditure upon the British navy is about £34,500,000. If we take the white population of the men Empire outside Great Britain at about it will be seen that it is, roughly speaking, one-third of the population of Great Britain itself. Now, if we recognise that the Imperial navy, whatever may be the purposes of England, has the effect of guaranteeing the safety of our shipping, as well as that of England, to us and to every other part of the Empire, and - of enabling us to live in quietness, without the fear of invasion by any one of the many peoples whom we by our legislation so - openly insult, we must admit that our contribution should approach in some way a fair proportion according to population. But hitherto we have contributed only £120,000 - a year, and it is now proposed that we .shall contribute £200,000 a year, which is, roughly speaking, only one-fifteenth of what - our contribution should be according to population.",29
93,Mr CONUOV,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,-But we have no voice in - determining questions of peace or war.,30
94,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If it is contended that there should be no contribution without representation, or that the contribution must be in proportion to representation, I ask what would be our proportion of representation according to contribution? On our present contribution we should have only one representative in the House of Commons. But the views expressed by the representatives of Australia at the great Imperial consultations which are held from time to time, and at which both the head of the Government and the leader of the Opposition have within the last few years been present, exercise a far greater influence in the councils of the Empire than would be exercised by our proportional representation in the House of Commons. Why, then, should we quibble upon the question of representation? If we contributed in proportion to population, we might ask for an Imperial Parliament in which Australia should be represented : but if we were so represented we should be absolutely bound by the decisions of that body. Now, however, we are in the happy position of being able to offer advice and counsel to the Ministers of the Empire without responsibility. We have only recently had an instance of such action. The head of the Government promised the Secretary of State for the Colonies that ho would submit his preferential scheme of duties to this Parliament, but he has not clone so, and who can make him do so? But if an Imperial Parliament in which Australia was represented had taken the matter in hand, its decision would have to be complied with, and who can picture the friction which would have occurred here when it was found that we were bound at its dictation to consider the matter of preferential trade. The natural sympathy between Australia, and the mother country will be a sufficient bond between them for many years to come. AVe are not concerned with the desire of a great statesman to consummate his magnificent career by some large scheme if it does not coincide with our interests. I join heartily with the Government in their desire to increase the naval subsidy, and I - hope that the time will not be long before we shall offer, according to our means, a much larger sum than we are offering now. AVho can doubt that the people, of Australia, taking into consideration the condition of the daily lives of our population, are better able to contribute to a fund of this sort, man for man, than are the people of England, with their carping poverty and distress? ' That being so, are we not wanting in that great Imperial spirit of which we so often boast, when we fail to come forward and say- "" AVe will contribute our proportion to this great fund from which we derive so much comfort in the protection of our personal interests 1"" I shall be very happy to support also any Defence Bill which is founded upon the recommendation of the most skilled men the Government can find, and to vote for the establishment of a High Commissioner in London. I favour, too, the adoption of uniform patent laws. AVe are apt to under-estimate the importance of uniform patent laws to the whole of Australia ; but the difficulties which, personally and professionally, I have known men to suffer in connection with the registration of patents in Australia show me that much dishearten ment and disappointment occur under the present system. A very simple Bill, to which no opposition-could be urged, might be passed, and its effect should be to encourage the inventive genius of the people of Australia, and to give us a better chance of industrial Success in the future. W it h these comments I conclude myremarks. Speaking generally, I shall be very glad, apart from the criticism I have offered, to give the Government every assistance"" When I am here,"" the Minister for Trade and Customs will say. He has the magnanimity never to fail to remind my constituents that I do not attend the meetings of the House as often as he does, but when, like him, I am offered a salary of £2,500 a year, I shall be willing to put aside my own private business, and devote myself as entirely to Commonwealth affairs as he does.",30
95,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Wit h regard to the concluding sentence of the honourable and learned member for Parkes, I should like to say that I have never, when on the platform, made any references to his absence from this House, though in an exchange of courtesies now and again in this chamber I have called attention to the fact that he is not here so often as we should like to see him. I do not think that he need take exception to that statement. Mr Bruce S.MITU - Of course the right honourable member regrets the fact.",31
96,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do. When he rose he indulged in remarks of a character which induced ine to think that they called for some retort, but his subsequent observations were much more pleasant, so that I do not now think it necessary to reply to him in kind. The criticisms in which he indulged at the expense of the Government were of a very general character. His remarks ranged from the actions of the Imperial Government, and of one of the most distinguished statesmen of modern times-the Secretary of State for the Colonies-to those of our humble selves, and perhaps we should be pleased to be grouped with the Imperial Government, even in depreciatory criticism. In my opinion we have reason to beproud that a statesman of the calibre of Mr Ghamberlain has addressed himself to the question of preferential trade between the various parts of the Empire. The criticisms of gentlemen who have accepted the theory that in trade nothing but cheapness is to be valued, and who decline to give the slightest consideration to questions of Empire and kinship, are not likely to induce Australians to come to a wrong conclusion as to the value of the action which is evidently now contemplated by the British Government. Sentiment, they say, rules the world, and sentiment, practically expressed, appeals to all j but sentiment which finds no expression in action is worthless. . What is the value of the talk about Imperial sentiment and of the ties which constitute the Empire which we all believe in our hearts, if we are to know no citizenship so far as trade is concerned, and to recognize no distinction between those whose hands may be, and have been, raised in our defence in times of distress and difficulty, and those who at the earliest opportunity would drag the national, honour in the mud, and destroy our traditions and reputation ? May the time speedily come .in which, as regards trade affairs, we shall be found willing to make some littlesacrifice for those who rightly claim to beour kith and kin, who subscribe to the sameconditions of commerce and labour as we do, and with whom practical expressions of friendship should exist. It is a source of great disappointment to many that hithertono preference has been shown by Great Britain to her colonies, or by her colonies to G reatBritain; but may the time speediIy come when some arrangement in that direction may be made which will be satisfactory to both thecontracting parties. I do not forget our difficulties in the way of revenue, but ib is patent that we might give the United Kingdom preference over foreign countrieswithout any inexpedient loss of revenueby keeping our duties as they are, so far asEngland is concerned, and raising them against others whom we have no reason tosimilarly favour. What is the value of our patriotism-and imperialism if we do not differentiate between our brothers and thecitizens of the mother country, and those who would willingly bring about our downfall at the earliest opportunity ? Those whobrag about the connection, with the Empire, and refuse to give her peoplethe slightest consideration, are undoubtedly open to blame. Consideration of the present position is being forced upon Britain by the action of Canada, and I venture to think that British statesmen will rise to the occasion. What is the position ? Canada gave a preference to Great Britain without receivinganything in exchange.",31
97,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Sh e had the benefit of open ports.,31
98,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"She received nothing in a protectionist or reciprocally preferential commercial sense. What was. the further result? The benefits which Canada had previously enjoyed in relation to foreign trade, and which Great Britain had also enjoyed and continued to enjoy, were taken from her by German retaliation. Thus Canada's preferencein for her own mother country resulted in her being deprived of privileges whichshe had formerly enjoyed, and being subjected to disadvantages to which she had' not previously been called upon to submit. Under such circumstances, British sentiment in relation to her colonies. has found practical expression in the words of the Prime Minister of England and Mr Chamberlain. We find moreover that German)' has practically retired from her position, and that Canada is not likely after all io be seriously penalized for the magnanimous attitude she assumed towards the mother land. The time has come of which we have every reason to be proud. We have also reason to regard with pride that statesman who has taken such a prominent part in this movement. The honourable member for Parramatta referred to Mr. Chamberlain as having resorted to a political dodge. The honourable member may know all about dodges, but he does not know very much about Mr Chamberlain. I hope that there ""will be no uncertain sound in this connection, and that it will be made known, despite the outcry of free-trade faddists, that Australia appreciates what is proposed by Great Britain, and that she will welcome the day when the details can be worked out, and some satisfactory arrangement arrived at. At present the Government are subject to adverse criticism, because they have not proposed this, that, and the other ; but our present duty is to wait. The British Government intend to appeal to the country, and I venture to think that our duty is to wait, and to wish, and to hope, and to hold ourselves in readiness to support the mother country in every possible way. We should make it known at the earliest possible moment that Australia will be only too glad to take advantage of the opportunity which Britain proposes to give us. The Empire which does not recognise, in matters of this kind anything in the shape of citizenship, but treats the enemy of tomorrow in the same way as its friends and citizens of today, which does not concede the right of mutual consideration between citizens and mother country, which does not mark the distinction between foreigners and bhose who belong bo ib, cannob stand. Therefore, let us hope that such condibions of instability as do exisb may be replaced at an early date by a better state of affairs, in which the national sentiment shall find practical expression by assent to proposals which it is evident the British Governmenb propose bo make ab the earliesb possible opporbuniby.",31
99,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The British Cabinet is divided on the subject.,32
100,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Beally , after the statements which have been made by the bwo genblemen who are ab the head of the British Cabineb, ib would appear that the honourable member has spoken without reflection. When a declaration has been made on the floor of the House of Commons, by Mr Balfour and Mr Chamberlain, telling the whole world that the Cabinet are in agreement, what is the use of the feeble pipe of the honourable member foiDalley 1-for whom, personally, of course I have the greatest respect.",32
101,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The ballob-box will not speak wibh any feeble pipe. ',32
102,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Order ! I musb direct the attention of the honourable member for Dalley to his frequent disregard of the standing orders relating bo inberjections. I musb ask him to discohbinue bhese inberrupbions.,32
103,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The British Governmenb have acted in view of the elections, and have unfolded a programme of which their announcement relating to preferential trade will form a leading feature. Knowing whab we clo of the asbuteness and statesmanship of' the Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain, it may be baken for granted that he feels that the Governmenb programme is one which will appeal bo the greab heart of the British people. I venture to think that that programme will be appreciabed, as ib oughb bo be, here in Australia, and in the other colonies of the Empire, which have too long mourned the absence of some such proposal as thab now pub forward. I had intended to allow inyself to say a few words at the expense of the honourable and learned member for Parkes, but in his absence I scarcely care to do so. I might, perhaps, say that it is a pity that the remarks of the honourable and learned member should be characterized by what is apparently - of course I may be mistaken - insufferable egotism. The honourable and learned member has associated the word "" hypocrite"" with the Prime Minister. Who believes for an insbanb that hypocrisy is a characteristic of my right honourable friend ? Then the honourable and learned member talks about "" swollen"" utterances. I do not know what is the worse thing that one could behold in the way of "" swelling visibly."" I believe that there would be a close contest between a pouter pigeon and a poisoned pup ; but these two represenbabives of the animal kingdom would hide their diminished heads in a competition with the honourable and learned member for Parkes when he rises to let himself loose. "" Hypocrisy!"" -""Swollen!"" Do honourable members think that these are proper words to use in that connection ?",32
104,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,They are quite as fitting as the' right honourable gentleman's reference to a poisoned pup.,33
105,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"On a dog matter, no doubt, the honourable member may be an able judge. The arguments of the honourable and learned member for Parkes were most inconsistent. First he found fault with the Prime Minister for administering the law, and afterwards rated him from a different point of view altogether for not administering it . The arguments of the honourable and learned member were mutually destructive. I contend that if a law is proposed in this House, those who are opposed to it should get up and fight against it. Do not let one honourable member s a y - "" I was asleep,"" or another say - "" I was not here."" It is the duty of all honourable members to be awake. It is their duty to be here. And if, as the result of their somnolence or absence, legislation is passed with which they cannot agree, or which, from their point of view, is injurious to the Commonwealth, they are all the more to blame. It does not become them to attend here at rare intervals, and then rate their fellow members who have been applying themselves to their work and who agree with the law. The honourable member for Parkes said that the law provided that immigrants were not allowed to come in here under contract unless the Prime Minister had ascertained that they were required. That is the law. Anybody who finds an expression of the popular will embodied in a Bill, and who disagrees with it , should strike at it immediately. If , however, the measure becomes an Act, no Minister can hold his seat and refuse to execute it without being a traitor to his country and the law. That law was intended to be executed.",33
106,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It is not being carried out now.,33
107,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It is. I venture to say that the law is being as thoroughly and faithfully executed as any Act ever was. Has the Government failed in its duty 1 We have the law for our direction, and it is interpreted by the honourable and learned member for Parkes as requiring the Prime Minister to do what he actually did. My right honourable colleague would have been a coward and a traitor if he had not done what he did. There was no dispute as to his duty. Are we to pass Acts simply to tickle the public ear, to offer the people something, and then snatch ib from their grasp ? I say "" No."" I am proud bo ser.ve under the Prime Minisber, who is determined bo keep the word of promise bo the hope as well as to the ear. I desire to make some reference to the remarks which have fallen from honourable members as to certain Maoris having been prevented from entering the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister had nothing br> do wibh the action that was baken in regard bo bhem. He did nob know anybhing aboub ib until ib was all over, because the stoppage which wassuggesbed was of the purest bechnical characber, and all bhose concerned were more than pleased wibh whab was done. These Maoris were members of Fibzgerald's circus broupe. On their arrival at night they were refused admission by the Customs officer, bub when the matter was referred bo the Collecbor of Customs nexb morning an exemption cerbificabe for three months was issued immediately. What more do honourable members want ? The Customs officer executed the law, and the nexb morning an exemption was granbed by the collector. A telegram which was received on the subject goes further, and states-- "" Fitzgerald Bros, express 'bhemselves as perfecbly satisfied, bub wish extension for twelve months."" The extension was given immediately, and a further notification was conveyed to Messrs. Fitzgerald that if they wanted anything else in that connection it would be done. There is no doubt aboutour sentiments in connection with the admission of immigrants. Of course,. Maoris are treated in a manner entirely different from aboriginals of Australia. We have specially exempted bhem, and very properly, from the prohibition which abtaches to aboricinals in connection with the franchise. As regards the fuss which has been made in this connection, I say that it clearly reveals the fact that the Prime Minister did his duty ; aye, and he is always prepared to do his duty.",33
108,Mr WINTER COOKE,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Under what authority is a temporary permit granted 1,33
109,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Unde r the authority of the Immigration Restriction Act. I could not avoid laughing when the honourable and learned member for Parkes, who really ought to know all about history, because he looks so like it , sneered at Mr. Chamberlain, and asked-""What does he know, seeing that he has visited only Crown colonies "" ? Good gracious ! What about Cape Colony and Natal ? Are they merely Crown colonies ?",34
110,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Thei r Constitutions are suspended so that the honourable and learned member was perfectly correct. Honorable MEMBERS - No , no.",34
111,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I think that the honourable member for Coolgardie will find that his statement is incorrect, and that both colonies possess constitutional government.",34
112,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Thei r Constitutions were suspended during the recent war.,34
113,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Do they not possess responsible government? When Mr. Chamberlain was there, were they not so governed ?",34
114,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I do not know.,34
115,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The honourable member does know, and ought to acknowledge that that is so. Open confession is good for the soul, and I believe that the withdrawal of the stigma cast upon Natal and Cape Colony by the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Parkes that they' are Crown colonies, will be performed by him with all possible despatch. At different times various hard things have been said about myself. I have listened with interest to a number of them, and I should like to say a word or two in regard to those criticisms. I confess that I was fairly pleased to find that, though the language used by some of my critics was intended to be severe, the reception given to ib by the House showed unmistakably that honourable members were not disposed to believe that I would wittingly treat one man differently from another.",34
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Hear , hear.",34
117,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I feel certain of that, and I wonder, bherefore, why one or bwo honourable members did nob say a libble less bhan they did. The principal suggestion which has been made is founded upon a petition presented by the Colonial Sugar Company. The effect of that suggestion - undoubtedly is that in the collection of excise upon sugar I have treated one company' differently from another. All I can say is that I have never done anything of the sort.",34
118,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I made no insinuation that such treatment was intended. I stated that I did not know the facts.,34
119,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am not complaining of the observations of the honourable member for North Sydney. I know per : fectly well that he did not suggest an improper act, or that I . had dealt with one company in a way differenb from that in which I had treated anobher.",34
120,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Some people suggesb that.,34
121,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"And ib is nob worthwhile taking any notice of some of those people. The allegations conbained in the petition from the Colonial Sugar Company isThat' whilst stocks of purchased sugiir held by the company in their free stores were seized and levied on, no excise or other duty was levied on stocks in other factories, expressly"" referred to as coming under the operation of the Excise Acts, nor were such stocks seized, though those in breweries were under Customs supervision, and were subsequently used in the production of beer, under Customs authority. Ib then proceeds bo particularize as followsThat although the company s stock of refined sugiir in their free store was seized and excise levied thereon, a larger quantity, the property of the Millaquin and Yengarie Sugar Company, and other white sugars, made and owned by .Gibson and Howes, H. E. and A. Young, the Nerang Central Sugar Mills, and Wood Brothers and Boyd, all at the time in the stock, custodj' and possession of the said manufacturers respectively, were not seized, but were permitted to be delivered free of of excise, such sugar amounting in all to over 9,000 tons, and'liable thereforeif your petitioners' stocks were rightly seizedto duty in the amount of £27,000 was allowed by an officer of Customs to be sold and distributed in the State of Queensland without the payment of excise which was levied on the stocks of your petitioners, and without, so far as .your petitioners can ascertain, any inquiry by' the Customs department as to the quantity of ""sugar thus held, or the places in which such sugar was stored. I am sure that honourable members will not come to the conclusion that the Millaquin Company, Messrs Gibson, Howes, and obhers, were allowed', bo clear their sugar free.",34
122,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Not clear it .,34
123,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am satisfied that honourable members will nob believe that any differentiation WHS made bebween the mills. If I were guilty of such conduct as that, I would not stand here. I would not face the House. I say, further, that if I thought any section of the House worthy of the name, believed that I could be guilty of such conduct I should be sorry indeed, and glad enough to justify myself at any time or place. This matter has been repeatedly explained. It was the subject of discussion time and again last year in the Senate.",34
124,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Who gave the explanation of it ?,35
125,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The Vice-President of the Executive Council. It was on the Sth of October, 1901, that we imposed the sugar excise. That was the date upon which the Tariff was introduced. Part of the 1901 season, therefore, which commenced in June or Jul} , had expired. There was bound to be some sugar which had passed into consumption, and which it was impossible to pursue into the teacup, or even into the private store. What we decided to do was to seize all that was in the factories or in stores belonging to them.",35
126,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The law "" stock, custody, or possession.""",35
127,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The honourable member will recollect that on the Sth of October, 1901, there was no law in existence. We did not enact legislation upon this subject t ill some months after. The Tariff Excise Bill was not drafted until some time earl} in 1902. Therefore, we had to. consider what we should do. It was a moot question whether or not we should collect duty upon sugar which had been manufactured - prior to the introduction of the Tariff. We therefore decided advisedly to seize all the sugar in the excise factories and refineries, and in the mills belonging to them, and resolved, as regards the other, to await the authority of Parliament, which we hoped to receive in due course",35
128,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,W as that fair to the other companies ?,35
129,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Yes . We could not pursue sugar which had gone into consumption before the Sth of October. We could deal only with that which remained for consumption.,35
130,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLIAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The Minister has given his whole case away.,35
131,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The honourable member for Wentworth will allow me to finish my remarks before he comes to such a delightful conclusion upon the whole subject. I was"" informed that the Colonial Sugar Company complained of some action of mines in this connection.",35
132,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,On the 18th of October.,35
133,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not think it was so early as that. What was done ? The Comptroller-General, who heard of the matter in Sydney, telegraphed at once that no difference was to be made between the treatment accorded to the Colonial Sugar Company and that meted out to any ether company. When it got to my ears",35
134,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Did not the Minister know of it before 1,35
135,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"When the matterreached my ears I spoke to my officer in warm terms, which are not likely to beforgotten. I issued instructions that the7 same treatment was to be accorded to all, and that course has been adopted from beginning to end.",35
136,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It is questionable whether that instruction was carried out,35
137,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"-When the petition was forwarded in September last, Mr . says in the Lockj er was Acting Comptroller-Geiieral,. 7 and he telegraphed",35
138,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That was after several communications had been made upon the matter.,35
139,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I would point out to honourable members that several attacks have7 been made on the Minister during the course, of this debate, and, for example, no later than last evening, there was not a whisper heard when the honourable member for Wentworth was speaking. In common fairness I ask that the Minister shall be allowed to proceed without interruption.",35
140,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I have searched high and low for all the communications that ibis possible to obtain in this connection. I have a number of them here, and I think I shall be able to show enough of them tosatisfy honourable members generally. Thesbing of the petition is bo be found in bheallegation that certain men have been singled oub for special treatment. Nothing of bhesorb. All have .been treated alike. As I was saying, the Acting Comptroller-General, wiredColonial Sugar Refining Company have petitioned Governor General re excise on sugarcharged on stocks of raw and refined sugar manufactured and purchased by company before dateof introduction of Tariff, and held by company in Queensland in free stores, which were not subjectto customs or excise control prior to introduction of Tariff. Petition sets out that while thecompany's stocks were charged excise, the stocks: of sugar in breweries and other excise factories T h mentioned in the Excise Act were not charged excise. Petition further alleges that a large quantity of sugar, the property of Millaquin and Yengarie Company, and other white sugar We owned by Gibson and Howes, H . E. and A. Vuung, the Nerang Central Mill, and Wood Bros, and Boyd, all the time in their stock, custody, and possession on the introduction of the was not charged excise, but was delivered free. Petition states this sugar amounted to over nine thousand tons. Minister desires immediately full report as to these allegations, especially re that of discrimination between the mills, he cannot believe has occurred. The following reply was sent by Mr . Irving:Sir,- I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your wire of the Kith instant rt. petition of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to the Governor General, and the Minister's structions for a full report and especially that of discrimination between the mills. 1. ""That while the company's stocks were charged excise, the stocks of susrar in breweries and other excise factories mentioned in the Excise Act were charged excise."" In reply to the above I have to state that, on the receipt of a confidential wire dated 3rd ber, 1901, from the Comptroller-General, "" Act as if excise duty will be collected, on sugar from 9th instant, and see necessary arrangements for officers taking stock, &c, are made."" Officers were instructed accordingly October, and the stocks of sugar were taken in all factory and refinery premises in the State on the of ownership by the manufacturer. morning of the 9th idem. Do honourable members see whab t h a means ? Just fancy an officer discriminating, or an instruction being given to treat one differently from another ! man who ever dreamt of such at h in g and you"" show me a dishonest man. The comdelay. munication continues The total quantity of sugar ascertained in the factories was 16,803 tons 17 cwt., distri- j i l t e d as follows :Colonial Sugar Kenning Company, Brisbane.

Mr KINGSTON - I mean the firm were h it harder in that d u t y had to be paid the on nearly 8,000 tons, whilst the company inwho complained had to pay d u t y on only upon the allegations, 5,000 tons.",36
142,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"What about the 9,000 tons?",36
143,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"P r o b a b l y this sugar was got out before the Sth of October; we not - know how smart merchants are, and we did not feel justified in seizing sugar which Octowas not in the facbory or its store. It is viz., one bhing to go to a m ill store, and another t h in g to pursue sugar all over the country into merchants' private stores, or in to private houses. We did what was r i g h t when on the Sth we took that which we could get, and which bore on its face p r i m d f a c i e evidence We did nob try to do what was unreasonable t or impracticable, but we did what was our duty. If we find out that there was m ill any dutiable sugar belonging to any mills Show me the at that time, we shall be only too pleased to collect the revenue with o u t a moment's",36
144,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,May I poinb oub that all to be thab is asked for is an in q u i ry ?,36
145,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am now g i v in g the results of an inquiry ; at any rate this matTons. Cwt.

The f o l 6,28 3 3 3 lowing question was asked in the Senabe : 1. Whether it is true, as alleged by the ColoBundaberg. nial Sugar Refining Company, that no excise Tons. Cwt.

If so, what was the reason for such differen16,803 17 0 tial treatment. The reply wasThere was no differential treatment. Customs Control was taken of all sugar in the possession of manufacturer on their factory premises. It was not found practicable to do this as regards sugar which had left the factory, and which uppeared to have gone into consumption except on Inter-State transfer.",36
146,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The sugar referred to had not got into consumption.,37
147,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I know the honourable member for North Sydney is a reasonable man, and I know lie will follow me when I say that there was a risk of losing our proposal for the duty on the stuff which had been passed into consumption before the Sth of October ; and we were perfectly justified in doing what we did in regard to the sugar in stock. To follow the sugar into the merchants' stores is a step which I am sure the honourable member would not - have cared to take unless fortified by legislative authority.",37
148,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Will the Minister allow me? We are not concerned with sugar which had gone into merchants'"" stores, but with sugar which was in the refiners' possession.",37
149,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"As to that, the Sugar Company admits that they had 50 tons of sugar which we did not touch, because it was not our policy to interfere with what had gone from the mills or their stores.  tioners give evidence ?",37
150,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If I can find there is any sugar which, under the larger powers given by the Act, we can take, and which has not been taken, it shall be taken. It is absurdto suggest that I exercised a preference for somebody of whom I had never heard : indeed, had I heard of him, it would only have made the matter worse. My desire, as every one knows, is to get the revenue due to the Commonwealth, and it seems so preposterous to haul me over the coals for acting upon that desire, that I might almost apologize for lingering longer on the subject. My policy is to get revenue any where I possibly and rightly can, and the man who can justly lay a charge against me of any laxity or want of vigilance must have found me in a mood altogether unusual. This matter has been discussed almost to nauseousness elsewhere, and I think I have a right to complain of the suggestions which undoubtedly have been conveyed to the House.",37
151,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,B y whom ?,37
152,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I mean specially by the presentation of the petition.,37
153,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That is another matter.,37
154,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not blame any one, but I feel sure that no member who was a party to the presentation of the petition knew that the matter had been threshed out.",37
155,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What was the date of the threshing out?,37
156,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I have the date here, and I should like to show the malign it} , 7 with which this complaint has been pursued. Any honourable member, I do not care'on which side of the House, would resent an accusation of the character which has been made against my administration. On the loth of May last year an honourable member of another place asked why one particular company should be singled out, while every other company and importer escaped. Is that allegation borne out by the facts and figures I have to-night laid before honourable members 1 The Collector of Customs in Queensland was brought down to Melbourne, in order that this matter might be fully explained. Senator Millen in his place saidDuty was not collected on similar sugar which was held in Queensland by the Millaquin and Yengarie Company - which, I understand, is really the Queensland National Bank-H . E. and A. Young, Gibson and Howes, and by Woods Bros, and Boyd. These people I understand held between them 8,000 tons, and while that quantity was allowed to go free of excise duty, a quantity of 2,584 tons, held by the Colonial Sugar Company, was charged duty. Further on, Senatpr Millen saidIn the absence of a specific denial of my statement, I venture to say that even Senator O'Connor will not attempt to defend an act of administration which shows snch partiality or discrimination, Senator O'COSXOK - There was no duty levied on sugar in stores, but the sugar in all factories and refineries were levied on.",37
157,Senator MILLEN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Of course a great deal depends on what is the definition of a store. In this particular case, a duty was levied on goods which were in a store, and not in a bond at all. Senator O'COKXOR - I draw no distinction between stores and factories. Sugar in stores not connected with factories or refineries was allowed to go free. What more explanation is wanted than that - give n a year ago ? Senator O'Connor also saidBut at the same time the Sugar Company are not entitled to be placed in a different position from any other body, or corporation, or individuals, and I propose to deal with the subject simply as if it were an individual who thought he had a right to some redress for some injury. This is what he also said d u r in g the discussion of the Bill in the Senate :We must take it that under constitutional usage sugar on the Sth October was an excisable article. Therefore, subject to this law, and according to the exact letter of the law, sugar, wherever it was, and could have been followed, no matter whether it was in private houses, or warehouses, or stores. That, in the first place, was unnecessary. It was also unworkable and impracticable to cany it out with any sort of fairness. A line, therefore, had to be drawn for the protection of the revenue. The matter was thoroughly f o u g h t out when the 2nd clause of the 5 t h section of the Excise T a r if f Bill was before the Senate, and honourable members know that the intention of the OJovernincnt was carried in to effect.",37
158,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The Act speaks of the stock or "" in possession.""",38
159,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Yes ; but that was not the original provision on the Sth October, 1901. We had not then formulated precisely w h at we were going to d o ; but we adopted an easily explainable and j u s t rule as to seizure. To continue the quotation from Mr I r v in g ' s letter from which I was reading These sugars were all' placed under Customs control on the morning of the Ofch October, and on being delivered for home consumption, were charged excise duty. None of the sugar we seized, including the 6,000 tons belonging to the Colonial Sugar Refinin g Company, went in to consumption u n t i l the d u t y was paid.",38
160,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Was any sugar seized on board ships ? ' Mr KINGSTON - I do not think so. Mr I r v in g proceedsWith regard to stocks of sugar in breweries and distilleries on Sth October, these wore not taken, as no intimation had been received to that effect, and no copy of the Excise Tariff Act was received here until 1st July, 1902, which was wired for to Melbourne by the Comptroller-General when here. I took the opinion of the Attorney-General as to the true interpretation of the Excise Act in regard to the d u r a b i l it y of sugar in a brewery, because I wanted to know the best way to recover any amount for which it was liable. The Act imposes duties of excise uponAll goods dutiable under the schedule . . . in the stock, custody, or possession of, or belonging to, any brewer, distiller, manufacturer, or refiner thereof. If the word "" the r e of "" were not in the section, I take it that sugar in possession of a brewer would be dutiable, but it apparentl y refers to the whole group of excisable articles, so t h at the section seems to speak of beer in the possession of a brewer, tobacco in the possession of a manufacturer, spirits in the possession of a distiller y and sugar in the possession of a factory or refinery. That is the way in which we have administered it . Mr I r v in g goes o n In my wire to you of 24th July, 1902, it was stated that the breweries held 219 tons 16 cwt. We would have levied the d u t y if we had been entitled to it . He continuesMy letter of 28th August brings this under your notice in connection with the Excise Tariff Act, and asks for instructions. There was no sugar in the distilleries ou Sth October, molasses only being used by spirit-makers in this State. Mr I r v in g then deals with the f o l l o w i ng statement :-- 2. "" That a largo quantity of sugar, amounting to over 9,000 tons, thft p'roperty'of Millaquin and Yengarie Sugar Company, and other ' white' sugars owned by Gibson and Howes, A. H . and E. Young, the Nerang Central Mill, and Wood Bros, and Boyd., all the time in their stock, custody, and possession, on the introduction of the Tariff, was not charged excise, but was delivered free."" In reply, he saysI have to state that all sugars found in the factories or factory premises of the persons referred to by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, was taken possession of on the morning of 9th October, and found to be as follows :Millaquin S.283 tons Gibson and Howes ... ... 230 ,, A. H . and E. Young ... 5 ,, Nerang Central Mill 25 ,, Wood Bros, and Boyd ... 15 ,, None of this sugar was delivered free of Excise duty ; no discrimination was made between any sugar factories and refineries. No one reading the petition, and particul a r l y the references which contrast the at t i tude adopted towards the Colonial Sugar Refinin g Company, with the way in which these sixty other people were treated would believe for a moment that they were treated as this letter shows, all in the same wav. and in the only reasonable way in which they could have been treated. No doubt .a considerable q u a n t it y of sugar got in to consumption before the Sth of October.",38
161,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"What does the right honourable member mean by ""consumption "" 1",38
162,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It was sold, or got to places where it would not be w o r t h while to follow it , It was not in any factory.",38
163,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The right honourable member does not refer to sugar in a store?,39
164,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I would not hesitate to charge duty upon sugar stored by a manufacturer. If the sugar crop in Queensland in that year was 120,000 tons-thoug h I do not think it was so much-woul d it not have been only natural that at least 20,000 tons would have got into consumption by the Sth October. My officials have gone thoroughly into the matter, and we cannot find that more than 15,000 tons had got into consumption by that time, though we can account for pretty well the whole of the crop for that year. Mr Irving continuesWith regard to the quantity of over 9,000 tons of sugar said to be in the possession of the persons named on the introduction of the Tariff, delivered.free of doty, a large quantity of sugar, estimated to be 10,000 tons (see my wire of 17th instant), had been removed from the factories, and was stored in merchants premises and other places, not being factory premises, throughout the State ; but the department has no knowledge to whom it belonged. This sugar was not taken possession of on the flth October, and in connection therewith I beg to refer you to the following wires between the Comptroller-General and myself:Of course, directly I heard the suggestion that there had been discrimination, I gave instructions that a ful l inquiry should be made. This is the first telegram, which was sent by the Comptroller-General from Sydney, on 28th October, 1901 :Stated that some persons have large stocks of sugar which are escaping Excise whereas Colonial Sugar Company are charged. Is this so ? There ought to be no distinction. Reply to Melbourne. To thab telegram Mr Irving sent the following reply :lie sugar stocks removed from mills prior to 9th instant, and stored warehouses, wharfs, &c, have not been treated as liable to Excise. See your wires of 9th and 10th instant. Colonial Sugar Company had large stocks in their refinery, which have been detained in common with stocks in other factories. See also my letter 22nd October, 1901, re Gibson's applications. Mr THOMSON,-I b was nob all actually in the refinery, but in the premises adjoining.",39
165,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The Excise Act gives bhis very wide definition of a factory :"" Factory "" means the premises on which any person is licensed to manufacture excisable goods, and includes all adjoining premises used in connection therewith or with the business of the manufacturer. I think that thab definition abundantly justifies all that wo have done.",39
166,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Was nob some sugar taken out of the refinery before the duty was imposed, and brought back afterwards ?",39
167,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am obliged to the honourable member for reminding 'me of that fact. It got out before the Sth October, 1901, but when I saw Mr Gibson and Mr Young during my Queensland trip, I was not aware that I had impounded their sugar. However, here is my ruling on the subject, in my own handwriting, which he who runs may readIf, as I understand, this sugar was manufactured by Messrs. Young Bros, before the Sth October, 1901, and that on the Sth October, 1901, it still belonged to them, it is undoubtedly dutiable under paragraph (ft) of section 5 of the Excise Act 1902. Thisapplies to all sugar belonging to the manufacturer thereof on the and Sth October., 1901, notwithstanding it may not be in his possession on that date or afterwards returned to his possession. Mr Young promptly paid the duty, and we 1 are doing, our best to find out any other sugar that was removed while it - still belonged to the manufacturer.",39
168,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Tha b is what is asked for.,39
169,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am only too glad to do this, but I am afraid we shall not find very much Mr - THOMSON - The Sugar Company and the Sydney Chamber of Commerce are willing to assist the Minister by giving evidence on oath at any inquiry he may hold.",39
170,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I shall only be too glad if they will give us any information that may be in their power. It would be idle for us to appoint a Royal commission to hold an inquiry. If we have a willing horse we do not need to flog him, and those who are willing to give information can supply it by making a statutory declaration. Do honourable members suppose thab I do nob wish to catch those, if any, wbo are escaping the payment of duty ? My desire, is to make the Customs revenue look as well as I can, and I venture to apply to my right honourable colleague the Treasurer for a certificate on that point.",39
171,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The right honourable gentleman has been so vigilant that he has quite upset my estimates.,39
172,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Yes ; because I brought in more revenue bhan wasexpecbed. I would ask honourable members to consider the attacks to which I have been subjected by some of my critics here. I am not complaining,39
173,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The Minister can give Roland for an Oliver. Mr KIN GST ON - I am not going - complain about the honourable member for North Sydney. I wish I was able to obment tain from other honourable members benefits - similar to those which I derive from - the experience of the honourable member, which I know is always at my disposal. Preposterous statements have been made regarding me as a Minister. I take some pride in the position I occupy, and I not. have a desire to collect all the revenue that is due, and I know neither friend nor foe - connection with my office. I have made my should be taken. - explanation, and I feel convinced that honourable members will consider that not - slightest discredit attaches to me. - only say, further, that it was not without .some difficulty that we made up our minds - as to the proper way in which to treat matter. I conferred with some leagues on the subject, and we came to the - conclusion that the plan that was adopted - as regards seizing sugar in factories which had been made before the Tariff was brought intp operation-whe n we knew where it was and to whom it belonged-wa s - the tionary power and refrain from proper one to adopt. We have the Act to work upon now, and as soon as it was passed, the Collector of Customs for - Queensland was informed, and I believe that he has faithfully carried it out ever since. If , however, there is anything that remains to be collected it will be into the revenue as soon as possible. W it h regard to the general criticism to which - customs administration has been subjected, I may take up my parable from some the words which were used by the honorwhere able and learned member for Parkes. - said that an understanding was arrived in the House that no prosecutions should be entered upon except in cases of fraud. There was nothing of the sort, and was never any ground whatever for that - suggestion. The Bill was framed on an altogether different principle, because i discriminated between cases where fraud, and those in which there was no fraud. For fraud a double penalty was provided, we were required to expressly allege fraud whenever it was intended to suggest it I had charged fraud in the various cases which have been referred to, I should been worthy of the criticisms in which some honourable members have indulged, but very few cases, indeed, has fraud been I Sydney. . a charged. On the contrary, I have been accused of having initiated prosecutions in to cases where no fraud was suggested, and time and again the counsel for the departhas announced in court that no fraud was charged. I arranged for this from a consideration of the first criticisms which were passed upon me, in which it was stated that unless the fact that. no fraud was charged was mentioned in court, the public would not know whether there was fraud or Instructions were issued that the position was to be stated in court, although in it was not necessary that such a course Sir ' WILLIAM MCMILLAN - Does the the Minister contend that the Act must be I need put into force in every case ? Mr KINGSTON!-No , I do not,",40
174,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Then I do not this see the relevance of the right honourable of ' my colgentleman's explanation.,40
175,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I do not see the force of my honourable friend's interjection.,40
176,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"What I say is that if the Minister could exercise discretaking action in the courts, why did he force people there in cases where no fraud was alleged 1",40
177,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Because in some cases hideous carelessness was indulged in.,40
178,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In one case out of many involving altogether the paybrought ment of £25,000 to the revenue.",40
179,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"My honourable friend's the memory is very much at fault. I desire to call his attention to the fact that I have of been taunted with prosecuting in cases there have been errors on either He side and a balance in favour of the at department. That charge was made against me in another place, and it was supported by the quoted testimony of the honourable there member for Wentworth that this had happened to him.

187,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Itwa s when the MinisSydney; ter for Defence came back from England. Senator Pulsford referred to the Fuller which was really the only case in which even a pretence could be made that there was a balance in favour of the Customs.

188,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It was admitted.,41
189,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No ; it was not adwas mitted. We could not go into the matter. The prosecution was instituted in respect a short payment; and it was not until we got into court that anything in the shape a set-off was urged. That matter could be investigated, because the point should have been raised when the goods could spected. No claim could have been enternecessarily tained for the refund of the money, and suggestion of the error in favour of Customs appeared to be a lawyer's device, resorted to at the last gasp. The issue as to the over payment was not tried, but was rejected by the court. The sworn testiI mony in the shape of the entry had been case. accepted, and there was a 3hort payment, which we proved up to the hilt; but at the last moment the solicitor's ingenuity suggested an over-payment which would more than counterbalance the shortage. The court would not look into the matter, but fined the defendant in respect to the shortage.",41
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Did the look into the matter ?,41
191,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No . I could not do so, because certain goods are charged at a certain rate of duty, and when a point of this kind is raised, we want^to see the goods and find out what they are",41
192,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Not if it is a manifest,41
193,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"We accepted the entry, but for the sake of discrediting his own entry, the defendant proposed to deny the correctness of that to which he had sworn. I say that that was the only case of its kind, and Senator Pulsford was entirely wrong in saying that, not only was there the Fuller case, but also that of MCArthur and Co. The the testimony of the honourable member for Wentworth, in a matter of this kind, no doubt, carry great weight. The tale as told by Senabor Pulsford has all over the place, and I was not able to trace it to its source until I saw a report of a debate which took place in and noticed that an old friend of mine had been making some most extraorcase, dinary statements about men having been sued when the balance was on the side of the Customs. I wrote to him about these statements, and found that they were supported by an authoritative announcement by the honourable member for Wentworth. Hence the statement of Senabor Pulsford regarding MCArthur and Co., whereas the only case that of the Fuller Carrying Company. I do not suggest that the honourable member to for Wentworth would wilfully state what he did not believe in, bub the circulation of of such a reporb shows that the wish is not often father to the thought, and that one often imagines wrongs that never be inoccur. I do not know thab I have uninbroduced personal matbers the affecting politics into bhis discussion. the Probably the honourable member for Wenbworth will seize an early opportunity to mention that what is alleged did not happen to him, as the people of Sydney, from whab have heard, undoubtedly believe to be the",41
194,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I obbained the evidence of certain cases. I do not deal with my own business in this House.,41
195,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The case exisbed all the same.,41
196,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"There were not two cases bub only one, and that was Fuller's case, which I have already disposed of. The Minister suggestion that the Acb was bo be confined bo cases of fraud was never made. On the conbrary, express legislative provision was made for differentiating between the two classes of cases. I have pointed out, time and again, that in very few insbances are proceedings instituted for fraud.",41
197,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What Robert Reid case ?,42
198,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That charged with fraud.,42
199,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I say that the firm in question was charged with fraud, and that the jury found it guilty of the charge preferred against it . I do not intend to differentiate as to blame, and it is not my disposition to bother my head beyond the discharge of my duty. In the discussion of these cases, I have not exhibited bitterness towards any individual, I feel sure. I simply do my best to faithfully discharge my duty. I have issued instructions that a man is not to be charged with fraud unless upon clear evidence, but that in such cases no pains are to be spared to punish the offender. I do not wish to discuss anything in the nature of personal matters, but I may be permitted to ask what was the way in which I was met a year or two ago in the discussion of this question when I brought up the name of Robert Reid and Co. 1 When I was attacked for instituting proceedings against this firm for the recovery of 6s., what was put 1 The idea that that firm could be guilty of any irregularity was scouted as preposterous. what I did upon that occasion was right, and that the merchants of Tasmania spoke out with good cause, although at the time it was suggested that I was little less than a maniac for impugning the action of the firm in question.",42
200,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If that were a case of fraud, the Minister ought to have taken stronger action.",42
201,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"There was not sufficient evidence to prove fraud in that case, but in the light of subsequent evidence, how does the taunt against me lie in the mouths of those who criticised me 1 The firm has been proved guilty of fraudulent practice. Under such circumstances, how long shall I be taunted with the cry- "" It is a respectable firm of long standing and integrity; let it escape.""",42
202,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That was never suggested.,42
203,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Why , the Chamber of Commerce declared that it was a persecution.",42
204,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,There were a thousand reasons for not prosecuting in that case.,42

[ Mr Speaker left the chair at 6.8 p.m.; sitting resumed at 7.30 p.m.]",42
206,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The honourable member for North Sydney threw some little doubts on my suggestion as to the use which was attempted to be made of the name of the firm of Robert-Reid and Co., when the Tasmanian case was under discussion.",42
207,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The doubts have all been dissipated.,42
208,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"As the honourable member for Perth points out, the old doubts at this particular moment have all been dissipated, but to prevent their return I should like to place on record the facts. When I spoke of the' Tasmanian case I was by no means attempting to impugn the honour of any person or firm, but I did not hesitate to point out that I was justified in saying that the revenue was "" got at."" Tliere was immediately an I believe that attempt made to scout the idea on account of the respectability of the firm, a respectability which to all outward intent I was content to admit. I referred to Robert Reid and Co. as a firm held in as high honour as any, but I was justifying their being tackled, when the necessities of the case appeared to require it , as I hope I shall always do, whatever firms, big or little, may be involved. Speaking on that occasion, I saidWhat happened'! A declaration was made as regards about ,t'l(i worth of goods that were intended to be sent to Tasmania, that they consisted of ±'3 worth of imported material, and that the added value given to them hy the Victorian manufacturer was £13. That was not true.",42
209,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,There was only Os. difference.,42
210,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"We may ""regard the trade between Victoria and Tasmania as of a retail character, and our attention was called to this case because it was found than Tasmanian merchants were being ""got at,"" owing to their being deprived of the protection to which they were entitled under the Constitution.",42
211,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Does the Minister mean that Messrs. Reid and Co. deliberately did this?,42
212,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I mean to say that they did ""get at"" the Tasmanian merchants, whether this they intended to or not.",42
213,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That is absurd.,42
214,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If that is the view the Minister takes, it shows where the trouble comes from. If that is not attacking me for suggesting that this firm was capable of ""getting at "" the revenue, I do not know what it is. I - do not believe that that criticism would be indulged in today, when I feel still further justified in the action which I then took. On that same occasion I called attention to the reports of the Tasmanian State-collector, Mr Barnard, who statedrf the quantities and values .are correct-wit h regard to the item on the attached copy of certificate-it would show that some of these certificates are totally unreliable ; and in - action should be taken against those persons who make these declarations falsely. Otherwise the revenue of this State must be seriously affected.",42
215,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"What floes he mean by ""falsely?"" Knowing them to be false? Mr - KINGSTON - I will read what Mr. Barnard saidIn the case in point, the dutiable material from cotton apparel is stated to hare declared to on the certificate <:ost. of manufacture at £13 lis., whereas the experts here - agree that the material used cannot be of less value than d(i ISs tirl., taking the value at bare American cost, thus defrauding the revenue of the duty on £ii Lis. 7d., plus 10 per cent. That, I think, would prevent the two honourable members to whom I have referred, indulging in similar criticism today; and in the light of subsequent events I feel even more justified in the course which I then took, and which the House'was prepared to endorse. It is no pleasure to me to institute prosecutions. I do not want the fines, and I do not care to see men disgraced by convictions for fraud : but, holding the position I do, my duty is clear, and I will do it, looking to the House for justification. assert that I proclaim myself the only honest Minister say that which is not true. There have been many honest Ministers who have done their best, but having the benefitof the advice and the experience available to an Australian Minister responsible for six States-advice and experience which were not available in the case of State Ministers-I see more of what goes on and know more of what ought to be done than was naturally the case in the isolated States. I do not for one moment attribute to Australian general failing in comparison with British merchants. Australian worthy of the highest reputation which British merchants deservedly enjoy : and those who say that I have spoken ill of my Australian friends and the people to whom I belong, in the way of making comparisons with the merchants of other countries, say that which is not. I am proud of the country to which I belong, and have every Mr Kingston. cause to be proud. I am proud of our merchants and all classes and conditions of men within the Commonwealth. But we all know that in the matter of smuggling and offences against the revenue there is a lax idea in nearly all communities which we do not find in connection with other matters. "" Getting at "" the Government has been thought to be a comparatively venial offence. I do not know what may generally be taken out by the experts here thought of such offences, but a Customs Minister ought to la}' himself out to prevent the interests of this State some them.",43

217,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,W it h common sense.,43
218,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Yes ; with common sense, in order to prevent not only fraud, instances of which of a deliberate nature I am happy to say are comparatively few, but also to prevent carelessness, incompetence, and recklessness, which are all too frequently exhibited in connection with the preparation of Customs entries.",43
219,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,In one out of ten thousand entries.,43

222,Sir AVILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I did not mean what the Minister thinks I meant.,43
223,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I will not press the point, as the honourable member says he did not mean his words to be taken in that light",43
224,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I was referring to what the Minister previously said. merchants any Mr KINGSTON - Many people think lightly of Customs offences, and we know merchants are how entries are scamped in the hurry of the moment ; but that is not good enough, and the Customs have a right to require more. Importers should employ competent hands at good wages to do this work.",43

227,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Nonsense . MY.

Dr Wollaston, who is the highest authority in - customs practice in Australia, and who is - a worthy recipient of the Imperial Service Order, informs me that it has been too long - the custom to send boys to do this important work. Where the oath of an importer is - concerned, and the reputation of his firm rnay be involved, competent men at decent wages should be employed, and not boys in knickerbockers.",43
228,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Rubbish .,44
229,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"As a fact, however, boys, whose heads are not up to the shoulders of an average adult, have been intrusted with this business, and, so long as I have the honour to be in my present position, I shall not allow the practice to go unchallenged.",44
230,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,How many cases of fraud have been discovered ?,44
231,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Not many-si x or seven. But when we find fraud amongst the highest firms what are we to think, And what care ought we not to exercise? SirWit.LiAMMCMILLAN - Nobod y blames the Minister for that.",44
232,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am sure they do not. The honourable member for Wentworth knows that the Customs 'authorities have to be very careful, and that A line cannot easily be. drawn between one class of firm and another. great majority of the merchants are honest men, but they are perhaps not quite so careful as they are honest. There are some few who defraud, but they cannot be marked off with a line; and firms in high repute today, may tomorrow be detected ""in a long series of frauds. We have to be vigilant and treat all alike, and no man should be allowed to escape on account of previous good character. No fraud ought to be charged, unless it is capable of proof up to the hilt.",44
233,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Is it possible to avoid error in any business ?,44
234,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It seems to me that there are errors and errors.',44
235,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,And Minister wants to call them fraud.,44
236,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That is not so. I am not going to justify my administration by reference to cases, all of which are publicly known.",44
237,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Has the Minister not found the bulk of our mercantile community honest 1,44
238,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Indee d I have; the great bulk are honest. But the honourable member must not think that he has now extorted from me an admission which I have not previously made and gloried in.,44
239,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I do not think the Minister started with that idea.,44
240,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I did start with that idea, and I repudiate indignantly any suggestion that I ever defamed my countrymen, of whom I am proud. I never suggested that Australia compares unfavorably in this respect with any other country in the world ; on the contrary, I know the fact to be otherwise, and have so expressed myself time after time. To endeavour to make out that I am a slanderer of my countrymen is to talk nonsense. I do complain that there is not more care shown in the charges which are brought against me. I - vvill. not return to that charge, with which I . have already dealt, and in which my honourable friend admitted, like the honourable man he is, that he had made a mistake. I think it was Senator Pulsford who said that in a case in which there was a difference as between £ 3 4 7s. 6d. and £ 3 7 4 s . 6d., and in : which nothing had occurred more than a mere error, of which it was not worthwhile taking notice, I caused a prosecution. I did nothing of the sort.",44
241,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,There have been prosecuThe tions for less.,44
242,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The fact is that there was a case brought before me in which there was a difference or shortage as between £ 6 2 and £150, and at the same time the other case, to which Senator Pulsford referred,.was mentioned. But it came before me, not as a difference of £ 3 , but as a difference of practically £ 9 1 . I ordered the prosecution, and the two caseswere taken as practically one matter. The defendants pleaded guilty in regard to the big case, and the other was withdrawn.",44
243,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Has the Minister seen Senator Pulsford's letter?,44
244,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Yes ; and Senator Pulsford has every reason to be ashamed of the himself for it .,44
245,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,He examined the depositions in the police court.,44
246,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I will give honourable members the facts. The plea of guilty was entered in regard to the larger charge. The defendants wanted it to be entered as regards the smaller charge, but we would not agree to that. I may say at once that there was no charge of fraud. This is the letter of the Crown SolicitorI have the honour, with reference to your letter the22nd inst., relating to two prosecutions against Farmer and Co. on the 24th September last, to inform you that, although my papers do not disclose the subject-matter of the charge upon which the conviction was obtained, the prosecutingofficer distinctly recollects that the plea of guilty was accepted in respect of the charge concerning twelve csises of furniture. He informs me that, the day before the cases came on for hearing, Mr Shorter, solicitor for the defendant company, saw him in reference to such cases, and asked if the department would be prepared to withdraw one of the charges in the event of his pleading guilty to the other. Mr Shorter was told that a definite reply would be given at 10 o'clock next morning, and at that time he expressed a desire to have the plea recorded in respect of the charge relating to one bale of rugs. The prosecuting officer declined to accede to this course, and eventually Mr Shorter pleaded guilty to the other charge. I made that statement, or one to the same  heard what I said, and went to the court. He then proceeded to write that he visited the court, and that the docket showed that the conviction was upon the smaller charge. That statement is a half truth, the sort of fib which is the hardest of all to fight. He makes no mention of the fact that the clerk told him that there was a confusion in the papers, and that in all probability the plea of guilty was entered in the larger case. In ignoring that information he, it seems to ine, has wilfully misled the public. This case shows the sort of treatment to which I am subjected. If I make a mistake, I am not above owning it, and I think that others might do the same.",44
247,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I have no doubt that Senator Pulsford will reply to the Minister's statements.,45
248,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I hope that he will, and that at length the truth will be made plain.",45
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Senato r a more accurate man than the right honourable gentleman ever was.,45
250,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I do my best to be accurate.,45
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,So does he.,45
252,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not wish to sugfeelings. gest that hedoes not; all I desire to say is that he did not treat this case with the candour which is probably his characteristic, but which on this occasion he suffered himself to lapse.",45
253,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Where is the evidence of what the clerk said ?,45
254,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It was contained in of the following letter, which is signed by F. P. Minns, P.M., acting C.P.S., and Chamber Magistrate :With reference to the communication between Senator Pulsford and the deposition clerk, it ap the papers, and explained to him that ""although the ' furniture' summons attached to the ' ruginformation was marked 'withdrawn,'""' it was almost a certainty that the word ' withdrawn ' referred to the information to which the summons was attached. All that we have heard about the cruelty of charging fraud against this, that, and the other man is so much fudge. The charge of fraud is preferred only when there i's ground for it . In all other cases the statement is made by the prosecuting counsel that we do not charge fraud, as a concession to the wish of many, that where we do not charge fraud, we shall declare we do not. W it h regard to the statement that persons charged with Customs offences have to herd with the ""drunks,"" I would point out that in South Australia a man who neglected to register his dog would have to rub up in the court against a ""drunk,"" just as he might do in the street - Though I am not an advocate of intemperance, however much the consumption of spirits may benefit the revenue which I cherish so dearly, I say that, in the sight of Heaven, for a man upon a jovial occasion to exceed, so that in rolling home afterwards he is run in and fined, is a venial sin compared with that of the man who robs me of my duties. We are all liable to make errors, and if we do, it is suggested that we should appear in the courts to receive punishment without being contaminated by the presence of "" drunks"" there. There is too much nicety in these complaints. If a man in Victoria does not vaccinate his Pulsford is child he is taken to the police court, and I believe that a member of this Parliament has been so treated. Was he contaminated by that?",45
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"He feels outraged, and is writing to the newspapers to vent his",45
256,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"But I guarantee that he has too much' good sense to object to from what has been done to him on the ground that he was brought iuto contact with' "" drunks."" Perhaps he did not appreciate such treatment from the people of another State. We need not be ashamed, except for our own sins; and though we may blush vicariously for the enormities of others, it is really our own affairs that trouble us. Now it has been said that there was no considerable trouble in connection with Customs administration before I took office. If there was not there ought to have been. I think I know something to the contrary. Do not honourable members recollect that we had not been six months in existence as a federation before the cry came from Queensland that serious customs leakages were taking place, and we were asked to help the authorities there 1",45
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The not bo able to stop the leakages, notwithstanding all his heroic measures.",46
258,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The Brisbane Courier of 10th August, 1901, contains a report - with these headlines, "" Unfair influence of official laxity-Custom s leakages-deputa tion to the Queensland Treasurer."" This was a deputation to direct attention to the customs laxity and the need for reform, and among those who attended I find representatives of Messrs. Stewart and Hemmant, gentlemen of whoml can speakin the highest terms, who, when called upon to afford me information, did their best to show that what they stated was actually a fact, and I feel sure that they were actuated by the best printroduced ciples in doing what they did. There also occur the names of Messrs. D . and W . Murray, R.. Eraser and Co., Robert Reid and Co., R. Armour and Co., and A . M Kirkland. Three of these firms have since found themselves in collision with the Customs authorities, and have been dealt with.",46

260,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I do not lightly charge fraud Str WILLIAM MCMILLAN whether the Minister has the right to mention their names.,46
261,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Regardin g one of the firms mentioned, an allegation was made when they were tried and fined that their honesty was shown because they had made a mistake against themselves. The mistake against themselves amounted to 10s., and the mistake against the revenue to £ 1 0 . I am not suggesting fraud in that case, because, as I say, I shall not charge fraud lightly. When I charge fraud, honourable members ma}' depend upon it that there is some ground for it, and that we are likely to reach the offender.",46
262,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Does not the Minister ever make an error in his own accounts 1,46
263,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Does the right honourable member for Wentworth often have accounts sent to him showing that he owes less than the amount due from him to his creditor. I do not mean to say that all mistakes are made against the Customs, but it is very nice to be able to point to a mistake Minister will against oneself, and say, "" See how honest I am."" In regard to such mistakes the merchant will not forget, to call in afterwards and collect the overpayment, but if we passed the mistakes against the Customs, where should we be'! ' According to the report to which I have just referred, Mr Alexander Stewart did not hesitate to give it as his opinion thatThe leakage in the Customs revenue from soft goods alone during the past three years has been fully equal to half the amount of the existing deficit-namely , over £250,000. And Mr Stewart asks-""Can we assume that other trades are honest, if this sort of thing goes on in the drapery trade * I . specially refer to the gentleman who in the deputation, because I feel sure that he is absolutely public spirited. It is very pleasant to have to do with a gentle- ' man who not only speaks boldly, but gives . every assistance to the Customs. It cannot be doubted that the members of the deputation were in a position to know what was going on, and to give reliable information. , Some honourable member asked me a question regarding this matter, which was also mentioned in the Queensland Parliament in the following manner :Mr Macartney asked the Treasurer1. Has he seen a statement referring to an alleged leakage iii Customs revenue attributed to I doubt Mr Alexander Stewart (of Messrs. Stewart and Hemmant) ? 2. Is there, in his opinion, an}' foundation for such statement in fact ? 3. Has any action been taken in the matter? Mr Cribb replied :-1 . Yes. 2. Yes. 3. The alleged leakage in Customs revenue was brought under the notice of the Treasurer on 7th June last. Steps are being taken to prevent such leakage. I communicated with Mr C r i b b on the subject, and he replied on Sth Augustas fol lows :I liave the honour to inform yon that in the know that a great many prosecutions month of June a deputation of Brisbane merbeen instituted chants waited on me, stating reason to believe that considerable leakage occurred in the Customs revenue of this State. It has been the practice here to allow firms ducting business in other States with branches in Brisbane to pass import entries at English foreign cost, plus 10 per cent., but it was sented that the invoices presented with ""the entries did not always show the true English foreign cost, and that due care was not exercised to see that they did so. This privilege of passing entries at 10 per cent, on English or foreign was not intended to apply to houses which do not keep stocks in this State, but simply sell through agents on samples. The deputation further alleged that some firms were in the habit of ing entries for goods which were not properly fined in the declaration. For instance, under head of ' Pins,"" which for use in apparel are free, 1 hair-pins, curling-pins, & c , are included ; and saddlery buckles, which are free, are made to cover many varieties of buckles. There appears have matters misrepresented. to be substantial grounds for the statements made by the deputation, and when comes into force there may be further inducements for unscrupulous traders to attempt to pass goods from State to State without payment of duty. I am desirous that all reasonable should be taken that the revenue of the State should not suffer, as well as that merchants conduct their business in a fair and legitimate manner should not be placed at a disadvantage, and I should be glad if you would give this matter your attention, and issue instructions which will insure close scrutiny of invoices, and more quent examination of goods iii this State, with view to preventing the abuses complained of and protecting the revenue. At the instance of a committee of in Queensland, the powers of the Commonwealth were invoked fcr the purpose of preventing abuses, which were stated to be of a very grave character, and this stance added strength to the of which we subsequently became and confirmed us in every action. tivity in such a case would have been a grave offence, and I am determined such a charge shall not lie at my door. said a little time ago that I was not requiring information which was not within complete control of the merchants selves. I-am not troubling merchants regard to the classification of goods for duty. I do not care what mistake they make regard to the duties. There may be cases in which it is difficult to sa)' to what particular duty goods are properly subject, what I have said time and again me the nature of the goods, give me their Mr Kingston.

I Mr KINGSTON - In Jun e I made the promise bo whic h I have referred, and by the which my officers were bound, and on 2nd them- Sepbeniber I gave insbrucbions whic h .werewith pub inbo for m al circulation, although they had' been previously acted upon. I could with not go back upon a lebter such as bhat w r it t e n by me to the Sydney Chamber of Commerce. This was my insbructionbut is-""Give 1. As to entries, I do not wish prosecutionswhen the nature and value of the goods are fairly disclosed in the entry, so that acceptance of theentry will not necessarily cause loss to the revenue-if the officer does his duty. -2. I specially desire thab no errorof classification by the importer in the entry shall alone render him liable to penal consequence if he has in the entry disclosed the true nature of the goods so that they can well be identified for Tariff purposes by an officer familiar with the Tariff. What I say is that I am entitled to bwo things-bh e invoice and the entry. entry is an oath to which the importer swears. I say to him - "" Let me have the invoice and entry, the nature of the goods and their value, and you may make as many mistakes as you choose regarding the d u t y and 3'ou will nob be punished."" That is the position which I bake up. officers bo look afber the duty, aud not bo rely boo much upon the inexperienced classification by a merchant. We are more competent than he is to decide w h at d u t y should be imposed, but he is more competent to say what is the nature of the goods and bheir value. When he gives us that information, together with the true invoice, he need fear nothing. what was circulated with the memorandum by the Act in g Comptroller-General, Mr . Lockyer, one of my mosb careful officersa gentleman who has raised himself bo his present posibion as collecbor in Sydney by high abiliby. Whab does he say?Herewith are enclosed for your guidance, directions by the Minister in regard to the dealing with misdescription of goods and errors entry by importers and agents. A careful spection of many of such cases which have, direction, been submitted for the personal sideration of the Minister, has disclosed in many instances, to say the least, the most culpable carelessness in the presentation of the important particulars necessary for the protection of revenue. Here, I say, time and again I geb the excuse of gross carelessness. 1 say to the merchants - "" Before you swear to any stabemenb, emf ploy some one who will not be'grossly less. Protect the revenue, and honesb and careful merchants."" The communication continuesI t .is possible that many of these errors result of the employment of incompetent and experienced clerks. I believe that they are. But I hold t h the offence is rather aggravated by the employment of boys or of men, ofte n at very small salaries, to do work which they are nob capable of satisfactorily performing. The Act in g Comptroller-General continuesI t is quite clear that in many instances tention and care which are considered imperative in ordinary commercial transactions, have not been extended to and observed in dealing with the department. There is undoubted evidence in many cases of inexperience, want of care, and in competence in the preparation of entries, which,, in the interests of the revenue, cannot possibly betolerated. It , therefore, now rests with you to see that there is no lapse of vigilance on the part of the officers, or want of care and attention on the part of importers and agents in all that is. necessary for the furnishing of full and accurate The information. . The entries should be clearly written and fully completed, the goods accurately and truthfully described, and due regard eiven to the importance and very serious nature of the declaration subscribed. An entry involves an oath. I think that fact is too frequently forgotten. It is reI w a n t my garded merely as an idle for m , judged by the wanb of abbenbion given to it s preparation, and the f a c i l it y and recklessness wibh which ib is sworn bo. The Minister particularly directs-""In all cases of false statements on entries its to thevalue of goods against he revenue which might have been avoided by proper care by competentclerks, proceedings to be taken when more than £1 duty is involved, or irrespective of amount This is where the case is not the first against the same importers. The Comptroller-General may sanction any proceedings, irrespective of amount, in any case when the special circumstances appear to require it.",47
267,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Does that apply to fixed duties ? Mr KINGSTON "" - It applies to all . Even in the case of goods which are not of delivered before they were weighed, there is inno trouble. I have taken pains bo inquire by by telegram with in the lasb ten daysconwhether there has been any breach of the order bo which I refer, and I have received an assurance from each of the Sbabe collecthe tors thab nothing of the sorb has bakenplace. U n d e r bhese circumstances, how does ib lie in the mouths of bhose who suggesb the contrary to j u s t if y bheir attacks? Leb bhem bringo r w a r d one case which will jusbify bhem. careSuch a case has never occurred, and cannot have occurred, unless my collecbors have sbabed whab.is nob t r u e ; and I know thab I am supported by an honourable sbaff which are the would nob, cn any account, wrongly advise in the Minister's office. There I am conbenb to leb the matter rest. I am delighted toa t have an opportunity of making this explanation. I have had other opportunities in various places, and at different times. Thelast one-and perhaps the one which I most enjoyed--wa s ab the interview which the atI had with a deputation of merchants abt h at great centre, Sydney. What was the result of that interview, even according to my severest critics ? One of those criticsthe Sydney Morning Herald-whic h had prepared me for all sorts of dull and dreadf u l things, headed the report of the proceedings of the deputation- "" The Minister in a conciliatory mood""- I am always that""Amicable assurances on both sides."" At first there was a little loose sparring, but when we got to close quarters we found that we thoroughly enjoyed each other. The report in question statesAt first there was a little disagreement ing the precise subjects to be brought forward by the deputation, but an understanding was soon arrived at, a conciliatory spirit was shown on both sides, and the discussion was curried on in the most friendly spirit There is nothing of the prize-fight about that.",48
268,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The Minister has since stated that the deputation misunderstood his promise, and that he did not give the promise which satisfied them.",49
269,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,All I can say is that this is the report of the Sydney Morning Herald upon the matter. 1 suppose that will be accepted as an authority in New South Wales.,49
270,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The Minister does not accept its statements himself.,49
271,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Not as to statistics especially as to shipping which is decorated. In such cases if one obtained 6-47ths of the truth he would be lucky. But the report of the proceedings of the deputation seems to be all right. Mr THOMSON,- I quoted from it the other night and the Minister said it was wrong.",49
272,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Then the honourable member must have quoted a portion which I have not seen. The members of that deputation reminded me of what I had said, but they did not assert that 1 ever declared I would uot institute prosecutions except in cases of fraud. They agreed that I was right in what I wanted. In the House of Representatives, said Mr Barre Johnston, Sir William MCMillan had asked the following question:Would not the Minister permit a Customs official to allow the rectification of a clerical error""! to which the Minister had repliedWe arc not laying down the rule that persons must be prosecuted and penalized for the smallest clerical error, such as might take place in an arithmetical calculation ; but in collecting duties, as I have stated in communication with chambers of commerce and other bodies interested, we have a right to know from the importers what is the nature of the goods they are importing, and what is the value of those goods. When they put it that they wanted me to abstain from prosecutions where questions of duty were involved, I told them that I had been adopting that practice throughout. The report proceedsOn the point that Mr Wall and other gentlemen have raised, as to men being prosecuted for making wrong statements of duty chargeable, I regard- wrote to your chamber some time ago stating that such was not 1113' wish, and I gave instructions to the contrary months ago. I hold in my hand the instructions signed by me 011 1st September. I look to my officers regarding the question of rates-(Hear , hear)-and Mr Lockyer tefls me he believes the fullest effect has been given to these instructions. In the second clause of those instructions I specially desire that no error of classification by the importer in the entry shall alone render him liable to penal consequences, if he has in the entry disclosed the true nature of the goods so that they can be identified for Tariff purposes. All the members of the deputation smiled their benedictions, the clouds which had previously overhung the meeting were dissipated, and joy and happiness reigned supreme. Upon that occasion I also emphasized a declaration which I made in June last, to the effect that the importers need not trouble themselves about the duty which is to be paid. They have only to speak the truth about matters within their knowledge, namely, the nature of the goods, their value, and the invoices. I will undertake to look after the duty. Every member of that deputation left the room perfectly satisfied.",49
273,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Did not the Minister say the other night, when I was quoting an extract from that very newspaper, that the deputation had misunderstood him ?",49
274,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I cannot tell. I had not the report in my hand when the honourable member was reading it . There is no doubt, however, as to the position which I took up, and there I . am content to allow the matter to rest. Since that deputation waited upon me the Tariff guide has been completed. That work I think supplies a wealth of information not only to the commercial public, but to the Customs officials. It will enable them to avoid that reference to headquarters which has necessarily been associated with its absence. I do not hesitate to admit that in the past too many delays have occurred. I have never attempted to deny that fact. It is infinitely better I should acknowledge that a lot of work has been forced upon me which I have not shirked. Unless 48 hours could have been compressed into each day, I could not possibly avoid the delays which have occurred. I have not spared myself, and I have no intention of doing so. But I shall be glad indeed to get rid of the drudgery associated with the initial stages of Federal Tariff administration. It is an experience which I should wish no honourable member, but which I am glad to have gone through, because I believe it will further qualify me for the performance of my duties, and give me a better appreciation of the work, thus tending to the credit of my office, and, I hope, to the good of Australia.",49
275,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," After a storm there generally comes a calm; and now that the hurricane which has recently blown in this House has subsided, the debate should flow along with its usual placidity to the end. I sincerely hope that we have heard the last of grievances concerning Customs prosecutions. For the past two weeks in this House, and in the press for months, utterances would lead one to think that no interests in the country were suffering except those of unfortunate importers, who are represented as being continually harassed and persecuted by a fiend in the shape of the Minister for Trade and Customs. Surely there are other people besides importers in Australia. When the Tariff was before the House, I fought in the interests of free-trade ; but now that we have a Tariff there should be no loophole left for dishonest traders. is the meaning of all this talk about the indignity of men appearing along with drunkards in a police court? Are not innocent men often arrested, and not merely asked to appear with "" drunks,"" but deprived of their liberty ? Yet we never hear a protest in such cases from those honourable members who are so eloquent in their defence of the importers. In my judgment the statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs is perfectly fair. If the importers will tell him the value of the goods, and their nature, and produce proper invoices, he will fix the duty. That seems a proposition with which I do not see anybody can 2u fairly find fault. But there are other departments of the State quite as important, if not more so, to the people than that of the Customs. There is the Postal department, which touches people more intimately than the Customs. I tell the Government in all friendliness that if they are to continue in office it will be necessary for them to' look closely into the administration of the Postal' department. As one from a distant State, I know that most aggravating delays occur before the Department can be induced to carry out the slightest work. Some 'of these works were projected before the Commonwealth took over the department, and yet they are still at the stage when tenders are being called. That is the'result of red tape, and I respectfully suggest the advisability of shaking up the officers, so that the people in the interior portions of Australia, who are opening up and developing the country, may obtain postal and telegraphic facilities. In my opinion the department is run a little too much on commercial principles, the idea of the Minister apparently being that each service must pay its way.",50
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Why should the Postmaster-General not get revenue, if the Minister for Trade and Customs gets it ?",50
277,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not object to that view, but up to this time the post-office has always been used as an auxiliary in the development of the country. It is monstrous to expect that every new service must pay its way from its inception, and if the present policy is continued it will seriously retard settlement and development in the interior. Then, I want to know the reason why these extravagant demands for guarantees are What made in the matter of telephone and telegraphic communication? If I desire a telephone to be constructed between two towns, I must give a cash guarantee to cover any loss that might occur. Under the Western Australian law, municipalities have no power to give these guarantees, but must spend every shilling of the rates, except 3 per cent., on municipal improvements. It is the opinion of those who interpret the law that the municipalities are thus debarred from giving guarantees to the Federal Government in connection with telephone and telegraphic extension. And I want to know how it is that in these matters some States are served differently from-others.?",50
278,Mr JOSEPH GOOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,All States treated alike.,51
279,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That is not so. An honciable member of this House, who represents South Australia, and has an influential newspaper at his back, was instrumental in obtaining the construction of a telegraph line to Tarcoola, at a cost of not less than £14,000, without any guarantee being given to the Eederal Government. I understand that, iii the first instance, it was represented to this House that this money would be deducted from South Australian revenue as part of the expenditure of a transferred department; but now the claim is seriously raised that this is part of the new expenditure which must be borne by the Commonwealth generally. This is a matter which seems worth inquiring into. How is it that an honourable member from one State can have a large work like this done at a cost of £14,000 without any guarantee, while a Western Australian member, under similar circumstances, is, asked to deposit a certain amount in cash 1 There is another point requiring notice in connection with postal administration. This is in respect to the refusal to deliver letters addressed to Tattersall's. That step has caused an enormous loss of revenue, and the statement. I made at the time that the section would prove a failure is borne out by the fact that Tattersall's sweeps are now filling as well as ever they did. The House as well as the Government deserves censure for this. This is what may be called hypo-critical legislation.",51
280,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Why so? as well say the honourable member was guilty of hypocrisy in voting against the clauses. Mr Mahon"" - It is pure cant to pretend to legislate for the suppression . of gambling, when we know that it cannot be suppressed in that way. What I said in the House was that if we desired to legislate against gambling we should do so directly, and not in an underhand manner, which is always more or less hypocritical. As regards the transcontinental railway, I notice that some honourable members are opposing its construction on grounds of economy. One of the South Australian members the other night gave, as his principal objection to the line, the enormous cost it involved, but I notice that when the same honourable member advocated the are extension of the Tarcoola telegraph line, he> made no inquiry as to the expense before-recommending the project to the House. Another honourable member observed that the Western Australian Government should build the Esperance line before South Australia, gives permission for. the transcontinental lineto pass through her territory. It will bewithin the recollection of honourable members that during last session I submitted amotion in favor of the construction of theEsperance railway, but I think these projects stand on different footings. They arebo th worthy of being completed, but there is no reason why the non-construction of the Esperance railway should retard the construction of the transcontinental line. I regret very much that some effort is beingmade to prevent the Parliament of South Australia from giving the necessary consentto the construction of the Port AugustaKalgoorlie railway. If ever a Governmentpledged itself to anything beyond recall, the Government of South Australia are pledged to give permission for the construction of this transcontinental line. To prove the truth of what I say, I have only to read a', letter written to the Premier of Western Australia by our Speaker, when he occupied the-high position of Premier of South Australia. The letter is dated 1st February, 1900, and is as follows :Following our conversation as to the possibleblocking of the construction of a railway line from. Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta by the Federal authority, by South Australiarefusingconsent,rendered, necessary by section 34 of clause 51 of the Commonwealth Bill, to the construction of the linethrough her territory, I regard the withholding of consent as the most improbable thing, in fact,, We might quite out of the question. To assure you of one attitude in the matter, I will undertake as. soon as the federation is established (Westand South Australia both being States of the Commonwealth) to introduce a Bill formally giving the assent of this province to the construction of a line by the federal authority, and to pass it stage by stage simultaneously with the passage of a similar Bill in your Parliament. I find also that your successor, Mr Speaker,, in the Premiership of South Australia, wrote on 31st July, 1901, to the Prime Minister as follows :In reply to your letter of 23rd inst., I have thehonour to inform you that prior to the submission of the Commonwealth Constitution Act for theapproval of the people of Western Australia, viz., the 1st February, 1900, the Honourable F. W. Holder (then Premier of South Australia) wrote-, to the Premier of Western Australia (copy of the letter herewith) undertaking on specified conditions But the only condition specified in your letter, sir, was bhat the Western Australian Parliament should simultaneously pass a Bill through their House. Now we are given to understand, however, that certain specified conditions were mentioned, and the letter of Mr Jenkins proceedsundertaking on specified conditions troduce a Bill formally giving the assent of this State to the construction of a line of railway to the Western Australian border. On the 11th June I telegraphed to the Western Australian Premier as follows :Re Coolgardie Railway. A Bill will be introduced into our Parliament, as agreed by Mr. Holder, 1st February, lilOO, but we strongly insist upon line joining your State 40 to north of Eucla. It appears to me that new conditions are now being added by the Premier of Soubh Australia before consent will be given. I notice, from the reported statements of some public men in South Australia, that there is a disinclination to give effect to the promise which you, sir, made as Premier on behalf of the Parliament and the people of South Australia. I have too high an opinion of the people of Soubh Australia bo credit the notion that they will permit their Government to commit such a serious breach of faith as this involves. I feel convinced that when South Australian public opinion is appealed bo, ib will be declared that the promise of the Premier of thab Stabe, given in good faibh, .should be redeemed. If that State had an objection to consent being given to the consbrucbion of the. Western Australian transcontinental railway, the time for bhat objection was before Western Australia agreed bo join the federation.",51
281,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,And then Western Australia would not have come into the union.,52
282,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Tha b is so. Ib was mosb unfair to wait until now to suggest new conditions and to raise new objections to the project. But we find an explanation of that peculiar circumstance in the fact that South Australia appears to have set her heart on another bransconbinental line, though I venture bo bhink that, when true condibions under which proposed to build that line are known, no syndicabe will be foolish enough bo undertake the work. It is proposed to convey to a syndicate for the building of the line a berribory almost as large as the State of Victoria. The railway, when finished, is not to be handed over to the 2 H2 South Australian Government, but is to continue the property of the syndicate. That seems to me a most inequitable proposal. I know of two similar private railways in Western Australia, but they are both miserable failures.",52
283,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Are they failures to inso far as the promoters are concerned t,52
284,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"They are failures so far as the country is concerned. The most miserable railway journey a man can make in Australia is that from Perth to Geraldton, on the Midland Company's line.",52
285,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Is that worse than r (JO miles the journey from Albany to Perth ?,52
286,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Yes , far"" worse; there is no comparison between the two. The trains run at the rate of about 15 miles an hour, and in the 318 miles, which comprise the whole distance, there is not a place where one may procure a decent meal, so that those who travel on the line invariably bake bheir own food and liquor wibh bhem. Bub the secreb of the South Australian objection to the Western Australian transcontinental line will be discovered in the report of an interview which took place in London between a newspaper reporter and a gentleman who claims bo be the power behind the throne in South Australia. He is not the Premier, but he informs all and sundry that at any time he likes he could turn the Government out. This is the report of an interview with Mr Darling, the leader of the Opposition in South Australia, the gentleman to whom I referAlthough his coming to London had no official connection with the promotion of the scheme for building a railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, still, he hod made ""casual"" inquiries amongst bankers and financiers. ""They seem to be agreed,"" continued Mr Darling, ""that the state of the money market and the disposition of capitalists generally are not altogether too favourable nt the moment. They seem to think, however, that it is one of the ventures that might well be taken up by London capitalists when better times arrive."" The South Australian afterwards proceeded to show what the expression ""better times"" meant in his mind. ""The Commonwealth,"" he said, ""is at present entirely the opposed to the introduction of coloured labour ib is into any part of the island-continent. If that course is persisted in, then the tropical resources of the Northern Territory cannot be profitably developed. It is no use blinking this fact. What I would suggest is the introduction of Indian cooties under an indentured system, which has worked so well in other parts of the British dominions. I believe that the people of Australia will, in the course of a few years, come round to this view."" The railway is to be made by a private syndicate \ and, as a concession, they are to receive a territory as large as Victoria, and are to have the right of running the line, and, apparently, of charging what rates they like on it for all time. I believe, too, that they are to be exempt from State taxation. But Mr Darling has given the project away when he says, in effect, that this territory can be made profitable only by the employment of coloured labour. I think that this Parliament will prevent Mr."" Darling or his syndicate, if it is foolish enough to undertake the enterprise, from employing coloured"" labour. Possibly the syndicate has not been told that the Eederal Parliament may impose taxation upon property: although, so far, we have imposed no direct taxation, we have the light to place a tax upon land. I apprehend that when those facts are made known to London capitalists they will hesitate for a long time before proceeding with the construction of the line. The correspondent from whose report I have quoted goes on to sayI reckon that if Mr Jenkins' land grant railway to Port Darwin is not built until the Australians have tar nod their buck upon white labour, then the man is not j et born who will travel on the line. And I quite agree with him. I think when the question is fairly put before the people of South Australia they will not be guilty of a repudiation in the nature of a breach of faith. Despite what the politicians and leaders of Parliament may say, I should be perfectly willing to submit the issue to the people of South putting before them the promise which was made on their behalf by their Government. I intended to speak at some length upon the other questions with in the Governor General's - but no doubt other opportunities will in due course arrive when the various measures in the Government programme are brought before the House. Although Jam inclined to consider the High Court a necessary part of the federal machinery, I fear that as proposed it would be too expensive a luxury at the present time. I should like instead to see some arrangement whereby one federal Judge could be appointed to sit with the Chief Justices of the States whenever occasion required the services of the Eederal High Court, because it does not appear to me that there will be sufficient work for five Mr Mahon. Judges. I believe, however, that the whole matter is one that we might fairly postpone for the present. W it h regard to the federal capital site, I think that, in justice to New South Wales, we should proceed to its selection as soon as possible, but I should not be in favour of commencing the building of the capital while money is so dear in London, because no Government can profitably borrow at 4 per cent., and it is not possible to get money now at lower rates.",52
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Not much money would be required.,53
288,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No ; but as this House has already objected to the borrowing of money for necessary works, such as telephones and telegraphs, I think we should not borrow to build a federal capital. We want telegraphs and telephones for the development of the back country more than we want a federal capital. However glad I might be to get away from Melbourne, .[ recognise that this is not the time to increase the burden of the taxpayer by borrowing.",53
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Is it not the time to carry out a bargain?,53
290,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The construction of the transcontinental railway was an implied bargain, with Western Australia, the terms of which are unfortunately not in the Conthat stitution, but they would have been there had those who represented that State at the time been alive to the interests of their colony. When will the honourable member be ready to carry out that bargain ?",53
291,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Tw o wrongs do not make Australia, a right.",53
292,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No doubt that that is so, but that statement makes our wrong no less hard to. bear. I am rather disdealt appointed with the declaration of various speech, speakers concerning preferential trade relations with the other parts of the Empire. I was surprised to hear the eulogium pronounced upon Mr Chamberlain to-night by no less a person than the Minister for Trade and Customs. It is a singular thing to find one who is widely regarded .as the darling of Australian democracy praising a man who in England has been a traitor to democracy; Possibly the attitude of one of the Melbourne newspapers in regard to Mr Chamberlain may have influenced the mind of the Minister. That paper is a harsh' critic of the Minister for Customs, and his hostility to it may account for his exhausting the language of eulogy concerning Mr Chamberlain. Until last Monday the Secretary of State for the Colonies was the darling and hero of that' great newspaper, the Argus. During the African war, and ever since he left the liberal party, the Argus has shown the greatest appreciation of the genius of that wonderful' man. Bub on Monday last the Argus says this of himReversals of policy by Mr Chamberlain have been too many and too remarkable to make it worthwhile to charge him with inconsistency. With him a policy or a principle is a thing to be adopted in view oF the exigency of the hour, and to be dropped as further turns of the political wheel may render necessary. J object to the savage manner in which the Minister for Trade and Customs corrected the small mistake-if it was a mistakemade by me in an interjection. I merely said that the Constitutions of Natal and Cape Colony had been suspended during the war in South Africa. What I should have said was that the light of the Parliaments of those colonies to meet had been suspended during the war.",53
293,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That is practically a suspension of the Constitution.,54
294,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It is really a distinction without a difference, and the Minister for Trade and Customs devoted more attention to this trivial matter than it warranted. was rather surprised also to hear some of the views expressed from the opposition side of the chamber with reference to preferential trade. The leader of the Opposition said that if we were to have a protective Tariff we ought to close the doors more tightly against foreign countries than against England. I do not see much differencebet ween what the right honourable gentleman said and what the Minister for Trade and Customs has suggested. The utterances of the leader of the Opposition do not accord with the Cobden idea of free trade, because Cobden held that, although a protective Tariff might .injure the country against which it was directed, it w ould also injure the country which imposed it. If that is so, how can the leader of the Opposition allow himself to become implicated in any imposition of protective duties 1",54
295,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"He would lessen them as much as possible, if he could not remove them.",54
296,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"There is the alternative proposed by the Minister for Trade and Customs of increasing the duties upon foreign products, and leaving them as they stand with regard to those which come from Great Britain. Personally, I should prefer to see the duties entirely abolished so far as imports from the mother cenntry are concerned, and revenue imposts collected upon goods from foreign sources. I was surprised that the Minister for Trade and Customs should become so enamoured of Mr Chamberlain, because he' must be perfectly aware that that right honourable gentleman hs-s proved a traitor to every political parby with which he has - been associabed. Mr . John Morley, who, as a statesman, a literary man, and a democrat, is far and away above Mr Chamberlain, in writing the life of Cobden some years ago, practically foresaw the presenb proposal for preferential trade, or, as it was then known, fair trade. This is what he saysNobody has fully grasped the bearings of free trade who does not realise what the international aspect of every commercial transaction amounts to; how the conditions of production and exchange in any one country affect, both actually and potentially, the corresponding conditions in every other country. It is not free-trade between any two countries that is the true aim ; but to remove obstacles in the way of the stream of freely exchanging commodities, that ought, like the Oceann9 of primitive geography, to encircle the whole habitable world. In this circulating system every Tariff is a,n obstruction, and the free circulation of commodities is in the long run I as much impeded by an obstruction at one frontier as at another. This> is one answer to an idea which has been lately broached among us, under stress of the temporary reaction against free trade. It has been suggested that though we cannot restore protection in its old simplicity, yet we might establish a sort of National Imperial Customs Union among the English dominions. The territory over which the flag of Great Britain waves is so enormous and so varied in productive conditions, that we could well afford, it is urged, to shut ourselves within onr own walls, developing our own resources, and consolidating a strong national sentiment, until the nations who are now fighting us with protective Tariffs come round to u better mind. The answer to this is that the removal of the restriction on the circulation to a more distant point would not affect the vital fact that the circulation would r still be restricted and interrupted. To induce our colonies and dependencies to admit our goods free would, of course, be so much gained : just as the freedom of interior or domestic commerce, which was one of the chief causes of the early prosperity of Great Britain, was by so much a gain over the French system, which cut off province from province by customs barriers during the same period. But freedom of internal commerce, whether within an island or over a wide empire, is still not the same thing as universal freedom of exchange. An interruption, at whatever point in the great currents of exchange, must always remain an interruption and a disadvantage. England is especially interested in any tninsiiction that tends to develop trade between any nations whatever. We derive benefit from it in one way or another. The mother country has no interest in going into a customs union with her colonics, witfi the idea of giving them any advantage, or supposed advantage, in trading with her over foreign countries. I do not know that I need weary the House by continuing this debate. I should not have spoken but for some remarks which were made regarding the transcontinental railway to Western Australia. I hope that in discussing the various measures which are to come before us, we shall display the same good feeling and friendliness that was shown in connection with every measure except the Tariff last session. If the Government will direct their attention to securing a proper administration of the Postal department, they will perforin as great a public service as has been rendered by the Minister for Trade and Customs in his department. I honour the Minister for what he has done, and I believe that the people of this country, almost to a mancertainly those in the back country of Western Australia-approv e of his administration. Although I sit in opposition to the right honourable gentleman, I concede the fact that his dealing out of evenhanded justice to the weak and the strong must meet with all-round approval, and that his action in bringing to j.ustice men who held their heads high in the community, and regarding whom no suspicion was previously entertained, redounds to his credit. I hope that he will continue in the course which lie has hitherto followed, but that he will make a strenuous effort to avoid the irritating delays which have caused so much loss and annoyance to merchants in the past. I rose mainly to deal with the objections regarding the transcontinental line to Western Australia, and to urge the j Government to give more attention to the administration of the Postal department, and to conduct it upon principles other than those which appear to actuate the Postmaster-General.",54
297,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"South Australia) I do not intend to go over the ground which has been traversed so often by other honourable members. I should be glad to"" say a word or two in defence of the attitude of the Parliament of South Australia in reference, to the transcontinental railway to the Northern Territory, but, unfortunate!}', I am unable to do so. It seems to me that the granting of such a large concession to a private company to enable them to build a railway for their own convenience is altogether indefensible. W it h reference to the attitude of South Australia towards the Western Australian railway, I think that the honourable member for Coolgardie is hardly doing justice to the Premier of the former State. The South Australian Government have not stated that they will not carry out the promise, but they have stipulated that the proposed line should be constructed in a certain latitude.",55
298,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,There was no such condition made in the first instance?,55
299,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No , but there is an explanation for that. During the period which elapsed between the communication sent to the Premier of Western Australia by Mr Speaker when he was Premier of South Australia, and the letter sent by Mr. Jenkins, the present Premier, the Tarcoola gold-fields were discovered, and the Government of South Australia are now naturally anxious that the line should pass somewhere in the vicinity of those fields rather than, as suggested, some distance southwards. This would relieve the South Australian Government of the necessity of constructing an almost parallel line to Tarcoola. The proposed deviation will not add 25 miles to the total distance to be covered by the railway, and the condition laid down is a reasonable one.",55
300,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not think that Western Australia will object to such a condition, but we are informed that all sorts of other conditions aie suggested.",55
301,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not believe that the people of South Australia will go back upon the undertaking entered into first by the Minister for Trade and Customs, when he was Premier of that State, and afterwards by Mr Speaker when he held a 1 similar office. But before that line is built other conditions may prevail. I do not think that the people of South Australia will go back upon their undertaking merely because Mr John .Darling, or even ii dozen or two individuals, may think it is desirable to do so. I say this without in any way suggesting that either South Australia or her representatives are necessarily in favour of the line. But that is a very different matter from declaring that if the line is to be undertaken, South Australia will nob stand in the way of its construction through her territory. I suppose that honourable members would smile if I suggested that - something had been omitted from the 'Governor General's speech. One paragraph in that long deliverance statesA number of other important measures are in preparation. Among these is a Bill to provide a uniform navigation and shipping law. This measure, however, is necessarily long and complicated. Later on thn speech contains the following declaration :My advisers will gladly take advantage of any - opportunity which may offer of bringing these - subjects before you, but they are not sanguine of being uble to do so in the course of this session. I think that statement is a reasonable one to make. It would be quite impossible for us to enact uniform shipping legislation - embodying all the navigation laws of the - different States in one Act during the present session. I understand that a Bill to .effect this purpose is in course of preparation, and that it contains some hundreds of clauses. Of course we - should not care to attempt to pass such a measure during the current session. But I put it to the Minister for Trade and - Customs that there are some Bills that the 'Government intend to proceed with which - are less urgent than is the passage of a ;short Bill designed to protect Australian .shipping from the unfair competition to which it is at present exposed. A measure - containing only a few clauses would be sufficient for the purpose. Under the cir-cumstances which obtain today, Australian - shipping is gradually being taken away from local companies by foreign vessels which, once in several years, call at a port - outside the Commonwealth merely for the purpose of getting their crews to sign fresh - articles. By adopting that subterfuge they are enabled to defy any legislation which we may enact with reference to the - employment of white men upon them, and to override the conditions with which Australian vessels have to comply. believe that the House would readily con.senfc to consider a short measure such as I suggest. There is a great deal hanging to it . In this connection I need only point »out that an agreement exists between the Australian steam-ship owners and their seamen, ' which will expire during the present month, though an arrangement has been made to continue it t ill December next. If something is not done in the interim to place foreign ships in a similar position as regards wages, manning, &c, to - that occupied by Australian vessels, an all-round decrease in wages will take place. It may be said that that matter will be covered by the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, but the arbitrators under any A ct will take into consideration the unfair competition to which the owners are subject.",55
302,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Coul d we not compel the owners of vessels which trade here to pay the increased rate of wage ?,56
303,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I very much question whether we could. It seems to me that it would be far better to introduce a separate Bill for the purpose of covering these special disabilities. I know that the Minister for Trade and Customs does not care about devoting himself to a short measure of this kind. He would prefer to thoroughly master the whole question, and then draft a measure to meet the necessities of the case. If honourable members study the figures contained in a blue-book which was presented to the House of Commons last year in regard to this matter, they will be disagreeably startled. Those figures show that a large increase has taken place in the number of lascars and foreigners employed upon British ships, and a corresponding decrease in the number of Britishers so employed. During the past ten years I find that the lascars upon British ships have increased by 12,288, and the foreigners by 8,750, a total increase of 21,038 seamen, whereas the number of Britishers so employed has decreased by 7,155. . Mr CONROY - May not that be due to the fact that the men can do better than go to sea ? - Mr BATCHELOR - The real reason is that the labour of the lascar is cheaper. These figures, I submit, are sufficiently startling to merit careful consideration, unless the whole of the mercantile marine of Britain is to be manned by foreigners I and lascars, which would be a particularly serious matter for the Imperial navy in the event of a naval conflict. In the course of his remarks, the honourable member for Parrarnatta spoke of the agreement which had been entered into with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. He declared that it was a matter for congratulation that the interminable agreement which previously existed had been amended, and an arrangement for ten years substituted. From my stand-point I am unable to discover any cause"" for congratulation what I ever. As a matter of fact, the old agreement gave the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company nothing, but bound it to the contracting States a continuous reduction in cable rates to the old country.",56
304,Sir JOHN EOHREST,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,A similar covenant will be contained in the new agreement.,57
305,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,But that agreerevenue ment is only for ten years.,57
306,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What about the right to open offices ?,57
307,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That arrangement means nothing at all. In the absence the Pacific cable, tenders for the construcmember tion of which had not been called",57
308,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,But the agreeinto ment had been made.,57
309,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,At the time the bear agreement was made the Pacific Cable pany had not called for tenders for conassist struction.,57
310,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"But the British Government had agreed to join with the States, otherwise the Eastern Extension Company would never have lowered their rates.",57
311,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I admit that the Pacific cable project assisted to make the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company decrease its charges. It would have been a splendid lever to have held for an indefinite period, but I submit that as an actual fact the construction of that cable has been a bit of a blunder. What has been the immediate result of the undertaking ? It has involved a loss of £90,000, of which £30,000 is to be borne by the Commonwealth.",57
312,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,We have saved the subsidies which we would otherwise have had to pay.,57
313,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The subsidies were wiped out in the agreement.,57
314,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member wants to obtain all the good and reject all the bad.,57
315,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That would have been the sensible course to adopt. One method would have been to use the Pacific cable scheme as a means of dealing with the Eastern Extension Company in the event of the latter charging more than fair rates.,57
316,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That would been a breach of faith with Canada Mr BATCHELOR,-There has been breach of faith so far as South Australia is gether? concerned, and that State was perfectly satisfied.",57
317,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,And Western Ausgive to tralia was perfectly satisfied.,57
318,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"We ought to remember that under the sliding scale arrangement, prices over the Eastern Extension cable had to be reduced whenever the of the company reached a certain figure, and that but for the establishment of the Pacific cable, and the subsequent division of the business, we should now have been able to send messages at 2s. 6d. per word instead of 3s. It was a curious of contention on the part of the honourable for Parramatta that Western Australia and South Australia, who entered no arrangement in connection with the Pacific cable, should now not only have to the loss of revenue which its establishComment has caused them, but should further the eastern States to pay their portion of the loss.",57
319,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That is only the "" t r u e federal spirit.""",57
320,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I wonder if theeastern States, in the case of any profits being made on the Pacific cable, would hand over a share to the western States. I mention the observation of the honourable member for Parramatta, because in the absence of anything to the contrary the Government might think it reflected the opinion of the House.",57
321,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The liability of the eastern States w-as taken over by the Commonwealth.,57
322,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"And during the book-keeping period those States muststand or fall by their agreements. South Australia cannot complain of the fact that a portion of the business now goes over the Pacific cable, but we should regard it as iniquitous if we were now called upon to assist in meeting the loss on that line.",57
323,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Does the present line from South Australia pay ?,57
324,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It pays fairly well, but in the old days - it was a very heavy burden on South Australia; and the loss,, including payment of interest, has not yetbeen made up.",57
325,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"AVoul d not the have arrangement as to the Cape cable have had the effect of taking away the transcontino nental work from South Australia altoMr BATCHELOR,-No , it would not. Under the interminable agreement thab South Australia, and also AVestern Australia, entered into, the former State gave nothing, and got a considerable reduction in the rates. Messages by the Cape cost just as much as those by Port Darwin ; and the amount received by South Australia is the same irrespective of the line used.",57
326,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,But the Darwin line would not have been used.,58
327,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That does not matter, because the landing facilities at Fremantle and Glenelg would have been used. AVe have no right .to complain of the Eastern Extension Company trying to defeat a rival, but we must complain of an attempt on the part of the Commonwealth Government to unduly favour the Pacific line at the expense of the former company. Three of the eastern States are concerned in one cable, and the western States are concerned in another, and the postal authorities have decided that all messages, the routes of which are not indicated by the senders, must go by the Pacific cable. That appears to be a deliberate action in order to force as much business as possible to the Pacific line. Why should unrouted messages handed in at Kalgoorlie be sent all the way round to Brisbane, and thence by the Pacific line, when a shorter and quicker route, in which AVestern Australia is interested, is available?",58
328,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Wester n Australia is not interested in that route.,58
329,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not use the word "" interested "" in the sense of partnership.",58
330,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It does not matter to Western Australia which way messages go, but I think they are sent by the line from that State. The messages go just as quickly, and at the same price, on both lines.",58
331,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I have seen it stated in the newspapers, and have also very' good authority for saying, that instructions have been given to the effect which I have indicated; and this, of course, affects, - very considerably the revenue of South Australia and AVestern Australia. A fair thing would be to arrange that all messages should go by the quicker route, or by each route alternately. Either method would be adopted, but with the present arrangement the Government can fairly be accused of favouring the Pacific line. I should now like to refer to the public service regulations. These as a wholeare fairly liberal, but there are a few to which exception may be taken. I shall not refer to details, because I think the public servants may be trusted to bring any disadvantages under which they labour under the notice of their superior, but there is one regulation which it Port seems to me ought not to be allowed in its present form. By regulation 41, officers are expressly forbidden to publicly discuss, or in any way to promote political movements. That is a very wide and sweeping regulation. Officers are further forbidden to use any official information for political purposes, or to disclose any such information without the express direction of the permanent head. These latter regulations are quite proper, and will meet with the approval of not only the public, but also of the officers themselves. Under regulation 41, however, public servants are unable to join any kind of organization whether of single taxers, free-traders, or protectionists, or in any way to promote a political movement. It may be said that the regulation! is not to be .interpreted literally-that it is a power which will never be exercised : but it is a very dangerous power to place in the hands of the Executive. I shall not go into details, but merely mention that recently we have seen a very extreme view taken of what a political association' is. AVe have seen the most disastrous results in one of the States as a consequence of the adoption of that extreme view. Here, however, we have a much wider clause, and one which I think honourable members will agree should not be in the regulations. It was first published on the 23rd December last, and took effectonthe 1st January of this year. There are other clauses in the regulations to which I should refer, but that I do not wish to keep honourable members at this late hour. I ask the Minister, however, to consult with the Public Service Commissioner to see if the regulations which I have dealt with cannot be modified, so that the public servants of the Commonwealth may enjoy as full rights of citizenship asthose outside the service. There are one or two other matters upon which I wished to speak, but I shall leave them over until 'another time. I was exceedingly pleased to hear the explanations of the Minister for Trade and Customs in answer to the charges made against him during the debate. I feel certain that the public opinion of the Commonwealth will approve of his administration rather than of the criticism of some of his detractors. I hope that when the debate is con-cluded we shall get to work as speedily as possible, and that the session will not be unduly prolonged.",58
332,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," At this late hour it is not my intention to keep the House very long. I would preface my remarks by thanking honourable members who visited Western Australia to see for themselves the conditions of an importAnt State, which in many respects, I am sorry to say, has been misrepresented. The people of our State, however, regretted that more federal members did not go there to inquire into our conditions, and to be witnesses of the prosperity which we .are enjoying and shall continue to enjoy for a considerable time to - come. As in 1892 our population was only 58,000, while ""in March last it was 219,000, honourable members will realise that the State has not stood still. On the contrary, it has progressed by such leaps and bounds as are phenomena] even in the history of Australia. I am aware that An impetus was given to our progress by the discovery of gold, but other reasons for it are the liberality of our laws and the generous encouragement which is given to settlement. The measures to which reference was made in the Governor General's speech are of very great importance. It must be remembered that the conditions of the various States are very diverse. I may fairly say that there are not two States whose conditions are alike. Consequently the legislation which is proposed here necessarity provoked a great deal of discussion. We can only hope that the laws which are passed will prove beneficial, not to particular States alone, but to the whole Commonwealth. Last session we passed into law twenty-one Acts, apart from measures of a financial nature, so that our first session was not an idle one; and I feel sure that the legal foundation for the working of the Commonwealth which was thus laid will - later redound to our credit. We have heard from some of the eloquent speakers in this Chamber that many of the Bills which are to be brought forward this session will be of the greatest importance to the - future welfare of the Commonwealth, and no doubt they must. W it h regard to the establishment of a High Court, I feel that unless some economical proposal is put before us I cannot support the Bill. My idea is that the Judges of the States courts will be sufficient for some time to come. There may be cases involving hundreds or thousands of pounds which should come before federal courts, but, as a trial, the Chief J ustices of the States might very well be used for a year or two to constitute such a court. If that is done, there will be a great saving of expense, and justice will be meted out to those who ask fori t . W it h regard to the federal capital, I , for one, willnot agree to the expenditure of any large sum of money upon buildings. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Parkes that it is a mistake for the Federal Parliament to meet in one of the capitals of the States, because its members must be influenced to some extent by the newspapers of that State. If economy were practised I - think that the necessary buildings could be erected without imposing too serious a burden upon the finances of the Commonwealth. I am entirely in accord with the proposal to establish courts of conciliation and arbitration. We have just had an illustration in this State of how business and commerce are paralyzed when a large industrial dispute takes place. If a similar dispute occurred at one time in more than one State the disaster would be very great. An y measure which will prevent strikes, and will save men, and especially women and children, from their effects, will be a good one. In AVestern Australia there were in 1901 two strikes which paralyzed trade, and honourable members can imagine the consternation and misery which was created by the stoppage of supplies to the gold-fields, which are dependent for communication on about 400 miles of railway. I am also ready to support the proposed naval subsidy of £200,000 per annum. It would be suicidal for a country with a population of something like 3,800,000, to spend, say £1,000,000 upon the purchase of a war > v - ssel. AAe should still have its up-keep r to provide for, and it would practically give us no protection at all. I feel sure, however, that under' the new naval agreement we shall be well protected. I hope that the Government 'will see that the war ships are allowed to move from port to port. In the past the people of ""Western Australia, who have always contributed their share to the subsidy, have «een very little of the vessels of the squadron. The honourable member for Darling Downs spokein favourof the establish ment of - a Federal Department of Agriculture. That .suggestion was first made by the honourable - and learned member for Bendigo, and it is - a pity that it has not been carried out. Such a department need not necessarily be - expensive, but it would do a great deal of ,good by its investigations into the capabilities of various kinds of soil, and by the information which it could give to agr.i-culturists of all kinds. I wish to call the Attention of the Minister for Trade and 'Customs to a case which I should like to bring under his notice. A firm in Western Australia some time ago imported some timber, and as the documents necessary to pass a Customs entry did not arrive with the timber, an arrangement was made with the department thab a deposit of £ 5 0 should be paid, and that the entries should be made in dueform when the proper - documenbs arrived. That happened in due - course, and somebhing like £ 2 6 was paid in duby. Bub upon an applicabion for a refund of the difference, ib was stated thab the money had been paid inbo the revenue accounb, and thab the Cusboms Acb did nob allow any of ib to be reburned. I will read copies of the papers in the case which have been placed in 1113' hands, the originals having been senb bo the Comptroller-General of Customs. The first is a letter to ni}'self, which I do not think it necessary to read. The next letter is addressed to the Collecbor of Customs, Fremantle, and is dated Fremantle, 6th November, 1902. It reads as follows :Dear Sir,-B y the Wo/lowru, which reached this port in January last, at Adelaide, we had 1,215 pieces of timber transhipped from a vessel from America. The papers forwarded to us were not sufficient to satisfy your department, and, by jiermission, we deposited the sum of £50 (fifty pounds) to obtain delivery, and to produce the specification and other information when received. These papers have come to hand, and we desire to complete entries, but we are informed that .the £50 has been paid into revenue. The amount of duty charged in the shipment is - U26 f Is. it will be seen that a sum of J-23 Ss. 8d. is due to us. We will be pleased to learn that upon our ing the necessary entries we may obtain a refund of this amount. The reply was dated 7th November, and reads as follows :In reply to your letter of yesterday's date, I beg to inform you that the amount in question being on deposit over the period allowed, viz., G (six) months, was carried to revenue, and as your firm failed to produce the documents required by this Act within the prescribed time, I am unable.to approve of any application for a refund of ihe amount overpaid. On the 22nd November a letter was addressed to the Comptroller-General of Customs at Melbourne, in the following terms :We respectfully ask your consideration of a deposit entiy made by us in January last, as ]ier onr letter to Collector of Customs here, and his replies thereto, as per copies enclosed herewith. We learn that according to section 17, Federal Customs Act, six (6) months is the period allowed for such deposit, but of this fact we were ignorant, and, therefore, under the circumstances, we trust you will deal justly with the case. On the 4th December the Comptroller General repliedI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst., for refund in connection with an amount deposited by you with the collector, Fremantle, in January hist, to cover duty 011 certain timber ex Wolloicra, and in reply to inform you that the Customs Act does not permit compliance with your request. I think that was really a hard ease, because the firm affecbed was one of good standing, and handed over £ 5 0 as a deposit in order to secure duty which amounted to not more than £ 2 6 . I direct the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs to this matter in the besb spirit, and I feel sure thab thab honesby of purpose which has distinguished his administration will prompt him to act fairly in this instance. A letter which appeared in today's Argus, signed by Messrs. Blogg Brothers, shows the difficulties and inconveniences to which manufacturers, even in Melbourne, are subjected",59
333,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I could say something very funn}' about that letter if I wished.,60
334,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not think it necessary to read the letter, but simply direct attention to it . I desire to $&y a few words wibh reference bo the branscontineubal railway bo Wesbern Australia Some honourable members, representing 4d., so South Australia, seem to look upon this proposal in a very parochial spirit. They think that because the Western Australian piss- Legislature declined to authorize the construction of a railway from Esperance Bay to the gold-fields, the South Australian Government should, therefore, their consent to the construction of the line through their territory to ""Western Australia. The House has ahead} been informed that distinct promises were made to the Minister for Defence and others before Western Australia entered the federation. It was represented by Sir John Forrest, who was then-Premier of Western Australia, that South Australia was really in earnest in her desire to have the railway constructed, and if it had not been for such assurances, Western Australia would certainly not have entered the union. It has been stated that if a railway had been constructed from Esperance to the gold-fields, it would have greatly assisted South Australia, and apparently that State would prefer to have the local line rather than a railway which would connect Western Australia with the other States of the Commonwealth, and promote the general benefit. Would it nob be better, after all, for Soubh Australia if goods could be sent direct from Adelaide to Kalgoorlie rather than by steamer to Esperance and then by rail to the gold-fields 1 I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Soubh Australia, Mr Batchelor, say thab he was favourable bo the construction of the line, although he could not vote for it ab present. We do nob wish honourable members bo pledge themselves to vote for the construction of the line until the necessary information, now under preparation, with regard to water supply and many other matters is placed in their hands, because we know that it would be suicidal on our part to urge the construction of the railway before its success could be fairly assured. Thehonorableand learned member for Parkes rather pooh-poohed the idea that the railway would be of any use for the purpose of conveying troops. I hope that many years will pass before any necessity arises for using the line for such a purpose : but I feel sure that we should act wisely in placing ourselves in a position to convey broops to almost any point of our exbensive coasbline, in order bo meet a threatened Ib is questionable whether a railway from Esperance Bay to the gold-fields, such as has been ardently desired by the people of South Australia, would pay or prove of any real benefit to our neighbours in that in fact, it might have the effecb that neither the present line from Fremantle or the suggested line would pay; so that I hope too Mr E. Solomon. much importance will not be atbached to withhold the refusal of Western Australia to construct the Esperance line. I hope the Government will push on with the inquiries 7 now being made in regard to the transcontinental railway, and that the line will be surveyed without unnecessary delay.",60
335,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I think that, in view of the long speech made by the Minister for Trade and Customs, we may fairly ask the Prime Minister to consent to an adjournment of the debabeab this stage.",61
336,Sir EDMUND BARTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I think that we might go on a little further to-night. I have been very considerate to honourable members in allowing early adjournments, and I think they should be satisfied if we close ab a quarter to eleven.",61
337,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In view of all the circumstances, the Prime Minister might very fairly have consented to an adjournment, bub I know that I need not expect very much consideration from him, and, therefore, I am quite prepared to proceed. A great variety of subjects have been dealt with in the course of this debabe, bub mosb of bhem are of the greatest importance, and deserve the fullest consideration at our hands. Therefore, I do nob regard the time devoted to their discussion as wasted. No doubt the Government are anxious to conclude the debate, in order that they may escape further caustic criticism, and enter upon the work of the session without further delay. One of the charges levelled against the Prime Minister is that he was nob perfectly fair to the electors of the Commonwealth, and particularly to bhose of New Soubh Wales, when he indicated to them the Tariff policy which he stated it was intended to submit to this Parliament. The Prime Minister, in his reply to the leader of the Opposition, declared that there was no reasonable ground for the assumption thab he was not perfecbly frank wibh the electors of New South Wales in regard to this matter. But I am disposed to think that the criticism of the leader of the Opposition was perfectly justified. I would reinvasion. mind the right honourable gentleman that a very strong feeling existed in New South Wales over the question of the adoption of the Constitution. That feeling largely obliterated the old lines of difference beState: tween persons entertaining opposite fiscal views. If for no other reason than that, the Prime Minister should have fully disclosed to the electors the character of the Tariff which he intended to submit to this Parliament. At the conclusion of the severe contest in connection with the adoption of the Constitution a meeting was held at Bathurst to consider the future position of the federal movement. At that meeting the chief figure was the Prime Minister, who was regarded as' the leader of the profederal movement in New South Wales. The battle-cry which he then raised in connection with the impending struggle was not one of protection versus free-trade, but the main contention was that the Constitution was in danger. He appealed to the electors to rally round the federal party, and thus save the Constitution. The reason for this action was that a large section of the anti-federalists were prepared to do all they possibly could to defeat the purposes underlying that instrument of government. At the meeting held in Bathurst, amongst the gentlemen who occupied seats upon the platform were the honourable member for 'Wentworth and the honoiable and learned member for Parkes. The tenor of their addresses was strongly in accord with the policy outlined by the Prime Minister ; bub they were wise enough nob bo burn bheir boabs, and when they became familiar wibh the characber of the Tariff which was bo be submibted, they wisely drew back.' No doubt they congratulate bhemselves bo-day that they are nob in the position of many of the old-bime free-braders of New Soubh Wales. For example, one of the right-hand supporters of the Prime Minister in his own electorate was a free-trader. He supported him upon the understanding bhat the righb honourable genbleman was bo be the leadernob of a probectionisb Governmenb, bub of a Federal Adminisbrabion. The federal idea was bo be uppermost. When the Tariff was submitted bo bhis House he withdrew his support, and during the course of the present debate the Prime Minister has declared thab the genbleman in question had nob sense enough bo perceive whab was the real position at the time. Yet in his Maitland address I find that the Prime Minister, amongst other things, stated-I have not come here to conduct a protectionist campaign, though under other circumstances I should have been prepared to do so. Later on, in addressing a Brisbane audience, he is reported to have said that the difference between the policy of the Government and that. of the other side was only a thin veneer - that it was .not the wide fundamental distinction which is implied by a probecbive as distinguished from a freebrade Tariff. During the same campaign the Minisber for Home Affairs is reported to have saidHe could only call it cruel to raise the fiscal question now, when the very Constitution itself rendered free-trade and protection alike impossible. All these facts go to show that the fiscal issue was not submitted to the electors. I would further point out that Senator O'Connor gave utberance bo sentiments similar bo bhose enberbained by the Minister for Home Affairs. The Vice-President of the Executive Council is reported to have saidWe ought not to allow the wretched fiscal question to come in, but we ought to choose the best men. That was the original battle-cry. The men who were in sympathy with the federal movement were to receive first consideration, aud the wretched fiscal issue was not to be raised. But what happened? After the elecbions had been won, the Government had to evolve their taxation proposals. In submitting bhose proposals bo bhis House the Minisber for Trade and Customs declaredThis is a protectionist policy. We were sent here by the people to support that policy, and we place it before you with the force of our majority behind us. That is very different from the statement which was .made throughout New South Wales prior bo the elections. All things considered, I think there is very substantial ground for the criticism which has been levelled against the Government upon this particular matter. I regret to say that the high expectations formed of the first Federal Administration have not been realized. Probably the reason for bhis is bo be found in the facb thab the Prime Minister selected his present colleagues very largely from the legal profession of the obher States. The resulb is that in the adminisbrabion of the affairs of governmenb we gebtoo much of legal bechnicalibies and boo little of common-sense. The result is that much friction has been caused throughout the Commonwealth by an incapacity on the part of Ministers to handle matters in a commonsonse manner. Whilst I freely confess that 1 was in opposibion bo the Consbibution Bill, because I wished to see it more democratic in some respects, I bhink I have every reasonable ground for claiming thab I am as sincere a federalist as the men who fought for a conservative Constitution. I hope that federation will not be judged by the mismanagement of the first Federal Government. I join heartily with the mover of the address in reply in the hope that as time goes on those causes of friction will disappear, and that the great advantages to the whole of the people of Australia from this union will present themselves in so Strong a light that dissatisfaction will be forgotten, and all will assist in upholding and supporting the federal movement. i\ matterof great regret to every friend of the union that the Federal Government have made such a bad start. If even now the Government .could see their way to clear themselves of the mere legal technicalities, red tape, and blue paper which, as it were, make the Federal Government stink in the nostrils of the average member of the public, they would serve the high purpose I have no doubt they have in view much better than they are doing at present. This weakness is seen right through the various departments, from that of the Minister in the case of the half-dozen hatters, down to the administration of the Post and Telegraph department, am afraid that even the department of Defence is not altogether free from this irritating red-tapeism. As to the hatters, I wish to say that I supported the provision under which they excluded, because I believed that a law of that character was necessary and desirable in the best interests of the people of Australia. And I am not prepared to go back on the stand I then took ; but it is most regrettable that the powers conferred bj' this provision were put into operation on this particular occasion. that the papers which have been produced place a much more favourable light on the conduct of the Prime Minister appeared when the question was exciting high feeling in the State of New South Wales. There was some substantial ground for the feeling of friction which was occasioned in that State. The Prime Minister in his reply seemed. to wish to lead the House to suppose the noise was caused by opponents of his Government, and of the principles of legislation of this character. I remind the Prime Minister, that perhaps one of his strongest political friends in New South Wales is his late colleague, Mr Brown. the present Premier of that State. That gentleman is not likely to lend himself toany expression of hostility towards the Federal Government on measures of thisdescription, but he saw grave grounds fortaking exception to the action of the Prime Minister. In the height of the disturbance, before the Prime Ministercame to a decision, Sir John See telegraphed, to him as follows :I sincerely hope your Government will see fitrelease hatters on OrovMs without further delay. But it is Matter raising intense dissatisfaction here. 'The following day Sir John See wired againJust received cable from Agent-General that, action taken to prevent landing of British workmen seriously affects financial proposals of this State. Again strongly urge permission to land.",61
338,Mr TIJDOB,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Si r John See did not know all the facts of the case.,63
339,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That was a request from the Premier of New South Wales, who is not in any way hostile to the Prime Minister of Prime the Commonwealth. Indeed, when the Prime Minister or any member of the Federal Cabinet addresses a meeting in Sydney the Pre-and I mier of the mother State is able to join him on the platform and support the Government in matters of general policy. But he could notsupportthem in the matter of thehatters. I am open to correction, but I am were informed that Mr Anderson also is a strong supporter of the present Government, and notlikely in a matter of the kind to do anything to their detriment. Mr Anderson spentsomething like £30,000 in Sydney in equipping a factory for the production of' hats, and he was not likely to spend thatsum of money for nothing. For his factory I admit he required 72 skilled"" hands, and was prepared to give employment to about 200 or 300 other persons; and,' according to histhan own statement, he endeavoured to secure this skilled labour in the State of Victoria before he sought assistance from outside the Commonwealth. I find from a return prepared by the trades unions for the information of the Prime Minister, that in this tradethere are 173 skilled hands in Victoria, that twenty in South Australia, fifteen in New South Wales, and three in Western Australia, or a total of about 211 within theBut Commonwealth. Papers produced show conclusively that Mr Anderson was not able to get anything like the number he wanted in Australia, and he-decided to import hands. I . cannot understand the - opposition which in certain quarters was shown to theimportation of skilled men of this description. Itmeant theopening of a new industry, and enlarging the productive powers of the Commonwealth; instead of making the conditions of labour worse, it meant the opening up of new avenues of employment. I have no sympathy with the cry that, the population of the Commonwealth should be kept down to its present figure. We have immense possibilities in the way of developing the wealth of Australia, but the possibilities are dormant until such time as intelligent labour can be brought to bear.' If this Commonwealth is to be the great nation we hope, we must be prepared not only to see an increase of population but to afford facilities to that population for developing the natural resources of the land. To prohibit the starting of new lines of industry, or to prevent the introduction of skilled hands, is, in my opinion, the most suicidal policy which could be followed ; at any rate, it is a policy to which I cannot give any adhesion. But in the State of Victoria, and increasingly so in New South Wales, such are the conditions that I'believe it would he most unwise to launch.any large scheme of assisting or inducing population, to come here. We arc not able to hold the population we have at the present .time. The very best men of these two States are - being driven away because the natural resources are in the hands of a monopolistic few, who will not uso those resources themselves, or afford others reasonable facilities for d.oing so. Until the State Governments solve this problem I have no hope of any great additions to our population in the near future, but am rather inclined to think that the leakage we are now experiencing will continue, to the detriment of the Commonwealth and our national prosperity. The Prime Minister took a week to consider the matter of the six hatters; and here I may say that I believe the right honourable gentleman, in insisting on an exemption being applied for, was ' only carrying out the law. The difficulty of the position was first of all that the particular section was in an Alien Restriction Act which primarily dealt with coloured races; and. both employers and workmen in the old country may be excused for their ignorance of the character of the legislation.",63
340,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That was not the case with these men.,64
341,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I have no doubt they were told something about the law in Melbourne.,64
342,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,They were told before they left the old country.,64
343,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"This provision had never been exercised before. Mr Anderson, according to his own statement, sought legal advice, and he was informed that the Act did not apply to men who were beingbrought out under the terms of his agreement. After considerable negotiation, after he had been put to the expense of journeying from Sydney to Melbourne to interview the Prime Minister,. and after the Prime Minister had consulted a number of persons, interested in the trade, it was discovered that the whole trouble was due to the fact, that one of the blue paper forms of which the Federal Government is so fond had not been filled in. When Mr Anderson wasset on the right course, the Prime Minister discovered, as he wrote in his minute, that It is clear that Mr Anderson cannot find his72 men among the existing personnel of the Australian hat trade within the Commonwealth, and orders were issued to allow the men to be landed. Instead of being treated as. they were, they should have been treated as the Sultan of Johore and the Maoris whocame here were treated. It was most unwise to administer the law as it was administered. I am a friend of the Act , because I believe it to be a necessary one, and I want to see its provisions carried into effect. But I say that it was unfortunate, in the interests of that legislation, that the incident happened. If the men had a right to come here, they should not have been placed in such an invidious position; but, on the other hand, if they came out under conditions inimical to the publicwelfare, they should have been treated as undesirable immigrants, and not allowed to land. I believe that great damage has been done to the Commonwealth in the opinion of the old world by the action which was taken. I make that statement on the authority of the Premier of New South Wales, and of the Agent General of that State, both of Whom are personal friends and former colleagues of the Prime - Minister, and would not say anything calculated to injure him .unlessthey'found it absolutely necessary to do so.
