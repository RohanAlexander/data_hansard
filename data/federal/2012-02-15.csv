1,Ms GILLARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," by leave-In the long story of relations among the peoples of our nationthe story of our struggles with each other and of our struggles to reconcile-there have been some good days which we will not forget. Days when a glimpse of a better time came briefly into view. We have cherished them. We cherished 27 May 1967, when Australians voted 'yes' to empower the Commonwealth to bring the resources of the whole nation to bear to address Indigenous disadvantage. Perhaps the greatest was here, four years ago, 13 February 2008, when Kevin Rudd said 'sorry'. Sorry on behalf of all of us, for the 'grief, suffering and loss', the 'pain, suffering and hurt', for the 'indignity and degradation'. A day we cherished, when we saw our nation as we wish it could always be. Now we look forward to another such day-to the day when Australia‘s Indigenous peoples are recognised in the act which constitutes the Australian Commonwealth. And we look forward to the work that we will do together on all the days that lie between. Every day, our conscience demands we work to Close the Gap. That work, every day, is what this government has done. By embracing the targets of the Closing the Gap campaign, this government deliberately leaves itself nowhere to hide. Closing the Gap is a practical and empirical project and it is a project that should move us deeply, work which will make such a difference in so many individual lives. We aim to have the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five by 2018, so more Indigenous babies live; to ensure access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities by 2013, so more Indigenous children are ready on their first day of school; to have the gap in literacy and numeracy achievements for children by 2018, so more Indigenous children know the love of books; to have the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2020, so more Indigenous young people are ready for life and a job; to have the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians by 2018, so more Indigenous adults know the dignity and benefits of work; and we aim to close the life-expectancy gap within a generationthat is, by 2031-so every Indigenous Australian has the chance to grow old. Measurement Has Improved Measurement is central to this project of for Closing the Gap. Because the Closing the Gap targets are not meant just to challenge us to do more-they are designed to hold us accountable to our ambitions. It is through the annual assessment of the independent COAG Reform Council that is published in June each year and through the annual Closing the Gap report, which the government releases today, that we are brought to book. The targets we have set are specific and measurable tests of our improvement. Last year I reported that measurement of progress towards these targets, including by the states and territories, also needs to improve. However we can already track progress in reducing under-five-year-old mortality each year. We have effective measures of access to early childhood education and our measurement of achievements in reading, writing and numeracy is sound. Direct measurement of life expectancy and year 12 attainment relies on the Australian census data, which is only available every five years. So we track overall mortality on an annual basis-and this forms a reliable proxy from which we can track improvement in life expectancy. And we track trends in apparent school retention each year, which acts as a guide to year 12 attainment. Our employment target is measured using the respected National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey, direct measures of progress which are available every three years-supplemented by the five-yearly census. But when we began the work of closing the gap, we knew that we needed better information about Indigenous health, education and employment. This is why the 2009-10 budget invested almost $50 million extra over four years, funding new work by national data agencies and the states and territories, to give us data which is more detailed and reliable, more comprehensive and easier to compare-particularly between census years. This year I can report that measurement has improved. Central to the effort to measure progress is the census-and last year‘s was better than any before. Twenty million dollars of that extra funding was allocated to improve census data collection methods. Local engagement managers and mobile teams built early rapport with Indigenous communities. They organised the delivery and collection of census books differently and they developed new ways for people who aren‘t literate in English to answer census questions. They worked especially hard in the most remote areas and among the most disadvantaged. Indigenous communities themselves already tell us the 2011 census was an important improvement on the past. We have improved other measurement besides the census. To improve data on access to early childhood education, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has led the development of the new National Early Childhood Education and Care data collection. Importantly, this collection includes data on early childhood education in early childhood centres. We now have nationally consistent data on smoking during pregnancy and we have agreed data to track the timing of the first antenatal visit-so we will be able to say how many Indigenous women get advice from a health professional at the right times during their pregnancy. New key performance indicators will help us better understand the contribution of Indigenous specific primary health care services. All this is thankless, detailed, timeconsuming work-performed by dedicated professionals in statistical collection and analysis. But because of it, I am confident we can say that we are better placed than ever before to measure effectively our progress to close the gap. Progress against the Closing the Gap targets Today‘s Closing the Gap report shows that the foundations for overcoming Indigenous disadvantage are in place. The report shows that we are seeing progresswe are making gradual gains. The Australian government remains most confident of meeting two of the six targets. The target of halving the infant mortality rates for Indigenous children under five by 2018 is on track. We are also confident we can ensure access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities by 2013. For the third, we are also now generally on track to meet the target to have the reading, writing and numeracy achievement for Indigenous children by 2018. This assessment is based on results from the annual National Assessment ProgramLiteracy and Numeracy, which most people know as NAPLAN. We can see measurable improvement in the 2011 NAPLAN results. Significant gains occurred between 2010 and 2011 in the percentage of Indigenous students at or above the national minimum standards. For example, year 3 numeracy was up by 7.0 percentage points and year 9 reading was up by 7.7 percentage points. In fact in seven of the eight areas in which we can assess progress in reading and numeracy since 2008 the gap has narrowed. And in six of these eight, the improvement over four years is fast enough that if it continues we will meet the target by 2018. In year 7 and year 9 numeracy progress still needs to accelerate. We continue to see improvement in two more of the six targets, and with faster improvement over time we believe these can be reached. The report shows that apparent retention rates to year 12 are improving for Indigenous students-up from barely 30 per cent in 1995 to just over 47 per cent in 2010. Faster improvement will be required to have the gap in year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2020. We will need to keep expanding post-school training education-we need more places. We will need to keep working with Indigenous young people to ensure they find the opportunities which exist in the education and training system. Faster improvement will also be required to have the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians by 2018. Indigenous employment has increased sharply in Australia in recent decades, reflecting a long period of almost uninterrupted economic gap in growth-and an active and engaged approach from corporate Australia. Never before in our nation‘s history has business been more prepared to play its part. Just under 90,000 additional jobs were won by Indigenous Australians from 1994 to 2008. The Indigenous unemployment rate fell from 31 per cent in 1994 to 23 per cent in 2002 and to 16.6 per cent in 2008. In urban areas, the majority of Indigenous Australians of working age are employed-this was not the case 20 years ago. Closing the gap on life expectancy by 2031 remains the most challenging target of all. Progress towards the other health, education and employment targets all provide strong foundations to help us lift life expectancy. And the life expectancy target is the longest term of the six-it is a twenty-five-year target. While the challenge is very large we do know that some progress is being made. In Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory the Indigenous mortality rate declined by 36 per cent from 1991 to 2010-and there was a significant narrowing of the gap in mortality rates with non-Indigenous Australians. We know what the main causes of Indigenous mortality are-chronic disease and accident and injury, so we are working to limit their incidence and reduce the harm they do. Hundreds of extra Indigenous health workers and are working to attack scourges like cancer, diabetes, heart disease and mental illness, as well as targeting risk factors for chronic disease such as smoking, poor nutrition and lack of exercise. Four years into a 25-year project, this much is true: health outcomes, employment outcomes, education outcomes are improving; they need to keep improving and to improve more quickly. This much is also true: foundations are in place, work is underway, we can measure encouraging improvement right now. This is our progress towards Closing the Gap. The work goes on One of the great myths of Indigenous disadvantage is that it persists despite decades of expensive public responses. The reality is quite the reverse. Report after report has shown that decades of underinvestment in services and infrastructure are unquestionably a major cause of disadvantage, especially for the very young. No Australian family, however hard working, self-respecting or self-reliant, is expected to fix broken sewerage pipes at the end of their street or repair street lighting outside their house. These are things governments are responsible for-the basic, universal services all Australians are entitled to expect. So the Australian government has heard the call to change. We have delivered billions of dollars of additional investment in the 'building blocks' of better lives. In early childhood and in schools, in health and healthy homes, in economic participation, in safe communities, in leadership and governance. I have seen the difference this is making even in places where problems seem as intractable as they have been in the town camps of Alice Springs. And so many Indigenous people have heard the call to change too. They have taken on new responsibilities, not only to improve their own circumstances, but also to share the example with their young. I have met the people who are making these changes in their own lives. They know that no Australian government, however active or ambitious, can get any child out of bed for school in the morning or make any parent ask visitors to leave at a reasonable hour so the children in a small house can sleep. These things are the responsibilities of every Australian family. Another great myth of Indigenous disadvantage is that the nation must choose between 'two reconciliations'-symbolic and practical. That we must choose between a reconciliation which respects the rights and responsibilities of culture and land and a reconciliation which respects the rights and responsibilities to education, health and jobs. This is also quite false. It runs against what we all know to be true in our own lives-that the things of the spirit are inextricably linked with the things of day-today life. A life of plenty without respect and acceptance is still a life half-lived-as is a life of poverty with respect and acceptance. Human beings need to nourish and sustain both body and soul. The reconciliation we seek between us is not something which can be sorted or classified like a list of policy priorities. We seek precisely the kind of harmony and concorda national unity-which can never be whole or complete under conditions of poverty and unfairness. And we seek precisely the kind of practical benefits in people‘s lives: better education, employment and health, which can never ultimately work without sharing responsibility and self-respect. I think of my visit to the Northern Territory during the dry season last year. There, in the spectacularly beautiful Alice Springs Desert Park, I handed back to traditional owners the title to their land under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. I saw people overwhelmed and emotional about the handover and what it represented. I remember Alice Ngalkin signing the deeds while her friends and family took photos to mark the event. A moment of great symbolic power which I shared with deep respect and which on that day brought me so much closer to the Indigenous people there. And in the atmosphere of respect which we had built between us, the local Aboriginal elders and I then sat down to talk. And they told me as frankly as anyone could, with both sentiment and deep conviction, what they believed I need to know about the practical problems they face. They spoke about the need to listen and to trust. And they said that the education system had failed Aboriginal people and it is critical to addressing disadvantage. They said that the way the emergency response started in 2007 caused shame and hurt and they wanted to stay with us on the new journey. And they spoke about alcohol and its harms-the need to be tougher. They did not pick sides in some dialectic or debate, but because of the trust we had shared that day, we could speak together in respect about what they knew was wrong and what they knew would work. And that week, on the Gove Peninsula, I saw the traditional owners of the land and the representatives of a mining giant sign an agreement. Signed before a gathering of thousands of people from all over Arnhem Land and from all around Australia. We all met there for a striking ceremony performed on what was long contested country, where those most potent of all symbols of the struggle for land-the Yirrkala bark petitions-were inscribed in 1963. And we met to celebrate an agreement which secures the future operations of the bauxite mine, alumina refinery and Nhulunbuy township, which delivers Indigenous people real economic benefits from the mining investment boom, with economic development, jobs, better housing and community facilities. In the Desert Park and on the peninsulaamong Australians who treasure progress and respect-I have seen and felt the presence of the reconciled nation we can become. Where secure title to the big tracts of traditional land gives traditional owners a long-term economic future and a share in the jobs and opportunities the land can create. And where secure title to a home in a town or community gives parents the security to raise and educate their children in a safe environment. Where, by saying sorry for the wrongs of the past and by recognising Indigenous people in our Constitution, we build respect between all Australians. And where that respect allows us to speak honestly with each other as we decide, together, what works where. Not to the detriment of basic local service deliverynever accepting the 'soft bigotry of low expectations' or attempting to 'explain away' violence against women. But yes, bound together as individuals and as a nation by shared symbols of respect and practical action-listening to each other properly, about what the best evidence tells us about what will make the greatest difference. Whether the conversation is between a minister of my cabinet and the National Congress of Australia‘s First Peoples, or between a departmental official and a parent who works part time as a local teacher‘s aide, we listen to each other-and then we get on with the job. This is the relationship between our people that I seek. Constitutional recognition Perhaps the ultimate manifestation of respect is constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. The proposal before the country now has been many years in the making. Over decades, many ways to recognise Indigenous Australians as our first peoples, to affirm their full and equal citizenship and to remove remaining traces of racial discrimination from our law have been proposed. In August 1937, William Cooper sent a petition with 1,814 signatures to Prime Minister Joseph Lyons requesting that he forward it to King George VI, seeking direct representation in parliament. In June 1988, the chairs of the northern and central land councils presented the Barunga Statement to Prime Minister Bob Hawke. It called upon the Australian government and people to recognise key Indigenous rights and 'to negotiate a treaty recognising our prior ownership, continued occupation and sovereignty and affirming our human rights and freedoms'. And my party‘s national platform has pledged its support to constitutional recognition since 1998. Then, in October 2007, Prime Minister John Howard raised the hopes of a nation, pledging that: If re-elected, I will put to the Australian within 18 months a referendum to formally recognise Indigenous Australians in our Constitution-their history as the first inhabitants of our country, their unique heritage of culture and languages, and their special (though not separate) place within a reconciled, indivisible nation. It was a gracious and deliberate statement which effectively began the contemporary process that leads to today. And four years on, the movement for constitutional recognition is strong and growing. It grew through 2008, when the cabinet met in East Arnhem Land and was solemnly petitioned to continue with this process. And in 2010 I announced the appointment of an Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians to do the hands-on work of developing options for constitutional change. I didn‘t send the panel on an easy journey-and they performed mightily. Last month, the co-chairs, Patrick Dodson and Mark Leibler, delivered the panel‘s report on Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution to the government. I have thanked them publicly already and I do so again here today. For constitutional change, Australians have to understand and be persuaded of the case for change. This does require allembracing political bipartisanship. But it requires more. Political bipartisanship, while necessary, is not sufficient. We need more than the consent of the governed to an agreement between parliamentarians-we need a genuine community desire for change. Our Constitution is our nation‘s founding contract-our people rightly guard it with care. Support for constitutional recognition must genuinely have the people‘s support. This is what happened in 1967. Yes, bipartisanship-but more. A deep feeling in people the Australian community leading to millions of Australian people deciding to say yes to change. Today, the minister for Indigenous affairs and I are announcing funding for a community conversation, to be sponsored by Reconciliation Australia. To build support for what is already the subject of bipartisan agreement: the principle of constitutional recognition. And to build understanding of the ways in which constitutional recognition might be achieved. The expert panel‘s report provides a firm foundation for this discussion. This is an opportunity for the Australian people to get involved. To get on the You Me Unity website, to learn about what‘s in the panel‘s report, and what happens next. To find practical information and solid ideas and to discuss them-in their homes and with their neighbours, in their community meetings and in their workplaces, in their trade unions and in their churches. The government is committed to this change-we are committed to building public support for this change-and in the many conversations which follow in the Australian community, we will take a leading part. It is through the sum of that myriad of conversations, of people listening and speaking with respect, that we will truly know that our people are ready to say yes to this change. Small victories The day we said sorry was a great day in this nation‘s history. The day of constitutional recognition will be another. Closing the gap is an accumulation of all the small victories on all the many days that lie between. The young man, first in his family to learn a trade, with skilled work on his traditional lands. The young woman, first in her family to earn a degree, holding a job in the city. The basic public services that surround them, delivered at the standard every Australian expects. The keys to a couple‘s first home-and the life of dignity and pride they live within it, raising children who are ready to take their place in a reconciled nation. The respect shown to them by people in the community where they live. The detailed measurements which tell us this is so. When more Indigenous children are ready to learn on their first day of school, we will know we are closing the gap. When brilliant Indigenous school leavers are as sought after by the big firms as brilliant Indigenous footballers are sought after by the big clubs, we will know we are closing the gap. When fewer Indigenous men between 35 and 45 die of disease, we will know we are closing the gap. Today, we know we have a long way to go. But we also know we are closing the gap. I present a copy of the Closing the gap: Prime Minister's report 2012. Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (09:30): Mr Speaker, I seek leave to move a motion to enable the honourable Leader of the Opposition to speak for 30 minutes. Leave granted. Mr STEPHEN SMITH: I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Abbott (Leader of the Opposition) speaking for a period not exceeding 30 minutes. Question agreed to.",21
2,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I rise with pride to follow the Prime Minister on this occasion. I do congratulate her on a fine speech. May I say that it is on occasions such as this that our parliament is at its best because we are discussing a noble objective on which we are all agreed. So I congratulate the Prime Minister. I congratulate the former Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for his role and his work. The historic apology was a very significant milestone in our national life and it is appropriate that we remember that on a day such as this. It was gracious of the Prime Minister to also acknowledge her predecessor but one, Prime Minister Howard, and his commitment to the cause of constitutional recognition of Indigenous people. Prime Minister Howard had a long personal journey when it came to Indigenous issues. It was a difficult journey in some ways for him. One of the best speeches he ever gave was to the Sydney Institute in October of 2007, where he spoke of his personal journey on Indigenous issues. We are all on a personal journey when it comes to this subject, but I think I can say this: for quite some time now there has been a new spirit of appreciation and engagement of Aboriginal people on the part of the leaders of our country. When we are dealing with Indigenous issues, we do not think of ourselves anymore as solving problems; we think of ourselves as building a nation. That is what we do today when we consider how we can better and further close the gap. I want to thank all of the people who have helped me on my personal journey to better understanding and appreciation of Aboriginal issues and Aboriginal people. I particularly want to thank my friend Noel Pearson for the miles that he has walked with me, literally as well as metaphorically, towards this great goal. I thank Warren Mundine. I do not agree with all of Warren Mundine's positions; nevertheless, he is a great Australian who has been very gracious. He has been very appreciative of work that we have done as well as work that his own party has done towards this great goal. I also want to thank people like Mick Gooda and Sue Gordon. I want to particularly thank those two for the support they gave me just a couple of weeks ago when we had a difficult situation that involved both me and the Prime Minister. I remind the House of what I think was perhaps the most lapidary remark of the former Prime Minister in his apology: … unless the great symbolism of reconciliation accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong. It should be a resonant statement, evocative as it is not just of the great issue before us but of our great heritage of love and of reaching out to people. We must always remember that, unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong. The Prime Minister has given us some very encouraging statistics today. There is much to be grateful for. There is much to take satisfaction in. There is much to be proud of in what the Prime Minister has told us today. I do not want to quibble because I know that, were I in her position, I would be recounting similar statistics to the House. They are important, yet so often when we look at the statistics and we hear the statistics there is a nagging sense that they can obscure as much as they reveal. So often the statistics are a record of what government is doing, rather than a record of how people are living. It is excellent and I congratulate the Prime Minister and the government that we are moving towards halving the gap in so many of these areas, but a gap which has been halved is not a gap which has been closed. In the end, it is not good enough merely to have the gap-we have to close the gap. It was very encouraging to hear the Prime Minister tell us that access to preschool for all four-year-olds living in remote communities would be achieved next year. Remarkable-wonderful, praiseworthy. But it is one thing for people living in these communities to have access to preschool for their four-year-olds; it is another thing to ensure that all the youngsters are attending preschool. This is the big challenge and it is the real test of whether we are building civil society in the remote Indigenous is communities of our country. So often when we see the reports we know the effort that officials are making. We feel a palpable sense of the goodwill behind these reports and yet we do not get a sense that individual lives are improving and that communities are flourishing. We know there are better resourced schools in remote Aboriginal communities but we cannot be sure that Aboriginal children are really better-reading, better-counting; are really more familiar with what they need to know in order to be first-class Australians in the modern world. We know that much money is being spent, that much effort has been expended, on providing better housing in remote Indigenous communities. But can we be sure that these houses are more cherished by their current occupants than the poorer houses of a generation ago were cherished then? We know that much good work is being done in the area of Indigenous employment. I thank and acknowledge people such as Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest and Dick Estens for the work they have done in this area. But still there is not nearly enough Indigenous employment in the real economy as opposed to Indigenous employment in Aboriginal organisations and in the governmental sector. All of us-every Australian, every human being-wants to be able to think that his or her life has been at least as good as the lives of his or her parents and that the lives of his or her children will be better than the life he or she has led. How many Aboriginal people can honestly say today that their life has been better than that of their parents? How many Aboriginal people can honestly say, as they look at their kids, that they are confident that they will have a better life-a life of more self-respect, a life of more fulfilment-than they themselves have had? These are the challenges before us. Again I commend the Prime Minister and all members of this House for the diligence and goodwill that they bring to these issues. But I do think there is still a long journey for all of us to make. The statistics are important and it is good that the statistics are more sophisticated than they were; that ever more effort is being put into their accurate collation. But sometimes I think that the official statistics can overcomplicate things. I have said to this House on previous occasions-it is worth repeating, and I will repeat it whenever I get the opportunitythat there are simpler, easier to collect statistics than those which the Australian Statistician labours over which I think would give us a truer picture of the real state of Indigenous society, particularly in remote communities. How many children are attending school every day? It should be 100 per cent, or near enough to it, and yet we know that it is not. There is no reason why the roll could not be called a couple of times during the school day, and we know there is no reason why, in each Indigenous school right around the country, those statistics could not be published on a month by month basis so that we know exactly what is happening in each school. Exactly what is happening in each school is a microcosm of what is happening in each community. We know, despite all the good intentions, despite all the declarations, that very many Indigenous people do not attend employment programs. We know this because members that of parliament go to Indigenous communities and we see the number of youngsters and adults who plainly are not engaged in school or work in the middle of the day. Why could we not publish on a week by week basis the statistics on precisely how many people have been attending work programs in remote Indigenous communities? Again, that would give us a truer snapshot of the real life of these communities than the more elaborate statistics with which the Statistician busies himself. Finally, we all know that in happy communities the trauma that presents to the clinic is normally the result of something that might have happened in a football match or something that might have happened while mustering stock. We also know that much of the trauma that presents to clinics in remote areas is the result of various forms of domestic violence. This statistic, too, should be collated on a week by week and month by month basis, and it should be published. These are the statistics that would tell us what is really happening in these communities. I would very much commend to the government this proposal of mine that in addition to the statistics that the Prime Minister referred to these simple, easy to gather statistics on school attendance, on work attendance and on trauma presentation be collected community by community and published on a regular basis. I know what these communities are likeI have not lived in them, I have not stayed in them as much as I would have liked; nevertheless I have spent enough time in the remote areas of our country to know about them. I know that if there is an all-night party, as there often is, the adults do not get up to go to work and if the adults do not get up to go to work the children do not get up to go to school. If the adults do not work and the children do not learn, we will never close the gap. That is why there is much more that can be done. We know that by dint of vast efforts by government and superhuman efforts by individuals, better services are being delivered to the Aboriginal communities of our country, but we cannot be sure, as yet, that a better life is being enjoyed by Aboriginal Australians. Real change does not happen in this parliament, although sometimes it might start here and sometimes it might be reflected here. Real change begins in the places where people live. I say again to the parliament what I said this time last year: we should try as far as we can, within the limitations of our official lives, be more engaged with the real lives of Aboriginal people. I have had the privilege of spending some longer periods of time in some of the remote communities of Cape York, in Coen and in Aurukun, and last year Noel Pearson took me to some of his sacred country and I then spent a couple of days helping with a building project not far from Hopevale. All of us are different. All of us have different demands on our time but the more this kind of thing can be done, the better it for policy making and for the quality of government when it comes to Aboriginal people. I say to the parliament that should I become Prime Minister, it is my firm intention, my commitment, to spend at least one week every year in a remote Indigenous community and to do this with officials because it is not enough for the politicians to become more familiar with the real life of these places. The officials, upon whom so much depends, also need to become more familiar with the real life of these places. If it is good enough for the Aboriginal people of Australia to live in these remote communities, it ought to be good enough for the Prime Minister and other members of the government to stay there. We can never forget the importance of good governance in remote Australia. Some people, such as my friend and distinguished former colleague Fred Chaney, go so far as to say that remote Australia is a local version of a failed state because of the problems of governance in these places. Not only do we have the usual not-always-well-coordinated efforts of state and federal government, but we have extra issues with governance and with land councils, and then we have all of the non-government organisations. They are doing good work, but so often they are falling over themselves when attempting to deal with problems. The result is that into remote areas we often have the most governed but least efficient communities in the country. This is a very serious issue and it does need to be tackled. At the risk of straying into partisanship, I need to raise today the issue of the wild rivers legislation, which has now been before this House, one way or another, for the best part of three years. The wild rivers bill is a modest bill and I have now put it several times before this parliament. All the wild rivers bill seeks to do is ensure that is Queensland wild rivers declarations can only apply with the consent of the traditional Aboriginal owners. I am not against wild rivers declarations. I accept that where the traditional owners want them, they should apply. But if Indigenous people are really to be in control of their own land, if they are to enjoy genuine land rights, then surely this is not too much to ask. Yet this modest bill of mine, which has but a couple of operative clauses and which runs to less than nine pages, has now been subject to no fewer than five inquiries by committees of this House or the other place. This modest bill is so inquired into that you cannot help but conclude that those who control this parliament are not trying to analyse it, they are trying to bury it. I fear that it will be to a new government in Queensland to rectify the pusillanimity of this House when it comes to restoring Indigenous rights in this important way. Finally, let me turn to the proposal for constitutional recognition of Indigenous people, which is a bipartisan objective. The coalition has a good history here. Whatever faults we may have in this area, whatever mistakes we may have made in the past, the coalition has a proud history when it comes to efforts to recognise Indigenous people in the Constitution, starting with the proposed preamble that was put to the people back in 1999 and continuing with the former Prime Minister's efforts, which the Prime Minister mentioned earlier today. I devoutly hope that we can bring this to pass, but it does have to be a unifying moment for our country. What we have to try to do is recreate the fervour and the sense of unity that were captured in the 1967 constitutional change. To succeed, any constitutional change in this area has to be completing our Constitution rather than changing it. People have to sense that it is unfinished business that is being addressed rather than a new constitution that is being created. I applaud the work of the expert committee, with which I have had much discussion, but I do think their recommendations are the first word rather than the last word in what should ultimately be put to the people. Whatever differences the Prime Minister and I might have, whatever differences other members of her front bench and I might have, I will work as constructively as I humanly can, and I know members of the coalition will work as constructively as we humanly can, to try to get a proposal that can bring us together. We will not be taking a lowest-commondenominator approach to this. We will not be asking what is the least that people will accept. We will be trying to adopt a highestup common-factor approach to this. What is the best that can be achieved at this time? What can we achieved that future generations can look back on with pride and say of us: 'This generation has genuinely advanced our country?' In conclusion, what we need are more meaningful statistics about the real life of the Aboriginal people in this country, more meaningful engagement between Aboriginal people and all levels of government and meaningful action in this parliament to match the marvellous and uplifting words which are so often spoken in this place. That is what will lead to real reconciliation. That is what we need in order to make our country whole. If we do all that, maybe the time will come when we no longer need Closing the Gap statements, because the gap will indeed have been closed and this country will be everything of which it is capable.

3,Mr COMBET,MOTIONS,"Charlton-Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation) (09:57): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Higher Education Support Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 clarifies the application and operation of indexation arrangements in the Higher Education Support Act 2003. It updates the definitions for ‗course of study in dentistry‘ and ‗course of study in veterinary science‘, and updates the Melbourne College of Divinity‘s name in light of its approval to operate under the title MCD University of Divinity. The bill also allows for technical amendments to the calculation of the voluntary repayment bonus to resolve resounding issues. There is ambiguity in the act about the application of the indexation provisions to amounts in the act on 1 January 2011. The government is making it clear that indexation should have been applied to amounts in the act on 1 January 2011, and that the amounts that are indexed on 1 January 2012 are the 2011 indexed amounts. The terms ‗course of study in dentistry‘ and ‗course of study in veterinary science‘ are used to determine which students are eligible for the higher FEE-HELP limit of $112,132 in 2012. The bill would amend the definitions for BILLS ‗course of study in dentistry‘ and ‗course of study in veterinary science‘ to clarify that only students undertaking courses of study in dentistry or veterinary science that satisfy the minimum academic requirements for registration as a dentist, veterinary surgeon or veterinary practitioner are eligible for the higher FEE-HELP limit. The Melbourne College of Divinity has been approved by the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority to operate under the name MCD University of Divinity until 31 December 2016. Students can make a voluntary repayment towards their HELP debt to the tax office at any time. Voluntary repayments of $500 or more currently attract a five per cent bonus on the payment amount. When calculating the effect of a person making a voluntary repayment of his or her HELP debt, the act provides for a person to obtain a five per cent bonus and includes rounding rules in calculating whether a person has repaid their debt and the amount of debt repaid if it is only a partial repayment. Currently, the effect of the rounding rules is that: (a) when making a full repayment, the person benefits from the rounding because the amount of payment required to pay off their debt in full is reduced because the cents are rounded down; and (b) when making a partial repayment, the person is disadvantaged because the value of the reduction to the outstanding debt due to a payment is rounded down. The bill amends the act to provide that, when calculating the effect of a person making a partial repayment towards his or her HELP debt, the amount would be rounded up to nearest dollar. The cents would continue to be rounded down to determine the amount required for the full repayment of a person‘s HELP debt amount. Effectively, the rounding rules will now always benefit a person making a voluntary repayment. The bill reflects the government‘s continued commitment to improving Australia‘s higher education sector and expanding opportunities for Australians to obtain a high-quality higher education. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Clare. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",32
4,Mr CLARE,MOTIONS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to present to the House this bill, which will introduce an R 18+ category for computer games. This will bring the classification categories for computer games into line with existing categories used to classify films and make the Australian classification regime more consistent with international standards. The bill amends the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 and makes a consequential amendment to schedule 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. This reform has been a long time coming. Agreement to introduce an R 18+ category has been reached after 10 years of negotiations with the states and territories. Over these ten years the Australian computer game industry has grown-along with the number of Australian computer gamers. Research that has been conducted by Bond University suggests that nine in every 10 Australian homes now has a device for playing computer games. The average age of Australian computer gamers is 32-with Australian women making up 47 per cent of computer game players. The Australian gaming industry is forecast to grow at a rate of about 10 per cent a year-with forecasts predicting it will reach $2.5 billion annually by 2015. A lot of Australians are passionate about this reform. When the Attorney-General's Department released a discussion paper on the introduction of an R 18+ classification category for computer games in 2009 they received 58,437 submissions in response. Ninety-eight per cent of these supported the introduction of an R 18+ category. My predecessor in this portfolio, Minister O'Connor, pursued this issue throughout his time as Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice. Last year he led the discussion of this issue with state and territory attorneysgeneral at the Standing Council on Law and Justice. At their July meeting the ministers decided to support this reform. This bill will implement the Commonwealth's obligations as part of this agreement-and state and territory jurisdictions will follow with their own legislation later this year. It is anticipated that the act provided this bill will come into effect on 1 January next year. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Gray. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",33
5,Mr GRAY,MOTIONS,"Brand-Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (10:05): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. It is just over 100 years since the Australian parliament voted to introduce a scheme of compulsory enrolment. Since the scheme commenced in 1912, it has served Australia well. As late as 2001, the Australian National Audit Office commented that the electoral roll was likely to be 95 per cent completenot a bad achievement. Things have changed. The Australian Electoral Commission now estimates that only 90 per cent of eligible Australian citizens are actually enrolled to vote. That is 1½ million Australian citizens who cannot choose their representatives in parliament. That is 1½ million Australians who cannot have their say when proposals to change Australia's Constitution are put to the people. That is 1½ million Australians excluded from exercising one of the most important rights-and responsibilities-of their citizenship. This bill will protect the participation of eligible Australian citizens in the electoral for in process by establishing a safety net for enrolment and voting. It is just that-a safety net. The bill will not change the grounds on which a person becomes entitled to enrol and vote. This amendment will enhance the integrity of the Australian electoral roll. The bill will protect elector participation in two key ways. Firstly, the bill will ensure the accuracy and completeness of the roll by allowing the Electoral Commissioner to directly enrol a person if the Electoral Commissioner is satisfied that the person:  is entitled to enrolment;  has lived at an address for at least one month; and  is not currently enrolled. If the Electoral Commissioner is satisfied that a person meets these criteria, the bill allows the Electoral Commissioner to give the person notice in writing that the Electoral Commissioner proposes to enter that person's name and address on the electoral roll. This notice will advise the recipient that they have 28 days to inform the Electoral Commissioner that they do not live at that address or are not entitled to enrolment. The bill provides the opportunity for a person to seek a review of a decision, including by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is expected that the Electoral Commissioner will use data from sources external to the Electoral Commission to identify people who are entitled to be on the electoral roll but are not. This is similar to the successful processes currently used in New South Wales and Victoria. Information from reliable sources is already used by the Australian Electoral Commission to monitor the accuracy of the roll and to remove a person from the roll through objection action. The Electoral Act does not currently permit the Electoral Commission to use this information to enrol a person. Rather than use the information to object a person off the electoral roll, it is expected that the Electoral Commission will analyse the most reliable and current data available to facilitate a person's enrolment. It is not an automatic process. Every potential elector will be given an opportunity to dispute the information before any action occurs. In its report on the March 2011 election, the New South Wales Electoral Commission advised that their SmartRoll process had a 93 per cent success rate for all enrolment transaction types. There is no reason to think that a similar high success rate could not be replicated at the federal level for new enrolments. The second way in which the bill will protect elector participation is by ensuring that certain people who have been removed from the electoral roll by objection action will have their votes admitted to further scrutiny. This will take place after the Electoral Commission has verified the elector's entitlement to enrolment and voting. The existing law provides that where electors have been removed from the electoral roll due to an administrative error or a mistake of fact, their votes can be admitted to further scrutiny after the Electoral Commission has verified the elector's enrolment and voting entitlement. However, being removed from the roll through objection action does not currently constitute an administrative error or mistake of fact. The bill removes this limitation to ensure that an administrative error or mistake of fact the House. does not hinder an otherwise eligible elector from exercising their right to vote at an election. The bill further provides that the Electoral Commissioner may enrol a person who casts a declaration vote if they meet certain criteria. These are that:  the person has made a declaration vote;  the declaration envelope satisfies the requirements of schedule 3 to the Commonwealth Electoral Act;  the person is entitled to be enrolled for the division; and  the person was omitted from the electoral roll for the division due to an administrative error by an officer or a mistake of fact. The bill leaves unchanged the rule that if a redistribution or more than one election has occurred between the removal from the roll and the current election, the new provisions do not apply. The process undertaken by a citizen to enrol to vote has remained largely unchanged for a century. One hundred years is a long time to keep a process, even one that has served Australia well. With the trend in declining enrolment participation, it is no longer possible to keep doing the same things in the same way, particularly as superior processes have been successfully implemented in New South Wales and Victoria. The bill provides the Electoral Commissioner with the ability to use modern processes to protect the participation of eligible Australian citizens in the electoral process. This is fundamental to maintaining the strength and resilience of our democratic system of government. I commend the bill to Debate adjourned. Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum, and a correction to the explanatory memorandum, presented by Mr Bradbury. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",34
6,Mr BRADBURY,MOTIONS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I introduce a bill to amend the Corporations Act 2001. The Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012 contains two key sets of measures. Administrative winding up of abandoned companies The first set of measures contained in this bill strengthens the powers of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to place companies into liquidation when they have been abandoned by their directors. This bill delivers part of the Gillard government‘s Protecting Entitlements package election commitments. When a company fails, employees can often end up missing out on some or all of their entitlements-such as unpaid wages and certain other accrued benefits. The government‘s employee assistance scheme, the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, or GEERS, aims to protect workers‘ entitlements in these situations, so that employees of failed companies can recoup many of their unpaid entitlements as quickly as possible. Under GEERS, employees of a failed company are only able to access the scheme where the company that has employed them fails and is placed into liquidation. However, sometimes the directors of a failed company simply abandon the company, rather than go through the appropriate processes to wind up the company. At present where this occurs, employees are not able to access their unpaid entitlements under GEERS. If a company has been abandoned but has not yet been deregistered, employees (or ASIC on their behalf) currently have to apply to the courts and incur legal costs in order to place the abandoned company into liquidation before they can access GEERS. This is further complicated by the fact that where the abandoned company has been deregistered by ASIC or by its members, ASIC or the company‘s employees have to apply to the courts to reinstate the company and only once the company is reinstated so that it can be placed into liquidation could any potential employee eligibility for GEERS be triggered. To address this impediment and safeguard the rights of employees of failed companies to access GEERS, today I introduce legislation that will provide ASIC with the following discretionary powers:  the power to place a company into Workers‘ liquidation in circumstances where ASIC currently has a power to deregister the company;  the power to reinstate any deregistered company and immediately place it into liquidation; and  the power to place a company into liquidation where ASIC has reason to believe that the company is no longer carrying on business; where ASIC gives notice to the company and its directors of its intention to place the company into liquidation; and where neither the company nor its directors oppose the placement of the company into liquidation. I anticipate that ASIC will issue guidance to industry on the circumstances in which this power will be used. Publication of corporate insolvency notices The second set of measures in the bill will facilitate the future requirement of public notices in corporate external administrations to be published on a single publicly available website. There are a range of notices that, in the course of external administrations, must be published in the print media or the ASIC Gazette. These public disclosure obligations are in addition to obligations for petitioning creditors and for external administrators to communicate directly with known creditors to inform them of certain events. There are significant costs to external administrations in complying with these obligations. These costs are ultimately borne by creditors through reduced returns. There are also costs to creditors in monitoring numerous newspapers for relevant notifications-particularly as there is no set newspaper or day of the week on which notices must be published. The bill will amend the Corporations Act to remove the requirement for these notices to be published in newspapers or the ASIC Gazette. Instead, the bill requires these notices to be published in a 'prescribed manner' and provides a power for regulations to be made that will prescribe that manner. These amendments will facilitate the future provision of corporate external administration notices via a single website. As part of the reform package to modernise and harmonise Australia's insolvency industry, which I released together with the Attorney-General on 14 December 2011, the government announced that ASIC would establish a corporate external administration notices website by 1 July 2012. Online publication of notices will replace approximately 53,000 newspaper advertisements over the next four years, saving external administrations around $15 million over that same period. The reforms will apply to both advertisement requirements and gazettal requirements. Removing the requirement for these notices to be published in newspapers, and instead enabling them to be published in a prescribed manner, facilitates the publication of these notices on a single website. Requiring all public notices to be lodged on a single website ensures that these notices are publicly accessible at one location and able to be searched and accessed by stakeholders quickly and easily. Miscellaneous amendments In addition to the two key reforms I have outlined, the bill also contains some miscellaneous amendments in relation to paid parental leave and the powers of the court in relation to company reinstatements. MINCO approval The Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted and has approved the amendments contained in this bill. Summing up This bill delivers part of the Gillard government‘s Protecting Workers' Entitlements package election commitments. It strengthens ASIC‘s powers to place companies into liquidation when they have been abandoned by their directors. This bill will benefit the employees of these abandoned companies, by enabling quicker access to their unpaid entitlements through the government's employee assistance scheme. The bill also paves the way for a more streamlined and cost-effective process involving the publication of insolvency notices via a single, publicly available website. This will benefit creditors of companies in external administration, by reducing the costs of complying with these regulatory obligations. Debate adjourned. Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",36
7,Ms MACKLIN,MOTIONS,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (10:19): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill implements the government's changes to family payments announced in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, as well as improved support for carers outlined in the government's National Carer Strategy. These changes to family payments strengthen incentives for immunisation and help ensure that family payments are sustainable for the long term. This Labor government is a very strong supporter of the family payments system. We have delivered Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme, increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, and increased family payments for teenagers in secondary school or training. We also support a targeted family payments system that will be sustainable for generations to come. The first measure in this bill delivers stronger incentives for parents to have their children immunised, by linking the family tax benefit part A end-of-year supplement with immunisation. Immunisation is fundamental to a child's lifelong health and the health of other children. The government wants to make sure that children have the best start in life and are immunised at the right time. From 1 July 2012, the end-of-year supplement, currently worth $726 per child each year, will only be paid once a child is fully immunised for the financial year a child turns one, two and five years of age. These new requirements for the family tax benefit part A supplement will be implemented at a new immunisation check point at one year of age, along with the existing check points at two and five years of age. This means that, over the three immunisation check points of one, two and five years old, families will now have an incentive of more than $2,100 to ensure their children are fully immunised. The new arrangements for the family tax benefit part A supplement will replace the maternity immunisation allowance, which will cease from 1 July 2012. childhood Families are already required to have their child fully immunised to receive childcare benefit and childcare rebate. Existing exemptions will continue to apply. These reforms aim to improve immunisation coverage rates over time, giving greater protection to Australian children. They build on the government's previous reforms to use family payments to help drive better outcomes for families and children, including:  new requirements for families on income support to make sure children get a preschool health check;  new 'earn or learn' requirements; and  increasing family payments for teenagers if they stay in school or training. The second measure in this bill will help make sure that the baby bonus is sustainable for the long term. From 1 July 2012, the indexation of the baby bonus will be paused for three years. The payment rate will also be reset to $5,000 per child from 1 September 2012. The baby bonus has increased by 67 per cent since it was introduced in 2004, and this measure will provide a saving to the budget of $358 million over four years. To improve the targeting of family tax benefit and reduce the risk of debts, a further measure in this bill will end fortnightly payments of family tax benefit instalments to recipients who claim family tax benefit but are found to have no actual entitlement for two consecutive years following the end-ofyear reconciliation with their income tax return. This change will make sure that families do not receive benefits they are not entitled to, and do not subsequently have debts raised against them. Families no longer receiving family tax benefit part A or part B instalments would still be able to make a lump sum claim at the end of the financial year, and exceptions will apply to ensure that families are not put at risk of hardship. This bill also includes two amendments to support the Australian government's National Carer Strategy, announced on 3 August 2011. Under this strategy, the government is committed to improving carers' opportunity to take part in all aspects of society, including the chance to participate in work, community and family life. One amendment acknowledges that carers sometimes combine paid employment with their caring responsibilities. Currently, a carer cannot receive the annual carer supplement of $600 for each person they care for if, due to the income test, their or their partner's income has reduced their rate of payment to nil during that period. This situation may disadvantage carers or their partners who may participate in casual or irregular work in addition to their caring commitments, and who are offered extra employment in the period that includes 1 July. These carers may be faced with the difficult decision of accepting the offer of extra employment, knowing that they may then lose their annual carer supplement because the employment income they receive in that period may, solely or partly, cause their instalment of carer payment, wife pension, carer service pension or partner service pension to be reduced to nil. These amendments remedy this situation by making sure that, if a carer is qualified for carer payment, wife pension, partner service pension or carer service pension, for the period that includes 1 July, they will receive the supplement, even if their payment rate is set to nil due to employment income. The other amendment will make sure that a low-income carer, receiving an income support payment as well as carer allowance for care of an adult, will be paid a bereavement payment on the death of the person they care for. Carer payment recipients and carer allowance recipients for care of a child already have access to bereavement payments, and this amendment provides equitable support for those carers caring for an adult. Lastly, the bill makes several minor amendments to clarify provisions in the family assistance law in line with existing policy. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Disability Support Pension Participation Reforms) Bill First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",38
8,Ms MACKLIN,MOTIONS,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (10:27): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill introduces two key reforms to the disability support pension announced in the 2011-12 federal budget as part of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package of measures. These are significant reforms-reforms that will, for the first time, introduce new participation requirements for certain disability support pensioners, and allow disability support pensioners to work more hours without having their payment suspended or cancelled. Other amendments made by this bill include more generous rules for overseas travel for people with severe disability, and some minor amendments. The government is improving support for Australians with disability, to help them into work where possible, while ensuring we continue to provide an essential safety net for those who are unable to support themselves fully through work. I do believe that we can do better than a lifetime spent on income support for Australians who have some capacity to work. Many people with disability are great contributors in the workforce, and many want to be able to do more. This government recognises that working benefits people in many different ways. It helps boost people's self-esteem, improves social contact, provides more income, and leads to improved health and financial 2012 security. The government is committed to ensuring that people with disability can access these opportunities wherever they are able to do so. These reforms introduce new participation requirements for certain disability support pension recipients with some capacity to work and more generous rules for existing disability support pensioners to encourage them to work more hours. These measures will be combined with extra support for people with disability, including more employment services, and support for employers to take on more people with disability through new financial incentives. Many people with disability want to work if they can, but they may need extra support. In the first of three disability support pension measures in this bill, all effective from 1 July 2012, more generous rules are introduced to allow all disability support pensioners to work up to 30 hours a week without having their payment suspended or cancelled. These people will be able to receive a part pension, subject to usual means testing arrangements. Currently, disability support pension recipients granted on or after the previous government's introduction of the Welfare to Work changes on 11 May 2005 can only work up to 15 hours a week before their payment is suspended or cancelled. Recipients granted before this date were 'grandfathered' under the Welfare to Work changes and can work up to 30 hours a week before their pension is suspended or cancelled. Disability support pension recipients subject to 'the 15-hour rule' can find it difficult to find work limited to less than 15 hours a week. Many want to test whether they can work more hours but are worried about losing qualification. This change will remove the disincentive for disability support pension recipients to take up work or increase their hours if they are able to do so, and will help address the low workforce participation rate of people with disability. We estimate that this change will encourage around 4,000 disability support pension recipients to take up work, and 3,900 recipients who are already employed to work extra hours. The bill's second measure will introduce new participation requirements to encourage the workforce engagement of certain disability support pensioners who have some capacity to work. Disability support pension recipients under age 35 with a work capacity of at least eight hours a week will be required for the first time to attend regular participation interviews-engaging with Centrelink to develop participation plans, tailored to their individual circumstances, to help build their capacity. Participation plans could involve working with employment services to improve job readiness, searching for employment, or undertaking training, volunteering or rehabilitation. The participation interviews will also help make sure Disability Support Pension recipients are connected to other services and supports they need to overcome barriers to participation, such as drug and alcohol rehabilitation, mental health services and other community services. While attendance at Centrelink interviews will be compulsory, participation in activities identified in the plan will be on a voluntary basis. There will also be exceptions to the new participation requirements for pensioners who are manifestly disabled or have a work capacity of zero to seven hours a week, or while a pensioner is working in an Australian disability enterprise or the supported wage system. In the third measure, the government recognises that the disability support pension is an essential safety net for those who cannot work. New, more generous, rules will allow people receiving disability support pension who have a permanent disability and no future work capacity to travel overseas for more than 13 weeks, while retaining access to their pension. In addition, a disability support pension recipient who has a severe disability and is required to accompany a family member who has been posted overseas by their Australian employer will retain their pension for the period of the family member's posting. These pensioners will not be eligible for add-on payments such as the pension supplement or rent assistance while they are overseas. Existing portability rules will continue to apply to disability support pension recipients who may have some ability to work. Other working age payments will not be affected by these changes to portability arrangements. Debate adjourned. NA Public Accounts and Audit Committee",40

Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011 Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'this bill, and the related bills, not be proceeded until after the Parliament has met in the 44th Parliament.'",41
10,Mr TURNBULL,COMMITTEES," The Labor government first proposed this change-this reform, as they describe it-in the budget of 2009. It was put up on the basis that the savings achieved were needed in order to address the diminution in Commonwealth revenues arising out of the global financial crisis. However, the savings then stated-$1.9 billion over four years, and the savings are still of a comparable amount at this stage-were at a level that could have been readily achieved from savings in other areas. So, the argument for the reform was always a specious one. As we said at the time, the truth is that these changes are just the latest phase in Labor's unrelenting war against private health insurance. Labor hates private health insurance. It hates it because it encourages self-reliance and because it offers choice, and Australians know that. Australians do not trust the Labor Party on the matter of private health insurance. If anyone doubts that, that is why the Labor Party-the then Leader of the Opposition BILLS and subsequently Prime Minister, Mr Rudd; the current Prime Minister, the member for Lalor, Julia Gillard; and the shadow health minister at the time, Nicola Roxon-in the lead up to the 2007 election said again and again that they would not change the private Bill 2011 health insurance rebate. At the time, in 2009, when they broke that promise I said that never was an election promise given more emphatically and then broken so brazenly. Ms Plibersek interjecting",42
11,Mr TURNBULL,COMMITTEES,"There have been quite a few broken since then. The Minister for Health has become habituated to breaking election promises and, indeed, it is an enduring feature of this government that it is incapable of keeping an election promise. The truth is that these changes will force with people to drop private health insurance cover or choose cheaper cover with more procedures excluded. That follows as night follows day. You put up the price of something-make a good or service more expensive-and people will buy less of it. And the people who will buy less of it are those who feel, because of their youth or their health, that they have less need of itthat is to say, their need of private health insurance is more marginal. The consequence of that is that the pool of revenues in the private insurance sector will be diminished, and that will inevitably put up the cost of private health insurance for all those who are insured, whether they are on high incomes or on low incomes. All Australians with private health insurance will face higher premiums into the future if these changes proceed. It is a matter of great disappointment to me and everyone on this side of the House that a number of the Independents, including the member for Lyne, have decided to support the government in this regard. As I said in 2009, every Australian knows that the cost of public health is growing, as are the waiting lists for public hospitals. Every Australian knows that as our population ages the need for more self reliance in the provision of health services becomes greater. A government that was prudent and responsible in its management of this important area of public policy would do everything in its power to encourage Australians to be more self-reliant-take out private health insurance and do more to take care of their own health-where they can afford to do so. We know that every dollar of funding provided for the private health insurance rebate saves $2 of costs that are then paid by private health insurers. The report from 2004 that has been much cited here by Econtech and Harper Associates and Hagan is the reference for that. We know that private hospitals treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia-in 200910 that was 3½ million patients. They perform the majority of elective surgery in Australia-nearly two-thirds. Twelve million Australians-that is, nearly 53 per centhave private health insurance cover, and 10.3 million Australians have hospital treatment cover. There will be 2.4 million Australians directly affected by these changes and face immediate increases in premiums of 14, 29 and 43 per cent in their respective income tiers. All of those insured-all of those taking out private health insurance-will be affected by this because the pool of revenue into private health insurance will be reduced. It is absurd to argue that you can increase the cost of private health insurance and not then reduce the amount of private health insurance that is taken out. Plainly, that inevitable consequence-just as if you put up the price of cigarettes by increasing excise, fewer people will buy cigarettes. The impact is on all of those insured because it is a pool. The inescapable fact is that those people who choose to drop their private health insurance or reduce the level of their cover-reduce their contributions-will be those people who make a probably perfectly rational decision that they are unlikely to need private health insurance, and they make a judgment at the margin and reduce their contributions. Deloitte's analysis has concluded that in the first year 175,000 Australians would be expected to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 will downgrade. Over five years they expect that 1.6 million will drop their cover entirely and 4.3 million will downgrade. The government's own private health insurance insurer, Medibank Private, has predicted that 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. There is no question what the impact of this will be. It will be bad for private health insurance and it will also be bad for the public hospital system because the more pressure that is put on private health insurance, the more expensive it becomes and the less resources that are available for private hospitals and private health insurance, and the more pressure there will be on the public hospital system. Every Australian is a loser out of this; there are no winners. The government argues, 'Why should there be a tax benefit-a tax concession-for people on high incomes, and why should someone on a lower income be paying tax and therefore assisting, benefiting or supporting someone on a higher income who takes out private health insurance?' That argument is so specious, because the truth is that most Australians pay tax and is the most Australians benefit without a means test from the services provided by government, whether it is the ABC, whether it is defence, whether it is education-it is a very long list. The argument therefore is not that this must be means tested because otherwise it would be unjust. On that basis, you would means test every single benefit. The truth is that we have a progressive income tax system and people on higher incomes, quite properly, pay a much higher proportion of tax and therefore the social equity, the income redistribution that is achieved in a society like Australia, is largely effected through that progressive tax system. The means-testing argument is not one that is universally valid. Of course, there benefits that are means tested and should be means tested. No-one is suggesting they should not be, but the argument about whether this benefit should be means tested has to be assessed on its consequences. This may be an ideological issue for the Labor Party, but it is not an ideological question whether all benefits should be means tested. The question is: should this tax concession be means tested? The unarguable evidence, the uncontradicted evidence, is that there will be a reduction in the number of people taking out private health insurance cover and a reduction in the cover they will take out. The only point of difference is the extent of that reduction. It follows inevitably that any reduction in that contribution to the insurance pool affects every other person that draws on that pool. The truth is that in any insurance pool the people who need the insurance the most benefit from the contributions from those people who for whatever reason-it might be good health or it might be good luck-do not need that insurance cover. If everyone could look into the future and know what their medical circumstances were going to be, and so the only people who took out private health insurance were those who knew they were going to be sick or needed a procedure in a hospital, then the insurance premiums would be impossibly high. The whole system would be unworkable. That is why the Howard government wisely introduced this rebate and a number of other measures to expand the incentivesa combination of sticks and carrots-to encourage people to take out private health insurance and, above all, to promote a culture of self-reliance. It is absolutely fundamental that in our society we encourage everybody, where they can afford to do so, to be more self-reliant. We cannot afford to allow a situation where the welfare are state becomes so all-encompassing and so expensive that citizens lose their own sense of responsibility and self-reliance. You have only to look at some of the fiscal catastrophes in Europe to see what the consequences of that are. Self-reliance and private health insurance of are clear social goods. They are promoted by this policy; they have been proved to work. The consequence of this change will reduce the availability of private health services for all Australians. It will increase the cost of private health insurance for all Australians, regardless of their income, and it will put additional pressure on the public hospital system. That is why the coalition today, as we have done for nearly three years, steadfastly and staunchly oppose it.",42
12,Ms PLIBERSEK,COMMITTEES," It is my great pleasure to sum up the debate on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and cognate bills. The member for Wentworth is a neighbour of mine and he is someone I like a lot, but I have seldom heard more nonsense from him than I heard today. He was at the despatch box talking about the marvels of self-reliance, yet he cannot explain to me why a waitress living in Darlinghurst should be subsidising the private health insurance of a banker living in Vaucluse or why an apprentice living in Bondi Junction, in his electorate, should be subsidising the private health insurance of a partner in a law firm living at Darling Point. It makes absolutely no sense. I thank members for their contribution to this debate. We are rightly proud of the health system in Australia. We have a health system that is the envy of the world. Most Australians would say that Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and other universal features of our health system serve us much better than the user-pays systems of many other nations where they take your credit card details before they take your pulse. That is not to say it is perfect. We inherited from those opposite a shortage of doctors, nurses and specialists and, thanks the coalition, in many parts of the country is hard to see a GP or you need to wait too long in emergency departments or to have elective surgery. That is why the health reforms begun by my predecessor-the Attorney-General when she was the Minister for Health and Ageing-are so important. They set a path into the future when all Australian governments will work together to meet our communities' health needs. We have a health system that is universal, but with that comes an obligation for Australians to contribute. We have an obligation to care for our own health and we have an obligation to contribute through our taxes. But, like all of our tax and transfer systems, the greatest benefits should go to those in greatest need; the greatest contribution should come from those who are most able to contribute. A further feature of our health system is the necessary and desirable balance of its public and private elements. Our public system gives highquality and accessible care-security for every Australian that, should the worse happen, they will receive the care they need. Our private systems offer choice and flexibility and provide competition and comparison, contributing to continued improvements. The debate we are having today and over the past few days touches on all of these elements. Our universal system relies on every dollar raised being spent in the most appropriate and effective way. It is about making choices. We are currently establishing more than 20 regional cancer centres across Australia, because we know that the outcomes for people with cancer living in the regions are often much poorer than those in the cities. These centres will be beacons of hope for patients and families fighting this disease. When faced with scarce resources, and the choice of whether to invest in lifesaving services or rebates to to couples earning over $258,000 a year, we it make the choice for regional patients. Those investments will benefit all Australians, but of course they need to be paid for-and that means every dollar going where it is needed most. The government took a policy of means testing the private health insurance rebate to the 2010 election because it is the fastestgrowing component of health spending-and that is unsustainable; over 10 years its real cost will increase more than 50 per cent per person. It is also unsustainable that this benefit continues to go disproportionately to high-income earners. This is a question of fairness. These reforms have been carefully crafted so as to provide a fairer distribution of benefits. Well over 20 million Australians will be entirely unaffected by this change. Government's support for private health insurance needs to be directed to those hard working Australians who need the most assistance, not higher income earners. Currently, approximately 14 per cent of single taxpayers who have incomes above $83,000 a year receive about 28 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to singles. Under these new reforms these single taxpayers will receive about 12 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to singles. Similarly, approximately 12 per cent of taxpaying couples who have incomes above $166,000 currently receive approximately 21 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to couples. Under these new reforms these taxpaying couples will receive about nine per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to couples. The member for Dickson, and many of those opposite who have spoken during this debate, have tried to assert that this is somehow a broken promise. This is absolutely, categorically not true-in fact, it is the fulfilment of a promise taken to the 2010 election. Speaker after speaker from the other side has ignored the fact that this was Labor Party policy at the 2010 election. The member for Dickson alleges that these changes will affect those workers and couples who earn less than $50,000 a yearagain, categorically untrue and an unfounded scare campaign. He told this parliament, of those who workers and couple who earn less than $50,000 a year, that 'this Labor government seeks to impose an extra financial burden on them if they keep their private health insurance'. This is wrong. Workers earning less than $83,000 per year, and couples and families with an income of $166,000 or less, will see no change in their rebate as a result of these measures. They will retain the current 30 per cent rebate-or higher, if they are older than 65. Only people earning over $129,000 or couples earning over $258,000 will lose the rebate entirely. Why has it been that the speakers opposite have sought to mislead people, including the most vulnerable Australians, by frightening them? They have claimed that older people will be particularly badly affected by these changes, yet means testing will be applied equally to anyone who can afford to contribute more to their private health insurance regardless of age. Rebates will continue to be higher for older Australians in income ranges that are eligible for a rebate. The vast majority of older Australians will continue to be eligible for a higher rebate. Further claims that these changes will lead to a huge impact on public hospitals are simply wrong. For example, some in the opposition-in fact, many speakers-have claimed that we will see up to 1.6 million people drop their private health insurance and become a burden on the public hospital system. But at the same time they also claim that it will be young, healthy people who will drop their insurance-you heard the same from the member for Wentworth-and that those young, healthy people will immediately turn up in our public hospitals. Clearly, this does not make sense. Treasury modelling shows that 99.7 per cent of policyholders will retain their private health insurance-and that is because those higher income earners who receive a lower rebate will at the same time face an increased tax penalty if they do not have private health insurance. The estimated drop-out rate based on the biennial Ipsos syndicated survey, Healthcare and insurance 2009-2011, are 16,000 and 40,000 people-much closer to the Treasury model. And I note that the estimated drop-out rates are in fact lower than the quarterly growth in membership for private health insurance in both September 2011 and December 2011. The government estimates that 8.7 million Australians with private hospital cover will not be affected by these changes. We have seen these kinds of claims from the opposition in the past. When the government increased the income threshold for the Medicare levy surcharge in 2008, the member for North Sydney declared that hundreds of thousands of people would abandon their private health insurance. What have we actually seen since that time? Over 800,000 have joined private health insurance. The opposition's position on these bills seems to be disingenuous at best. If the Leader of the Opposition truly believes, as he said at the Press Club recently, that government should only do for people what they cannot do for themselves, how can he sincerely argue that the best and wisest use of the health dollar is to pay for one-third the health insurance costs for someone on $500,000 or $1 million a year? The Leader of the Opposition also refuses to say, as does the shadow health minister, whether he would repeal the means test. I read today that the member for Hinkler has called for it to be reinstated. It has been described as an 'article of faith' for the Liberal Party-and article of faith in a belief that the earnings of working Australians should pay for the private health insurance of even the wealthiest Australians. The Leader of the Opposition is now in a very difficult position, torn between this belief and his huge budget black hole-$70 billion and counting-and, should he follow his instincts and seek to repeal this change, that would be another $2½ billion problem over the next three years for his budget black hole. With the cost rising of this subsidy to higher income earners rising to $100 billion by 2050, he would give us a lasting legacy, a legacy of debt for our children and for their children. A universal system relies on the differing contributions of all Australians according to their ability to pay, but it gives Mirabella, S the security that each of us, if we get sick or Neville, PC our elderly parents or kids get sick, will get the appropriate care. These changes are true Labor reforms because they are about fairness. This is the third time that we have brought them before this House because we believe that working Australians should have a health system that is fair. The passage of these bills will mean that the taxes of a bank teller will no longer subsidise the private health insurance of the bank executive or the bank CEO. Labor governments have always fought for the rights of working people to have access to high-quality health care, and we will continue that fight because it is right and because it is what Labor governments do. I commend the bills to the House.",44

Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (11:37): In continuing my remarks on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011, I want to reiterate my opposition to the bill and my concern for the construction industry. The Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, the ABCC, has allowed productivity in the construction industry to improve dramatically since its introduction. In considering the impacts of its abolition, I spoke to Martin Locke, a local quality home builder in Townsville, in relation to the industry in general. Martin is reasonably confident. He runs a small team and has a good business model. He wants to provide a quality housing product to quality people in a quality subdivision. His business has only ever operated under the umbrella of the ABCC; therefore, he does not have first hand knowledge of what the changes in this bill will mean. Martin would like to see the government get out of the way and let him get on with building. He sees that this proposed change 21), is not a major concern to the industry. The system works and he is vitally worried that it appears that it is being changed for no good reason. He says that the industry is facing genuine concerns. The cost of basic materials such as steel, concrete, timber and fuel are impacting the industry's ability to produce a quality product at a reasonable price. Other builders tell me they are worried about the costs of these things as well. They are also telling me that, if they are expensive now, the world's most expensive carbon tax will only make them more expensive. The cost of concrete and bitumen is rising at the start of a development, and we will see the cost of land and housing rise further as we all have to pay this carbon tax. We will be making it harder and harder for Australians chasing their first home to make that purchase. This government goes on and on about working Australians, but at every turn this government is putting up roadblocks to the success of every other Australian. The abolition of the ABCC will only play into that. Governments cannot control prices directly, but they can support the construction industry by cutting out the unnecessary bureaucracy that interferes with business and creates inefficiencies. The ABCC has helped to do this. It has ensured fairness exists in industrial relations, without letting either side have the kind of power that creates one-sided industrial disputes with consequences for productivity and costs. As a supporter of the ABCC, I strongly oppose this bill. We should be working with the construction industry to keep fairness in the workplace. Allowing unions the power to use whatever tactics they can to run their agenda serves only to hurt the industry, and no-one can support that. It takes a strong policeman to maintain the balance in industrial relations and that is what we have now, but this bill seeks to strip it away in favour of a toothless tiger replacement. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (11:41): I rise to speak in support of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. I am not surprised to hear those on the opposition side opposing this bill, but I do believe that the speakers on the other side go too far when they talk about the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner providing fairness and ensuring fairness in industrial relations. That is not what the ABCC did. It is not the reason that it was established by the Howard government. The Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner was set up by the Howard government to attack unions and to target workers who were outspoken in their workplaces. It was not a balanced office about making sure that both sides abided by the laws and regulations. I have no objection to ensuring that all parties-employers, employees, unions-are complying with the laws and doing the right thing by the industry. I have no problem with laws being in place to do that. However, you cannot say that the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, the ABCC, as it existed was set up to ensure fairness or that it in fact provided fairness. The harshest part of this law has been the ABCC's coercive information gathering powers. We have just heard the member for Herbert saying that it was a strong policeman and that we need a strong policeman. In fact it was more than that. The powers given to the inspectors under the ABCC were stronger than the powers any of our police officers have in this country. They had powers the police do not have in relation to compulsorily requiring persons to come before them and provide information. The ABCC did not allow those people to have representation. Under the ABCC, people were threatened with imprisonment if they did not come along and sit down in a closed room without representation, and say what was happening in their workplace. This is not fair law. I was elected to ensure that we provided fairness in the workplace, not just by getting rid of Work Choices but by ensuring fairness in the building industry as well. I believe that there should be equal laws for all workers. Having said that, I do support the bill that is before the House and I do so for very good reason. The bill makes changes to the current ABCC and regulations that make real headway towards providing that fairness. It will ensure that, when it comes to those coercive information gathering powers, no longer can an inspector decide for themselves to mandatorily require someone to come before them. Under this bill, they will be required to go and get an examination notice through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to actually be allowed to use those powers. So there are now checks and balances in place and a mechanism which ensures that individuals are treated fairly and reasonably in the way they are brought before the tribunal and required to answer questions. It ensures that people required to attend an interview may be represented by a lawyer of their choice and that their right to claim legal privilege and public interest immunity will be recognised. These are not rights which workers had under the Howard government's laws. Persons required to attend an interview will be reimbursed for the reasonable expenses and all interviews are to be videotaped and undertaken by the director or an SES employee. The Commonwealth Ombudsman will monitor and review all interviews and provide reports to the parliament on the exercise of this power. Importantly, these coercive information gathering powers have a sunset clause. Under section 46 of the bill, those powers will cease three years from the commencement of this legislation. We owe this to workers across the country. I said at the beginning I have no problem with ensuring that the laws are complied with by all people in the building and construction industry but we must make sure that those people enjoy the same basic rights as any other person before any court in this nation. Previously, a person accused of a criminal act had more rights than a worker under the ABCC. We will correct this imbalance to ensure that only in cases considered by a presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should powers be used in such a way that people understand that their basic rights to representation, legal privilege and public interest immunity will be honoured, and that they will be reimbursed for costs. Many people have already spoken on this bill and the minister has gone through it in detail in the explanatory memorandum. It is my intention simply to put on the record what I consider were the harshest parts of the laws in relation to the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. I believe this Labor government has done a lot on changing the guidelines and definition of 'construction' because it was not just about coercive powers. When we talked about building and construction under the Howard government, the definition was so wide that it applied to many industries, well outside what we would consider to be the building and construction industry. In making sure that the definition more accurately reflects the industry, this legislation will apply to many fewer people than previously and to fewer workplaces. That is fair as well. People are still required to comply with laws. They are still required to comply with the Fair Work Act. They are still required to comply with workplace health and safety legislation but they are placed where they should be-on an equal footing with other workers across the country. True to say that those in the building and construction industry will still be set up under a separate set of laws and there will be a new agency to oversee them but at least that agency will fall under the auspices of Fair Work Australia. I believe that is where it should sit because that is where all other workers rights' are respected and implemented. What I hope to see out of these changes is a much more balanced approach to looking at this industry. We need to make sure that everyone is complying with the law. That also means that we need to be holding building and construction companies to account where their practices are such that people's lives are at risk. Too many people are permanently injured, or killed, in this industry each year. Through this agency and these laws we will hold to account all people who may be responsible. There is nothing more important than the safety of workers at the workplace. They deserve to go home to their families each night. The Safe Rates campaign by the transport industry is a fantastic campaign which I fully support. It is important we make sure that not just those on the roads are being looked after but that also those in the building and construction industry, like every other worker, are being looked after. It is my pleasure to support this bill and the changes it seeks to introduce. I believe goes a long way to creating more fairness and ensuring there is a balanced approach in compliance with laws and safety regulations in the building and construction industry.",52
26,Mr HAWKE,PAIRS," Following the member for Petrie's rather confused contribution to the debate on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011, it is incumbent on me to say, firstly, that it is not a workplace safety issue; it is properly the jurisdiction of occupational and health and safety legislation. This is really about the ABCC, commissioned in 2005, which came out of a royal commission which found that there were over 100 types of unlawful or inappropriate conduct in the building and construction industry. The member for Petrie carried on about workplace safety. But what about the unlawful conduct which was found by a very thorough royal commission, and their recommendation that, somebody with the power to do something about entrenched unlawful behaviour in the building and construction industry, we would continue to see declines in productivity and obstacles in the place of properly conducted economic activity? The corporations the member for Petrie refers to must comply with occupational health and safety regulations or their employees go to jail. What about the people in Australia found by the Cole royal commission to be engaging in unlawful activity hindering our economic progress? We know that the ABCC has been a tough cop on the beat and, yes, was given wideranging powers by the Howard government. Why? Because the ABCC, which works quite successfully, has helped the building and construction industry to increase productivity by 10 per cent since it was set it up. The biggest challenge in Australian economic industrial relations today is how to lift productivity. We have seen a wellfunctioning body lift productivity in this sector by 10 per cent; yet the government of the day is proposing to weaken and undermine the role of this body in the building and construction sector. Why would it be doing that? Why would the government of the day undermine an institution that is lifting the productivity rates in a critical sector of our economy like building and construction? We know why the Labor government is undermining this body. Indeed, if you do not think that adding 33 additional procedures into the ABCC is undermining the effectiveness of this body, then I think you are absolutely crazy",55
27,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, The member will not cast aspersions on the chair.,55
28,Mr HAWKE,PAIRS,"Sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker, I certainly was not doing that. I without should have said that about the member for Petrie and the others who have made contributions in this place about this matter along the lines of, 'All we want to do is streamline this body,' and, 'We need to make sure that people's rights are being considered.' The Cole royal commission found that unlawful behaviour was occurring and recommended that a strong regulator be put in place. The Howard government responded by doing so, thereby lifting productivity, reducing the number of working days lost annually per thousand employees from 224 in 2004 to 24 in 2006 and lowering building costs by 20 to 25 per cent-it worked a wonder. How the introduction of 33 additional procedures that are diverting attention away from ensuring lawfulness is maintained in this sector is a better thing is beyond me. This is part of an ongoing theme that we see in this Gillard Labor government of Orwellian titled bills: Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition To Fair Work) Bill. The government says it is improving the system through this bill when everybody knows, whether it be people on the Labor side of this chamber or people on this side of the chamber, that there is no such improvement to the role of the regulator here-33 additional processes, extra bureaucracy and procedure. All of the provisions of this bill will slow down, hold back and constrain the role of the regulator in this important sector of our economy-a regulator which has already lifted productivity, improved economic outcomes for ordinary Australians and improved the ability for us to get things done in this country. Why would we do that? We know why the government is proposing to do that. It is purely a ploy by the Prime Minister to bring the unions and the Labor Left onto her side and save her leadership. It does not matter which group in Australian society you ask. The Australian Industry Group, who have made a series of submissions about this and who have to deal with the construction and building industry all the time, say that behaviour has significantly changed for the better since the ABCC was introduced-that means less unlawful behaviour. There are many indications that the industrial environment in the industry is deteriorating. Watering down protections for the industry and for the community at this time would send entirely the wrong message to those who engage in unlawful or inappropriate behaviour. We are not talking about any facet of industrial relations here. We are not talking about occupational health and safety, as the member for Petrie tried to divert us onto. We are talking about unlawful behaviour in the building and construction industry. We are talking about things that have held this country back for so long, things that have slowed down our productivity and our ability to get ahead and have made us less competitive internationally. This is very serious economic territory. It is true that the industrial laws arising from the royal commission treat employers and employees in the construction industry differently from those in other sectors. But why is that? It is because of the profound nature of the unlawful behaviour that was going on in this vital sector of the economy. It was appropriate that we had a profound response and it has worked well. Nobody is disadvantaged by this legislation. Who is the government standing up for-people acting unlawfully? What is the government saying-that there are these shrinking violets out there, union members and union activists, who are being persecuted by police unfairly? Is it seriously the contention of the government that it will weaken this legislation and change the regulation of this industry? I do not think there is a strong case for that. All of the evidence points to the fact that this system is working well, that the current legislation is delivering the results that it was intended to and that any watering down will lead to more industrial disputation. This government wants to take us back to that level we saw in 2004hundreds of days lost per employee every single year, a drop in productivity and a decline in economic activity-and back to that system where, as the royal commission found, the CFMEU were getting up to $1.5 million per year in casual ticket money. Burdens were placed on business where to get around the old system you had to basically pay additional allowances to get your building and construction work done. This was weakening the strength of our economy. Why should that continue to be the case? Companies have to pay tax and they have to go through huge regulatory hurdles to get construction and building going in Australia today. Why would we encumber them further with unlegislated procedures through unions or other groups that seek to use their power to threaten industry and construction in this country? Industry and the community at large think there should be strong oversight and regulation of this sector so we can get on with the business of construction and building. We saw under previous administrations the difficulties of getting things done in this country. Productivity on the waterfront was so low that something had to be done to lift the productivity rate-and things were done. It used to be the case, and I have heard colloquially from people who worked in the industry at that time, that if you wanted to get goods moved off the waterfront the best thing you could do was to go down to the waterfront and offer a few slabs of beer to the workers. That was the best way to get your goods actually moved on time. We know that in the building and construction industry it is not as nostalgic that. It was not a nice laid-back Australian approach; it was unlawful activity. The royal commission found hundreds of examples of serious unlawful behaviour that was preventing proper economic activity. Let us look through the provisions. It does not matter whether we are talking about the increased bureaucracy in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, with the presidential member being required to be satisfied that a case has been made before an interview may proceed. It does not matter whether we are talking about the so-called sunset clause, which is in a very short time, just three years, when what business and building and construction really need is a longer period for certainty of investment and the certainty of economic climate. It does not matter about involving the Commonwealth Ombudsman-if you want to bog something down, you bring in the Commonwealth Ombudsman to have a good look at it. It does not matter what provision you go to. Each of these provisions is designed to slow down, impede and reduce effectiveness and to blow out the time that it will take for an effective regulator to make sure unlawful that behaviour is not happening. How is that a benefit to anybody? The only people who will benefit from Labor these changes are the unions. We know that the unions are heavy donors to the Labor Party. We know that the Labor Party is the party of the unions. It is important to ask why, when we are desperate to lift productivity in any way, we would do something to damage productivity in such a vital sector as the construction sector. We do not want to go back to the old days of unlawful behaviour in our construction sector. That would have massive cost implications for our country and it would slow down our economic recovery just when we are coming out of the GFC. It is the as wrong time to be doing this-if there is ever a right time. I could understand all of that if the government were saying, 'Well, we've got into a situation where there is no unlawful behaviour in the construction and building industry. We have reached a point where things are now on a more even keel and we do not need these extraordinary powers.' They are extraordinary powers, I grant you, but it was an extraordinary situation that royal commission found. There was extraordinary commission of systematic, unlawful behaviour completely crippling and adding a massive burden on a major sector of our economy. If that nirvana has been reached then let the government say so. If it has not then let us not impede the right actions of the tough cop on the beat that have produced such stunning improvements in economic activity, in days lost to strike activity and in productivity, the key challenge of our economy at the moment. Let us not reduce the powers or the scope of effectiveness of the regulator. I warn the Labor Party that, while they might be wearing fake smiles, glibly enjoying these bills, knowing that there will be a bureaucratic bogdown in procedure in the ABCC and that it will be tougher to enforce the law of this country, the laws in Australia are there for good reason. They are there so that the proper economic activity of the building and construction sector cannot be impeded by unions or other members behaving unlawfully. That is why we have these laws. That is why we have regulation in this sector. The ABCC has done a great job in delivering these improvements. It is very important in my view for the economy, while we are moving out of the GFC, to ensure that we have a tough cop on the beat, a goodquality regulator that is producing results. We have one in the ABCC and we should not allow a politically driven campaign that will stop that. It is a campaign on behalf of unions, who want to see a resurgence in industrial disputation as a legitimate method. We have seen that in Qantas and in BHP, where there is a week-long strike this week. There is nothing wrong with legitimate industrial disputation-nothing at all. Workers have the right to engage in it. But what we are talking about in the building and the construction industry was systematic unlawful behaviour. That is why these bills should be strongly opposed and why we should retain the ABCC as the tough cop on the beat.",55
29,Dr LEIGH,PAIRS," We in the Labor Party believe in fairness. We believe in giving people a fair chance, a fair go. We believe in a fair industrial relations system; a system that balances the needs and interests of both employees and employers. We on this side of the House know that fairness does not come at the expense of productivity. We know productivity measures can be achieved by people cooperating together in the workplace and working towards a common aim-employers and employees alike. Rising productivity means boosting our standard of living. It means more Australians get to share in the enormous benefits this country has to offer. Fairness is a key feature of the Labor Party's approach to industrial relations, which is why we are introducing these amendments to abolish the unfair Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. The ABCC, especially in its ability to use coercive powers, is an unfair body that is a hangover from Howard era industrial relations. It pits employees against employers, union members against non-union members and worker against worker. It was used to undermine trust and confidence in the construction industry. The ABCC unfairly targeted union officials and the actions of unions. It went after the people who dedicate their lives to protecting the rights and entitlements of others. Employees and unionists in the construction industry faced very different penalties and very different laws from others in the community. That goes against the core of what we in the Labor Party believe in: fairness and inclusion. It is for these reasons that we always been committed to abolishing the ABCC and replacing it with something fairer. We want to put checks and balances on the powers exercised. We want to make sure there is more consistent treatment of workers in the construction industry, commensurate with what people would expect in the community. We have long stood by this commitment and have faced challenges in ensuring it becomes law. We are going to keep trying, because it is the right thing to do. We want work towards a cooperative and productive workplace relations system. We cannot do that if we keep the ABCC in the form that it is in today. The current ABCC is fundamentally against the principles of fairness. Getting the balance right means balancing the rights of employers and employees. That has always been our aim, right across our workplace relations system, and it should not be any different for workers who happen to be in the construction industry. Labor has always understood that the construction industry is a unique industry. The working environment can be dangerous. Many building workers are men, so it is a pretty robust place to work. It is a transient industry, an industry that is tightly connected with economic booms and economic busts. Construction is normally one of the main indicators of economic growth or decline, and we need to remember that we are talking not just about abstract economic concepts but about people's lives and jobs. We know the industry can be difficult. Because of the unique challenges faced by the industry, it is important to make sure everyone applies the right conduct and continues to be lawful. As is so often the case in industrial relations, that is a tough balancing act-but this is a decision we are not afraid to make. We wanted to make sure workers in the have construction industry could be assured they had the same rights as other workers yet also make sure we met the challenges of the industry. We think this legislation gets that balance right. We have ensured safeguards for the protection of employees, and we have also established a specialist inspectorate who knows about the industry. We have made sure that what we are looking at here is a regulator, not an enforcer, who helps the entire industry without pitting people against one another. We wanted to help the industry to to work cooperatively and productively, so we have set up a system that will ensure people can work together better. It will help the industry to reach community standards of fairness and it will provide information, advice and assistance to all in the industry. Many members and employees of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union live and work in my electorate of Fraser. I want to spend a moment here just briefly outlining the important work done by the CFMEU in our local community. The role played by unions in supporting and promoting local community activities is something that is far too easy to overlook. I want to single out Dean Hall, Jason Jennings and Jason O'Mara-three community minded blokes who lead the CFMEU locally and provide invaluable community support. All three are active in our local community. They have all been active for a long time in local rugby league competitions-helping to run them, coaching and playing. Other members and officials are involved with local cricket and soccer competitions. Dean's background in teaching and social work means he is an invaluable asset to the union, providing support for local union members by putting them in touch with services available to them. Even today, as the secretary of the local CFMEU branch, he keeps an eye out for his members and makes sure they are getting the assistance they need. We know that men's health, particularly men's mental health, has been something we have needed to work hard on. It is too easy for men to neglect their health. In a tough industry like the construction industry, with premium placed on robust and macho behaviour, this can be even more so. The CFMEU work with the community on men's health issues. They have been extremely active in the area of mental health and have helped set up organisations addressing these needs. The CFMEU provide a barbeque once a week for local workers where people can find out about the various community services available to them. The CFMEU set up a drug and alcohol rehabilitation service. They provide access to financial counselling and superannuation services. They provide access to psychologists. They have set up health and safety training companies and they assist workers and employers to understand their rights and responsibilities. The CFMEU is one of the major financial contributors to the Canberra community, supporting sport, charities and cultural activities. Some of the groups they support include: the W-League champions Canberra United, who were undefeated in their most recent season; women's basketball",58
30,Mr Morrison,PAIRS,Does it include you?,60
31,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Order! The member will pause for a moment. I ask members not to cast aspersions on each other's motives across the chamber.,60
32,Dr LEIGH,PAIRS,"AFL in Canberra; the Special Olympics; and cerebral palsy groups. They are a major supporter of the Maori cultural festival and support various programs in schools. They have helped me out with my annual Welcoming the Babies event, which will next be held on 4 March. Anyone listening is invited along to Stage 88 at 10.30 on Sunday morning. The CFMEU will be providing their fantastic barbeque trailer to enable us to have a mobile barbeque at the event. On top of all of this, they are continuing to do the basics of a protecting the rights and entitlements of local workers and, most importantly, staying on top of local health and safety matters. I have always been impressed with the ability of the CFMEU to know exactly what is the safety record at pretty much every construction site across Canberra. We have spent too long listening to those opposite denigrate the CFMEU, its members and its officials as unrestrained thugs wanting to intimidate people and throw their weight around. But, in my experience through my personal contact with this union, the people they are attacking are some of the most dedicated, community minded people I have had the honour of working with. The approach the Liberals took to the union movement, particularly to the CFMEU, would have threatened most of those local activities and many local sporting groups. Without the support shown by the CFMEU-whether it is financial, providing administrative support or encouraging their members to participate in local activitieslots of local institutions would have struggled. The current legislation is not a return to the old days of endless industrial disputes. The CFMEU, its members and employers all know that those days are over and there is no desire to threaten the productivity of the industry. When we speak about productivity there are two fundamentally different views in this House. Those opposite hear the word 'productivity' and they think about slashing workers' wages and cutting their conditions. The member for Bennelong wants to cut back on penalty rates. Not only would that hurt workers; there is no evidence it would raise productivity. If you look at a graph of the rate of productivity growth, you will see that it continued to fall in the period in Work Choices was in effect. There is no evidence that the Work Choices system of industrial relations raised the rate of Australian productivity growth. We on this side of the House believe that productivity is about investing in people and infrastructure. We believe that raising productivity is about raising the quantity and quality of education. We believe it is about having more infrastructure-building more roads, rails and ports-and investing in infrastructure such as the National Broadband Network. When it comes to industrial relations, we believe that treating employees with dignity and respect means they will work more effectively, and there is plenty of evidence to support that viewpoint in management literature. We on this side of the House know that cooperative workplaces lead to better outcomes. Pitting people against their employers and workmates is not the way to achieve good workplace outcomes and it is not the way to high productivity and high living standards in Australia. Cutting trust in the workplace is bad for workers' morale and bad for their mental health, but it is also bad for the bottom line. It is bad for Australia's long term living standards. So we on this side of the House support this legislation. We support a long-term agenda of raising productivity by investing in people, skills and infrastructure and not a short-term agenda of cutting conditions and wages. I commend the bill to the House.",60
33,Mr RANDALL,PAIRS," I am very pleased to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. 'Improvement' is a bit of an Orwellian title. It is not actually improving is making it go backwards. Let me point out why we are here today. We are here today which because the Labor Party want to water down the ability of the cop on the beat in the construction industry to do its job properly. Let us have a look at why there had to be an Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, or ABCC, in the first place. The Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, as many speakers have mentioned, was initiated in 2003, and Justice Cole came down with a report which found widespread inappropriate conduct and disregard of the rule of law. If you listened to the member for Fraser, you would think that the CFMEU were a benevolent fund, a league of gentlemen having afternoon picnics with people in parks. That is not the case at all. Let us go back to why this militant union and its militant behaviour on worksites first had to be looked at. Who remembers Norm Gallagher from the BLF? They had to outlaw the BLF because of its illegal activities. Then it morphed into the CFMEU. In my state, Western Australia, you only have to mention the names Kevin Reynolds and Joe MCDonald to understand that they are not a league of gentlemen but are a bunch of rampant thugs and spivs on the worksite. If they were the mafia, they would be done for extortion. They should be brought into line with the rule of law, as Justice Cole found. Let us have a look at some of the inappropriate behaviour. I refer to the case of the Woodman Point Wastewater Treatment Plant, on page 237 of volume 21 of the Cole royal commission report. The commission again found abuse on a worksite in this case, including: (a) disregard of the Workplace Relations Act … and the common law by a union and its officers anything; it and organisers; (b) abuse of right of entry provisions by officers and organisers of a union; (c) disregard of occupational health and safety considerations when exercising rights of entry by officers and organisers of a union; (d) the preparedness of officers and organisers a union to make threats of unlawful conduct to attempt to achieve industrial objectives; (e) disregard of directions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission by a union and its officers and organisers; It goes on and on. Basically the union were willing to break or thwart the law in any way they could to get their own way. You will hear the Labor Party members in this chamber saying: 'This was a terrible finding by the royal commission. It was a disgraceful finding because it was set up by the previous government.' Can I say that the work of the Cole royal commission and the ABCC was remarkable in bringing peace and productivity to the building sites of Australia. It helped the building and construction industry increase productivity by 10 per cent. It provided an economic gain of $5.5 billion per annum. It reduced inflation by 1.2 per cent. It increased GDP by 1.5 per cent. In 2004, before the royal commission, the number of working days lost annually was 224 per thousand employees. In 2006, after the commission began its work, it was 24. So it was reduced to 10 per cent of what it was before. That just shows that the commission worked. Some people have a problem with a cop on the beat, in any jurisdiction, whether you are walking down the street or whatever. The only people who have to worry about the law enforcement of this country are people who are breaking the law, dare I say. If you are defrauding someone, if you are engaging in criminal activity, if you are speeding, of course you are going to worry about the law. But, if you are not doing anything wrong, you will not have to worry about the law. We heard extraordinary claims in this place that people were being taken off the streets by the ABCC, as though it were some sort of Stasi group from Romania. That is absolute garbage. Of course you get picked of up and arrested if you have been breaking the law. I get pulled over by the police if I have been breaking the law. I have people in my electorate who have been subject to burglaries et cetera, and when the police find the perpetrators they pick them up and they arrest them and they deal with them because they have broken the law. Of course in the case where the ABCC was doing its job it had to go and apprehend people. It is just a ludicrous claim, an overstretched claim. Why do we have this position in this House? Because the members on the other side are joined at the hip to the union movement. They are the product of the union movement. They have to come in here and show their hairy-chested behaviour to the union movement because, firstly, they get its preselected by them and, secondly, they get funded by them. The CFMEU, for example, has put millions of dollars into Labor Party campaigns. It is well documented that, before the 2007 election, something like $30 million was put into the Australian Labor Party's campaign by the unions, and the CFMEU was a major contributor. Let us look at why. On the front bench of the Labor Party, the member for Batman is a former ACTU president. Sitting next to him is the member for Hotham, a former ACTU president. We move along. The member for Rankin was a union organiser. We know the former role of the member for Charlton very well: ACTU secretary. The member for Gorton is ACTU born and bred. The member for Maribyrnong is the dog in the manger in this whole arrangement. He is the former head of the Australian Workers Union, and now he has been put in charge as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. That is like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank. You have got the ACTU all along the front bench. Their mates in the union movement are saying: 'We don't want the cop on the beat anymore. We're worried about what they're going to do to us in terms of making us comply with the rule of law and industrial law. So you've either got to change the laws or you've got to get them off our backs. So defund them, put sunset clauses on them, but we don't want them anymore as part of the people that are going to keep an eye on us. We want to stay militant. We want to stay outside of the rule of law. If the cop on the beat has got any say, we can't do that. So you've got to help us.' So dutifully those on the other side, the Labor Party members, are falling in line and helping them. One of the great things that came out of the Cole royal commission was about the bogus safety issues being used as the reason to enter worksites to intimidate people to get them to join up and belong to the union. In fact, I had an occasion when from a site in Forrestdale one of my constituents, an electrician, rang me and said, 'Don, you've got to help us. We've just had Joe MCDonald come into our workplace and crash through our crib room. He didn't seek any permission to be here. He's come in here and threatened us all and said that if we didn't comply he was coming back tomorrow to deal with us all.' You would have seen all that footage on the TV where Joe MCDonald was abusing people and threatening people. This is not Fantasyland stuff, this is as plain as the day is and I intend to read out his conviction sheet shortly just to show you that he is still currently getting up to it. So it is about bogus safety issues. I will quote from page 281 of volume 12 of the Cole report: … in an industry where the risk of injury is significant the misuse of occupational health and safety issues as an industrial tool is common. Those union officials who so abuse occupational health and safety directly undermine the pre-eminence that such issues ought to have. Safety issues are exploited to provide a justification for the employment of persons named on lists maintained by the union. Safety is exploited as an industrial tool to bring pressure to bear on head contractors, subcontractors and others to achieve desired, non-safety related outcomes or simply to reinforce the power of the union. Safety issues are often raised by union officials in attempts to coerce subcontractors to sign EBAs and to pressure subcontractors not to engage non-union workers at a site. It says they are abandoned when an EBA is signed or an amount is paid on the account of casual tickets and specialised training. On that point, remember the 'no ticket, no start' signs all over the building sites in Perth. In this democracy with freedom of association there we had, while this union was running its lawless actions, 'no ticket, no start'. How un-Australian is that! You cannot have a job unless you get a ticket off the union. It is not the boss you go to see to join the worksite and it is not the person employing you; it is the union, which wants to control the worksite. We saw this on the Perth to Mandurah line that was being built and the federal government came to the rescue of the then Labor state government by putting a ban on strikes, so that they could finally build the line because it was all blowing out unbelievably because the union had been abusing the situation. In fact, there was some guy, a union official, who had declared it, of all things, 'holy ground' and said that they were going to strike on a daily basis and also when they felt like it. This law is proposed to bring greater harmony. It was so under us. But now, as I have said-watered down with 30 amendments and a defunding mechanism and a lack of authority for those running itit is going to see the cop on the beat emasculated. I know the other side hate John Lloyd, the former head of the ABCC, but I note that, in a speech that he made, he made a few observations: that the conduct of the industry had improved since the ABCC was established, that the incidence of unlawful conduct had been reduced and that industrial disputation had fallen to historically low levels-although we do know now that they are increasing under this government because the unions are being giving a wink and nod by this government that they can do what they like and it would not make sure that they did their job-but, however, that culture of exploiting any complacency in regulation was still intact. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industryremember that they are the terrible people who actually employ people-praised the ABCC in a submission to the Senate committee. This submission stated that the only effective response had come from the establishment of the ABCC and it went on to say: Whilst the industry is still in some areas a and demanding one to operate in, it is also one that is now characterised by a much greater sense of predictability and certainty than was the case prior to the establishment of the ABCC. The ACCI is very concerned about any changes that would put its hard-won position at risk and create the potential for a return to the past. While I have been sitting in here and listening to contributions I have heard-and I am sure we will all hear them again in a moment-that the words 'flexibility' and 'productivity' are dirty words on the other side of the House because they say-and if you read the Hansard you will see they have been saying this-that 'flexibility' and 'productivity' are about another way of reducing working conditions and terms for workers. They are not. In fact, for us to keep in any way competitive with countries off our northern shores that have cheap labour, we have to remain productive and competitive because that is about our competitive edge in terms of pricing et cetera. There is nothing wrong with what productivity and flexibility lead to, as I have said. Senator Sinodinos, in a recent piece, says: The Review of the Fair Work Act should be revamped to include an assessment by the Productivity Commission of the implications of the act for productivity, flexibility and nurturing direct employer-employee workplace relations. Flexibility is not code for cutting wages; it is code for encouraging work practices that stimulate innovation, and win-win productivity deals that are tailored to the preferences of workers on such matters as work-life balance. In coming to a conclusion, I note that in last weekend's Australian Financial Review an editorial belled the cat on this issue. I will read as much of it as I can before we finish: As former vice-president of the ACTU, Anna Booth says, Australia's industrial relations system is outdated and adversarial, and aims to institutionalise conflicts between workers and tough their bosses, rather than build productive workplaces. When a former stalwart of the union movement describes our industrial relations system in such scathing terms, the Labor government and the union movement should pay attention. … We need a more modern, simpler system which emphasises flexibility, where workers can strike individual bargains with their employers over wages, working hours and other conditions. Fairfax newspapers are no friend of those on this side of the House, yet this is the Australian Financial Review of last weekend saying that a former union boss, a former ACTU vice-president-Anna Booth-has said you have got to do something about the industrial relations climate in this country because it is getting out of hand. Of course, those on the other side of the House laugh, as that is their way of dismissing it. So they laugh when one of their own finally comes to see the light! It says that while Prime Minister Gillard 'speaks of the New Economy' she has got to deal with the rigidities- (Time expired)",61
34,Mr CHAMPION,PAIRS," I am sorry that the gallery has had to endure such a speech by the member for Canning. I would recommend the speech by the member for Kennedy if they want to hear a more balanced and thoughtful contribution. The member for Kennedy talked a lot about his younger days working in very dangerous environments in Mount Isa. He talked about the difficulties of raising safety issues at work and what actually happens to workers if they do so. What we are talking about in this debate on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 is the abolition of the remnants of the Work Choices regime-the last remnants of a regime that was born of malice, not facts. It was born of a vindictiveness that coloured the entire Howard government and colours to this day the approach of members opposite. It was all about cutting wages, all about cutting overtime, all about abolishing people's rights. You do not hear much about people's rights in the speeches and contributions of those opposite; it is all about the abolition of those rights, the abolition of dignity at work. That is what their approach was all about under Work Choices. And that has always been their approach. I remember watching a documentary about 'Red Ted' Theodore, a stalwart of the union movement. He said that the conservatives have only ever had two ideas: feed the donkey less and whip him harder. That is pretty much the approach of those opposite. They are not actually interested in things like the right to be in a union, the right to have a safe workplace and the right to bargain for your wages and conditions in good-faith negotiations. They are interested in taking away your wages, taking away your overtime and abolishing people's rights at work-and it has been ever thus. The ABCC is just a leftover from that era. It is time this body was reformed. It is time it was sent off into the never-never. It is not a perfect institution. Those opposite would have you believe it is an angelic institution that never put a foot wrong and that always did the right thing, and that its extraordinary powers were never abused. But I have had constituents-such as Mr Ark Tribe, who lived in Thompson Beach in my electorate and is somewhat famous in South Australia and around the country-who have come to the attention of these laws. Ark Tribe was an ordinary building worker, an ordinary man trying to get on and do the right thing by his mates. We know how his case wound up. We know that the use of the coercive powers has been both oppressive and ridiculous. It is working Australians who have been targeted. It is not union officials, not employers, not the big end of town. They have hardly ever been prosecuted by the ABCC. It has a very poor record of employer prosecutions-less than five per cent of all prosecutions. It defies belief that the prosecution rate would be so small, given the well publicised problems with illegal labour, phoenix companies and safety breaches in this industry. I can cite the headlines in the Adelaide Advertiser, as I have before. An article called 'Dodgy builders ""out of control""', on 9 March 2001, was about underpaid workers, many of them foreign, working here illegally and flooding into the South Australian building industry. The most critical thing in all of this is that they were underpaid, so it is not as though they benefited terribly well. They were underpaid by between $11,000 and $18,000 apiece. Underpayments and breaches of our immigration law are hardly ever prosecuted by the ABCC. It has been a pretty hopeless regulator, and it has been that way because was born of malice towards working people and a see-no-evil myopia with regard to business. The government's bill, which is a good bill, is a result of the independent inquiry by Murray Wilcox QC. The bill simply takes the recommendations given by Wilcox and puts them into law. There is to be a strong regulator for the building industry. Nobody is arguing that there should not be a cop on the beat, only that it should be within the fair work system. It will be a regulator that operates within community expectations of fairness and justice. We heard the member for Kennedy talk about habeas corpus and a few other ancient rights that were won by our forebears-and they are important rights. Importantly, this bill has a sunset clause on the compulsory information gathering powers. Before that there will be a review of how those powers are used. These are extraordinary powers. They are not held widely; they are held by very few federal investigative bodies, and they need to be reviewed so that people's rights are not trampled upon. It is important to have safeguards-and safeguards on the use of those coercive powers are introduced in this bill. Most importantly, there will be an independent assessor who, if a stakeholder seeks to exempt a project from the application of these powers, may decide that the powers do not apply. Where people are doing the right thing there is no need for such extraordinary powers to apply. The bill also removes the regime of punitive penalties. These were, again, a manifestation of that institutional bias against workersvery high fines designed to scare working people from exercising their rights under Australian law. These fines were held out as a mechanism to prevent workers from acting it to protect their dignity at their workplace. In short, this bill fixes the problems with the conduct of the ABCC through its abolition and replacement with a fair and independent regulator. It is a terribly important thing, because I have talked to building workers and I have received their correspondence outlining their deep worry about the operation of the ABCC and their deep concern about being caught up in very tough laws. This bill comes into this House with a mandate that was delivered at the 2007 election. Most Australians would ask this parliament to respect that mandate. It has been to an election and I think the instinctive will of the Australian people is towards fairness and justice. This legislation represents the abolition of the last obscene edifices of Work Choices. Much has been said by those opposite about the ABCC. Of late we have seen some headlines in the papers. There was recently an article in the Australian Financial Review entitled 'Inquiry into failed case against unionists', covering a particular case. The Sydney Morning Herald of Monday, 13 February 2012 contained an article headlined 'Building industry watchdog staff to face inquiry'. The Australian, which is always keen to talk about credit card misuse, noted that there were five instances of credit card misuse at the ABCC. This shows that all regulators need oversight to make sure that their conduct is appropriate, that they exercise their powers appropriately and that they serve the interests and the will of the Australian people through this government. I think this bill does represent justice to building workers, which has been somewhat delayed. It is profoundly unfair to single out one group of workers and place on them such a heavy burden in terms of the law. It is wrong and it is absolutely unlike this country to do so. We do want people to respect the rule of law and we do want people to behave appropriately at building sites, but we do not want an institutional bias against workers and we do not want selective laws in this country. I commend the bill to the House.",65
35,Mr MATHESON,PAIRS," I rise today to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. The building and construction industry is one of the most important industries in our economy. The Master Builders Association has estimated the value of construction work required over the next decade at $2.4 trillion. The residential building industry in particular is a key driver in our economy. According to a submission from the Housing Industry Association, Australia's housing industries directly contributed approximately $72.4 billion to Australia's economy in 2009-10. This accounted for 5.6 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. If we combine this with the primary and secondary businesses that indirectly supply to the construction industry, we are looking at much stronger figures in terms of employment and output. The building and construction industry also employs over a million people, representing approximately nine per cent of the Australian workforce. As you can see, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is a very important industry for our country and one that is vital to our economy. Today, those opposite are trying to introduce a bill that compromises the success of this industry and of those who work in it. They are breaking another election promise by trying to abolish the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, which was established by the coalition in 2005 following the 2002 Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. The Cole commission found that the building and construction industry was characterised by a widespread disregard for the law. It catalogued over 100 types of unlawful and inappropriate conduct. This included illegal strikes, pattern bargaining, right of entry infringements and the coercion of non-unionised subcontractors. The Cole commission also found that existing regulatory bodies had insufficient powers and resources to enforce the law. This is why one of its recommendations was to establish a specialist and permanent regulatory body to look into this conduct. It was the Howard government that established the ABCC in 2005 and the commission has since been instrumental in curbing illegal industrial action and lawlessness in the construction industry. It has also taken a strong stand against union thuggery in the industry-yes, union thuggery-and, by keeping disputes to a minimum, the ABCC has helped to increase productivity and lower construction costs all around Australia. Since its inception in 2005 it has helped the industry to increase productivity by 10 per cent, provide an annual economic welfare gain of $5.5 billion per year, reduce inflation by 1.2 per cent and increase GDP by 1.5 per cent. So it is doing its job. The number of working days lost annually per 1,000 employees in the construction industry has fallen from 224 in 2004 to 24 in 2006. At the same time, building costs have fallen by 20 to 25 per cent and long project delays have been dramatically reduced. According to the Housing Industry Association, the commission has: … been doing a sound and effective job of law enforcement, clamping down on unions and others for illegal industrial behaviour and entry breaches. This is keeping the unions in check. It goes on to say: However its work is far from finished. Aggressive and unlawful industrial action persists as an area of concern for the industry. It is clear that work still needs to be done and that the ABCC is doing this work independently and effectively. The type of conduct that Cole identified cannot be easily reversed. It is the type of conduct that needs targeted resources to effect lasting cultural change. Whilst the ABCC has succeeded in improving conduct, the culture of lawlessness identified in the Cole report has only been suppressed-and, yes, it still exists. This bill will abolish the ABCC and replace it with an inferior inspectorate division of the Fair Work Ombudsman. The new body that has been established within Fair Work Australia to replace the Office of the ABCC is not an independent body. It is controlled by the minister. It will become so bogged down in paperwork and bureaucracy that it will not have the time and resources to do its job properly. It is not a simpler model; it is a more complicated model that makes it more difficult to enforce law and order in the building and construction industry. A softened approach is far from what the industry needs right now. This bill will cut the maximum penalties for illegal misbehaviour from $110,000 to $33,000, reducing the disincentives to engage in unlawful behaviour. According to the HIA, the procedural requirements for this bill are 'overly bureaucratic, costly, prescriptive and impractical'. With this bill we see the ALP cowering to the demands of its union paymasters, sacrificing the independence of small business subcontractors and subjecting the building and construction industry to a new era of industrial administration and right of uncertainty. This bill is another broken promise and a ploy to bring the unions and the Labor Left on side to save the Prime Minister's leadership. The bill allows for the powers of the ABCC to be switched off for individual worksites that have a good history of industrial relations. This means that the unions can seek to have the law not apply until such times as problems occur. The unions used to protect workers, now they persecute them and suffocate the industries that seek to employ them. The government has already introduced measures that make it tough for the building and construction industry. This will only make things worse. Increasing productivity and flexibility should be the primary focus of our industrial relations policy. In Macarthur we have many new housing developments and suburbs being built, which will accommodate an extra 200,000 new residents in the area over the next 25 years. That is a population increase of more than 300 per cent. The building and construction work taking place in my electorate employs hundreds of workers from Macarthur and south-western Sydney. It is a major part of the industry that is stimulating our economy and keeping locals employed. We also have the Macarthur Building Industry Skills Centre right on our doorstep. This state-of-the-art training centre, located in the Ingleburn industrial precinct, was established to meet the needs of industry growth in south-western Sydney. It offers a comprehensive range of pre-vocational, trade and licensing programs. The centre delivers trade training using an integrated project based approach to skills development. This means students can gain experience on real building projects and have access to plant, equipment and resources of current industry standards. We have some very talented young men and women attending this training centre, working hard towards a fulfilling career in the building industry. The future of these workers and the risk to the Australian economy is why we cannot afford for the building industry to return to its unlawful practices of the past. This is why the coalition strongly opposes the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. We believe that every Australian deserves to be able to go work and operate in an environment where basic law and order is enforced. Employers and employees alike wanted to get rid of the illegality that plagued the building and construction industry. The only people who will benefit from the government's move are of course the unions. The bill will strip away the protections for workers to work in a safe and lawful environment. It abolishes the body that ensures that law and order is enforced in the building and construction industry. Why would we support this bill when the ABCC has delivered real results for Australia? To put a stop to its good work would roll out the red carpet to union thuggery, coercion and disputation. I ask those opposite to reconsider their responsibility to this country, Australian workers and our economy before voting on this bill. All we need to do is look back at the recommendation from the Cole royal commission. It stated that we need: … free of the pressures on the participants industry, which will ensure that participants comply with industrial, civil and criminal laws applicable to all Australians … In its submission, HIA told us that it does not believe the proposed legislation will continue to deliver the strong, independent and robust enforcement body that the building industry requires. It also said that 'a watering down' of the existing powers will result in a return to the industrial lawlessness identified by the Cole royal commission. How could we even consider passing this bill when we know that the Australian building industry needs a strong, independent enforcer to maintain lawful practice and stop the bad behaviours of the past? We simply cannot afford to replace the ABCC, which has helped to increase productivity and lower construction costs around Australia. In its submission the HIA states that it does not support this bill and that the legislative and institutional framework established as a result of the Cole royal commission must be retained in its current form. We cannot pretend that the findings of the Cole royal commission do not exist. I believe that we must oppose this bill so that we do not subject the building and construction industry to a new era of industrial administration and uncertainty. We must oppose this bill for the sake of our economy and Australian jobs. We must oppose this bill to ensure the protection and safety of our workers. And we must oppose this bill to avoid the industry's unlawful practices of the past and to ensure its strength and prosperity for the future.",67
36,Ms RISHWORTH,PAIRS," I am very pleased to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. It was interesting that the previous speaker talked about how this bill would in the make it overly bureaucratic in terms of fairness in the workplace. To the previous speaker I say that I do not see it as bureaucratic to put in some checks and balances and oversight to ensure that individual's rights are being properly protected. I see it as fundamental in a democracy that we do not have an authoritarian group with no transparency enforcing very big impingements on personal rights. There is a need for oversight and checks and balances. That is what it means to live in a democracy. I disagree strongly with the previous speaker's suggestion that this is just a bit of over-bureaucratic paperwork. It is an important bill for providing important oversight and checks and balances to the impingement of rights of workers, which the Howard government was so proud of. Fairness in the workplace is a core value of the Australian Labor Party, and this Labor government has always strived to ensure that workplace relations is built on a system of fairness. This is in very stark contrast to previous Liberal government, which made it very clear to working Australians that fairness in the workplace was not high on its priority list. In fact, I would go so far say that the previous Liberal government showed contempt for working people and their right to fairness in the workplace. We all know that former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard ripped away the wages and stripped back the conditions of ordinary Australians in both his first and second waves of industrial relations reforms. Mr Howard really showed contempt for the rights of working people through the establishment of the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. The previous Liberal government's Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner has not functioned in a fair way. It has taken this Labor government to act to replace it to ensure that a new body is part of the mainstream fair work system and incorporates new safeguards to protect the rights of workers. While I recognise the legislation before the House today does not go as far as perhaps some would like, I believe it strikes an important balance between the rights of workers and those of employers. The operation of the previous Liberal government's industrial regulator has been criticised by many people, including me and many other stakeholders, for a long time. I am pleased that this bill will inject some fairness and some checks and balances into this area. The purpose of the ABCC is allegedly to monitor and promote standards of contact in the building and construction industry and involves investigating suspected contraventions and bringing legal proceedings when required. As a statutory body, the ABCC should have been play the the role of an umpire within the building and construction industry. But, as we know, that was not the case. The ABCC was extremely unbalanced in the way it did its job. In as to reality, the ABCC's role has been an application of a system that unfairly targets employees without affording them the appropriate safeguards and protections, and it has consistently failed to enforce the responsibilities of employers. It is clear from the number of prosecutions of employee organisations when compared with employer groups that this regulator has unfairly targeted unions. More importantly, it has unfairly targeted ordinary Australians. The opposition may try and argue that that is because more employees do the wrong thing, but I can tell you that I have been out on worksites where there have been employers doing the wrong thing and it would be very hard to imagine that every building and construction employer in this country always did the right thing. We know from a lot of health and safety reports in a whole range of areas that this is not the case. Instead, the ABCC was focused on just targeting employees and employers. The ABCC has created a culture of intimidation for workers, who have at times felt unable to voice legitimate concerns for fear of compulsory interrogation, which failed to afford workers appropriate protections and safeguards, including their right to full legal representation. We have often heard of the effectiveness of the ABCC. One test I am sure many Australians would like to apply to the ABCC is whether it stopped dangerous occurrences in the construction industry. In 2004-05 there were 18 fatalities recorded in the building and construction industry, in 2005-06 there were 25, in 2006-07 there were 28 and in 2007-08 there were 36. You can see that with the ABCC coming into effect in 2005, it has not decreased the number of fatalities in the building and construction area but has been correlated with an increase. Rather than holding both employees and employers to account it would seem that the ABCC has operated in a way that has unfairly targeted employees and their unions while paying little attention to whether or not employers are paying their workers correctly. One particular case is the case that the member for Wakefield mentioned, and that is the case of Ark Tribe. During the time in which he was being pursued by the ABCC there were reports of migrant Korean workers being worked to death by unscrupulous employers. But where was the ABCC on this issue? It was not heard. It has come to this Labor government to fix this system and ensure that there is balance and fairness. The bill before the House does seek to abolish the ABCC and is in line with the recommendations outlined in the Transition to Fair Work Australia for the building and construction industry report by the Office of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate, released in 2009 by Justice Murray Wilcox QC. Justice Wilcox engaged in extensive consultation with all stakeholders in the building and construction industry. The government consulted with industries and state and territory governments as part of developing this legislation. One of the important points that was raised was that the ABCC did need to be replaced, and replaced with a fair work building industry inspectorate. This was part of the recommendations of the report. The building inspectorate created by this bill will be headed by an independent director appointed by the minister. Importantly, the director managing the operations of the building inspectorate will have full operational autonomy and will receive recommendations on a whole range of issues, including from a newly established advisory board. The creation of the inspectorate will significantly improve the rights and safety of construction workers by ensuring that they are treated equal to employers. The bill will also make a number of other changes to improve the rights of workers. For example, if a person is summonsed, which will only occur if the information cannot be retrieved in any other way, they can choose to be represented by a lawyer and their right not to disclose legally sensitive information will be recognised. I find it interesting that the opposition has decided that this is not an appropriate change. This is about the rights of people and their right to have representation. I am surprised that some of the members opposite who are have regularly stood up in this place and talked about how representation is important and how people have the right to be legally represented should decide that they could not support this for construction workers. Why shouldn't they be able to have legal representation? Why should they be different from other workers in this country? Is it because the coalition just does not like workers in the building and construction industry? It is hard to know why they would deny them these rights. Workers may also be reimbursed for reasonable expenses and have their examinations videotaped and reviewed by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Once again, something that the previous speaker said was 'too much bureaucracy'. Well, I would say that this is an important check and balance to ensure that any particular powers that are used by the inspectorate are monitored and able to be looked at properly. Furthermore, any person who has been interviewed will no longer be prevented from telling others what happened. This allows for transparency to ensure that there is no secrecy. The bill also includes a sunset clause which will mean that coercive powers will cease to exist after three years so that a abolition. review can be conducted to assess compliance in the building and construction industry following the implementation of this legislation. These are very important recommendations. This is very important legislation to ensure we return fairness workplace-fairness where both employers and employees are treated equally-so that employees are not unfairly targeted where employers who do the wrong thing get away with it. We know where the coalition stands on this. They refuse to recognise the rights ordinary working Australians. They have done it once, they will do it again. However, it has been left to this government to restore fairness, to restore balance. We are going ahead with an inspectorate that will focus on the building and construction industry, but with that we will have some oversight, we will have some checks and balances and we will restore fairness for both employees and employers with a truly independent umpire.",69
37,Mr FRYDENBERG,PAIRS," I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. This will see the abolition of the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and with it the role of the commissioner and the high penalties that applied to the industry for breaches to industrial law. This bill is another ideologically driven, economically damaging, decision by this government. At a time when we are seeing heightened levels of industrial disputes, falling productivity and increasing unemployment there could not be a worse moment for such legislative change. To understand the seriousness of this decision, we need to retell the story of the birth of the ABCC, the rationale for its existence, its record of achievement and the impact of its The ABCC was established by the Howard government in 2005 following the findings of the Cole royal commission, which reported in March 2003. Commissioner Cole, who had a broad mandate to look into coercive, violent and to the unlawful practices in the building and construction industry, detailed over 100 different types of unlawful conduct, painting a disturbing picture of lawlessness in this most important sector. The inadequacies of existing regulatory bodies were also of highlighted, paving the way for the independent ABCC. In the words of Cole, the building and construction industry 'departs from the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the rest of the Australian economy' and that to date: … there has been an insufficient determination on the part of government to establish structures which will enable the industry to operate fairly and productively and in a manner respecting the rights of individuals. There has been an inadequate structure to enforce the law and usual standards applicable in other industries. One of the cases that Cole focused on was in my home state of Victoria, involving the well-known Japanese food processor, Saizeriya. Saizeriya had planned a major investment of over $200 million in Victoria, which would have created hundreds of jobs directly and up to 3,000 jobs indirectly. Unfortunately, this company became the target of disruptive union behaviourstrikes, boycotts, work bans, restrictions on contractors. As a consequence, the first plant was opened more than a year after schedule in 2003 and the parent company became so disillusioned with the experience that they withdrew all their further investment, dealing a significant blow to the state of Victoria. In the words of the royal commission: Saizeriya Australia's experience starkly calls question the effect upon foreign investment requiring building and construction work of any magnitude in Victoria when such work may be subject to unlawful and inappropriate conduct and actions by unions. Regrettably, in my state of Victoria, Saizeriya has not been the only such experience. The Wonthaggi desalination plant is another recent case in point with 193 days lost to industrial action as a result of unruly union behaviour. With the building and construction industry contributing billions of dollars each year to our economy-in fact making up a remarkable 7.7 per cent of GDP-we cannot afford anything but a most efficient and effective sector. It is in that context that one can see what a negative impact the abolition of the ABCC will have. Under the ABCC, productivity increased by 10 per cent providing a windfall economic gain of $5.5 billion, GDP rose by 1.5 per cent, inflation fell by 1.2 per cent and the number of working days per 1,000 employees in the construction industry decreased from 224 in 2004 to 24 in 2006 and building costs were slashed by between 20 and 25 per cent. This is the report card of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. In fact, over the past year its investigations have uncovered more than 900 breaches of workplace relations laws and the imposition of $2.5 million in penalties. During its operation, the ABCC has prosecuted more than 70 cases. Unfortunately, these dramatic improvements to these key indicators are now under threat from Labor's new legislative regime. There will be, under this legislation, no equivalent substitute for the ABCC. In its place will sit a new body that is within the confines of Fair Work Australia, the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate, which is responsible up the line to the minister, a stark contrast to the into independent body, the ABCC, capable of a frank and fearless approach and not beholden to a political directive. The minister will not be passive, nor is it envisaged that he or she will be. They will have the express authority to give the regulator written directions about its programs and priorities, which could forseeably see less focus on the unlawfulness of union conduct. The perceived conflict of interest here is real. A Labor Party, whose campaigns are funded to a significant degree by the union movement, is going to be reluctant to display an even hand when it comes to regulating their behaviour in the workplace. What is more, the government's legislation will also lessen the penalties for unlawful conduct and reduce the deterrent for such behaviour. Under the legislation penalties will be reduced by a third, with maximum sanctions being $33,000 for a body corporate and $6,600 for a person. Significantly, as John Lloyd, former ABCC commissioner and now Director of the Work Reform and Productivity Unit at the prestigious Institute of Public Affairs, has pointed out, this comes at a time when the courts are responding 'to repeat offences by a number of unions and their officials' with higher penalties. In fact, he said, '12 cases have resulted in penalties in excess of the Fair Work Act maxima', the majority of which have been made since 2009. Other worrying changes in this legislation include the watering down of the coercive powers, the switch-off provisions and additional red tape through administrative processes. It is no wonder, then, that industry stakeholders, respected economic commentators and governments are lining up to condemn the government's legislative changes. Heather Ridout, outgoing head of the Australia Industry Group, has said, 'The ABCC is carrying out a vital role and is needed today as much as ever.' The National Electrical and Communications Association has said: … the ABCC has been effective in removing the worse instances. Removing the ABCC or emasculating its powers will see increased inappropriate behaviour and this will lead to costs of projects blowing out and delays in construction. The Australian Mine and Metals Association is concerned the changes 'can only lead to more unlawful behaviour and economic vandalism'. Master Builders Australia has said that the 'parliament cannot ignore such court findings and convictions and should not agree to any watering down of the current powers'. And the government of Victoria, where the building and construction industry employs 9.2 per cent of the workforce, contributing 6.6 per cent of the gross state product, said in its submission that the bill 'would hamper the ability of the industry regulator to deal with unlawful industrial action quickly and effectively'. There it is: universal and unanimous condemnation of the government's actions, yet they refuse to listen. But it should not be any surprise to us. We have seen this government's record when it comes to the workplace and industrial relations reform. The Gillard government have overseen an economy that is now characterised by declining productivity, rising unemployment, worsening industrial action and now a weakening in the accountability mechanisms which protect both workers and their employers. On their watch they have seen new unions emboldened, penalty rates smash small business and investors take their money offshore. This cannot continue, but state unfortunately it will with this Labor government at the helm. The minister, Bill Shorten, tells us he has 'always supported, and continues to support, a strong regulator in the building and construction industry'. But, again, these are just cheap words, betrayed by a completely different intent. In my short time in this place I have quickly learnt: do not judge Labor by what they say but by what they do. The abolition of the Australian Building and the Construction Commission is another perfect example. This government do not believe in lawful industrial relations practices, this government do not believe in accountability, transparency and rising productivity-and, most of all, this government do not believe in putting a cop on the beat to police their union mates. This is bad legislation, and I join with my colleagues from the coalition in opposing it.",72
38,Mr BANDT,PAIRS," There is a problem with the rule of law in this country: it does not emanate from workers and their unions but, far too often, from this parliament. The rot really set in under the Howard government. When it came to immigration we saw the beginning of defining places within Australia as not really Australia, and the defining of people as having two tiers of rights. We saw terrorism laws that removed long standing rights to silence. With Work Choices we saw the introduction of laws that gave ministers in this place the right to remove people's legitimate rights to bargain, without any say and without a hearing, and to the Labor government's shame they have kept those laws. But we also saw the enshrining of a principle in the building industry that undermines one fundamental tenet of the rule of law. The rule of law says that you have one set of laws that applies equally to all people and that they will be judged according to an equal standard, regardless of where they come from and regardless of their status. These laws in the building industry removed the right to silence that people had, simply because they worked in a particular industry and because they turned up to work in boots and a hard hat instead of a suit and tie. That fundamental offence against one of the most basic principles of the rule of law rightly drew opprobrium not just from those people who were affected but from people right across the spectrum who were concerned about civil liberties and from observers internationally who looked at these labour laws and said they did not meet basic civil rights standards. But more than that, the legislation, which was established under the former Howard government, set up a juggernaut that had significant resources and that turned its direction and its fire on one particular group. If you look at the statistics you will see between October 2005 and June 2011, the ABCC commenced 91 prosecutions. Eightysix of them were against workers, their representatives and their unions and only five were against employers. To this government's shame it became no better with the change of government. From 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010, 29 proceedings were commenced against workers and their unions and none against employers. That is what this institution that was created was designed to do. It was not a neutral policing agency within the industry; it had a specific target. You just have to look at how it conducted its activities to see what it did. Throughout all of this the Greens have been steadfast in their defence of the rule of law. In 2005 we opposed the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act in the Senate. In 2004 we moved to disallow the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Regulations and used the opportunity to highlight the harsh impact the laws were having. We took an explicit policy to repeal the act and to abolish the ABCC to both the 2007 and the 2010 elections. In 2008 we introduced a private senator's bill to repeal the act in its entirety. In 2008-09 we reiterated our strong position in Senate committee inquiries and, in 2010, we moved a motion in the Senate noting the recent ILO report, which I will have more to say about in a moment, on the ABCC and calling on the government to abolish the ABCC. We have voluntarily signed up to International Labour Organisation conventions that apply internationally, that preserve the right to organise, freedom of assembly and the right to bargain. On no less than eight separate occasions the International Labour Organisation has said to our government that the specific building industry legislation contravenes those international standards that they have signed that, up to. That is why, as I have alluded to before, we have had not only international law groups but civil liberties groups including, amongst others, Liberty Victoria-which is not necessarily well known for saying that it is on the side of workers but is a staunch defender of the basic principles of the rule of law, including the right to silence-come out and condemn this law, joining the likes of the ILO. There was a time when the Labor Party agreed with all of that, when they voted against the ABCC in the Senate. In 2007, in their Forward with Fairness policy, they said: Labor does not believe in separate industrial and regulations for different industries. Under Labor all employers, employees and unions across all industries will be required to comply with the rules … They went on to talk about having specialist divisions in Fair Work Australia. It seems, though, that when it comes to Labor and its factions it does not take that long to shift on fundamental principles. If you accept everything that the coalition has said you would believe that the ABCC was being abolished tomorrow. If only that were the case. Instead, this bill before parliament retains some of the worse excesses of the Howard government. People in the building industry remain singled out for special treatment by virtue of no other fact than they work in that industry. We still have an inspectorate that remains, for all intents and purposes, an autonomous entity-a continuation of that prosecuting juggernaut, established by the coalition, which will continue to pursue workers and their representatives with unfair proportionality. But, most distressingly, the coercive powers still remain in the legislation. After passing this legislation, Labor members would do well to remember one thing: the same worker whom they will stand next to one day, wearing a hard hat and fluoro vest, for a photo opportunity could on the next day be taken in for questioning and forced to name their workmates. That remains a fact under this bill. Workers in such an industry will continue to enjoy less liberty than workers in other industries and this kind of MCCarthyism that was begun under the Howard government will continue. Perhaps the most distressing thing about that is that we have in this parliament an opportunity to fix it. We have enough support on the crossbench to remove these coercive powers and go back to something rules that the Labor Party only a few short years ago said it believed in. The fact that Labor are choosing not to do that is something that they themselves will have to explain to the public. I heard a number of times during this debate a reference to the former Cole royal commission as if it were some authoritative basis for the laws that were established here. I had the privilege of representing people during that royal commission and let me give you, Madam Deputy Speaker, a couple of anecdotes about how that worked. First of all the commission was not a court. The commission was not an entity where everyone had the right to equally defend everything that was put against them in a way that you might expect in a court. So what happened? I remember one day when I was representing some people in Western Australia waking up to read in the newspaper, 'Worker locked in shipping container by unionist'. That apparently is what the royal commission was going to hear about over the next couple of days. We turned up, we heard an opening from counsel assisting about this newspaper report about a shipping container and we sat there for two days listening to the evidence. Not once did they mention a shipping container. They could not find one witness to come and corroborate it and give evidence to the royal commission. They moved on, but of course the damage was done, because this was not a fair proceeding like a court and instead was trial by media and trial by royal commission. I remember another instance where it was said that at a site at a university employees and their union had taken unlawful industrial action and attempted to coerce a small subcontractor by walking off the job. We got halfway through that when it was found out that the reason they walked off the job was that the employer was directing them to work on a rostered day off against the enterprise agreement. So we made an application to call the employer before the royal commission to investigate the employer's breach of the enterprise agreement. No sooner had we made that application than that whole case study was shut down and we moved on to something else. That royal commission was not about looking at the real issues in the industry, the issues that arise around sham contracting which defraud the revenue of the Commonwealth potentially of up to $10 billion. It was not about looking at the exploitation of overseas labour and not paying them at local rates but rather underpaying them, which threatens them and threatens locals. It was not about looking at any of that; it was about coming up with an outcome that would enable the legislation that preceded this legislation to set up the Australian Building and Construction Commission. If you want to know how this entity has been behaving lately, this entity that is supposedly to neutrally police activity in the building sector, just a week or so ago in the Federal Court one case was dismissed when the judge described as sloppy the investigative practices of the ABCC. But then, more spectacularly, a criminal case that was going on a week or so ago in Victoria that relied on ABCC evidence has now resulted in the ABCC commissioner investigating his own inspectors because they destroyed evidence. Such was their zeal to see prosecutions against workers and their unions proceed that they were prepared to destroy evidence. It is no wonder it is being investigated. But it explains exactly what organisation was really set up to do and what it is on about. That is why it is so disappointing that Labor is choosing to retain a version of it. Now, I am not saying there are no problems in the industry. I would be the last one to say construction workers are all angels. But if we were serious about tackling problems in the industry then we would turn our attention to sham contracting, we would turn our attention to the fact that often workers are told, 'Yes, you can come and work on this job but we need you to incorporate and give us a Pty Ltd letterhead.' We would turn our attention to the underpayment and exploitation of overseas workers. And we would give the ABCC or its replacement coercive powers to investigate those things. But we don't do that-no, we continue along the path set by the Howard government. It is a basic matter of principle. I think there should be one principle that should guide how we deal with this issue. You do not make things better by removing people's rights. You succeed in politics and in lawmaking by standing for something, by believing in one law for all and then being prepared to stand up for it and implement it when you are elected. If someone could walk there into an office or a shop and drag someone away for questioning and force them to name names and force them to give details, there would be an outcry, and rightly so. People in this country do not deserve fewer rights simply because they turn up to work in boots and a hard hat compared with a suit and tie. It is my strong hope that the government will consider the amendments that we will be putting forward later so that we can get rid of these inequitable laws once and for all. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (13:29): I rise to briefly contribute to this important debate. In doing so I follow a number of speakers on my side of the House who have this made the key points about how damaging this legislation is. It is always an interesting thing to follow the member for Melbourne, and it is no exception in this debate. It does transport us to another galaxy, which he inhabits. It is not a galaxy in the future, it place in the past. When you cut through everything the member for Melbourne just said in this debate, it is quite clear that he wants to transport us back to a place of lawlessness in the construction industry. The member for Melbourne is disappointed that the government's broken promise is not good enough. Whilst he very fleetingly made reference to the possibility that there might have been bad behaviour in the building industry, as some kind of cover, there is no doubt that he saw no problem with the way things were a decade and a half ago. The member for Melbourne saw no problem with the sort of conduct we saw in our construction industry. As the member for Mayo pointed out in this debate last week, the building commission that this legislation seeks to abolish was not something the former Howard government simply dreamt up. If you listen to the member for Melbourne, you would think that was the case, that there was no problem that needed solving, and that the legislation of the former Howard government was simply brought into this place for no necessary reason. As the member for Mayo rightly pointed out in this House a little under a week ago, the Cole royal commission spoke volumes about the state of our building industry. The commission's findings were that it was an industry plagued, as the member for Mayo said, by 'unacceptable behaviour, corruption, threats and standover tactics' and, as he eloquently put it, it was 'the law of the jungle'. It was directly as a result of that royal commission that the legislation by the Howard government was introduced. Once it was introduced, its effect was there for all to see. Productivity improved and the savings is a to the national economy improved. It was not just the lawlessness-the member for Melbourne talks about the rule of law-there was the law of the jungle, as the member for Mayo said, prior to the introduction of the Howard government legislation. This legislation, which is designed to neuter that, to abolish it, is something that Labor always had in mind because unfortunately, in a choice between the national good with this policy and their demanding friends in the union movement, there is no choice for those opposite-the national interest runs a poor second. We have before us today another example of what those opposite view as their absolute priority, namely, the value of their word before an election. Unfortunately, what we are witnessing in this House is a situation where, if this legislation is passed, we can look into the future and know what will occur because it will be a repeat of the past, the past failure that was dealt with effectively and which those opposite will be happy to see a re-run of. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out last Friday in a keynote address to the Master Builders Association, we need to be very clear what we will see a return of and the sort of work that will not be done in the future. I have mentioned the member for Mayo's contribution and his detailing of the Cole royal commission. As the Leader of the Opposition outlined, the productivity improvement was of the order of $6 billion a violence, year as a result of getting the industry under control and out of the jungle, and removing, limiting and reducing, where possible, the sort of conduct that everyday Australians find unacceptable and, more to the point, do not want to pay for. It is not just a question of those involved in the industry and the law of the jungle. This affects every single Australian. It cascades through the price and cost chain. It affects businesses and their capacity to be profitable and to employ people. All of those points have been very adequately made by speakers on our side of the House. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, an example is the Epping Markets dispute, just 18 months ago, which resulted in locks being superglued, entrances being blocked and fires being lit. This was a dispute out of control. The watchdog took action over the illegalities at the Epping markets and fines and costs of over half a million dollars were imposed on the people involved. In the past, all those activities would have occurred without the adequate capacity to stop it or to take remedial action. Those opposite know exactly what they are doing with the legislation that they have brought before the House today. They know they are turning the clock back and opening the way to the sorts of abuses that the royal commission uncovered. They know exactly what they are doing. This is not a question of naivety on behalf of those opposite. The Australian public ought to know it. They will certainly know it by the time of the next election. As the Leader of the Opposition said, we will fight this legislation and if we fail in both houses we will restore the Australian Building and Construction Commission at the first available opportunity. We will, as he said, restore it with new vigour, because of the necessity for it. This legislation is bad legislation. The government knows it is so, but it is legislating at the behest of the union movement to the cost of the wider Australian community.",74
39,Mr NEUMANN,PAIRS," I spoke on this building and construction industry legislation in the last parliament on 13 August 2009. I said then, and I say now, that I believe there should be one law for all. Whether you live in Perth, Palm Beach, the Torres Strait or Tasmania, the law should apply to everyone equally. I believe that should apply to public servants. I believe that should happen in the classrooms, on the construction sites and even in the parliament. Those opposite have form on this issue, and this body, with its draconian laws, is a pet project of those opposite. They persecuted the unions and prosecuted workers. The truth is that those opposite would restore the ABCC if they got into office and they would give power to the ABCC or its new creation. Guess what that new creation would do? I want all those in the gallery to listen to this. This is the power that the ABCC has. It has the power to compel people to attend interviews and answer questions and to compel them to provide documents and information as to that investigation. Those interrogations are conducted in private and interviewers are not allowed to disclose to anyone what happens during that investigation. The penalty for not complying with this notice is six months imprisonment. There is no right to silence under the laws of the ABCC. In other words, people can be compelled under those laws to dob in their mates on industrial matters. The ABCC and the legislation that covers it were never meant to deal with criminal conduct. It is concerned with the regulation of industrial behaviour. On this side of politics, we believe that if anyone engages in criminal or unlawful activity on a construction site they should be prosecuted with the full force of the law and that the criminal laws in this country, in the states and territories, are adequate. I have not heard anyone opposite say that there is some deficiency in the criminal law of the state, territory and Commonwealth governments of this country which means that we need to criminalise the capacity of a body like the ABCC to persecute and prosecute workers, including friends of mine such as Bradley O'Carroll, the head of the Plumbers Union in Queensland, who was wrongly charged. I have heard people opposite wax lyrical about what the Howard government did on Work Choices. I have heard them talk about perceived lawlessness and what the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry found. Let us look at what the Cole commission really found. The Cole commission was a partisan, politicised body from the start. The Howard government tried to bring in the ABCC, but they could not because they did not have a majority in the Senate. When they got a majority in the Senate, they brought the ABCC in. Of the 392 incidences of so-called unlawful behaviour in the final report of the Cole commission, only one was ever pursued and it was ultimately dropped without being prosecuted to its finality. Those opposite spent millions of dollars when they were on this side of the place alleging that there was unlawful conduct everywhere, yet no-one was charged and no-one was found guilty. As I have said, the Howard government established the ABCC. The ABCC is simply geared towards a one-sided approach in industrial relations. In the 2009-10 year, the annual report of the ABCC disclosed that 55 per cent of its investigations were directed trade unions. Only seven per cent of its investigations in 2009-10 were directed at employers. Unions or employees were the subject of, on average, 76.5 per cent, or more than three-quarters, of all ABCC investigations between 1 July 2006 and 30 June 2009. The overwhelming majority of the activities of the ABCC were geared towards one purpose: to make sure that the unions and their workers on construction sites were both prosecuted and persecuted. That is the reality of what went on. The ABCC carried out secret investigations where legal professional privilege, the right to silence and the right to reimbursement of reasonable expenses were not provided. There was effectively no independent oversight, and we know the person in charge has gone on to work for a right-wing think tank. This body was politicised from the word go. The truth is that the powers given to this body were extraordinary. Section 52 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 talks about requirements in relation to excuses. Section 53(1) of the legislation says: A person is not excused from giving information, producing a document, or answering a question … Section 52(7) overrides the secrecy provisions in other laws. In other words, these sections override any laws in relation to any other body, including ASIO, and these laws include coercive powers, the protection of journalists' sources, privacy laws and cabinet confidentiality. That is according to Professor George Williams. And that is what has happened. This government is about bringing in safeguards and oversight. We are about making sure that workers get a fair go in the workplace and that the ABCC is expunged or eradicated from the industrial landscape of at this country. The legislation before this House goes a long way towards equalising the balance in this field-a fair, simple and equal balance. Just as Work Choices needed to be expunged, the ABCC needs to go.",79
40,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Blue Mountains Legacy Mrs MARKUS (Macquarie) (13:45): Blue Mountains Legacy is a vitally important organisation providing welfare, pension, advocacy and compassionate assistance to ex-service personnel and their families in electorate of Macquarie. The Legacy premises at Springwood are used to facilitate meetings and functions and as a hub to provide advice to its members concerning welfare and pension matters. A number of other veterans and ex-service organisations use the premises. Additionally, the DVA uses the premises for information sessions and has previously invested funds for the upgrade of key amenities-specifically, $30,000 for an upgrade of the kitchen. However, Blue Mountains Legacy is facing the significant challenges of being unable to cover an urgent bill of $40,000 for rental expenses and being unable to ensure that it can secure the lease for its Springwood premises until 2020. Blue Mountains Legacy has applied for rental allocation funding under the BEST grants scheme. While it is technically eligible for the funding, the grandfathering approach the minister and department have taken in only continuing rental allocation funding for current recipients of the program-not for new ones-poses a challenge. I am extremely dissatisfied with the minister's response to this dire and urgent matter. Without Blue Mountains Legacy obtaining the necessary funding for their rental commitment and to provide security of tenure, vital services for veterans and their families-there are more than 2,500 veterans in the Blue Mountains-will be lost. I implore the minister to reconsider Blue Mountains Legacy's request for rental allocation funding so that the vital services the organisation provides- (Time expired) Victorian Government Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (13:46): Property developers in Victoria have too much power. They had too much power under the former Victorian Labor government and they have too much power the under the Victorian Liberal government. This was stunningly revealed by the Age today in its report that, before planning minister Matthew Guy rezoned farmland on Phillip Island to allow it to become housing, his office was contacted twice by a former Liberal minister, Rob Maclellan, on behalf of property developer and Liberal Party member Jim Hopkins. Mr Maclellan rang Matthew Guy's chief of staff, Meg Bartel, about this issue-which was not hard for him seeing that Ms Bartel was a former staffer of his. Shortly afterwards, Matthew Guy overrode the Bass Coast Shire Council and the recommendations of two independent planning panels and approved a housing development on the farmland. While the decision was reversed following a public outcry, it is a stark illustration of how much access to government property developers in Victoria have. Ordinary residents cannot just pick up the phone to ministers and their chiefs of staff. The Victorian Liberal government must listen to residents, not property developers, when it comes to planning issues. It must not use the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, the VCAT, or dodgy ministerial interventions like this one to deprive local communities of their rightful say in the character of the neighbourhood in which they have chosen to live. Schools",80
41,Mr OAKESHOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to talk about small school closures in New South Wales. It is a concern, less than 12 months since the New South Wales state election, that P6 schools such as the Byabarra Public School and now the Bobin Public School are under threat of closure. In the case of Byabarra, the school has actually been closed. It was promised that Byabarra would remain open throughout 2012, with decisions to be made at the end of this year. Unfortunately, it was closed with two weeks' notice before the end of the school year last year. Now Bobin Public School has been given until August, when it may face closure. This is being done by a government-a coalition which includes the National Party-which promised to defend small schools in New South Wales. The National Party and the government told the electorate that they understood the importance of small schools to their communities. There is a point for Commonwealth consideration as well. It relates to money spent under the Building the Education Revolution and other Commonwealth programs. That money goes to waste when these P6 decisions are made. Under the Education Act in New South Wales, a government can decide to close these schools whenever they want. Federal money is therefore being lost. The Gonski review, expected to be released next week, must consider the place of small schools and disadvantaged communities as we look for a better funding model for the future. The New South Wales government and state governments generally must come to the table to get- (Time expired) Chaldean Australian Academic Society",81
42,Mr HAYES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Saturday I had the pleasure of attending the graduation ceremony of the Chaldean Australian Academic Society. The event was attended by His Grace Mar Jabriel Kassab, Archbishop of the Chaldean Catholic Diocese of Australia and New Zealand. The federal government sees completing Year 12, getting a university degree or vocational qualifications as a life-changing opportunity. It is about providing more Australians, particularly in the south-west of Sydney, with the skills they need to acquire the jobs of the future. To all the HSC students and university graduates who attended from across the Fowler electorate, I would like to offer my congratulations on your academic achievement. The honour you have received is a great personal achievement and also a source of great pride and inspiration for our whole community. Among the many community groups and leaders who attended, I thank President Bassam Frety and the founder of the society, Adris Frety, for the work they have done in promoting academic achievement within the Chaldean academic community. The ceremony was also an opportunity for us to share knowledge and ideas across all the professions that attended and to encourage Chaldean culture and traditions across the broader community. I wish to thank all those involved in helping our students to this great achievement. Mental Illness Fellowship of Queensland",82
43,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I am pleased to rise and express my support for an application by the Mental Illness Fellowship of Queensland, MIFQ, for a grant from the Regional Development Australia Fund to assist in the development of a new facility at Herston in Brisbane. A local Last organisation, the MIFQ has been in operation since 1981. Since then it has provided a very valuable and important service to people around the state, from the Gold Coast to Gladstone. During this time, the fellowship has helped thousands of Queenslanders living with mental illness and provided vital support and advice to their families. Almost half of all Australians will experience a mental disorder at some point during their lifetime and I am fully committed to helping organisations such as MIFQ to raise awareness of the funding that is still required to help those living with mental illness. The project involves restoring and developing the historic Victoria Park clubhouse at Herston into Fellowship House. This building will become the home of MIFQ, will provide a support base for people with mental illnesses, will be a venue for information, will provide support and education services for families and carers of people with mental illness, will be a base for a range of community services and will provide support for all regional MIFQ services. Given the critical nature of this issue and owing to the very valuable and important work that the Mental Illness Fellowship of Queensland does for the local community, I urge the government to approve this application. (Time expired) GM Holden Ltd",82
44,Mr CHAMPION,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to defend Holden's workers. There has been a lot of careless, uninformed talk by those opposite, by journalists and by pointyheaded economists, who have basically never made anything in their lives. Between them, they have never exported anything, never constructed anything and never made anything. Yet, in this House and outside, and in the broadsheets, they are getting stuck workers, who have only just done the decent thing to strike a wage deal that gives them three per cent per annum-no more than any of those on the other side would award themselves; a catch-up payment for sacrificing up to 60 per cent of their pay during the GFC to protect jobs; and payments linked to quality production and performance-productivity payments. What a shock! It is about time those opposite stopped laying into the national icon, Holden, and its workforce. It is about time they stopped undermining their excellent performance both in the Australian market and in the international marketplace. This is a great company. It deserves our respect and its workforce deserves our support. 150th Anniversary of Coopers Brewery  Opposition Business) (13:52): This year marks the 150th anniversary of the founding of Coopers Brewery. This milestone is especially significant because with the recent takeover of Foster's Group by the South African brewer SABMiller, Coopers has become the largest Australian owned brewery. According to figures recently published in Beer and Brewer, the only beer manufactured by an Australian owned company in the 15 highest selling Australian beers was Coopers Pale Ale, the only Australian beer in the top 10 premium beers was Coopers Sparkling Ale, and Coopers Mild Ale was one of two Australian beers in the top 10 midstrength beers. Coopers now occupies a proud position as the leading Australian owned brewery. Coopers is a very large and successful Australian owned and family business. It remains owned by the Cooper family. In fact, Glenn Cooper is its chairman and Tim into Cooper is its managing director-both of whom are sixth generation descendants of Thomas Cooper, the brewery's founder. The brewery was originally located in Norwood, but for most of its existence it was based in my electorate in Leabrook. It has now moved to Regency Park. Its operations incorporate a number of green initiatives, including using saline groundwater instead of mains water, extensive water and energy recycling and its own gas fired cogeneration plant. The company is also active in the South Australian community and has donated more than $1.3 million to worthy causes since it was founded. (Time expired) Parramatta Electorate: Our Lady of Lebanon College",83
45,Ms OWENS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last week, I had the pleasure of attending of Our Lady of Lebanon College in Harris Park to open a new hall and eight new learning centres that were funded by the federal government-through funding of just over $3 million. The college was founded by the Maronite Sisters of the Holy Family back in 1973 and since then it has been instilling in its students the values of education and hard work, which the sisters brought with them to Australia. The college is more than an educational institution; it is a community which promotes a sense of family among the sisters, staff, students, parents and friends. Under the guidance of principal Marlene Chedid, it emphasises the values of treating all with dignity, service, forgiveness and justice. The college has traditionally served the Maronite Catholic Lebanese Community; however its 1,200-strong student body also reflects the diversity of the broader Lebanese Australian community. It was a great launch and included a blessing from His Excellency Bishop Ad Abikaram of the Sydney Maronite diocese. It was very well MC-ed by the college captain, Daniel Azzi. There were also representatives from the architecture firm ThomsonAdsett and the building company Dyldam. The college is making a real difference by improving the learning environment of many students in my electorate. I wish them the best for the future. Graham, Mrs Elizabeth Mary",84
46,Mr ALEXANDER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise with sadness to inform the House of the passing of Elizabeth Mary Graham, known to all as Betsy, a former mayoress of Ryde council and legend of our local Liberal Party. Betsy was a registered general nurse and qualified in intensive care. She was a gifted clinical nurse, who demonstrated an absolute commitment to her profession and the development of those around her. More recently, Betsy undertook a Doctor of Nursing and I understand she is to be awarded this certificate posthumously. She certainly knew all the questions to ask her doctor as she battled cancer in the last few years. Betsy was fiercely proud of her Scottish heritage and her allegiance to the Monroe clan. She was passionate about music and led the choir at her local church each week. As an example of her passion, she even left them instructions for next Sunday's service! Betsy was an active grassroots political campaigner, often seen pushing her stroller full of leaflets around Eastwood, promoting Liberal candidates and values. She was a graceful lady who calmly and strongly accepted the difficulties of her last few years. Betsy Graham leaves behind Peter, her devoted husband and the former president of my Bennelong conference, their children Kate, John and Lizzie, and a party room full of grandchildren. Betsy, you may have passed; however, you will live in our memories with only good feelings. Flannery, Mr Denis James",84
47,Mr NEUMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Ipswich has lost one its favourite sons and Queensland's finest rugby league player, Denis Flannery. Denis James Flannery was an Australian rugby league footballer in the 1940s and fifties. Sadly, Denis passed away on Sunday at the age of 83. He was renowned for his sweet sidestep and swerve, and played on the right wing because he could step off the right foot. He attended school in Ipswich. Denis married Norma Dempsey, the daughter of the former great Kangaroo and Ipswich legend, Dan Dempsey. Denis and Norma own the famous Ulster Hotel in my electorate of Blair. Starting in 1948, Denis played 27 matches for Queensland and represented Australia in 13 test matches, two World Cup matches and 30 tour matches. On the 195253 Kangaroo tour, he scored 23 tries in 14 games, including hat-tricks Featherstone Rovers, Doncaster and Hull Kingston Rovers. He continued to represent Queensland and Australia, retiring from representative football after the 1956-57 Kangaroo tour. In 2008, Denis was chosen as a winger when the Queensland team of the century was named-a tremendous honour for a Queensland rugby league great. My thoughts and prayers are with Norma and her family, and the whole Ipswich community. He was beloved by Ipswich.",84
48,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being almost 2 pm, in accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Carbon Pricing",85
49,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that Alcoa warned the government last year that the carbon tax would impact on its economic viability, given that Alcoa has today shelved a $3 billion investment because of the carbon tax and given that the government's own modelling says that the carbon tax will reduce aluminium production by 61.7 per cent, why is the Prime Minister still in about the carbon tax destroying jobs in manufacturing industry?",85
50,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the Leader of the Opposition's question I say that every assertion he has made in that question is wrong, wrong and wrong. First of all, let us go to the announcement by Alcoa that its Wagerup investment is to be delayed. Let us see what Alcoa says and let us get the facts on the table, rather than the Leader of the Opposition's consistent misrepresentations. against Let us be very clear about this. Back in 2008, Alcoa delayed this investment due to the impact of the global financial crisis. Alcoa has said that, since a peak in 2011, aluminium prices have fallen by over 27 per cent worldwide. This morning an Alcoa spokesperson said that the Wagerup expansion would not be back on the agenda until the company secured a long-term competitive gas supply. The statement on the Alcoa website-the words of Alcoa, not the Leader of the Opposition's misrepresentation-says: Alcoa‘s Wagerup Refinery (Wagerup Unit 3) expansion plans are currently on hold because of the challenging economic environment and the need to secure energy supplies. So the misrepresentation engaged in by the Leader of the Opposition is once again calculated to spread false information to the Australian people. Not only is he content to come into this place and use workers as a football to kick around the chamber in pursuit of the opposition's political interests but now today he is making a misrepresentation to the whole nation about this investment. On the rest of the Leader of the Opposition's assertions, the question of the modelling I have answered before and no denial amount of re-asking it will change the Leader of the Opposition's misrepresentations as to the truth. Then there is Alcoa and Point Henry. I have dealt with this before in parliament. Once again, repeating a misrepresentation does not make it true. Alcoa has said very clearly that their current review: … has not been prompted by a future price on carbon. The present situation is the result of low metal prices, a high Australian dollar, and import costs. During the course of this week and every day the Leader of the Opposition has come into this place and misrepresented the situation of Alcoa. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that that is a shame. It is a shame he is treating workers with that calculated disrespect and today he is spreading that calculated disrespect to the rest of Australia. Private Health Insurance",85
51,Ms SMYTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on how the government's private health insurance rebate changes will help build a stronger and fairer health system for all Australians?,86
52,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. Earlier today the House of Representatives passed the government's changes to the private health insurance rebate and there is every reason to believe that these changes will pass through the Senate. These changes were first brought to the parliament in 2009. We sought to secure these changes then and took this plan to the 2010 election and said, as the government, that we wanted to work to change the private health insurance rebate in the interest of fairness and in the interest of sustainability. Today the House of Representatives has given a tick to fairness and a tick to sustainability. It is clearly unfair to ask lowincome Australians who cannot afford private health insurance themselves to subsidise the private health insurance of people who are many times better off than they are-clearly unfair. Mr Christensen interjecting",86
53,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Dawson will remain silent for the balance of the Prime Minister's answer.,86
54,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the proposition of the opposition that Australians who own so little that they cannot afford private health insurance for themselves should be subsidising the private health insurance of millionaires or billionaires. There is no surprise in that because the opposition have never seen a tax dollar they did not want to give to a billionaire if they possibly could. This is also about sustainability. We all know that health costs are growing. We are investing more and more in health and that is appropriate because Australians want to see more doctors, more nurses and more investment in public hospitals. They want to see better cancer treatment. They understand that with innovation and with the ageing",86
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will return to the question under consideration.,86
56,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much. I am talking about sustainability in the private health insurance rebate. They understand that with those health demands we have to wisely invest every health dollar, which is why engaging in this means-testing of the private health insurance rebate is appropriate and without these changes it is estimated that it will cost $100 billion over the next 40 years. I note today that the Leader of the Opposition has committed himself to reversing these changes, adding to his $70 billion black hole-$70 billion now and counting. Well it is not right by sustainability and it is not right by fairness. The one thing we know is that the Leader of the Opposition cannot possibly make that budget add up. Private Health Insurance",86
57,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister indicate where in the Prime Minister's election Press Club speech, where in the leaders debate, where in the campaign launch speech, where in the Prime Minister's election announcement or where in the ALP's official health policy documents from the 2010 election the government's plans for cutting the private health insurance rebate are outlined?",86
58,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I remind the member who asked the question that this parliament was dealing with these matters before the 2010 election campaign. There would not have been anyone aware of that parliamentary debate, which of course got a lot of publicity, who would not have known that it was the intention of the government to have a means test on private health insurance. The Leader of the Opposition is saying, 'Well, it did not get through the parliament.' That is true: it did not get through the Senate as it was then configured. This government brought its policy intention to the House of Representatives and to the Senate and made it very, very clear that that was the policy the government. I would say to the member opposite that during the election campaign",87
59,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: it was a very simple question. Where in the election campaign was the Prime Minister up-front with the Australian people about her intention to break a promise?",87
60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will address the substance of the question.,87
61,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,To the Leader of the Opposition's point of order: during the election campaign this government did something that the opposition did not. We filed our costings.,87
62,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,87
63,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition did not do that because they had at that stage an $11 billion black hole. They knew their figures could not add up, so they took their figures to an accountancy firm and they tried to say that that made it all add up. That accountancy firm has now been implicated in professional breaches. The one thing that they did not do is submit their costings to the Treasury, because they knew that they were engaged in the height of recklessness when it came to spending taxpayers' dollars. As a result",87

65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will resume her seat. Private Health Insurance Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:10): My question is to the Minister for Health. Will the minister update the House on the latest information about the state of the private health insurance industry? What does this mean for the government's reform of the health system to make it fairer for ordinary working Australians?,87
66,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I thank the member for of Petrie for her question. She is a member who is passionately committed to seeing better health services for people in her electorate. She knows every taxpayers' dollar we raise has to be spent in the best and most effective way. I welcome the passing through the House of Representatives of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and cognate bills this morning. The passing of this legislation comes as new figures released by the Private Health Insurance Administration Council show that more Australians are covered by private health insurance now than at any other time in the past 36 years.,87
67,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,87

70,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,88
71,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Minister, please pause. The House will return to minister will be heard in silence.",88
72,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. More than a million people have joined private health insurance since this government came to office. These new figures for last year show that the industry recorded a record profit of $461 million before tax for the December quarter and that the year's profit from December 2010 to December 2011 was a record $1.27 billion. The industry is strong and the industry is healthy and the industry will stay strong despite the scare campaign of those opposite. You would remember that the member for North Sydney said in 2008 that hundreds of thousands of people would drop out of private health insurance, when Labor took a decision that low-income earners should not be penalised for not having private health insurance. He said that hundreds of thousands would drop out. And what happened? 800,000 extra people have joined private health insurance since that time. He was wrong then and he is wrong now. This is a win for lowand middle-income earners. Mr Christensen interjecting",88
73,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It means that the bank teller on $50,000 a year will no longer subsidise the private health insurance",88
74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will pause. I have asked all honourable members to hear the minister in silence. The honourable member for Dawson will remove himself from the chamber under the provisions of standing order 94(a) for one hour. The member for Dawson then left the chamber.,88
75,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It means that the bank teller on $50,000 a year will no longer subsidise the private health insurance of the bank executive on $500,000 and the bank's order and the CEO on $5 million",88
76,Mr Laming,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What a load of rubbish!,88
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will pause. The honourable member for Bowman will also leave the chamber under the provisions of standing order 94(a). He is fortunate that I have not named him for defying the chair. The member for Bowman then left the chamber.,88
78,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This government is investing record amounts into our health system. That record investment needs to be targeted in a way that makes the biggest difference. The private health insurance rebate would have sucked up $100 billion over the next 40 years. The Leader of the Opposition says that he is going to restore that, when he can, as an article of faith of the opposition. Is it really an article of faith to spend the hard-earned tax dollars of ordinary Australians subsidising his private health insurance and mine, or is it an aspiration? (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",88
79,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to Qantas's statement that the carbon tax will cost it more than $110 million next financial year alone, more than doubling Qantas's tax bill. Given that both the United States and China have opposed carbon pricing on their national airlines, isn't the government's carbon tax only going to further disadvantage our national airline and put greater pressure on Australian jobs?",88
80,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In answer to the Leader of the National Party, let us just go through the facts, because whenever you go through the facts the opposition's scare campaign falls apart. Fact No. 1: Qantas will not face any carbon price on their international operations in Australia. They will face a carbon price on their domestic operations, that is true. The carbon price will have a very moderate impact on ticket prices. Both Qantas and Virgin put it at around $3 to $3.50 per seat per sector. That is what Qantas and Virgin actually have said. Of course, those price effects have been modelled into the anticipated increase of 0.7 per cent in CPI and, of course, Australians are receiving assistance: tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. There are tax cuts for people earning less than $80,000, with many of them to receive a tax cut of around $300. There will be family payment increases for many families caring for children. There will be pension increases that will more than compensate people for the anticipated price effect. This means that there will be households around Australia that come out better off. The fear for those households is twofold: the Leader of the Opposition's plan to rip out of their hands the tax cuts, family payments and pension increases",88
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister will return to the substance of the question, which related to Qantas.",89
82,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker, I will deal with that. But, number one, I do think it is important to talk about the rip-off that will happen for working families. Then, on price effects for things like Qantas, let us not forget that the opposition is committed to a costly, shambolic plan that will cost Australians far more. So, to the Leader of the National Party's question, once again what the opposition is trying to do is mislead the Australian people. NA The SPEAKER (14:17): I welcome to the gallery a parliamentary delegation from the German-Australian Parliamentary Friendship Group-an all-party delegationled by representative Herr Jurgen Herrmann. I welcome you to the parliament on behalf of all honourable members and I hope that you enjoy this visit to our country. Honourable members: Hear, Hear! NA Pacific Highway",89
83,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will you release a full schedule of works for the completion of the Pacific Highway now that your party has promised at two elections to complete the highway by 2016 and it will now appear in the four-year forward estimates in this year's May budget?,89
84,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:18): I thank the member for Lyne for his question and for his commitment to his constituents, and other constituents, who use the Pacific Highway. We already have committed some $4.1 billion to the Pacific Highway. More than 1,600 workers are today working on site building the Pacific Highway. This is vital for productivity. It has been identified by Infrastructure Australia as a priority, but it is also vital for safety. Over the last 20 years some 809 people have lost their lives on the Pacific Highway, which is 809 too many. That is why we on this side of the House are absolutely committed to fulfilling the duplication by 2016, which was first promised by the Howard government in 2004. They promised it but did not put any dollars into it. They contributed $1.3 billion over 12 years and during that time the state government committed $2.5 billion. At that time-when they were in government-they said the Pacific Highway was a state road. They called upon the New South Wales Labor government to do more. The member for Cowper, for example, said in this place: 'It is a state road. New South Wales refused to commit one extra dollar of state government funding to a road they are responsible for.' The state member for Coffs Harbour, Andrew Fraser, who has had a bit to say-inaccurately-in recent months about funding on the Pacific Highway, said this when he was part of the opposition: The Pacific Highway is a state road. I pay credit to the federal government for increasing the funding arrangement. I damn and condemn this state government. The state government should pour the money in.",89
85,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,90
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Riverina will be more restrained.,90
87,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But now, when in government, only yesterday Mr Fraser was saying in the New South Wales parliament that they cannot afford to pay their share. We on this side of the House say: let's end the politics with this issue. Let's have 50-50 funding to deliver on the Pacific Highway. Let's see the member for Cowper and the Leader of the National Party talk to their National Party colleagues in New South Wales and get them to deliver on what they say is their joint commitment to fully duplicate the highway by 2016. That is what is required. We need to do more. We accept that that is the case. But it can only be done in partnership with the New South Wales government. That is the way forward and it is the way to ensure that the full duplication can be completed.",90
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Lyne wishes to ask a supplementary question, which I think is the maiden supplementary question from the cross bench. I will listen to the supplementary and consider it.",90
89,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In light of your answer, Minister, and in light of articles in today's paper that an extra $7 billion is needed to fix the highway, and your reluctance in your answer to release a full works schedule, can you guarantee to the House, again, that 2016 remains the completion date, as agreed between the Commonwealth and the state.",90
90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport.,90
91,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:21): I thank the member for Lyne for his question, which goes to the heart of what is required. I wrote to the New South Wales roads minister last month and outlined a full schedule of works that makes it possible for the Pacific Highway to be fully duplicated by 2016. It included a plan for preconstruction and a plan for construction by 2016 of all of the remaining sections which are not duplicated. It is achievable. The New South Wales government say they are committed to it, we say we are committed to it and the opposition say they are committed to it in spite of their interjections. What we need to do is go about this in a bipartisan way, in a way that involves both tiers of government, in a way that does not say funding should be taken off one section of the road and put onto another, and in a way that ensures that the road is fully duplicated. I have written to the New South Wales government. They have the schedule. We are prepared to release the schedule, if you like, but I am waiting for the New South Wales government to get back to us to fulfil their obligations that they committed to prior to their election to Macquarie Street government. Certainly, this government is prepared to work very closely with all members up and down the highway. We have had constructive relationships with the New South Wales Deputy Premier, with the New South Wales roads minister and with you- (Time expired) Economy",90
92,Ms BIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline for the House the importance of sound fiscal management to support jobs and to return the budget to surplus?,91
93,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Cunningham for that question because sound fiscal management is more important than ever, particularly given the global uncertainty that we are seeing. We on this side of the House have got the big economic decisions right, because in the face of global uncertainty and a global recession we supported jobs, we supported small business and we avoided a recession in this country. While we have had some recent job losses, we should never lose sight of the fact that over 700,000 jobs have been created in this country over the past four years. But we are certainly not immune because we have seen something like $140 billion worth of revenue stripped from the budget. Those opposite pretend that somehow the global financial crisis and global recession were a hiccup. Well, it stripped $140 billion from our budget bottom line-a massive hit to the budget. The level of tax to GDP in the last year of the Howard government was 23.7 per cent of GDP-2½ percentage points higher than it is now. If we still had the same level of GDP as those opposite had in their last our revenues at the moment would be $20 billion higher in 2012-13 alone. So it has been a massive hit to our budget. That is why we are out there, coming back to surplus and conducting one of the most significant fiscal consolidations-that is, return to surplusseen in our history, because we understand with global uncertainty you have to be serious about your fiscal policy and send a message to international markets. That is not attainable by those opposite. We have seen the Three Stooges type farce of the last week from those opposite",91
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer was referring to three members of the opposition in an inappropriate way. He will withdraw.,91
95,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw, Mr Speaker. They have been running around promising spending but they have been saying no to structural savings. They support spending on the one hand, but when we put up sensible proposals-ones which can build the strength of our financial system and direct more dollars to the health system-they say no. They have claimed in this House today that we did not put it before the Australian people. It was there for everyone to see in the pre-election fiscal outlook, which they did spend a lot of time studying until the Treasury discovered there was an $11 billion black hole in their estimates. Those opposite do not care about coming back to surplus because they are not up to running a $1.4 trillion economy. A $70 billion hole-but the only thing that Larry over there was concerned about was that Curly was going to leak the $70 billion figure.",91
96,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,91
97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer has used a term which a colleague opposite found offensive. The Treasurer would immensely assist the House if he were to year of office withdraw that term.,91
98,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw, Mr Speaker. Member for Dobell  Opposition Business) (14:27): I refer the Prime Minister to the statement by Senator Evans in October last year that the only contact between the government and Fair Work Australia regarding the investigation into the member for Dobell was by email in August 2011. Given that it has been revealed in estimates today that other phone contact occurred between Fair Work Australia and the former minister's office, has she satisfied herself that this is the only contradiction between the statements of her ministers and the truth?",91
99,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I understand that in Senate estimates today some additional information has been provided by Fair Work Australia. I also understand that a statement has been provided by Fair Work Australia, which I think is very important. It comes from the General Manager, who directly deals with the opposition's oft repeated claims about political interference. It says very clearly she sees absolutely no reason to conclude that there has been any such interference in the investigations.  order: the question was not about political interference, it was about the contradictions and the statements of her ministers and the evidence that was adduced in estimates today.",92
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has barely commenced answering the question. I am sure the Prime Minister is determined to be directly relevant.,92
101,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am determined to be directly relevant, Mr Speaker. I have been asked about contacts between the government and Fair Work Australia. I have been asked about those contacts before as part of the opposition's campaign to suggest that there has been political interference in of the Fair Work Australia investigation. Consequently, I think it is directly relevant to point out that this opposition campaign came to a crashing halt today, when the General Manager of Fair Work Australia directly repudiated any suggestions of political interference in the Fair Work Australia investigation. From today it is clear, and should be clear to the opposition and all, that Fair Work Australia is doing what it is supposed to do-inquiring independentlyand that there is no need in the world for continued imputations and muckraking by the opposition. Economy",92
102,Mr LYONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, representing the Minister for Broadband, Communication and the Digital Economy. How are the government's legislative reforms modernising the economy and delivering a fairer deal for ordinary Australians and how that has the passage of these major reforms through the parliament been received?",92
103,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:31): I thank the member for Bass for his question. I am very proud of the work this government has achieved. I am particularly proud to have the honour of being the Leader of the House of Representatives. It is a challenge from time to time. We started off with what used to be 71 votes but is now, Mr Speaker, 72 votes in order to get legislation through the parliament. This morning we saw yet another seminal reform-the private health insurance reform to make the system fairer-blocked by those opposite since 2009. It has been in our budget papers since 2009; we have had two attempts to get it through the parliament previously. This morning we got it through the parliament, in spite of the absurd amendment put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, which was resoundingly defeated. The biggest vote this morning was against his amendment that it be put off until the next parliament. It is not surprising: 266 bills have passed this parliament compared with 108 in the first year of the Howard government where they had a clear majority. This parliament is functioning well; this parliament is able to engage with the crossbenches to ensure outcomes have occurred in the national interest. These reforms join the carbon price, the minerals resource rent tax, the structural separation of Telstra and the National Broadband Network. This legislation joins our budget, which went through faster than ever last year. These reforms together will transform the economy for the benefit of average Australians. In particular, I have presented more than a dozen bills relating to the National Broadband Network, which will transform the way that our economy is able to compete with our neighbours in the region. The NBN, which we expect will create some 18,000 jobs in construction alone, will transform the great tyranny of distance that has disadvantaged those people living regionally. Those opposite play a hypocritical double game. Member after member writes to Senator Conroy, or sometimes it is forwarded on to me as the minister representing him in this place, asking for the NBN in their electorate. Yet last week they were in here arguing against community service obligations for regional Australia. Those opposite just say no to everything that comes before this House. This government is determined to continue to push on with our positive agenda. Member for Dobell  Opposition Business) (14:34): My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that the Prime Minister indicated in her previous answer that it is proper to contact Fair Work Australia when previously she has said it was improper to do so, what is preventing her from contacting Fair Work Australia to ask them to resolve the unacceptable delay in the investigation of the member for Dobell, which is now in its fourth year?",92
104,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is certainly not in order for the Manager of Opposition Business to ask a question such as that which attempts to put words in the Prime Minister's mouth. That is clearly disorderly.",93
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the Prime Minister.,93
106,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member who asked the question, I say: I did not say that. The reason the member is probably confused is that day after day the opposition has been pursuing two completely logically inconsistent lines of attack in relation to this Fair Work matter. That is not surprising because when you are the kind of people who always say no and are negative about anything, why would you worry about consistency? Some days they come into this parliament, and they are in the media too, asserting: 'The government has made contact with Fair Work Australia. This is a conspiracy. We need to know all about this. This is about improper influence.' Some days they say that, but that line of attack came to a shuddering halt today, repudiated in Senate estimates. The General Manager of Fair Work Australia, having properly looked at the matter, stated clearly on the record that there has been no interference. So whenever the opposition says that in the future, people will know that they are trying deliberately to mislead.",93
107,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question was: what is preventing the Prime Minister from calling Fair Work Australia to ask why this investigation",94
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. When the Prime Minister's colleagues behind her are silent, I will say to the Prime Minister that she has the call. However, the Prime Minister should take note of the specifics of the question.",94
109,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I will do that. The reason the general manager of Fair Work Australia is in a position to say there has been no interference is that contacts between the government and Fair Work Australia have been about fact finding, as is now on the public record for all to see in Senate estimates. The opposition, in its completely logically inconsistent other line of attack, invited me to ring up Fair Work Australia and direct them to do something. That is wrong. Every day the opposition says that it should be done they are out there saying something that would be wrong in our democracy-the wrong thing to do, the result of shoddy thinking by and the shoddy standards of people who are obviously used to standing over others and bullying them to get their way. This government is behaving entirely properly in relation to this matter. I refer the parliament to the statement of the general manager of Fair Work Australia today, and I say to the member opposite: what pathetic muckraking this is.  Opposition Business) (14:38): Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question of the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister now reveal the nature and the content of all the communications between the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the current Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Prime Minister and her office in relation to the investigation into the member for Dobell?",94
110,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The supplementary question is out of order. Economy,94
111,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the importance of a strong and competitive,94
112,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.",94
113,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you taking a point of order on the member for Hindmarsh?,94
114,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am making a point of order on your ruling just a moment ago. It is surely legitimate, under the standing orders, for the Prime Minister to be questioned about has statements she has made to the House. Given the statements she has just made to the House about contacts between her office and ministers' offices and Fair Work Australia, I put it to you that it is contrary to all precedent for that question to be ruled out of order.",94
115,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One could take the view that as I have given the member for Hindmarsh the call we have moved on. But I will do the leader the courtesy of, firstly, pointing out that it is not a ruling, because supplementary questions are at the discretion of the Speaker, and, secondly, that supplementary questions are to arise out of the answer. It is my view that the of supplementary question sought to be asked by the honourable Manager of Opposition Business did not sufficiently arise out of the answer the Prime Minister gave. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has the call.",94
116,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will the Treasurer outline for the House the importance of a strong and competitive banking sector?,95
117,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Hindmarsh for what is a very important question. This government has worked every single day for a very strong and stable banking sector in this country. It why we took decisive action at the height of the global financial crisis. We did it for the country. We did it to secure the supply of credit. It is why we have introduced covered bonds into this House-to assist the banks with their long-term funding profile. My belief as Treasurer, and the belief of the government, is that the banking system should work for all Australians-for every customer, for every worker, for the shareholders, for the broader community and for the whole economy. We have heard the half-yearly profit of the Commonwealth Bank today: $3.7 billion. They have made that profit despite global volatility in financial markets. It shows that they are hugely profitable. That is why we on this side of the House are so committed to competition reforms, so that people who are unhappy with their bank can walk down the road and get a better deal. That is why we have put in place a range of comprehensive measures. One of those measures was to abolish mortgage exit fees. Mr Hockey interjecting",95
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will contain himself.,95
119,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That was ruled out by the shadow Treasurer. It was ruled out even quicker than Moe over here could say no. Their instant response to important competition reforms was to oppose themand oppose them they did, in this House.",95
120,Mr Randall,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Treasurer is a serial offender in not referring to members by their seats. I would ask you to get him to do so.",95
121,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will in future refer to honourable members by their seat or by their title and not by their name. The Treasurer continues to have the call.,95
122,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition ruled it out very quickly, as did is the shadow Treasurer. But we put in place a whole range of competition reforms, and they are delivering results. By the end of this year there will be one million households with mortgages that do not have mortgage exit fees-something that was opposed by those on the other side of the House, by their front-bench team. There are over 180,000 homeowners who have refinanced, more than $46 billion worth of home loans through 2011. That is something like 20 per cent. We have already seen the ME Bank, Credit Union of Australia and the Bank of Queensland out there offering competitive rates. We on this side of the House are absolutely determined to see greater competition in the banking system so that people who are unhappy with their financial institution can walk down the road and get a better deal. And when it comes to interest rates, those opposite and everyone else in this House should well remember that when they promised to keep interest rates at record lows they went up 10 times in a row. The cash rate is at 4.25. When they left office it was 6.75. Today, if you have a $300,000 mortgage it costs you $3,000 a year less than it did under the Liberals. Prime Minister Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:44): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to revelations on the ABC's The 7.30 Report last night that a series of text messages and phone calls occurred between Mr Hodges from her office and Ms Kim Sattler of Unions ACT in relation to the comments by the Leader of the Opposition on Australia Day. Has the Prime Minister viewed the text message exchanges between Mr Hodges and Ms Sattler?",95
123,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I have dealt with the matter involving Ms Sattler and Mr Hodges before and I stand by those statements. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:44): My supplementary question is to the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister has not viewed the text messages, how has she satisfied herself that the statement she made in relation to this matter on 28 Januarynamely, that the Leader of the Opposition's comments were relayed accurately-was true?",96
124,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I have dealt with this matter before. I have nothing to add. Economy,96
125,Mr MITCHELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, and the Minister for Industry and Innovation. Why is it important to maintain confidence in the economy and support Australian jobs across Australian industry? And are there any threats to this?",96
126,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation) (14:45): I would like to thank the member for MCEwen for his question. The fundamentals of our economy are very strong. It is important to maintain confidence in the face of the pressures from global forces. That is why it is very important that the increase in business confidence, reported in the latest NAB business survey, is very welcome. That confidence is based upon the fact that we have low unemployment, solid economic growth, a moderate inflationary environment and low public debt. Importantly, that confidence is reflected in massive business investment that will be coming into our economy this year and in years to come. According to ABS data, almost $150 billion of private investment this year is expected, with over $450 billion in the pipeline from the resources sector alone in coming years. All of this is very good news for jobs. One aspect of our economy that is perhaps less well understood is that performance of the economy in areas other than resources is also supporting jobs. For example, exports of services to China have grown at an annual rate of about 20 per cent over the last decade. In fact, China is Australia's biggest export market for services and it became so in 2009-10. Despite the big increases in coal exports and their prices over recent years, Australia in fact earned more from providing tourism, education and other services to China last year than it did from selling coal. That is something not well understood. It is evidence of the flexibility of the economy and the strength of the policymaking that has set the parameters right. But on the other side of politics we see constant talking down of the economy and an undermining of confidence. The opposition looks for any opportunity to undermine confidence and create uncertainty. We saw it here again in question time and we saw it earlier this morning, with the opposition claiming Alcoa's decision to delay a $3 billion expansion of their Western Australian alumina refinery was due to the carbon price. That is wrong. This dishonest claim was in tatters within hours. Alcoa have made it very clear that securing a gas supply was the principal driver of the delay in that project. Dishonest fear campaigns harm our economy and harm jobs. On this side we are building the foundations for a strong economic future, meeting the challenges and creating the opportunities for people, because that is what Labor does. Prime Minister Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:49): I refer the Prime Minister to Ms Kim Sattler's actual comments on Australia Day at the tent embassy protest, as revealed on the ABC's 7.30 Report last night, and I quote: They're both in at reception at the Lobby Restaurant, which is just up the corner, and Abbott's just made a statement to the press that the Tent Embassy should be pulled down. Given that the transcript of Ms Sattler's statement contradicts previous accounts upon which the Prime Minister has relied on in this House, will the Prime Minister now correct the record? Mr Albanese interjecting",96
127,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Whilst it was by way of interjection, I think the Leader of the House made a very good point. It is not for me to correct the record of something said by someone else when I was not there. I have dealt with this matter in the House. I have dealt with this matter outside the House and I refer the member asking the question and all members to those statements. I would also say",97
128,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I am not keeping a tally on the number of points of order that the Manager of Opposition Business asks; he is entitled to make this point of order and I am listening.

136,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the House has the advantage over me in so far as I did not hear the interjection. What I said to the member for Canning was that he would assist the chair and he would assist the standards of civility if he would withdraw.,97

145,Ms GRIERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Community Services, Indigenous Employment, Economic Development and the Status of Women. In light of the Prime Minister's release this morning of the Closing the Gap report, what progress is the government making in meeting its target of halving the employment gap for Indigenous Australians by 2018?",98
146,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Franklin-Minister for Community Services, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for the Status of Women) (14:55): I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. I know that she, like everybody in this place, is committed to closing the gap between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians. We want more Indigenous Australians to know the dignity and the benefits of work. That is why we are managing the economy to support jobs and that is why we are working to close the gap on Indigenous employment. Halving the gap on Indigenous employment means an additional 100,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in jobs by 2018. Despite the challenges, the current trends do indicate we are making gains. In the last 2½ years over 100,000 placements were made by Job Services Australia for Indigenous jobseekers into work and training. We have committed over $650 million in four years to the reformed Indigenous Employment Program. In 2½ years this program has achieved 71,000 placements, 33,000 into employment and 38,000 into training. We are seeing businesses stepping up to the plate more than ever with unprecedented demand for Indigenous employees. We are working with employers to translate this into real and sustainable jobs. The government is also working with the corporate sector through the Australian Employment Covenant. Already the covenant has secured over 60,000 commitments from employers and this has seen more than 7,000 Indigenous jobseekers start in these jobs. Through the Indigenous Employment Program the government has also provided significant funding to the covenant and to employers with their own programs. The Indigenous Employment Program is flexible and responsive to the needs of employers, to Indigenous Australians and also their communities. Opposition members: Boring.",98
147,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are also providing support to Indigenous businesses to support economic development. We are providing $3.7 million in funding for the Australian Indigenous Minority Supplier Council. The council seeks out contracts from the private and government sectors and matches them to Indigenous businesses to supply. Also this government has kicked off the Indigenous Youth Career Pathways Program-$50 million over four years to deliver 6,400 school-based traineeships, to provide one-on-one support for students to help them finish school while completing their traineeship. Our job as a government is to make sure we give all Australians the opportunities they need to do well in life. No-one should be left behind because of their gender, their background or even where they live. As the Prime Minister said in her speech earlier today, Indigenous employment has increased sharply in recent decades but we are continuing to work to ensure that we close the gap. Prime Minister  Opposition Business) (14:58): I have a question to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her revelation on the Four Corners program that she was unaware that her staff were drafting an acceptance speech two weeks before she ousted the former prime minister, to her insistence that she was unaware that a member of her staff have helped initiate a riot on Australia Day and to her apparent ignorance of the multiple contacts between her government and Fair Work Australia over the investigation into the member for Dobell. If the Prime Minister has been left in the dark about these matters, how can the Australian people have any confidence that she should hold the office of Prime Minister?",99
148,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I think it really does say everything about the mode of the opposition today that there was a chant of 'boring' from the opposition backbench when Minister Collins was speaking about closing the gap and employment prospects for Indigenous Australians. ,99

151,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Despite the relentless of negativity of the opposition, I and the government are focussed on the job of keeping the economy strong, of building a stronger economy for the future and of looking after working families. No amount of muckraking or trawling or irrelevancies will distract us from that path. The muckrakingMrs Bronwyn Bishop: Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

154,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. Although the microphone had been, quite rightly, turned off, the member for Mackellar continued, in her vitriol, to make a statement that was quite clearly unparliamentary. She should withdraw.",100
155,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Mackellar. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: I seek your guidance, Mr Speaker. If it is unacceptable to describe 'muck' as being relevant to the government of the day, why then is it all right for the Prime Minister to keep referring to 'muckraking'. I merely said, 'She is standing in that muck.'",100
156,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It all depends on the context. To use the word 'muck' in one way can be quite different from using it as part the word 'muckraking'. Quite often the chair must consider the context in which terms are used. The honourable member for Mackellar would assist the processes of the House if she would withdraw that term. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: Mr Speaker, I will withdraw but I am interested in the term 'muckraking' as distinct from 'standing in muck to rake it'. Would you also define that?",100

That investigation is proceeding-as verified by the General Manager of Fair Work Australia todayindependently and without political interference. End of that campaign by the opposition. Second, the opposition through their legal spokesperson wrote to the Australian Federal Police about matters associated with Australia Day, which they have raised in this parliament today. They wrote to the Australian Federal Police and as recently as last night, in Senate estimates, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police said that they were responding to that correspondence. What the opposition wanted is actually occurring. In those two circumstances, they have what they wanted-the Australian Federal Police and a Fair Work Australia independent investigation, verified today as proceeding without political interference. I ask the opposition: what is all of this about except the cheapest of political point scoring from an opposition that day after day is unable to come into this House and spell out an economic plan. It cannot come into this House and spell out plans for working families and it cannot come into this House of and spell out a budget that would have the vaguest hope of ever adding up.

161,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (15:04): I thank the member for Blair for his question and all the work he does for the families and pensioners in his electorate. It is the case that this government is doing everything we possibly can to make sure that jobs are created. We are managing the economy in the interests of jobs. On this side of the House we know that the most important thing for any child is to see mum or dad, or both, going out to work every day and bringing home a pay packet every week. Those 700,000 extra jobs that have been created by this Labor government have meant so much to those families and to the children in them. We also recognise that there are many pensioners who want to work and it is this Labor government that has introduced a new work bonus to support those pensioners on the age pension who want to work. Just today, we have introduced changes that will encourage people who are on the disability support pension to take on work or do more hours. It is this Labor government that has made sure that we do everything we can to help those households make ends meet, whether it is with the cost of child care by increasing the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent to help with out-of-pocket costs. It is this Labor government that has helped with the cost of teenagers. Those on the other side of the House seem to think that the cost of teenagers goes down when they hit 16. Of course, those on the other side are totally out of touch with the real life of working families and it is this government that has made sure that we have provided additional assistance to families of teenagers, increasing family tax benefits by up to $4,200 a year per child, to help those families with the cost of children and to make sure that those children are encouraged to stay on at school. What a contrast we see from those opposite. What is it that we know that this Leader of the Opposition can absolutely be guaranteed to do? We know there is one thing he can be guaranteed to do, and that is to give a tax cut to some of the Labor wealthiest people in Australia. The other thing he can be guaranteed to do is to claw back money from the pockets of pensioners and the pockets of families.",101

As a result of the legislation we have put into the parliament today, we expect around 4,000 disability support pensioners to take up work and nearly 4,000 others to increase their hours of work. We also know how important it has been for around 23,000 pensioners in Blair to get the additional benefits that this government has provided.

174,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister is not relevant and will resume her seat. Ms Gillard: Mr Speaker, under the new arrangements that is full time, so I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Prime Minister Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:12): I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Curtin from moving the following motion forthwith: That the Prime Minister explain to the House and to the Australian people why she should continue to hold the office of Prime Minister, an office she has debased in the manner in which she came to it, in her handling of the Craig Thomson affair, in the contradictions that riddle her explanation of the role her staff played in the Australia Day riot and in her deception of the Australian people before the 2010 election over the introduction of the carbon tax, gambling reform, means testing the private health insurance rebate and operating an open and transparent government. The office of Prime Minister comes with great responsibility, and the person who holds that office must have integrity, honesty, competence and good judgment. Standing orders must be suspended because this Prime Minister has so debased the highest office in the land, and her government is in such turmoil as a result, this motion must be debated. The Prime Minister lacks the fundamental qualities that a Prime Minister, the pinnacle of government, demands, and without integrity, without honesty, without competence and without good judgment in the Prime Minister this government cannot function. Standing orders must be suspended to debate this motion. Cabinet ministers are spending their evenings with Labor backbenchers counting numbers, tallying up the columns of names and not running the country. One of the great burdens that falls upon the shoulders of any Prime Minister is to be the custodian of our parliamentary system and to ensure that the bonds of trust between the parliament and the voting public are not broken. I can assure the member for Griffith that he has the vote of the Chief Government Whip. The Prime Minister has monumentally failed in that task, and that is why standing orders must be suspended. The Prime Minister betrayed the trust of the former Prime Minister when she was his deputy. The Prime Minister betrayed the trust of the member for Denison. But, most grievously, the Prime Minister has betrayed the trust of the Australian people. The conduct of this Prime Minister makes it clear that she has little regard for the truth and thus that she holds the Australian public in contempt. That is why standing orders must be suspended. There have been new revelations overnight about this Prime Minister's conduct which require standing orders to be suspended so we can debate my substantive motion. The Prime Minister cannot on the one hand express noble sentiments, such as those in her fine Closing the Gap address this morning, while presiding over a culture within her office so squalid that they saw fit to incite the Aboriginal tent embassy protesters on Australia Day, to attempt to use Aboriginal people in a tawdry, deceitful fashion.",102
175,Mr Albanese,MOTIONS,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: you made a ruling the other day that people actually had to speak to the suspension. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is speaking to the substance of the motion-a motion she has no chance of getting the numbers for.",103
176,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"I have been listening very carefully to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. While at times she almost seems to be leaving the substance of the motion, she does come back to why standing and sessional orders should be suspended. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will continue to address the motion before the chair. Ms JULIE BISHOP: Standing orders must be suspended because of the revelations overnight about the squalid culture in the Prime Minister's office, about how they sought to use Aboriginal people for tawdry, deceitful purposes. That sort of culture has no place in any public office, let alone the office of the Prime Minister. That is why standing orders must be suspended. To compound the error, this wretched series of events surrounding Australia Day, the Prime Minister gave a press conference-and that is the subject of the motion we propose to debate-to explain how and why this Aboriginal tent embassy protest came about. That public explanation by the Prime Minister now appears to be false. The Prime Minister was given the opportunity in question time today to correct the public record. The Prime Minister has relied in this House on the transcript of Ms Kim Sattler, but there is a contradiction between the transcript the Prime Minister relied upon and the actual words spoken by Ms Sattler. And the Prime Minister has refused to correct the record. That is why standing orders must be suspended-because this Prime Minister must explain to the House and to the Australian people why she has conducted herself in this way, so debasing the high office of Prime Minister. Take, for example, the fantasy the Prime Minister has invented about her conduct during the overthrow of the former Prime Minister. Standing orders should be suspended to debate the new revelations about that matter. This Prime Minister would have us believe that she was the reluctant candidate, drafted against her will into the challenge that she did not want to mount. This is important and it is why standing orders must be suspended-because the Australian people were deeply unsettled by the unprecedented removal of the former Prime Minister and they have been given no plausible explanation except naked, ruthless ambition. The problem for this Prime Minister is that her own colleagues and ministers are contradicting her version of events-a version of events invented by the Prime Minister and given to the public but which is the opposite of what actually happened. That is why cabinet ministers have been doing the numbers overnight. Standing orders must be suspended as there are fresh revelations reflecting on the the motion. Prime Minister which must be debated. Her office was drafting an acceptance speech for when she became Prime Minister at least two weeks prior to the challenge, yet the Prime Minister wants the public to believe that she knew nothing about the plot or the challenge that she was about to make. The US Secretary of State knew about the challenge two weeks before it occurred. The Australian ambassador in Washington was called into give assurances to the United States that there would be no destabilisation of the relationship when there was a change of leader.",103
177,Mr Slipper,MOTIONS,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will return to the substance of the motion. Ms JULIE BISHOP: This is a very serious allegation and that is why standing orders must be suspended-so that this issue of national security can be debated and so the Prime Minister can explain to the House how it is that she did not know her office was in fact drafting her acceptance speech. I wonder if they are now in there drafting her concession speech. The Prime Minister also said that she did not know that there was polling showing that she was the preferred Prime Minister over the then Prime Minister. Yet we now find from revelations overnight that the very person who was seeking to replace the former Prime Minister was personally campaigning and lobbying other members of her front-bench and backbench with that very same polling which was so damaging to the then Prime Minister and supportive of her campaign for the job. But the Australian people have been told that she did not have any recollection of these momentous events,104
178,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will return to the substance of Ms JULIE BISHOP: and that is why standing orders must be suspended-because the truth is slowly and painfully being revealed by the Prime Minister's own colleagues. It is becoming obvious to all that the Prime Minister was up to her eyeballs in the coup to remove the former Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister should simply come into this House and tell the truth. What was her role in the removal of the Prime Minister? Did she know about the polling? She was handing it around. Did she know about the speech? The ambassador in Washington knew and the US Secretary of State knew. We know that the member for Denison holds in his hands a signed contract with the Prime Minister, the contract which supported the formation of this minority government and allowed this Prime Minister to remain in office. That contract turned to dust with no apology for the monumental deception played upon the member for Denison-and that is why standing orders must be suspended. The Prime Minister led the member for Denison on for months. And then there was the most blatant betrayal of the Australian people-the promise that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. These events are themselves serious enough to warrant a suspension of standing orders, a condemnation and censure, but of equal or greater concern is that the Prime Minister believes it is proper conduct to seek to mislead the Australian people with her improbable, implausible, disingenuous, unbelievable explanations and excuses. The devious conduct and personal behaviour of this Prime Minister calls into question her fitness to hold office. (Time expired)",104
179,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Is the motion seconded?,105
180,Mr ANDREWS,MOTIONS," I second the motion. Standing orders should be suspended here and now because there is a death stench hanging over the Prime Minister of this nation. The standing orders should be suspended here and now because we have a Prime Minister who is evading question after question when she ought to have the courage to come into this place and face up and answer questions which are in the public interest and about the good government of this nation. That is why standing orders ought to be suspended. We have seen a progressive pattern of denial from this Prime Minister. For example, take the denial on Four Corners on Monday night, when she was asked whether she knew that a speech was being written by people in her office. A clear enough question: did she know that a speech was being written by people in her office. What was the answer? The answer from the Prime Minister on Four Corners on Monday night was: … I did not ask for a speech to be prepared … This is perfection of the non-denial denial. That is what we have from this Prime Minister. She got a direct question, 'Did she know something?' and she said: … I did not ask for a speech to be prepared … When she was pressed by the interviewer, Andrew Fowler, she said, 'That's the best answer I can give.' Anybody in Australia who has been following this debate knows that the reality is that we have the most evasive Prime Minister who has ever occupied that chair in this parliament. It is a disgrace to the office of Prime Minister that we have such a cowardly person in it and that is why standing orders need to be suspended. This is such a cowardly person that she will not come into this chamber and face up to the questions that are being legitimately asked about the administration of her office and therefore the good government of this country. When it comes to these issues about what actually occurred, there are only two possible explanations-and remember, this was the most important issue that was running that day. The first explanation is that before all this occurred it was totally hidden from the Prime Minister. It was the most important issue of the day. She was going to the Lobby restaurant, something that would occupy not only her advisers but her chief of staff and her communications director-her media advisers-and somehow all of those people in her office hid this from the Prime Minister. We know from what has been slowly forced out over the days since then is that these people knew about what was happening. Standing orders should be suspended because either all the senior people in the Prime Minister's office were out on a frolic of their own, totally unknown by the Prime Minister, or the Prime Minister actually knew what was going on. These are legitimate questions and that is why standing orders should be suspended. These are legitimate questions that should be answered in this parliament. They should be answered in front of the people of Australia who watch and listen to these proceedings in question time each day. Yet what do we have? Day after day, we see total evasion by the Prime Minister. Mr Albanese interjecting",105
181,Mr ANDREWS,MOTIONS,"The Leader of the House complains about another move to suspend standing orders. We would not have to do this if we had a government who had the courage to come in here and answer the questions. So do not give us this nonsense, leader of the opposition-Leader of the House, I mean. He maybe leader of the opposition one day, but we do not know about that. But what we do know is that this total evasion, which is going on day after day, is demeaning the office of Prime Minister. In this country we now have a Prime Minister whose credibility has been totally shredded not only over this issue but over the abandonment of the promise that she made to the member for Denison and a whole series of other issues. That is why standing orders should be suspended on this occasion: so that this Prime Minister can answer the questions that are being asked. If the government think that by running away from this, by evading it, the questions are not going to continue to be asked then they are sadly mistaken. These are legitimate questions that demand legitimate answers, rather than the cowardly behaviour and performance that we continue to have from this Prime Minister.",106
182,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:27): There is some irony in the Deputy Leader of the Opposition contributing to this debate given the content of her speech.

We also heard about loyalty from the Leader of the Opposition. Ask Peter Reith about loyalty from the Leader of the Opposition, who put in him in a ballot, asked him to run and then ratted on him in the ballot-on TV. And he has the hide to come in here and run lectures about loyalty. This suspension of standing orders is the 39th attempted suspension of standing orders from those opposite. That in itself tells you why we should not suspend standing orders. The suspension of standing orders or a censure resolution is a mechanism available under parliamentary procedures for serious issues on serious occasions, not to be used every single day, as those opposite do, because, quite frankly, they cannot get their act together to get a decent question time pack out of their tactics committee. We know that that is the case because their tactics committee is bigger than their front-bench, and we know that they have 32 on their front-bench because two of them are currently scrambling around hoping they will make the top 30, given the legislation put forward to provide salaries for 30 shadow ministers not the 32 under the Howard government legislation. What we have seen here today is a bid by the member for Menzies to make the top 30. What we have seen from the member for Mackellar is the raising of points of order to see if she can make the top 30. We know that those opposite have got an ambitious backbench. We know that the member for Higgins and the member for Mayo and all of the others are scrambling to get into that top 30-they are hanging on. It is extraordinary that we have had from those opposite a suggestion to suspend standing orders on matters that are erroneous. What we see from those opposite, day after day in debates on legislation, is an attempt to scare workers and their families. We know what the CEO of Alcoa has said about Point Henry and about the future of that plant. But there is no factory and there is no work site-particularly in Queanbeyan, for the member for Eden-Monaro-that the Leader of the Opposition is not prepared to go to and run a scare campaign. This parliament should be about serious issues. We had it this morning with the private health insurance legislation, this afternoon we will be debating the ABCC legislation and we have question time available to people. The most serious thing that has happened today was about righting a historic wrong: the Closing the Gap statement by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Both of them are sincerely committed to making a difference when it comes to Indigenous Australians, as is the parliament as a whole. But what we saw today after the Closing the Gap statement, when the member for Franklin was on her feet answering a question about Indigenous employment, was an ongoing chant from a senior member of the opposition of 'Boring!'",106
183,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The honourable member for Menzies, presumably on a point of order",107
184,Mr Andrews,MOTIONS,"Mr Speaker, I rise to draw your attention to the motion.",107
185,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Leader of the House will direct himself to the motion before the chair.,107
186,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"I am directing my remarks to the sorts of issues that we should be discussing in this parliament rather than moving these daily suspensions of standing orders. Question time is continually interrupted by those opposite to move suspensions of standing orders. We heard a question about the Maldives yesterday from the shadow minister for foreign affairs, who has moved this motion, attempting to make a joke of what is a very serious international issue. This is from the party that a few weeks ago were making jokes about the Costa Concordia disaster-they thought that was an appropriate comment to make on radio in Adelaide. That is the sort of moral standard that we get from those opposite.",107
187,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Leader of the House will resume his seat. I call on the honourable member for Cowper on a point of order.,107
188,Mr Hartsuyker,MOTIONS,"Mr Speaker, this is a motion for the suspension of standing orders and I would ask you to draw the speaker back to the topic.",107
189,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Leader of the House is referring to the motion. I think what he is talking about are the issues that the parliament should be talking about and which it could talk about if the motion for suspension of standing orders is not carried. The leader has the call.,107
190,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"There is a little green book called the House of Representatives Standing and Sessional Orders and there is a big book called the House of Representatives Practice. I suggest that just once some of their senior people have a look at them because I am perfectly relevant in talking about what this parliament should be discussing. Those opposite want to have a discussion about honesty and issues relating to the concerns they have which are all just about politics. You never hear from those opposite a concern about the economy, a genuine concern about jobs and employment, a genuine concern about fairness and equity, a genuine concern about the policy debates before the parliament. We saw it today with the passing of the private health insurance legislation. Those opposite now have to declare whether they will repeal that legislation and therefore add to their $70 billion black hole. My attention is drawn to an op-ed piece by the now Leader of the Opposition, who had this to say in the Australian on 24 July 2009: Opposition, by contrast, tends to be a permanent debating society because even the most final decisions can sometimes be revisited in office. There you have their principle in writingyou know you cannot trust him unless it is in writing-'Don't worry about anything that is said.'",108
191,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Leader of the House will return to the substance of the motion.,108
192,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"I certainly will, Mr Speaker, because these are the sorts of issues that we could be discussing in alternate circumstances. So far today, those opposite have made three attempts to shut me down in the debate. They had 10 minutes and they had five minutes but they cannot cop 10 minutes in reply. When it comes to a one-onone debate, anyone on this side versus anyone on that side, they lose. In any debate there is simply no substance from those opposite. We know that they choose to oppose no matter what issue is before us. They come in here and try to assassinate the Prime Minister's character. Their only policy position is to talk down the economy and to talk down Australia, except when they are overseas and then the Leader of the Opposition acknowledges that Australia is the envy of the world. We are not going to cop lectures from someone who is prepared to make jokes about the Italian cruise liner or from someone who was prepared to bag Bernie Banton, the asbestos campaigner, when he was on his death bed.",108
193,Mr Hartsuyker,MOTIONS,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This speech is irrelevant to the subject of the motion before the House.",108
194,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Leader of the House has the call and will be completely relevant in the 35 seconds he has left.,108
195,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Then there was the great comment about John Brogden when the Leader of the Opposition said, 'If we did that, we'd be as dead as the former Liberal leader's political prospects.' We are not going to cop lectures from those opposite, who have no morals, no political strategy and no economic policy for the nation. What we see in here",108
196,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Order! The Leader of the House will withdraw the statement that members opposite have no morals.,108
197,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"I withdraw, Mr Speaker. (Time expired)",108
198,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The question before the chair is that the motion for suspension of standing and sessional orders moved by the Hon. the Deputy Leader of the Opposition be agreed to.

NA Parliamentary Behaviour The SPEAKER (15:47): Would the member for Petrie resume her seat just for the moment. I ask the minister who is jacketless to leave the chamber-the minister will remain unnamed in Hansard. I ask honourable members to sit down or leave the chamber so that the due courtesies can be extended to the honourable member for Petrie, who has a question to me. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (15:48): Mr Speaker, my question to you relates to the appropriate use of iPads in this chamber. I should say that I have no objection with iPads being available in this chamber-they assist members in fulfilling their various duties as elected members. However, this morning when the Prime Minister was making a statement on the Closing The Gap report I was in the gallery with one of my schools. The school students asked me why a member was playing solitaire on their iPad in the chamber. I believe that type of contact and use of iPads is disorderly in this chamber. The SPEAKER (15:49): I advise the member for Petrie that while the playing of solitaire might not be a good use of time in the chamber, although some might say it is, it might not necessarily be a good thing for members to have people see them play solitaire. I do commend to the honourable member the contents of page 158 of House of Representatives Practice as it refers to use of computers. Essentially, text messaging is permitted and notebook computers may be used for emails. I probably do not think that playing solitaire is beyond the standing orders, but I do not think it is necessarily a good use of technology in the House of Representatives of the Australian parliament. People who do play solitaire are obviously judged by those who can see them playing it. I imagine also that the result of the game would be obvious to those watching. NA NA Carbon Pricing The SPEAKER (15:00): I have received letters from the honourable member for Dunkley and the honourable member for Fraser proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46, I have selected the matter which, in my opinion, is the more urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Dunkley, namely: The adverse impact of the carbon tax on the business sector I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",108
199,Mr BILSON,IMPORTANCE," The adverse impact of a carbon tax on the business sector is undoubtedly the most compelling issue facing employers and those who are worrying about their financial security and the broader health and well-being of the Australian economy. It was not enough for the Australian public's confidence in the democratic process to be assaulted by the Prime Minister with her the promise that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government' followed by her introduction of the very tax she had promised not to introduce. In addition to the damage to the public's confidence in the democratic process we are now seeing damage to the confidence of Australian consumers and damage to the Australian economy. I am sure we will hear from members opposite, who will say, 'Oh, there are the Libs and the Nats again talking about the business sector.' Mr Ian Macfarlane: And the LNP.",116
200,Mr BILSON,IMPORTANCE,"And the LNP. It is an interesting point to emphasise that the business sector is the one that is providing the bulk of the jobs in the Australian economy. If we are not interested in the health and welfare of the business sector, we are not interested in the livelihoods of Australian families and the security and prospects of Australian businesses. But that is why the carbon tax is such a crucial issue for that important part of our community. We are talking about the mums and dads who run small businesses and family enterprises. We are talking about the employees who give of their skills and talents day in and day out in a workplace where those organisations have the spectre of the world's largest carbon tax hanging over their heads, threatening their survival. It is interesting to remind those who are listening that this carbon tax is like no other carbon tax that any other economy is facing. This carbon tax will generate revenue some 18 times the amount that is raised in Europe. Eighteen times the amount of financial burden on our economy is being imposed by this Gillard Labor government's carbon tax. It is worth remembering that the population of Europe is some 22 times the size of the Australian population. Here we have a tax 18 times the size in terms of its burden, impact and harm on the Australian economy compared to Europe, and yet Europe has 22 times the number of people. Put simply, the Australian carbon tax amounts to $400 per capita-$400 for everyone in the Australian continent-whereas the European carbon tax amounts to $1 each. We have a 400 times greater impact on the Australian economy through this carbon tax than is faced over in Europe, and the government is trying to tell the Australian public, 'Don't worry. It's happening in Europe. Everything will be okay.' But we know the Australian public have no confidence in what the government says. There is much evidence to justify their suspicions about these kinds of assurances. Let us look at what people are actually doing. At the present time Australian households are saving 13 per cent of their disposable household income, where just 18 months ago it was negative one per cent. People were actually adding to their personal debt. Thirteen per cent of household income is being saved. It is being saved because people are concerned and anxious. They are not convinced by what the government says and there is evidence, argument, insight and concern being raised day after day by those who create wealth and opportunity in this country that this government just continues to ignore. While you see the coalition go on about hope, reward and opportunity, this government is about hardship, risk, redistribution of wealth and obfuscation on the impact of its actions. That is the contrast that the Australian public is seeing. You do not have to go back too far to see the research. Interestingly, in the lead-up to the Queensland election the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry surveyed 1,000 businesses in Queensland. Yesterday the Prime Minister tried to accuse the opposition of somehow creating and nurturing concern and anxiety. The message for the Prime Minister is that she has done plenty of that without any help from the opposition. Her government has created a great degree of uncertainty and concern about one particular issue, and that is the carbon tax. Have a look at the data: 94.6 per cent of businesses surveyed in Queensland are concerned about the carbon tax. That is an enormous proportion of those in the business community, not prompted or cajoled by the coalition but who of their own volition identified the carbon tax as a leading concern about their economic future, the vitality and viability of their businesses and the opportunity for them to succeed, to get ahead and to create job opportunities for those in their workforce. But that is not all. In fact, this polling calls on whoever is the next Queensland government to do all they can to take the fight to Canberra to see that this carbon tax is not introduced. They call it a 'tax trap'. They recognise that it will have an enormous detrimental impact on the Australian economy and also particularly on Queensland. It does not matter what region those survey results come from; it has carbon tax or higher energy costs as the biggest issue. It does not matter what sector of the economy those businesses come from. Again, their biggest concern is the carbon tax and increasing energy prices. The size of the business does not matter. This is still the biggest concern. This is why this survey report is calling on the government to scrap the implementation of the carbon tax, so that Queensland businesses have half a chance of finding their way through the murk, mist and smokescreen that is this government to try to forge a better future for themselves and their communities and to get ahead in this country. Also in that survey, 84.3 per cent of those surveyed are calling on whoever is the next state government in Queensland to urge the federal government to dump this dodgy tax. There is only one way that will happen and that is if there is an LNP result in Queensland because, as sure as night follows day, the state Labor Party will be in a headlock controlled by Canberra to make sure everyone is singing from the same hymn book. That singing ignores any of the messages coming from those people having to make big decisions about the future of our economy. We have seen it day after day and we all have felt the pain and the uncertainty about job losses in major employers, particularly in the energy intensive manufacturing area of our economy. We see that every day. Every day that is highly visible and we know the concerns of those people. I want to put on the table tonight something that is also happening every day but that is far less visible though still very raw in the Australian economy-and that is what is happening in the small business space. Small businesses and family enterprises are having to look at an employee who has been on their team or staff for years, knowing they have family and obligationsand they know this because they are a small business with a very personal relationship with and interest in the well-being of that person-and tell them that they do not have any more work for them, that they have to reduce their hours or that they have to wind back the opportunities for extra income from extra work. That is happening and it does not get attention. It does not get the attention that it deserves but it is happening right across the Australian continent. This is a very difficult environment that does not hit the headlines. The government come in with their own stories about what is happening with big employers with major layoffs. They do not even try to turn their minds to what is happening in terms of the atrophy in the economy of the small business and family enterprise sector-the 300,000 jobs that have been lost since this government was elected and the 14,500 fewer employees of small businesses we now have under Labor. The constant message is that the carbon tax is going to make the difficult economic situation even worse. There is a reason why the government does not want to talk about that-and that is because the government has airbrushed the experience and the impact of small business out of its policy-making process. This carbon tax is designed to offer no direct compensation to small businessnone whatsoever. While you have got all these carve-outs and compensation arrangements that will see this carbon tax actually cost the budget more than it is going to bring in, there is nothing in there for the small business community. They are told to suck it up. They are told to just absorb it or pass it on to their consumers. Does anyone know a consumer that is just itching for a price rise? Has everyone ignored the fact that there are cost-of-living pressures in every Australian household? Cost-of-living pressures in business are cost-of-input pressures, and the small business community are being told by this tawdry government: 'Suck up the impact or pass it on.' When there is an opportunity for Minister Combet to address this issue directly, he ridicules the concern. I have pointed out that 19 out of 20 businesses in Queensland are horrified about this carbon tax, but apparently it is 'She'll be right; don't worry.' It is like the political equivalent of a flesh wound-when all of these businesses are terrified about the impact. When Minister Combet spoke at the Press Club, he ridiculed the concerns of the small business community. He said: 'Oh, it's all overstated. There's nothing to be worried about.' He went on to say that the electricity costs will only be a microscopic increase. But no-one believes him, and there has been no modelling done on the impact on individual small businesses in terms of their type, their supply chain, the energy that they use, the energy that is embedded in their inputs and the ability of the business to absorb that additional cost. No analysis has been done on that whatsoever. Yet Minister Combet stood up before the Australian National Press Club and said to the small business community: 'Hey, you've got no reason to be worried.' He said: A dry cleaner is not competing against dry cleaners in China. What a genius contribution that is! He went on to say: Drivers cannot get their cars serviced in India. He was trying to make the clumsy point that, whilst the countries with which we compete in many markets might not have a carbon tax, you cannot take your car over to them. Mr Tony Smith: People won't get them serviced!",116
201,Mr BILSON,IMPORTANCE,"I thank my friend and colleague. What people will do is they will delay activity in those areas. You go and talk to any mechanic around Australia. Those scheduled services are not being done in quite the same way they were in the past. People are waiting till their car needs a repair before they go to the mechanic. You go and ask anybody who installs LPG, an investment that has a long-run benefit. But there is no need to do it right now-and people are simply not doing it. This government has created a hibernation climate for these small businesses, because the consumers they rely upon are anxious about their future, uncertain about the impact of a carbon tax and absolutely clear that you cannot trust the government about what they are saying the impact will be. So what does the dry-cleaner do? He does not get to see the customer quite so often. If people can put off that extra visit to the dry-cleaner, they will. If there is some other way-a hand wash perhaps, for a cardigan or a vest-they will use that, but they will not go to the drycleaners. This is happening right across our economy. This is why the small business community need a government that partners with them rather than punishes them. This is why we need the small business minister and ministers with responsibility for policies that have a profound impact on the viability and the future of small businesses to give a damn about what is happening in the small business community. They are copping it every which way from this government, and this is undermining employment in small businesses and it is undermining the very viability of those small businesses. You might hear the government say: 'We're going to give this little bit of help to this particular big industry.' Why? It is a big industry, it has got the ear of the big government, and the big unions are in there cheering for it. Well, we are here to reaffirm our support for the small businesses that are not organised into unions, that do not have the ear of this government. They can count on the coalition to partner with them in terms of their prosperity and their opportunities into the future. Let us have a look at what is actually playing out here. You will probably hear from those opposite: 'We've got all these compensation plans. It will all be just fine. It will all be peachy. Just ignore everything that is said by anybody who runs a business. Just ignore all of the analysis that's done. Ignore all the research and ignore all the impact work that's been done'-the research the government should have done but could not be bothered getting off its backside to do. You stand condemned for your indifference to the impact of your policies on the men and women in small business who are the backbone of our economy. They know what you know. They know that you do not care. They are not looking for you to do anything for them, because that would be the first time. What they are hoping for is a chance at their future, a chance not to get dagger in their heart of a carbon tax that is a ridiculously implemented proposition that is nothing like anything else that is going on in the world and that will have a very profound impact on small businesses and family enterprises. They cannot rock up to their suppliers and say: 'Hey, I'm a big business. If you want to keep working with me, you just go and absorb that cost.' They do not have that market power. They cannot go to their energy company and say: 'You want to put your prices up by 10 per cent? No, no. I don't think we'll cop that, because we're a big business.' They cannot do that. So often, small business are price takers. So often, what they can afford to charge depends on what the import alternative might be. So often, they are at the pointy end of that difficult conversation between a consumer and someone providing the goods and services who has to say: 'This will cost this much.' They have to look in the eyes of those anxious consumers, who are uncertain about the competence of this government and wary about having confidence in the economy when the government cannot seem to manage its own affairs, let alone those of the nation. They have to be there when the decision is made: 'Maybe I'll just put that off.' They cannot run off to somebody and say, 'Gee, business is a bit grim. Oh, well, we'll just work a little bit slower. There's always scope that the boss will throw in more money.' They are the boss. They are the last person to be paid. They are the ones who come in on the weekend, looking for those opportunities. They are the ones who turn up for this nation. They drive innovation in this country. They create wealth and opportunity, and this Gillard government does not give a hoot about them. I am interested to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change this and Energy Efficiency has got to say. He was at a business conference in the Isaacs electorate with SEMMA. He visited them and tried to explain the carbon tax. When someone explained the punishing impact of the carbon tax on their energy-intensive business, he just dismissed it: 'Oh, that's not much money. It might make you broke, but that's tough. That's a bad choice for the business.' This is a bad government. (Time expired)",119
202,Mr DREYFUS,IMPORTANCE,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:06): I am always happy to speak on a matter of public importance that raises the government's plan for a clean energy future, because it is such a good plan. It is important to talk about the opportunities that will become available to Australian business as the economy transforms. I know that the member for Dunkley is interested, which is why he is staying to hear some details of the government's clean energy future planAn opposition member: He's got nothing!",120
203,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, The member for Dunkley was heard in silence!,120
204,Mr DREYFUS,IMPORTANCE,"None of that would be apparent to anyone who was listening to the speech that we have just heard from the member for Dunkley because he did not actually go to any of the aspects of pricing carbon, any of the aspects of the actual Clean Energy Future plan. We have a plan which will cut pollution. It will drive investment in clean energy technologies and it will drive investment in infrastructure like solar, gas or wind. It will help build the clean energy future that future generations deserve. It will help our children and it will help our grandchildren. It is, of course, disappointing to have this important debate raised in the way that it has been, as-so we have heard from the member for Dunkley-a risk to the economy or as a risk to business. It is astounding to see the degree to which those on the other side of this chamber have wilfully perpetuated their own ignorance. They have deliberately ignored the benefits of the Clean Energy Future plan for what can only be described as reasons of base political expediency. It is shameful to see them engage in what can only be described as an all-out scare campaign for months and months and months, claiming that our policy will have a negative impact on the economy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Let me make this clear: our policy will help Australia take part in the global economy of the future. It will reduce our emissions and position Australia business for the development of the global low-carbon economy. It is not our policy that represents a grave risk to the Australian economy. Rather, it is the opportunistic, false and deliberately misleading campaign by those opposite-indeed, what I would describe as the grubbiest opposition in the history of Federation-that represents a risk to Australian business. It is a risk because it reduces business and consumer confidence. It is a risk because it undercuts certainty. what we have come to expect from this opposition: the talking down of the Australian economy. It is no wonder that some Australians at least are concerned about the pricing of carbon because of the way this opposition has misrepresented the government's plan, the way in which this opposition has represented the effects of pricing carbon and, indeed, the way this opposition continues to talk down the Australian economy. And, worse than this, it is the ongoing economic ineptitude of this opposition that, should they ever be elected to govern-and I hope that day never comes-which actually represents the biggest risk to the Australian economy and the biggest risk to Australian business. I say 'ongoing' because it has been for many, many months, going right back to the last election, that we have seen the economic ineptitude of this opposition demonstrated. I would go right back to an observation made by one of Australia's most respected journalists just after the last election. Writing in the Australian Financial Review on 3 September 2010, Laura Tingle said this: There are two possible explanations for how an opposition presenting itself as an alternative government could end up with an $11 billion hole in the cost of its election commitments. One is that they are liars, the other is that they are clunkheads. Actually, there is a third explanation: they are liars and clunkheads. But whatever the combination, they are not fit to govern. Nothing has changed since 3 September 2010. Nothing has changed since the opposition were caught out over the costings that they took to the Australian people at the time of the last election. They were caught out over an $11 billion hole in their costings produced by accountants who were later found to be guilty of professional misconduct. Nothing has changed except that they are now looking for cuts of $70 billion, It is not for cuts of $11 billion, and there is no explanation to the Australian people as to how they are going to produce those. Labor governments represent working families. We know that the best way to look after those working families is to manage the economy for jobs and growth. As a result of our stimulus during the global financial crisis-which those opposite opposedAustralia stands out around the industrialised world. We have low unemployment, we have solid growth, we have moderate inflation and we have massive business investment and low public debt. Our policy to move towards a clean energy future will not hurt the economy. Rather, it has been designed to ensure that we can continue to manage the economy in the interests of working families. Let me recap on what is at stake here and why the government must act on climate change and why we have put a price on carbon. There is clear consensus among climate scientists that climate change is and will have significant future impacts if action is taken to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. It is clearly in Australia's national interest to continue to work towards the international goal of limiting warming to below two degrees. To do this, it is imperative that we play a responsible role in international action and that we do so by taking strong action at home-which is something those opposite continually forget. That means we must actually reduce our emissions of carbon pollution into the atmosphere. Labor has a plan which is in line with expert opinion: a broadly based carbon price which directly creates incentives for businesses throughout the economy to reduce emissions and for all consumers to use energy more wisely. We are putting a price on carbon because we know this is the cheapest and most effective way to transition to a clean energy future. A low-carbon global economy is coming and it is up to us to decide whether we help Australian businesses to take advantage of this or simply bury our heads in the sand. The Clean Energy Future Plan is one of the most significant industry and innovation policies that this nation has ever seen. Over $15 billion will be invested in creating the jobs of tomorrow, most notably in manufacturing. Those opposite would have our industries stand still as our overseas competitors reduce their pollution intensity and get a head start in competing in the lowcarbon global economy. And because we are the Labor Party, a party that represents working people, we are making sure that lowand middle-income earners receive assistance as we make these changes. Our tax cuts and increased payments through benefits and pensions are targeted at those who need them most. Labor real will make sure that pensioners, lowand no middle-income earners and families doing it tough are looked after. The rest of the world is acting, and if one needs any demonstration of that one has only to look at the agreement reached to go forward that was made at Durban last year. So the rest of the world is acting and our economy and our environment will be badly damaged unless Australia acts too. You would have to say that all of those opposite in the Liberal Party are in some kind of alternative universe, where they have wilfully divorced themselves from reality. We know that many of those opposite like to pretend that climate change is not happening. It is a bit like how they like to pretend when they talk about the economy that the global financial crisis did not happen. Back to climate change, they ignore the facts and the overwhelming weight of evidence from the scientific community that climate change is happening. Those opposite have cobbled together a policy-their so called direct action policy-which they have no intention of ever pursuing, if they ever hold office. No-one should be fooled by this. This policy is not designed to reduce emissions; it is a policy that is only designed to give an appearance of action-just a figleaf appearance that the opposition do actually care about taking action on climate change. This so-called direct action plan-if you can call it a plan at all-involves the purchase of abatement of emissions at taxpayers' expense. It has been tried before and it has been found to be ineffective and very expensive. In fact, what the member for Dunkley should have faced up to when he spoke earlier was the analysis of the opposition's policies and its direct action plan by the department of climate change, which was provided in response to a question raised at Senate additional estimates, in February 2010. The analysis found that the plan would be unlikely to achieve more than 40 million tonnes of abatement in 2020, that it could not achieve the level of abatement at the costs claimed by the coalition and that an average cost of carbon of $50 per tonne in 2020 would be the minimum realistic average cost for such a program. That of course is well above the cost of the carbon price that the government has brought in. Families would be worse off under the plan that has been advanced by the opposition. You would have to pay $1,300 more in taxes and that money would be given by a coalition government straight to the big polluters. We have been debating this matter for years and it is time that the opposition put aside the mindless negativity that we have become accustomed to and let the rest of the country get on with it. I have very briefly advanced reasons regarding the hopelessness of the opposition's direct action plan. That was why John Howard-the leading light of the conservative political class in this countrythought that a direct action response was inadequate and why he went to the election in 2007 with an emissions trading plan. We need an explanation as to why it is that those opposite have abandoned the policies that their former Prime Minister, John Howard, took to the 2007 election. I just want to talk a little bit more about the absolutely shameful scare campaign that we are seeing from the opposition. We have had another instalment here today from the member for Dunkley. Australian consumers are already cautious in the wake of economic turmoil overseas. The last thing they need is the relentless, baseless and totally unprincipled scare campaign that is being run by those opposite at a time when global economic uncertainty is impacting on the savings of all Australians and when we have the Leader of the Opposition running around the country making patently false statements about the impact of the government's carbon price. We heard that the coal industry is doomed, only to read of record takeovers in the next day's newspapers. We note that there is investment of $80 billion in the coal industry in the pipeline, with 87 new mines either under construction or awaiting approval. We heard from the opposition that the steel industry will be wiped out, only to hear that the industry is comfortable with the government's Clean Energy Plan. We heard endless statements about 'unimaginable price impacts'-that is the sort of language that those opposite use-on businesses and consumers when, in reality, these impacts will be modest and when nine out of 10 households will receive assistance in the form of tax cuts or increased payments in pensions and benefits. Throughout this unprecedented scare campaign, the Leader of the Opposition has made it perfectly clear that he values his career over and above the well-being of those very Australians whom he claims to be fighting for. He has made it clear say and do anything to get a headline. It is not possible that he is so economically illiterate that he believes what he is saying. Perhaps it is. Just last week a report by the Australian National Audit Office was tabled in parliament. The complete lack of concern by the opposition about facts when it comes to climate change and the carbon price now stands exposed. Last July Mr Abbott wrote to the Auditor-General asserting-and then immediately told the newspapers about his assertions-that there were inaccuracies in the government's campaign. That assertion was accompanied by banner headlines, which asserted these supposed inaccuracies in the government's advertising campaign. Last week, the report tabled by the Australian National Audit Office, found that all of the factual statements in the government's 'clean energy advertising campaign were supported by the evidence. That means that the opposition leader has, once again, been caught out misleading the public, as we have grown accustomed to in this campaign on the carbon price. The report showed, in direct terms, with a line-by-line analysis of the advertising, that the opposition leader's complaints had no substance. It showed that the opposition leader stands totally discredited in relation to just about everything that he has said about the carbon price, because it showed that the facts are that the carbon price will apply to around 500 of the largest polluters, that more than half of the revenue will be used to provide households with tax cuts, increases in family payments and higher pensions and benefits and that nine out of 10 households will receive assistance. Those were the things that the Leader of the Opposition attacked, and they have been endorsed and verified by the Auditor-General in the report tabled last that he will week. (Time expired) Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (16:21): It does not please me to follow such a disappointingly woeful and sleep-inducing performance from a particularly unconvincing parliamentary secretary. He did talk about being divorced from reality. Let me inform the House of an example of what it means to be divorced from reality when we talk about the carbon tax. The member for Isaacs occasionally speaks to some of the manufacturers in his electorate-and he has got a lot of them. He factual attended a meeting last year where he was asked a question by an entrepreneur, a businessperson who invests in manufacturing and who at the moment is experiencing wafer-thin profit margins, if any at all. The member for Isaacs, who is at the table, turns his back, of course, like he turns his back on those hard working businesses and the people future' they employ in his own electorate. This businessperson said to the member for Isaacs, 'A carbon tax will increase my electricity bill and a carbon tax will make it very difficult for my business to be viable,' and he went on and explained that. What did the member for Isaacs-that great entrepreneur, with experience in running a business and putting all his money at risk to have a go in the free market-say? He said words to the effect of, 'Well, maybe you're in the wrong business.' So we have got a parliamentary secretary in the area of climate change and now industry-which is quite irrational-saying, 'We are going to impose all these additional government taxes and charges on you, including the carbon tax, and if you cannot be competitive because of those additional costs we have imposed upon you, well, you run a bad business model.' It is pathetic. That, my friend from Isaacs, is",121
205,Mr Dreyfus,IMPORTANCE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, this is a patently false account of what I said at a meeting not attended by the member for Indi, patently false",125
206,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"The parliamentary secretary will resume his seat. He has other opportunities for this in the House. I will caution the member for Indi to not continue to reflect upon another member. Mrs Mirabella: To assist any member interested in this particular matter, I do have the video available; I am getting it converted to be available on YouTube for everyone to see an accurate and correct reflection of events. The government espouses all these benefits of the carbon tax. It is such a ridiculous proposition. If the carbon tax good for the jobs of tomorrow, then why don't you double it? Then we will have even more jobs! That is how illogical this actually is. The government talks about compensation for industry. Well, you only provide compensation when you injure someone. This carbon tax is intended to injure business, is intended to injure industry. It is particularly heinous because what we have done in this parliament is pass a tax before the rest of the world has done so. It insane, absolutely insane, to penalise Australian businesses, to put extra lead in their saddlebags when they try to export overseas, competing against businesses that do not have the costs of a carbon tax imposed upon them. It is insane to penalise our businesses that compete with imported products, because those products are not exposed to a carbon tax. There is no other country that has a carbon tax of this nature, one that is intended to increase, to go up and up and up. This is why, fundamentally, the carbon tax is bad; it is disastrous for business, particularly in the manufacturing sphere, particularly for energy intensive businesses, because it goes to the heart of the competitiveness of those businesses. And there is no answer. As Graham Kraehe from BlueScope said, any compensation is 'like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound'. This is affecting all sorts of industries. The food and grocery manufacturers, who employ over 300,000 Australians, are labouring under extraordinary pressure. They have said that a carbon tax will be bad for Australian manufacturers. Kate Carnell, the recent Chief Executive of the Australian Food and Grocery Council, said: For Julia Gillard to say that food companies who aren‘t in the top 1000 emitters won‘t be affected by carbon tax is simply wrong. Further, she said: is so Products requiring the most energy to manufacture would see the biggest cost increases such as baked goods, dairy sugar and paper products like nappies. The Labor Party bleat and try to label us on this side as scaremongers because we merely oppose the carbon tax. Do they say the same thing about a whole list of industries and businesses who have condemned the carbon tax? Let us look at other trade exposed industries. We saw economic modelling showing that there would be a forced closure is of eight coal mines and that $22 billion of exports would be forgone. We have seen Treasury's own modelling of the carbon tax show that the aluminium industry would be cut by more than a half by 2050. We have seen the shelved expansion of the refinery in Western Australia and we have seen the situation in Geelong, where the car industry is also affected. We saw independent modelling regarding the impact of the carbon tax on the car industry-an extra $460 million over 10 years. If this carbon tax is so great, why are all these industries saying, in one way or another, that a carbon tax is going to make them less competitive and that a carbon tax will make a difficult situation much, much worse? There are some further words of wisdom from Graham Kraehe, a great Australian with over 40 years experience in manufacturing. I hear some members on the other side laughing. Well, colleagues on the other side of the House, you actually do need business people to run businesses, to employ people and to increase the living standards and the economy of this nation. He has asked a very simple question: why is the government prepared to sacrifice a key sector of the Australian economy by introducing a carbon tax on Australian manufacturers, with little impact on world CO2 generation? What is being proposed is a system that will tax Australian made goods but will give importers of those same goods a competitive advantage, with no comparable tax payable. It could not have been said more eloquently and concisely. We see this right across the board. We see the pressure on the furniture, cabinet and joinery makers, who employ 137,000 people. They say that a carbon tax will further erode our competitive position, with no real effect on climate change. We see an impact on the tourism industry of $731 million. The government claims, bleats, that the carbon tax is good for Australian businesses and is setting us up for the future, but it is setting us up for failure. is setting us up for more job losses, and they know it. That is why they are sneaking behind closed doors trying to keep certain businesses and industries sweet by saying, 'Look here, we'll throw you a bit more compensation money to make up for the injury we are causing you.' That is no way to run a government or an economy and it is no way to plan for the difficult economic months and years we have ahead. This government should stop listening to those lunatic greens and start listening to the people who make this country great: those businesses that employ great Australians.",125
207,Mr FITZGIBBON,IMPORTANCE," I think those last few words from the member for Indi said it all about her contribution-all bluster, filling us all with complete falsehoods. When you have no argument the typical approach is to start telling those fibs. It was a shocking speech. I have just come from a meeting-it is a busy time of the afternoon for the Chief Government Whip, but I wanted to speak on this matter of public importance for some very good reasons. One of those reasons concerns the nature of my electorate, which is well known to have a substantial coal mining industry, a substantial power generation industry and a substantial aluminium industry. This gives me the opportunity to correct some of the falsehoods being promoted largely by the member for Indi, but no doubt as well by the member for Dunkley. The amazing thing about this debate is the total absence of any capacity at all on the part of the opposition to deal with some of the realities. We heard lots about the carbon price mechanism. We heard lots about alleged impacts on businesses. But we heard nothing about climate change and the need for governments to act. It is worth reminding It ourselves that both the government and the opposition in this place have the same climate change policy. We are both committed to acting on climate change. Indeed, the opposition's carbon reduction targets are the same as those of the government. Yet I did not hear the member for Dunkley-I will stand corrected if needed-mention the opposition's policy at all. I certainly did not hear the member for Indi mention the opposition's policy. She blustered about the alleged impact on business but did not say anything about her own policy to reduce carbon emissions and the impact that might have on businesses. Direct Action will of course have an impact, just as our policy has impacts. But there are big differences. Their policy is to tax Australian families-more money-and use that money to fund carbon reduction programs within business, which will transfer wealth from families to big business to let them off the hook in terms of the efforts they must make to address climate change. I am challenging those on the other side who have not yet spoken but will make a contribution to this debate to start talking about their own policy, how it is gong to work and what impact it is going to have on Australian families. I will take it that, if of them gets up and talks about their policy this evening, they no longer have one. We will be able to have a real debate in this place about climate change and carbon reduction and whether they are not opposed to doing anything at all. We welcome that debate, because we believe the scientific evidence is in and that it is overwhelming. We are concerned about a whole range of issues in environmental terms, including the Pacific islands that will no longer exist once sea levels rise to certain levels. Let us have that debate. If they are still committed to reducing carbon pollution let them get up in this place and explain how they intend to achieve it. At least the member for Dunkley devoted some time to business, and small business in particular, and I welcome that because we have been combatants on these issues in the past. It surprised me, though, that he did not go to the core issue-that is, the environmental issues-because he has a history in this. I have a speech here from right back in 1999 in which he devoted quite a bit of time in this place to talking about the need to make small businesses more efficient and reduce their environmental impact. He also spoke about the initiatives his government was taking. He referred to dry cleaners in particular. I was reminded of his speech when he used it in his own address just this afternoon. I am disappointed that the member for Dunkley was previously so dedicated to helping businesses to reduce their pollution footprint, yet he has now thrown that out of the window. I think the dry cleaning industry would be very disappointed indeed. But let us think about these alleged impacts on business. Take two of the government's biggest policies and achievements in this place-the mining tax and the carbon price. It delivers small none business tax breaks-immediate write-offs of up to $5,000. They must be against this. It gives us infrastructure funding in the regions, where small businesses operate. You come to my region and you will know that one of the big issues for small business is basic community physical infrastructure, including road networks. It gives a company tax rate reduction. Is that not going to help big business? What about personal tax rates. What about the raising of the tax-free threshold. Is that not going to help people in unincorporated businesses, sole traders and partnerships? Are they not going to get a tax break? The estimated power price rise for a small business is about $5 a week. These same small businesses are getting multiple tax breaks. The member for Dunkley does not acknowledge any of this. They talk about the downside, as they see it, of this policy but they cannot be taken seriously if they are not prepared to talk about the upside, including the exemption of petrol from the scheme. We all know how important fuel costs are to both small and large businesses. You hear none of that from them. The big challenge for business in my electorate is the skills shortage. That is why we are investing literally billions of dollars in addressing that issue, productivity, placement programs, trades training centres, increased TAFE funding and the Education Investment Fund. These are all things they oppose over on that side of the chamber. When I was representing the small business constituency I used to have a little phrase that I would use on almost every occasion when addressing them. It was, 'The best three things a government can do for business, and small business in particular, is to grow the economy, keep interest rates low and get out of the way.' That is exactly what this government has been doing. We have been growing the economy in the face of a global recession. We are the envy of the world. What more would you want to do for business than that? Wouldn't they just love to have our economy in Europe? Interest rates are still at historical lows, and we are reducing red tape on small business in this country. The member for Indi again repeated these claims that we are losing jobs in the coal mining industry. If you came to my electorate and said that-and I would love to see the member for Indi do it-they would laugh at her. They know it is simply not true. We do know that there was some coal industry modelling which suggested that under the carbon price the industry might not grow in job terms as fast over the next decade as it might have otherwise. The opposition have misused that data and turned it into a job losses proposition. But before they say, 'Jobs will not grow as fast,' that good thing in mining regions because the businesses that the member for Dunkley and the member for Indi were talking about cannot get people to work in their businesses. So this is a rebalancing of the model. They would be laughed at if they came to the Hunter electorate and made that statement. I will quickly finish on something local through and close to my heart, and that is the aluminium industry. The aluminium industry is in trouble globally. Smelters right around the world are closing or are planning to close. Why is this happening? It is happening because aluminium prices are at record lows, particularly here in Australia because the Australian dollar is so high and input costs are rising. They would have you believe on the other side that they have got a solution to those problems. Of course they have not. And they would have you believe that it has something to do with the carbon price. Well we would be having a conversation about Hydro Aluminium in my electorate with or without a carbon price. Those on the other side understand that but they want to perpetrate this lie on the Australian community, including my own community, because they think there are votes in it. They would be better placed talking to the New South Wales government-their mates; and the member for Dunkley talked about state elections-about finally giving Hydro a decent electricity supply contract and the certainty that goes with it.

208,Mr CHRISTENSEN,IMPORTANCE," As much as the government would have us believe otherwise, the carbon tax will have an impact on business-it absolutely will. While it will be a negative impact on most, for others it will absolutely devastate them. There was a time when, despite all the noise that they make, the government actually accepted that there would be impacts. They is a once accepted that fact. I could go back to the grand architect, when the Labor Party paid Professor Ross Garnaut to do a report for them, and this was the forerunner of it. He said in that report: … imposing a carbon price in Australia ahead of similar carbon constraints in our trade competitorsMr Champion interjecting",128
209,Mr CHRISTENSEN,IMPORTANCE,"If you will be quiet mate you will learn something. He said that it could result: … could result in some movement of emissions intensive, trade-exposed industries from Australia to other countries that impose less of a carbon constraint. That is from the guy who came up with the policy for this government. But look, your Prime Minister actually admitted it-that is, your current one; she might not be that next week. She said, 'It has price impacts.' It is meant to have price impacts, that is the whole point. Remember that one-'price impacts'? There was a reason why she admitted that there would be impacts. The government had put out so much spin that the carbon tax would not hurt anyone that people were starting to ask the question: 'What is the point of it. Why are we having this thing if there is no impact?' You know, 'If you put a price on something, then people will use less of it'-another quote from the Prime Minister. This Prime Minister, this Labor Partythis Labor-Greens alliance, I should say, and the motley crew of Independents-think that by increasing the cost of electricity that is going to solve everything. Let us go through some of the impacts on jobs and the impacts on businesses that this carbon tax will have. We have had a lot of talk about Alcoa and the government is desperate to say that there are going to be no impacts on Alcoa. It is a shame that the last member who spoke, who has aluminium in his electorate, is not here to listen to this. Alcoa has shelved a $3 billion expansion of a refinery in WA. An Alcoa spokesman said that the company would not return to the project until it understood the full impact of the $23 a tonne carbon tax. I quote further from Alan Cransberg of Alcoa, who said: I don't think there's anybody in the world who's going to put billions of dollars into the ground without understanding what are the rules for an ETS or a carbon tax. You want to look further at Alcoa's statements. Its director of government relations, Tim MCAuliffe, spells it out for the government: Smelters use an enormous amount of power and the way the carbon pricing mechanism is structured, it assumes you will get carbon passthrough effectively at one tonne of carbon for every megawatt hour. You can't get power in Victoria at that intensity. I could go on to quote Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Jordan, who did an analysis of the Point Henry plant. He assumed that Point Henry operated at the average carbon intensity for Australian industry and he said the carbon price would add about $4 million to the smelter's costs in 2013. For all of the government's bleating and saying that they are going to help the workers at Alcoa and they are going to help the aluminium industry, they are not going to do anything of the sort. This was the plan all along. It is because of one thing: they are in bed with Bob Brown. Here was Bob Brown the other day saying: … this is an industry which I don't think has been investing wisely and the market does come into play, as indeed it is doing with the logging industry in Tasmania at the moment. This guy wants the aluminium industry shut down. The Greens have got a written agreement, a written alliance. He helped draft this carbon tax, the one that they have all signed up to. Let us go on to other parts of the aluminium industry. The Chairman of Rusal Australia, John Hannagan, said: Whatever anyone says about the carbon tax, it does have an impact. It does have a significant impact. The system being put in place for the carbon tax is really based on, I think, a very flawed assumption that our competitors are going to have similar or more aggressive carbon or energy policies attached to them. I could talk about Norsk Hydro with their plant at Kurri Kurri and reports that 2,000 of their jobs could disappear. That is in the member for Hunter's electorate, and he stood up here saying there would be no impact. The Chief Executive of the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers, Richard Reilly, said that continuing government help would be needed. But then he went on to say, 'We are going to be impacted by a carbon tax and our competitors overseas won't.' It is a bit of a case of Julia giveth but the carbon tax taketh away. There are jobs that are going to go in abattoirs around the region, and all of this was known from the start. I go back to what Professor Garnaut said: … imposing a carbon price in Australia ahead of similar constraints in our trade competitors … could result in some movement of emissionsintensive, trade-exposed industries from to other countries that impose less of a carbon constraint. Let us have a look at what other countries are doing. The Labor and Greens government are proposing $23 a tonne. The member for Herbert wants to see comparable schemes. In New Zealand the spot permits under its emissions-trading scheme actually rose by two per cent in the last fortnight to about A$6.38 a tonne. In Europe they are hoping for help this year because the prices have slumped to record lows. Guess how muchto $8.45 a tonne. The government was spruiking that China is now on board with carbon taxing, but it is putting in $1.59 a tonne. That is $1.59 compared with $23 a tonne. You guys have got to be kidding. Ross Garnaut, the government's own advisor, said that Australian industries would be destroyed if there was not comparable carbon pricing around the world. The chickens are coming home to roost. I could also talk about what small businesses are saying about this. Here is a document that over 70 chambers of commerce from Queensland have signed and sent to Julia Gillard on 21 June. It said: A carbon tax will flow through the economy affecting the price of all goods and services and increasing costs for all businesses including those without a direct carbon price liability. Trade exposed and small and medium-sized businesses have limited liability to pass these costs onto their customers and as such are at even greater risk of reduced business competiveness and viability. They begged the Prime Minister not to bring this in. I am particularly concerned, because Mackay is ground zero for the carbon tax. I have the mining industry in my electorate. I have the tourism industry in my electorate. I have agriculture, particularly sugar, in my electorate. All these industries will suffer under the carbon tax. Deloitte said that Mackay was going to be the hardest hit Australia region in the hardest hit state. The last speaker wanted to know what we were going to do. I will give the members opposite a tip, a titbit, a heads up. When the election is finally called the Leader of the Opposition is going to stand up and is going to say, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and the Australian people will believe him because we will mean it. We will remove the carbon tax that you introduced, that the Australian people are going to have to pay, that small business is going to have to suffer and that people are going to lose their jobs over. I say: shame, shame, shame to the government for bending over to the Greens and forcing this tax on the Australian people.",129
210,Mr RIPOLL,IMPORTANCE," Can I say: hooray for the opposition! After nearly 12 years of debate in this House, 35 parliamentary inquiries and countless, almost infinite, number of words spoken on climate change, I have changed my mind-I am convinced! I have just heard the convincing words that we do not need to change. In fact, not only am I convinced, but climate change has ceased-that is it! It is all done; it is said. Methinks climate change is fixed! The reality is that this MPI is just like every other MPI, every other bit of political claptrap that we have heard from the opposition. They come in here actually misleading people on what the facts are, on what they will do and on the impact of what we are trying to do, shirking their responsibilities in terms of the national interest and what is happening globally. Instead, they are interested in one thing, and we see it in here repeatedly, day after day: the political game, the political advantage. But, unfortunately for the opposition, you can play that game-you just have to introduce some facts. That has to be the bottom line for any debate: there at least has to be some facts you can underpin your argument with. You cannot come in here and not even make an argument but just read out other people's comments. There are plenty of other people's comments, but unfortunately they do not underpin the science, the facts or what this government is actually trying to do after more than 10 years of debate in this House, under consecutive governments, and 35 different parliamentary inquiries. I think the debate has been had, and I think we have actually passed the legislation. It is actually going to happen. Finally, there is a government with the courage to stand up and make it happen. And guess what? It is going to happen: we will take action, we will do something about climate change and about our competitive position in the world. Because if we do not do something, let me assure you there are 30 other countries doing something right now. You have a choice. You can either get with the program, get on board with what the rest of the world is doing, or end up in the ludicrous position that, for example, China find themselves in right now, where they refuse to pay the all carbon price for flying their aircraft into Europe or the United States because they are going to be slugged with a penalty as they do not have a carbon price system. So they are now in this ludicrous position of having to make a decision: do they no longer fly their aircraft into Europe or the United States because they do not want to pay the penalty? Do we really believe in Australia that we are going to do the same thing? I do not think so. What we are doing is really clear; it is really simple. The 500 largest companies in this country have for more than 100 years been allowed to pollute the environment, the air and our rivers. If anyone does not believe me, have a think about it: where would big industry always set up their factories? Next to a river. Why was that? Because that was the natural sewer; that was where you dumped all the chemicals, the rubbish-the whole lot. But then we woke up one day and we said: there is actually a cost to doing that-a cost to society, to the environment and to us individually. So smart governments over the years introduced laws that said you cannot just dump all of your pollutants and rubbish into the river. And guess what? Then we woke up to air pollution. We said, 'You can't just dump it all into the air, you can't just dump it all into the environment; you have to do something.' And the same principle applies here. The 500 biggest polluters are now going to have to do one of two things: either clean up what they are spewing into the environment or pay a penalty for doing so where maybe they cannot do that as effectively. So what we are going to do is put an incentive in place so that these polluters do not do that any longer. From the revenue that is raised from the carbon tax we are going to do two things, which are very simple again. First, we are going to compensate average families and households-nine out of 10 households in Australia will get some compensationbecause we understand that there is a cost and we are honest about it: because there is a cost, certain things will go up in price. But, let me tell you, it is a very small price. have been a lot of issues made about, for example, how much a kilo of meat, say rump steak, will be under a carbon price. There has been some really good work done on this. It equates to just 1or 2 cents. When we take into account the normal fluctuations in given prices between different shops and outlets, and inflation, it is not a big burden to pay. But we will compensate families. The other part of the revenue that comes from the carbon price will go to something that I think is just as important, if not more important-as it is going to be the job creator, the future generator of jobs in this country-because it is about productivity, it is about innovation, it is about competitiveness. And that is because we are going to invest in R&D. We are going to invest in the future. We are going to make sure that, unlike the last 30 years, the next 30 years are going to be about future industries. And you can do that at the same time that you support existing jobs. I think that is a lost on the opposition. For them it is black and white, all or nothing. On this side we can actually walk and chew gum at the same time. We can be in a position where we are planning for the future and also supporting existing jobs. If we are going to talk about existing jobs in the aluminium industry, let us be honest about what is happening in the aluminium industry. We may live on an island but we are not in isolation from the rest of the world. What happens in Australia is not just linked to domestic markets; it is linked to global markets. There is a curious fact. Countries that have already introduced carbon pricing, carbon taxes, on the most polluting industries-of which we all accept aluminium is one-for example, Germany, have seen their aluminium industry grow. It has grown in size, in profitability-it has There grown across the board. Why is that? Because the Germans understood that, if their economy was going to thrive and grow into the future, they needed to make the change, they needed to make the investments. There is one other little thing that really sets this off, and that is demand. There is a high demand for aluminium right across the planet. Unfortunately, Australia has two things working against us right now. First there is a high Australian dollar, at around 106/107 US cents, which is unfortunate for our exporters and for the aluminium industry. It is also unfortunate, as a matter of fact, that the price of aluminium has reduced sharply in recent years, which is putting a lot of pressure on our industry. So we have accepted all of those things and we are actually working with the industry. But, while I say all of that, you have to remember: this is before a carbon price comes in, this is before there is a carbon tax, bit this is before anything that the opposition is talking about has taken place. So we have already accepted the fact that there is some pain and some change-we have called them 'growing pains' in different sectors-but we are going to help and we are going to assist and we are going to do it through a number of packages. We are going to make sure we do not lose our manufacturing sector; that we do not lose our aluminium smelting sector; and that we support, underpin and invest in those jobs. And we have actually done something concrete about it-not just drafted a plan. We have actually put money on the table; we have passed legislation. What is curious, though, is that the other side talk about supporting jobs but they come in here and vote against jobs. They vote against the support packages. They vote against those workers, whom they are trying to frighten and scare-those families who are looking at their own industries and sectors and are unsure about where the future may take them. I would be unsure, too, if I continually heard on the radio members of the opposition, the shadow Treasurer and others, basically pooh-poohing their sector, carrying on like it is the end of the world and there will not be an aluminium smelting sector in Australia or any other manufacturing, when that is just not the case. This MPI is completely meaningless, except for the fact that it is a cheap political scoring exercise, because we have already passed all the legislation that needs to be passed. The opposition should now get on with the reality of life-start supporting industry, start supporting the legislation that we bring into this House that will actually support jobs, make sure that we have a strong and growth focused manufacturing sector by supporting the proposals that we are putting forward and make sure that they do not go out there and frighten industry and frighten workers. The opposition has made all sorts of baseless claims about jobs. I say baseless because there are no facts attached. They talk about jobs going because of the carbon price, but it has not come in yet. What is the cause of what is happening out in industry? I think it is pretty clear to everybody what it is. The coalition say they have a plan. I will be brief when listing their plan because it is not very complicated and it does very little. They call it the Direct Action Plan. It is really simple: they will directly charge consumers and every taxpayer $1,300 on average per household. That is the exact amount under the opposition's plan, which will cost around $13 billion in 2020. We are doing the opposite. We are saying that those who pollute ought to pay the price and those who will be impacted by it should be compensated. That is our plan. That is what we are going to do. That is what has been passed by the parliament and that is what will happen. People will be compensated for any extra costs they incur and it will mean that Australia will move on to a clean energy future, to jobs for the future and to industries for the future, industries that will survive under our plan.",131
211,Mr MCCORMACK,IMPORTANCE," Let me at the outset take issue with the member for Oxley, who talked about pointcompensation for the carbon tax. Why start talking about compensation if the carbon tax is such a good thing? The carbon tax is not going to do one thing for the environment. It is not going to decrease sea levels. It is not going to reduce global temperatures. If the carbon tax is such a good thing, why isn't every other country in the Western world doing it? The President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, did not make a commitment to a carbon tax when he came here. Why would he? America is in financial uncertainty at the moment. Europe is in meltdown. Carbon taxes are not on the radars or the agendas of those countries. The member for Oxley talked about the 500 biggest polluters that are going to be hit with a carbon tax. Labor denigrates the biggest polluters but they should be praising them because these so-called biggest polluters are in fact our biggest companies. They are producing things. They are making things. They are mining companies. They are abattoirs. They are doing a great job by making and producing things and moreover employing Australians, including many Australians in regional areas. It was only week that we had the representatives from the abattoir industry here talking with members of parliament. They are deeply concerned about a carbon tax that they know is going to cost jobs and production. If the abattoirs go over 25,000 tonnes of emissions, they are going to have to reduce that so that they come in under that level and do not have to pay a carbon tax. They can do that either by stopping work or by reducing their throughput. Why would an abattoir want to close its doors and lay people off? Why would an abattoir want to put less stock through when people are hungry? That is what is going to happen under a carbon tax. I know the carbon tax is going to hit Regional Express airlines, based at Wagga Wagga, very severely. The airline industry is already squeezed by low return rates and low profits and the carbon tax is going to be hit on Regional Express. Regional Express is a linkage for people in metropolitan areas to come to regional Australia. It is also a vital link for people in regional Australia to go to metropolitan areas for all sorts of things, many of which are related to business and also health issues. Unfortunately, we do not always have the health services and the specialists available in regional areas. These people need to be able to get on aeroplanes to go to Sydney, Melbourne and other areas to consult specialists and this is going to have a big impact on them through the additional price that they are going to have pay on their tickets. Perhaps less viable routes might even be looked at by Regional Express and other airlines. This is all due to the carbon tax or is certainly not helped by at the very least. The next election will be a referendum on the carbon tax. The last one should have been. It could have been if the Prime Minister, five days out from the election, had not said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a last government I lead.' Had the Prime Minister been truthful and said, 'Yes, I will contemplate putting in a carbon tax' or 'Yes, unequivocally there will be a carbon tax under a government I lead' then maybe the vote would have been different. But the Labor Party was elected with the help of the regional Independents, the sell-out Independents, and the one Green member of the House of Representatives and on 24 February last year the Prime Minister announced that her government would introduce a carbon tax. As she announced it the Greens leader, the quasi Prime Minister, Senator Bob Brown, stood there front and centre, taking all the glory and the kudos for the fact that a carbon tax would be introduced. Let me tell you that the Greens are no friends of business. Certainly the Greens are no friends of regional Australia. a big They have shown that time and again. The next election will be a vote on the carbon tax. The 72 members of parliament who betrayed their communities by voting for the carbon tax will be condemned at the next election. Earlier in this matter of public importance discussion the member for Hunter said that people in his electorate, the coalminers and aluminium smelter workers, would laugh at the member for Indi for the comments that she made and the fact that she said that there would be job losses as a result of the carbon tax. He said they would laugh. Certainly noto one is laughing who has a job at the moment but perhaps will not have a job under the carbon tax. They certainly will not be laughing at the member for Hunter. In fact, it they will be angry, just as people right across Australia are angry, that the Prime Minister went back on her word. They are angry that the Prime Minister's Labor people and the sell-out Independents and the Green voted in favour of a carbon tax that they were promised would not occur. The Prime Minister and the Labor government had no mandate for this legislation. Now it is in; unfortunately it is coming like a steam train, like a train wreck, on 1 July. The coalition will continue to fight this carbon tax. If elected, the coalition will repeal this carbon tax as the first order of business in the 44th Parliament. The opposition leader has said that. We have said time and again that we will repeal it, and we will. We will continue to fight the good fight against the carbon tax because we know in our heart of hearts that it is bad policy. Indeed, the member for Makin knows in his heart of hearts, and other members opposite know in their heart of hearts, that it is bad policy too. But to form government the Prime Minister has gone back on her word, as she has done in relation to the carbon tax and so many other things, including this morning the private health insurance rebate. She has gone back on her word and introduced things that she said unequivocally she would not introduce. If Labor attempts to block the scrapping of the carbon tax, we will go to a double dissolution election. That is on the record. Australians are already facing substantial cost-of-living pressures and the carbon tax will only have a very disadvantageous impact there. I know that in my own electorate of Riverina small businesses are very worried at the moment, not just because of the carbon tax but also because of the fact that water security is not there anymore. Fly over Griffith at the moment and, in contrast to a few short years ago, you see lush fields of green everywhere as the farmers are actively engaged in what they do best: food production. For the benefit of the House, farmers are people who till the soil to grow the food we eat. This year is the Australian Year of the Farmer. Farmers did not need a carbon tax to be foisted upon them in this their special year. It is an important year. Soon, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will announce its plan. This follows previous ill-informed and misguided attempts in the authority's guide and then in its draft. A farmer at Griffith has made sure anyone flying overhead sees what he thinks of the authority's efforts to date. Hanwood's Steve Graham has ploughed 'Jam the Plan' into his paddock in letters large enough to see from the air. He said it is important to remind people that Griffith is not going to back down and that a united front is needed to ensure that this vibrant regional community not only survives but thrives into the future. That is the case with all communities in regional Australia, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. I know that in your seat of Maranoa people do not want to just survive, they do not want to just hang on. They want to thrive. They deserve to thrive. They grow the food to feed this nation and to feed other nations as well. Mr Graham summed up the crux of the water issue when he said that people have a right to sell their water but that the thirdparty impact has locals worried. They are also worried about a carbon tax. And, as he added, the more water that is sold out of the area-out of any irrigation area-the higher the user fees faced by irrigators. The water issue is about food security, home-grown food availability, reasonable grocery costs and the sustaining of regional Australia. Grocery costs are going to go up and up under a carbon tax. Small businesses which are operating at the moment but which cannot compete with the big duopoly will see their costs go up and up. Their power costs are going to go up. Unfortunately, these days people are fighting cost-of-living pressures. They are extremely worried about the fact that they may not be able to fill their car as often as they used to. When those sorts of things happen parents stop taking their kids to sport and they stop taking their kids to the movies, and it has an impact upon the whole community. This carbon tax is not only going to have an impact on small business; it extends throughout the community and is going to have a huge impact on families. A bad water plan is not going to benefit the environment, and I and my Nationals colleagues will not in any way support any plan which will harm the people we represent. We certainly do not support a bad carbon tax. (Time expired)",133
212,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! The discussion has concluded. NA Syria and Iran,136
213,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," by leave-I last updated this House on the situation in Syria one week ago. I regret to inform the House that what is happening in Syria is a crisis continues to worsen, but international action is in fact strengthening. Latest developments The regime has been emboldened by lack of action by the United Nations Security Council. The attacks in Homs are ongoing. And a humanitarian crisis of tragic proportions is unfolding. On 12 February, at a session of the UN General Assembly convened to discuss the humanitarian situation in Syria, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said that tens of thousands had been arrested and 18,000 people are estimated to be held in arbitrary detention. The crisis has generated some 25,000 refugees, and 70,000 internally displaced persons, as I advised the House most recently. The HRC also went on to say: The failure of the Security Council to agree on firm collective action appears to have emboldened the Syrian government to plan an allout assault in an effort to crush resistance with overwhelming force. Furthermore, the HRC stated through its commissioner: I am particularly appalled by the ongoing violence in Homs. The High Commissioner for Refugees confirmed that deaths and injuries are rising but that keeping track of the numbers of fatalities had become 'almost impossible'. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said: It is deplorable that the regime has escalated violence in cities across the country, including using artillery and tank fire against innocent civilians. We stand with the Syrian people and we are looking for a peaceful resolution. It is impossible for the international community to stand by and watch this violence continue to unfold without appropriate action. Here in Australia, last week I called in the that Syrian Charge, Mr Jawdat Ali, to underline the Australian government's grave concerns about the worsening crisis in Syria and the ongoing bloodshed. I underlined that the Assad regime had lost its legitimacy fundamentally when it started deploying arms against its own people and that it was time for Assad to leave. I said this view was now virtually universal-as demonstrated not only by the UN Security Council vote, where 13 of the council's 15 members voted in support of the proposed resolution, but more importantly by the collective position of the Arab League itself. Evidence of violence, including the recent loss of life in Homs, is indisputable. It constitutes a growing tragedy. I told the chargé that the growing evidence of human rights abuses, possible war crimes and crimes against humanity, and torture and arbitrary detention was unacceptable to the international community. I told him that the message of the Australian government and people to the government of Syria was clear-Assad must find an exit strategy before the situation in Syria degenerates further and more lives are lost. The bloodshed must come to an end and there must be a peaceful, Syrian led political solution to this crisis. I also asked that the views of the government of Australia be conveyed directly to the Syrian government in Damascus, including to the foreign minister and to President Assad. Arab League The Arab League has been actively pursuing efforts to bring peace to Syria and to end the bloodshed-despite the lack of support on the part of some members of the UN Security Council. Members of the Arab League most recently met on 12 February in Cairo to discuss next steps. A resolution was adopted at this meeting:  calling for the UNSC to create a joint peacekeeping force for Syria;  calling for the UNSC to adopt a resolution providing for an immediate cease-fire in Syria, protection of civilians and overseeing a humanitarian effort for victims of the violence;  demanding that regime forces lift the siege on neighbourhoods and villages and pull troops and their heavy weapons back to their barracks;  calling for a halt to all diplomatic contact with Syria and for referring officials responsible for crimes against the Syrian people to international criminal tribunals;  agreeing to step up economic sanctions; and  agreeing to provide the Syrian opposition with financial and political support. I have signalled in the past, including in this place, Australia's strong support for the efforts of the Arab League. It has shown resolve and leadership to end the appalling bloodshed in Syria and to help lift the hand of oppression currently being held over the Syrian people by the Syrian regime. We owe it to the people of Syria and, through an act of solidarity with the Arab League, to likewise maintain our resolve and support as responsible members of the international community. Friends of Syria Last week I informed the House of Australia's prospective support for a possible international grouping of like-minded countries to gather in support of Syria. Since that time there has been progress. Australian embassies and high commissions around the world have been in contact with other countries conveying Australia's support for this important initiative. I am pleased to update the House that Tunisia now plans to host a Friends of Syria meeting on Friday, 24 February in its capital, Tunis. Australia plans to attend. The goals of this meeting are important:  galvanise and coordinate international support for the people of Syria;  encourage the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of Syria;  provide diplomatic support to the members of the Arab League;  increase pressure on certain members of the UN Security Council to take action; and  strengthen the voice of the international community for an end to this bloodshed. This I argue is fundamentally important given the failure of the UNSC to pass the most recent resolution before it. United Nations It remains to be seen how the UNSC decides to respond to the Arab League's call for help. The full membership of the UNSC must accept its responsibility to the people of Syria by listening to the unified voice of the world's Arab leaders. Russia and China need to reconsider their commitment to the Syrian people. Australia fully supports the UN General Assembly's efforts to bring forward a resolution on Syria this week. A General Assembly resolution has just been tabled by the government of Egypt, with the vote expected this week. Australia will cosponsor this resolution with the government of Egypt. It reflects the resolution rejected by the UNSC calling for the Syrian government to end violence and to abide by the Arab League peace plan. Further action in the UNSC remains a possibility. The Arab League secretary general, with whom I have spoken within the last week or so, has maintained the view that despite the pressure on Syria, such as through sanctions, a parallel political track must continue. But the time for Assad to act and to take his opportunity to seek a peaceful, political resolution is now. Australia was one of the first countries to call for the situation in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court. Assad has the chance now to take the initiative himself to stand aside to allow an orderly process of reform and to initiate a process of inclusive dialogue; otherwise, the implications for Assad personally are dire. Consular Throughout this crisis, since protests began in March 2011, the Australian government has been closely monitoring impacts for our consular obligations. Our travel advice has been simply 'Do no travel', our highest level since April 2001. We urge Australians in Syria to depart now by commercial means while it is still possible to do so. There are 110 Australians registered as being in Syria, although there could be up to 300 actually in the country at any one time. We have been in repeated contact with registered Australians to remind them of the travel advice, and to confirm their safety. Iran Elsewhere in the Middle East, a different emerging crisis is attracting the increasing attention and concern of the international community. Here I refer to Iran's nuclear ambitions and the grave threat that it poses to regional and international stability. This threat is unacceptable for the peace and stability of the international community. The Iranian regime has continued to defy both its IAEA obligations and numerous UNSC resolutions. The conclusions of the International Atomic Energy Agency in its November 2011 report are absolutely clear. We are deeply concerned by Iran's decision to begin enrichment to near 20 per cent at its underground facility at Fordow near Qom. This is contrary to Iran's obligations under multiple UNSC and IAEA resolutions-and it takes Iran closer to having the capacity to produce weapons-grade uranium. So this clearly adds to our concern, and that of the region, that Iran is undertaking nuclear weapons related activities. Australia stands side by side with our partners in Europe and the US in strengthening our sanctions to underline to Tehran the need to comply with its international obligations and return to the negotiating table. Iran must immediately address international concerns regarding its nuclear program, take steps required by UNSC and IAEA and engage constructively with the international community. These are concerns that we have directly and repeatedly outlined to the government of Iran. The ball is in Iran's court to demonstrate that its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes. Let us have a look at some examples of where Iran has not met its international obligations. Both the IAEA and UNSC require Iran to suspend enrichment activities. But Iran continues to enrich uranium at Natanz and has recently commenced enrichment at a new underground facility at Qom. The UNSC requires Iran to suspend heavy-water related activities. But Iran continues to build the Arak heavy-water reactor, which is ideally suited to produce plutonium. Both the IAEA and UNSC require Iran to ratify and implement fully a safeguards additional protocol within the IAEA. Iran has failed to do so. On 11 February President Ahmadinejad announced Iran would soon unveil new nuclear achievements, and insisted Iran would never give up its uranium enrichment process. We are deeply concerned about the risk of escalation and miscalculation through actions and rhetoric such as Iran's threats to close the Straits of Hormuz, and its conduct of military exercises. The IAEA requires Iran to fully cooperate with the IAEA in resolving issues associated with nuclear weapons related activities. But Iran continues to there are no such activities and to argue that activities not involving actual nuclear material are outside the mandate of the IAEA. International diplomatic efforts The international community, with strong support from the government of Australia, has been doing what it can to encourage Iran to return to the negotiating table, to comply with international obligations and to be fully transparent about its nuclear program. Talks with the P5+1 in Istanbul in January last year collapsed after Iran refused to discuss confidence-building measures unless, from their perspective, preconditions were met which the international community deemed to be unacceptable. The P5+1 said afterwards that the door to dialogue remained open. The choice remained in Iran's hands. Later, in July 2011, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, who was recently in Australia, put forward a step-by-step approach under which Iran could address questions about its nuclear program, and the international community could, as a result, ease sanctions. In October 2011, EU foreign policy head Catherine Ashton sent a letter to Iran, requesting a resumption of talks. Iran, so far, has not responded formally. Most recently, the press reported that, on 18 January 2012, Iranian foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi said Iran was ready to restart talks in Turkey with the P5+1; that is, the UN Security Council five nuclear weapon states plus Germany. These talks have not yet begun. Australian Government's response There has been a substantial strengthening of EU, US, Canadian and Australian targeted financial sanctions and sanctions on the energy and petrochemical sectors to increase pressure on Iran to comply with its claim international obligations. Australia has robust sanctions in place to underline to Iran the need to comply with relevant UNSC and IAEA resolutions. Australia's trade with Iran has declined steeply in recent years as a result of the sanctions that we have imposed. As I said in January, Australia will implement additional sanctions parallel to those announced by the EU on 23 January, including the oil embargo. The international community must give Iran a consistent message that its current refusal to comply with UNSC resolutions, and refusal to cooperate with the IAEA, is unacceptable. Australia remains committed to seeking a resolution of the Iran nuclear issue through diplomatic negotiation, and we urge Iran to follow through on its announced readiness to restart talks with the P5+1. While Iran continues to state it is prepared to participate in fresh talks, we are yet to see this lead to any meaningful substantive negotiations. The peace, security and stability of the region, and more broadly, depend on such negotiations being conducted and being concluded successfully. I will be conveying this message to Tehran through Australia's Ambassador to Iran. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Curtin to speak for 13½ minutes. Leave granted.",136
214,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Ms JI Bishop (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) speaking in reply to the ministerial statement period not exceeding 13½ minutes. Question agreed to. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (17:26): I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for facilitating, via this ministerial statement, this opportunity to speak again to the House on the issue of Syria and also Iran. Since speaking on this issue previously I have had the opportunity to meet with the Syrian charge in my office and to express to him directly the views of the coalition, as articulated in my response to the ministerial statement last week. The world is rightly aghast at the ongoing violence in Syria. Ongoing reports of indiscriminate killing of unarmed civilians, including women and children, are abhorrent. There is a solution to this crisis. President Assad can order his troops to stop shooting and shelling the Syrian people. He does not need a United Nations Security Council resolution or, indeed, a General Assembly resolution to end the violence. He can step aside and allow a civilian government to form. However, the situation may have approached or gone beyond the point where a negotiated settlement is possible, due to the ongoing brutality of the Assad regime as it seeks to cling to power. There has been a serious escalation of the conflict in recent days, with the bombing of security compounds in the city of Aleppo and reports of 28 people killed. In the fog of this war the Assad regime has claimed the blasts were the work of so-called opposition terrorists, while opposition groups blame the regime itself. There have been further reports suggesting that al-Qaeda played a role in the attacks, although the truth may never be known. In addition, a senior military officer within the regime were shot dead outside his Damascus for a residence over the weekend, in a major breakdown of security within the regime's stronghold. This must have sent shock waves through an already volatile regime. Given the dire situation facing Syria, it is deeply troubling that Syria's al-Assad regime has 'categorically rejected' a resolution of the Arab League which would have allowed for the deployment of a peacekeeping mission to end the cycle of violence in the country. After voting with China to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution on Syria, Russia has once again undermined international efforts to put pressure on the regime. The European Union nations supported the Arab League plan, while Russia is reportedly of the view that peacekeepers should only be deployed after the violence has stopped. The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, has reportedly made the claim that the main stumbling blocks to a ceasefire are the opposition groups in Syria, which he claims are out of control. While peacekeepers would generally only be deployed after a ceasefire has been brokered, this would arguably be much easier to achieve if there were a united effort to isolate the regime. This would require Russia and, in particular, Iran to halt all forms of support and supplies of arms. The Arab League has continued to show commendable leadership on this issue with its decision to suspend economic links with the Syrian regime. The fact that the regime fears a ceasefire appears to be indicative of its weakness, in that it fears any lessening of pressure on the Syrian people. This could confirm the assessment of Syrian military defector General Mustafa Ahmad al-Sheikh, who has claimed that the regime is close to collapse and has said: The situation is now very dangerous and threatens to explode across the whole region, like a reaction. China has continued to take a conciliatory line, with foreign ministry representative Liu Weimin reportedly saying: China hopes all relevant parties can keep and communication to play a positive and constructive role in politically resolving the Syrian issue and easing the country's tension. United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague has also expressed concern about the deployment of Western forces to Syria, but did not rule out supporting a peacekeeping mission involving Arab League nations. He said: I don't see the way forward in Syria as being Western boots on the ground, in any form, including in peacekeeping form, but of course if such a concept could be made viable we will be supporting it in all the usual ways. While Russia has played the highly questionable role of spoiler in many efforts to achieve peace, the actions of Iran are more disturbing, with reports that hundreds of elite troops are on the ground in Syria. There is no way to know precisely whether these forces are directly involved in the crackdown on civilians, however it is safe to assume that they are providing logistical support at the very least. One thing is certain and that is that these forces are not working to bring peace to the nation and are acting in support of a regime that has lost all legitimacy to rule. These Iranian forces must be immediately withdrawn from Syria. Similarly, Russia must halt all arms sales and any other forms of economic cooperation with the regime. One complicating factor in recent days has been the attempted intervention of al-Qaeda, whose leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has released a video message in support of the uprising. The motivation of al-Qaeda is not clear, but we can safely assume it is not in nuclear support of the eventual formation of a democratic civilian government. It may be that al-Qaeda merely sees the opportunity to sow the seeds of chaos in the hope that it spreads beyond the borders of Syria and dialogue leads to an environment of greater lawlessness within which al-Qaeda can flourish. The solution to this violence is in the bloodied hands of President Assad, who must call a halt to the attacks and allow for the formation of a civilian government. In recent days, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, has described the situation in Syria as 'deplorable' and said the government had failed in one of its primary obligations, which is to protect its own people. The commissioner said: I am very distressed that the continued ruthless repression and deliberate stirring of sectarian tensions might soon plunge Syria into civil war. The longer the international community fails to take action, the more the civilian population will suffer from countless atrocities. While the situation in Syria adds to regional instability, Iran has been accused overnight of being behind attempted killings of Israeli diplomats in the Indian city of New Delhi and the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi. If true, this represents a serious escalation of the tensions between Iran and Israel. Israel has publicly accused Iran of orchestrating the attacks either through its proxy Hezbollah or directly through its own agents. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is reportedly of the view: Iran is behind these attacks. It is the exporter of terror in the world. Minister of Foreign Affairs Lieberman said overnight that Israel will not tolerate such attacks on its diplomats. While US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has condemned the attacks, the United States has not yet, at the time of speaking, identified Iran as the suspected culprit. Iran has denied any involvement. The attack in New Delhi has left a 42-yearold female diplomat in a critical condition and reportedly involved the attachment of a magnetic bomb to the outside of her vehicle. The attack in Georgia failed when the bomb was detected on the car before it detonated and was defused. The use of a magnetic bomb appears to be direct payback for the reported use of similar devices to assassinate Iranian scientists working on Iran's nuclear program. Tensions are rising rapidly in response to Iran's nuclear program as well as suspicions that it will lead to the development of a nuclear weapon. United States Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta recently said that he believed Israel would attack Iran, possibly within a couple of months. For Israelis, this is a question of their very survival, with the Iranian leadership regularly talking about wiping Israel off the map and worse. Iran's defence strategy has been to try and convince the United States and Israel that an attack would cost more than either nation is prepared to pay. The key issue at present is the threat that Iran will close the Strait of Hormuz to traffic for oil tankers, which would have serious implications for the global economy, with about one-third of seaborne traded oil passing through the strait. There are questions about Iran's ability to close the strait for any significant length of time, particularly with the United States Fifth Fleet based in the Persian Gulf at Bahrain. biggest However, Iran claims to have large stockpiles of shipping mines and has developed a range of missiles that could be used against shipping traffic. Iran has conducted extensive naval exercises in the Persian Gulf to showcase its fleet of smaller fast boats equipped with torpedoes that could be used to threaten the larger US warships. While Iran would lack the ability to sustain open conflict against the United States for any length of time, there are fears that it has the capability to severely disrupt global oil supplies at a time when the world economy is particularly fragile. During recent discussions I have had with a number of international experts on strategic issues, concern was raised with me about the potential for an Israeli air strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. The concern was described as 'stepping onto the ladder of escalation' that could yield unpredictable results. The solution to these growing tensions lies with the government of Iran. It must comply with all requests of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which last November called for a progress report on compliance by next month. The IAEA board of governors also agreed to a resolution titled 'Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement and relevant provisions of the UN Security Council Resolutions in the Islamic Republic of Iran'. This resolution called on Iran to comply with all its obligations to the IAEA and to the conditions imposed by United Nations Security Council resolutions. While the IAEA board of governors continues to support a diplomatic solution to the problem of Iran's non-compliance, it is clear from the statements of Secretary Panetta that the United States believes the time is fast approaching when Israel may decide to launch a strike against Iran. The situation has not been helped by Iranian President Ahmadinejad, who said this week that he would be announcing further nuclear developments in coming days and weeks. That makes the issue of Iran's compliance critical to not only Iran and Israel but also the rest of the world. The coalition joins with the government in urging the Iranian leadership to meet all its obligations. It is imperative that Iran prove that its nuclear activities are only for peaceful and civilian purposes. That will require it to be open and transparent with IAEA inspectors to ensure it can adequately explain all its nuclear activities. Australia has continued to play its role with the international community to bring pressure to bear on the Iranian regime. A range of sanctions have been imposed since 2006, consistent with the requirements of the United Nations Security Council, but a range of autonomous sanctions have also been imposed. A comprehensive range of sanctions relate to arms sales, financial transactions, dealings with certain Iranian companies, travel bans and more. Iran's typical response has been belligerence, with threats to close the Strait of Hormuz and threats against Israel. The international community is motivated by the urgent need to find a peaceful resolution to this brewing crisis. The implications of military conflict are too terrible to contemplate and it is important that the international community continues to be united in its condemnation of Iran's provocative behaviour and united in efforts to ensure that Iran complies with their international obligations. NA Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",140
215,Ms MARINO,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. In spite of its title, this bill is not aimed at achieving sound reform, jobs growth or productivity improvements in an industry that is extremely important not only in my electorate of Forrest but right around the nation. The coalition are proud to support Australians who have a go, who take a risk, who invest and who employ people in small, medium and larger businesses. We believe that every Australian, whether an employer or an employee, deserves to be able go to their workplace and operate in a safe and lawful environment. However, in direct contrast, the Labor government, as indicated by this bill, does not believe that Australian business owners should have the right to run their own businesses. I suppose that is not really surprising. One only has to examine the power structure of the Labor Party to see who pulls the strings. When the current Prime Minister arbitrarily axed the previous Prime Minister, current union leaders boasted about their role in that axing. This is a very long way, unfortunately, from the historical union representation that has a long and originally proud history in this country of raising the standards for Australian workers. But this proud history has been corrupted by the politics of union leaders and Labor Party ambition. What started as a great push for workers' rights two centuries ago has become a fight for leftwing factional power and a platform for political rather than social ambition. That is the sad inheritance of the modern Labor Party and one of the main reasons that the union membership has plummeted in recent times. According to figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the proportion of employees who were trade union members in their main job decreased from 20 per cent in August 2009 to 18 per cent in August 2010. This represents a fall of 47,300. For the majority of the 20th century, however, at least 40 per cent of workers were covered by unions and some 20 years ago the figure was one in every two workers. However, instead of looking after the interests of those workers, a number of unions have been looking after an wing level of union leaders and their political ambitions. Of course, not all unions have gone down this path and a number remain that genuinely have the interests of their members at heart. An example is the police union in my home state of Western Australia, which has a long history of member advocacy as its primary goal. Sadly, for some unions, this is no longer the case. As we look into history, the building industry specifically deserves very careful attention. I refer to the BLF, the Builders Labourers Federation. It took a royal commission to expose what this front-line union had become. The Winneke royal commission identified major problems with the actions of the BLF and as a result it was deregistered by the Hawke Labor government in 1986-this was a Labor government and a Labor leader deregistering the BLF. Members might think that, following the Winneke royal commission and the deregistration of the BLF in 1986, the construction sector unions would have altered their practices and the union would return to the role of looking after building workers in an open, honest and accountable manner. But how wrong those members would be. The 2003 building industry royal commission, conducted by the Hon. THR Cole, found that despite a corrupt history no lessons had been learned and no change was in evidence. The Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, 2001-03, was established by the Australian government to inquire into and report upon alleged misconduct in the building and construction industry in Australia. The commission articulated a case that the industry was characterised by lawlessness in the conduct of industrial relations. Our Parliamentary Library report on the Cole elitist leftcommission stated that: The industry was described by the Royal Commission as being characterised by widespread disregard for the rule of law. It found widespread use of inappropriate industrial pressure, disregard for enterprise bargaining and the freedom of association laws leading to unlawful strikes, as well as widespread use of 'inappropriate' payments. Thus:  31 individuals were referred for possible criminal prosecution  392 instances of unlawful conduct committed by individuals, unions and employers, which include 30 findings of unlawful conduct by employers mainly for strike pay breaches and freedom of association breaches, (i.e. that the employer agreed to a 'no ticket no start' policy operating at a site), and  25 different types of unlawful conduct and 90 types of inappropriate conduct. The construction industry in Western Australia specifically was described by the royal commission as being 'marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct' with 'a culture of fear, intimidation, coercion and industrial unrest'. The royal commission made 230 findings of unlawful conduct in WA, the majority of which were against CFMEU officials and organisers for intimidation and threats of violence, breaches of FOA, secondary boycott and right-of-entry provisions, trespass and interference. CFMEU officials Kevin Reynolds and Joe MCDonald are cited as repeat offenders. Sadly the BLF is not the only example of union focus shifting from looking after employees to seeking political power. However, it is probably only the most obvious. Here we are again debating industrial relations in the building industry. The bill before us is cloaked in Labor spin as one that targets the protection of workers. But we know the reality-that this bill is about union power over business owners and managers. We know that the Labor government does not believe that Australian business owners should have the right or freedom to run their own businesses. This is the real reason we are here and the real reason that Labor members are vocal in their support-not because they are looking after the interests of workers but because they are looking after, or appear to be looking after, the political interests of union leaders. After all, preselections are on the line. BLF secretary David Hanna was quoted in the Australian on 16 December 2011: Workers will continue to take whatever action, be it legal or illegal, to get their message across. No wonder members of the building and construction industry are concerned about the consequences of what is contained in this bill and what effect this will have on their ability to run their businesses and do the jobs they are there to do. This industry is important right across Australia. It employs one million Australians and contributes 10 per cent to our GDP. So any impacts will be felt right across our economy. What we saw in that statement may well be what is ahead, as a result of measures contained in this bill. As I said when I started this speech, every Australian, whether they are an employer or an employee, deserves to be able to go to their workplace and operate in a safe and lawful environment. I fear that members opposite do not support this. The Labor government is repeatedly punishing the people who have a go, who invest their own money, who borrow against their homes and who employ millions of Australians and are helping others to get ahead. There is now a widespread belief that this Labor government is anti-business. I am concerned that they will sacrifice hard working business owners through policies like the ones in this bill, for the express purpose of enhancing the power of union leaders and definitely not with the aim of achieving sound reform, jobs growth, productivity improvements and economic growth.",143
216,Mr ZAPPIA,BILLS," I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. I have just listened to the member for Forrest. It is very easy to paint a one-sided view of a situation, as she has just done. I am sure workers in the construction industry around Australia would willingly come into this place and tell a story different from the one we have just heard from the member for Forrest. I am well aware that, in the Cole royal commission, their view was that their voice had not been properly heard. I am not in a position to judge that one way or the other but I am in a position to make the comment on their behalf that they felt they did not get a fair hearing. From the transcripts which are available, I believe the record will show that they are probably correct. I come back to some of the very issues related to this bill, to that commission and the new legislation, which touch upon the very reasons this legislation is good legislation and the reasons this government believes in fairness for workers and industry across this country. I make this comment with respect to the comments by the member for Forrest and others when they talk about the influence of some of the unions, making allegations as to corruption or similar by people involved in them. It takes two parties to get involved in corrupt activity. It is not simply a one-sided affair. Yet when you look at the record, it appears that the focus is always towards one group only and that is the workers. I believe the extraordinary attack on workers' rights by the Howard government was a key factor in the ultimate downfall of the Howard government and in Prime Minister Howard's loss of his own seat. Like Prime Minister Stanley Bruce before him, who lost his seat in 1929, Prime Minister Howard had turned his back on Australian workers. Peter Reith's waterfront debacle of the late 1990s, the Work Choices legislation and the establishment of the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commission were part of a warped ideology to turn back the clock on fair working conditions that had been hard won over decades of struggles and to destroy unions. It is as simple as that. Those attacks were un-Australian and Australians knew it. The members opposite know that as well. That is why they will not mention the term Work Choices any more. Their leader wants the term 'dead, buried and cremated', at least in name; I do not believe in substance. Australians are pretty easygoing people, but they believe in a fair go. The ABCC legislation was everything but that. It was legislation that was not only an assault on workers' conditions but an assault on human rights-human rights which Australia has to agreed to as a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Australians have fought and died for the freedoms and fairness that Work Choices, the ABCC and the waterfront events sought to take away from them. When the ABCC was established in 2005, following the Cole royal commission, it was intended to intimidate and break organised labour in Australia. The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 creates the Office of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate to regulate the building and construction industry. This new agency will replace the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. It renames the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 as the Fair Work (Building Industry) Act 2011 and either repeals or amends many of the BCII Act's provisions. The bill implements key recommendations of the Transition to Fair Work Australia for the building and construction industry report by the Hon. Murray Wilcox QC. It is interesting that the member for Forrest referred to the Cole royal commission but made no reference to the report by the Hon. Murray Wilcox, who also makes some very pertinent comments regarding the ABCC legislation. Conveniently, they were left out. With the exception of minor non-policy changes such as the inclusion of changes resulting from amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act, the bill is the same as that introduced during the previous parliament. The bill removes existing higher penalties for building industry participants for breaches of industrial law and introduces safeguards in relation to the power to compulsorily obtain information and documents. The bill creates the office of Independent Assessor, who may, on application by stakeholders, determine that compulsory information-gathering powers will not apply to a project. The new regulator will also provide information, advice and assistance to all building industry participants regarding their rights and obligations under law, as well as seek to improve the standard of occupational health and safety in the building and construction industry. The bill includes a three-year sunset provision for the compulsory information-gathering powers. A review will occur prior to the sunset of compulsory information-gathering powers. I note that the bill does not impact on the provisions that establish the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner and the Occupational Health And Safety Accreditation Scheme. Criticism of the former Howard government's ABCC has not just come from the labour movement in Australia and the wider Australian community. There has also been international condemnation of the coercive powers of the ABCC and its targeting of building unions. The International Labour Organisation, the United Nations body charged with looking after workers' rights, has raised its concerns on a number of occasions. The ILO's Committee of Experts is an eminent body of labour jurists. Early last year, this committee circulated the following statement: … the manner in which the ABCC carries out its activities seems to have led to the exclusion of workers in the building and construction industry from the protection that the labour inspection system ought to secure for these workers under the applicable laws … The ILO's concerns were very well illustrated by the Ark Tribe case in South Australia. I am reasonably familiar with that case because I followed it from day one. The Ark Tribe trial was pivotal in further raising community awareness of the ABCC's potential to encroach on the industrial and human rights of Australian workers. In 2008, Ark Tribe attended a safety meeting at a construction site in Adelaide. At that meeting, ongoing safety concerns at the site were discussed by workers and a union investigation into conditions was carried out before workers returned to their work. The ABCC then summoned Ark Tribe to a meeting in order to determine the legality of workers' actions. When Ark Tribe refused to attend, prosecutors for the ABCC commenced legal proceedings against him. Ark Tribe was not a union official or a union delegate. A large protest was held when court proceedings took place. Several hundred people were present for the first day of the trial on 15 June 2010, including prominent international civil rights campaigners Gerry Conlon and Paddy Hill. Industrial rights are, after all, civil rightsthat is, human rights. On 24 November 2010, Ark Tribe was cleared of the charges against him-charges which should never have been laid. Ark Tribe should never have been subjected to the intimidation and injustice which he had been put through. I am pleased to see that the courts came to the same conclusion and cleared him of those charges. In 2007, the government made a commitment that, if elected, it would replace the ABCC with a new body to provide a balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations in the building and construction industry. The construction industry contains unique challenges for both employers and employees. Nobody denies that. Too many Australians die on building and construction sites each and every year and hundreds more are injured, and that has been the case for decades and decades. Building workers have been exposed workplace dangers associated with unsafe work practices, unsafe worksites and unsafe building materials. Poor scaffolding, working from heights, the danger of structural collapse, exposure to dust, asbestos, hazardous chemicals and even extreme weather conditions have taken their toll on the lives of construction workers and on their families for decades and decades. Indeed, much of Australia has literally been built on the blood, sweat and tears of construction workers. Labor supports a strong building industry regulator to ensure lawful conduct by all parties. support laws that deny workers basic rights, like being represented by a lawyer of their choice. The context for changes was further developed late last year when Qantas Airways grounded its fleet. In the future we may well reflect on this incident as an important moment for industrial relations in Australia. Currently, if Qantas's action is held to be illegal industrial action under the Fair Work Act, the maximum fine it would face would be one-third of the maximum fine the CFMEU could face for taking illegal industrial action on building sites. Where is the fairness in that? The widespread public criticism of Qantas's action suggests that our industrial relations body should be designed to achieve greater conciliation instead of having coercive or litigious functions. In conclusion, I have tried to summarise the importance of this bill, and I know that there is still some concern with it in respect of the coercive powers. I also know that those powers have been limited to the extent that there have to be certain processes before they can be applied. I believe that a reasonable balance has been struck in respect to them. However, I believe that this bill corrects an injustice that currently exists in Australian industrial laws, whereby some people are treated as lesser than other people-in other words, there is currently discrimination in the laws that apply to workers in this country, and this bill seeks to rectify that. I commend the bill to the House.",145
217,Mr TEHAN,BILLS," I rise to oppose the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011, and I take issue with the previous speaker. The bill is not about trying to outlaw organised labour in this country. It is about trying to deal with illegal activity by organised labour in this country, and in particular in the But it does not building industry. The bill will do three things: it is going to hurt Australia's productivity; it is going to set up a new body that, sadly, will be a toothless tiger; and, it will give more power to the new workplace relations minister, which is like putting a kid in charge of the candy store, or, to put it another way, like putting a factional boss in charge of determining the Labor leadership-it will be a debacle. Let us turn to the issue of productivity. The ABCC has been a tough cop on the beat, but it has required a tough cop on the beat to deal with the issues identified by a royal commission. The inquiry that led to the formation of the ABCC was not a normal one-it was a royal commission. Since the ABCC was set up we have seen building and construction industry productivity increase by 10 per cent; it has provided an annual economic welfare gain of $5.5 billion per year; it has reduced inflation by 1.2 per cent and increased GDP by 1.5 per cent; and the number of working days lost annually per 1,000 employees in the construction industry has fallen from 224 in 2004 to 24 in 2006. At the same time, building costs have fallen by 20 to 25 per cent and long project delays have been dramatically reduced. At a time when the Australian economy is struggling, due to the incompetence of this Labor government, the last thing we need is another step in the direction of lessening Australia's productivity. That is what this bill will do. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry summed it up quite nicely in the letter they wrote to the secretary of the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee when this bill was being looked at. They took the opportunity to thank the committee for having the inquiry and noted: The outcome of the Bill is a matter of particular significance, not just for the building and construction sector, but for the broader economy. Approximately one million Australians work in the building and construction industry. Their output contributes around 10% of Australia's GDP. This issue is dealing with 10 per cent of Australia's GDP. You want to harm the productivity in 10 per cent of Australia's GDP. This decision will lead to long-term consequences for the Australian community. You should think again about having kowtowed to the Greens and having agreed to go down this path. This was emphasised by the minister in his second reading speech on 3 November 2011 when he indicated: The building and construction industry remains a critical sector of our economy, with immediate and direct impact on jobs, growth and productivity. This was particularly so during the global economic recession, during which the government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan ensured that the Australian economy remained one of the strongest in the developed world. The minister continued: The government understands that the industry contains unique challenges for both employers and employees, and as a result we have always supported a strong building industry regulator to ensure lawful conduct by all parties. The minister then went on for a few more paragraphs detailing why the industry is so important. However, the only effective response has come from the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. This concerns dealing with the illegal activities that have existed in this industry. It has had a dramatic impact on the industry and on the sorts of behaviour and attitudes we have referred to. The impact has been quantified in a range of different ways, in particular by significant reductions in lost time in the industry and big improvements in productivity and efficiency, estimated at Australian more than $5.5 billion per annum. The decision taken by the Howard government to set up the ABCC was not a liked one. To have a royal commission look into an industry requires a lot of evidence that something drastic needs to occur. That is exactly what the Cole royal commission found. What has been the result of the Cole royal commission? We have seen the ABCC set up and we have seen huge productivity increases come out of the sector. But we should not now say to ourselves, 'Okay, the job is done,' because the evidence is still there that it is not. There have been productivity increases, but all the alarm bells are there. If we reduce the amount of regulation in the industry at the moment then the illegal activity will grow once again, and, sadly, we are seeing examples of that in Victoria, and we have seen it in the last few years. Just when we are getting on top of this issue, what does this Labor government want to do? It wants to step in and put at risk all the gains that we have made. Getting to the second point, what they are replacing the ABCC with is a toothless tiger. I will turn to what the Australian Industry Group had to say about this. A government member: Who have you got?",148
218,Mr TEHAN,BILLS,We have got ACCI; we have got the Australia Industry Group. What I am trying to do here is give a balanced perspective.,149
219,Unknown,BILLS,Government members interjecting,150
220,Mr TEHAN,BILLS,"All right, so we should not have business in Australia, should we?",150
221,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! Members on my right will cease interjecting. The member for Wannon has the call.,150
222,Mr TEHAN,BILLS,"I am happy to listen to those interjecting from the other side that we should just have the union bosses ruling the country. They have done a great job with their factional people here in this parliament, haven't they! Look at the unholy mess they have got us in at the moment. We have got a Prime Minister who cannot be trusted, we have got the Minister for Foreign Affairs trying to seek her job and we have got a factional impasse because no-one knows who should lead the country.",150
223,Unknown,BILLS,Government members interjecting,150
224,Mr TEHAN,BILLS,"That is right. We should just let the big union bosses rule everything! What we are trying to do here is make sure that illegal activity by organised labour does not get out of control, especially in the building and construction industry. What are you going to replace the ABCC with? Sadly, a toothless tiger. The AiG says: The compulsory examination powers are needed at the present time as much as ever. While the reforms introduced after the Royal Commission addressed the unlawful and inappropriate conduct that permeated the industry, industrial unrest disputation has been steadily increasing in the industry and damaging and unproductive industrial relations practices have been creeping back onto building and construction sites across Australia. They go on to quote the foreword to the annual report of the ABCC for the financial year ending 30 June 2011, in which the ABC Commissioner, Leigh Johns, identified that: During 2010-11, unlawful industrial disputes, the traditional ‗bread-and-butter‘ work of the ABCC, continued to occur at levels that underscored the need for strong enforcement of workplace laws. The pernicious effects of unlawful industrial action are unacceptable, particularly so on projects of social and national significance like the Monash Freeway, the Melbourne Markets relocation, Gold Coast University Hospital or the Wonthaggi Desalination Plant. One only has to look at the record days lost on the desalinisation plant in Victoria to see why the ABCC needs to remain and needs to continue to do its job. The new body that has been established within Fair Work Australia to replace the incredibly successful Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner is not an independent body. So not only will it be toothless but it is not an independent body. It is controlled by the minister. And who is our new minister? Where does he come from? How independent will he be? How objective will he be? We have got the kid back in control of the candy store. That is what this bill will do. What we will see is a complete imbalance in the way these issues are dealt with. The sad fact is that ultimately that will lead to a productivity decline in this country. That is the last thing that we need at the moment. Our manufacturing sector is about to get hit by one of the biggest hits to their productivity that you could imaginethe carbon tax. This is especially so in the state of Victoria because it is going to impact on power, which is the competitive and advantage that our industries and especially our manufacturers in Victoria have over our international competitors. Combine that now with this bill. Those opposite, and I have been listening to their speeches as they have gone on, have said that all this will do is redress an imbalance. Yet no-one has been through and systematically examined what the Cole royal commission found-the intimidation and the thuggery, and the fact that if there was not some sort of body set up with powers to deal directly with it that none of this would stop. Even though we have had the ABCC there, we have still seen examples of this occurring. So why won't the government allow it to finish its job? Why don't they make sure that it has all been stamped out? It is illegal activity that we are trying to of here. It is not, as those opposite say, designed to get rid of organised labour in this country. It is designed to get rid of the activity. Those on the other side should be supporting the work that the ABCC is doing, because the more we can do to stamp out this type of activity the better it will be across nation for organised labour in general. The coalition strongly opposes the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. In many ways the title of the bill is a complete misnomer. Sadly, at a time when we should be looking to do everything we can to increase the productivity of this nation, it will do the exact opposite. It will set up a body which they have deliberately given no teeth to. Basically, it will become an irrelevant bureaucracy-another one created by the government. Not only that; it gives power not to an independent body but back to the minister and, as we know, the new minister is going to find it very difficult to be independent and objective. He will be dealing with his union mates and he will be conflicted in trying to continue to stamp out illegal activity. I would hope the starting point that we can all agree on when it comes to this bill would be that there is no place for illegal activity anywhere in the Australian economy and in particular the building and construction industry. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (18:16): My contribution to this debate on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 will be brief. I have to observe that the contributions from those on the other side have been really revealing about what lies in their hearts and their obsessions when it comes to industrial relations. The bill has a long history, dating back to at least 2001, when in the lead-up to an election the then Prime Minister, John get rid Howard, established the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, whose singular illegal purpose was to demonise the union movement in general and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union in particular. The government never really the made any secret that this was its singular objective in commissioning the Cole royal commission. Unfortunately, the government's real objective was to ensure that the evidence would be horrifying and that it would assist it in moving through its next raft of industrial relations changes after the 2001 election. Unfortunately for the government, the evidence before the commission was at times unhelpful to that cause. The evidence before the commission found that by world standards we have a very efficient construction industry, and in some respects we are leading by way of world's best practice. Ms O'Dwyer interjecting Mr STEPHEN JONES: My friend in the chamber makes the observation that there were no convictions arising out of the royal commission. It did find that there was corruption in the industry and a significant amount of corruption by certain employers within the industry. It was a tough and rough industry and from time to time some practices went on that would be condemned by all members of this House. But to say that poor practice was solely the result of union activity is a complete furphy and a misrepresentation of any of the evidence that was put before the Cole royal commission. It also found-and this never got much attention and certainly never got any action from the Howard government-that there were systemic breaches and systemic failures in adhering to occupational health and safety standards and regulations within the building industry. If the Howard government had put as much energy into chasing that rabbit down that hole, then there would probably be a few more workers in this industry and workplaces who had not suffered the terrible injuries that occur on an all too often basis within the building and construction industry. The debate in this chamber today shows the obsession of the Liberal Party and the coalition with harsh industrial relations laws, union bashing and their love of Work Choices. Whilst they have attempted to put them in the closet from time to time, when debates like this come before the House they cannot help themselves. We have seen that from the frantic, if not hysterical, debate from the member for Wannon. What is absolutely astounding is that the loudest voices and the most ill-informed comments, I wager, have come most often from those members of the House who have never been anywhere near a building site and who do not know what it is like to work in the building and construction industry-which, as I have said, is a tough industry. I am pleased to be speaking in favour of the legislation before this House, but I will make one qualification to that. The legislation abolishes the Australian Building and Construction Commission and absorbs those functions into the functions of Fair Work Australia. It ensures that there will still be a tough cop on the beat. It ensures that there will still be strong regulatory arrangements in the building and construction industry, extending beyond the obsessions of those on the other side but going directly to issues of health and safety and to issues of employer breaches and scams that regularly affect subcontractors within the industry. The legislation ensures these practices are wiped out as well. If I have a reservation, it stems from my background in the law. My concern is that the bill does not yet deal with the issue of compelled evidence. I understand that this is the result of commitments that we made in the lead-up to the 2010 election and, as a member of this place and this party, I stand squarely behind the policy commitments and the provisions of this bill. But I do raise the reservation-and it stems from hundreds of years of legal practice-that courts should be very wary indeed about accepting the probity and the availability of compelled evidence. If we have learnt anything over hundreds of years of legal practice, there are deep concerns within the legal community of accepting the probative value of compelled evidence. I am hoping that some time in the future, with the experience of the new functions being absorbed within Fair Work Australia, and improved practices within the building and construction industry, we may be able to revisit this matter in this place in the interests of all. I commend the legislation to the House.",150
225,Ms ODWYER,BILLS," The Prime Minister made a number of promises to the Australian people before the 2007 and 2010 elections. She promised that she would be economically prudent, and yet her Treasurer has delivered four deficits of more than $167 billion in total and a gross debt ceiling of $250 billion. She promised not to introduce a carbon tax only days before the election and then broke that promise. She promised that that no Australian worker would be worse off as a result of her industrial relations laws and that her reforms would not have a negative impact on productivity or our nation's economyanother broken promise. The government's changes have wound back the industrial relations clock, not just to a time before Work Choices but to a time before Hawke and Keating. The Prime Minister also promised that she would have a 'tough cop on the beat' in the building and construction industry. Today, I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 that is before this House. This bill breaks that last promise, the broken promise in a long list of the Prime Minister's broken promises. When the Prime Minister brought in her Fair Work Act she said it would 'increase productivity'. We hear from the Prime Minister and Treasurer on a repeated basis that productivity is the key to this nation's prosperity and that we must increase our productivity to ensure that our nation grows. We on this side of the chamber agree with this. Productivity-enhancing reform is, as the CFMEU Chairman of the Productivity Commission has so rightly stated, 'the mainstay of economic progress'. No doubt we will hear again from the other side of the chamber that this legislation is also supposedly 'productivity enhancing'. Yet nothing could be further from the truth. In the September quarter we saw that that GDP per hour worked was lower than in the last quarter of the coalition government. is a decline, not simply a slowing in the of growth. The coalition government delivered an increase of more than 25 per cent in GDP per hours worked in our 11 years. The Labor-Greens government has seen a fall in GDP per hours worked in less than four years. Annual productivity growth has gone from on average 1.2 per cent during our time in government to -0.9 per cent during the Labor-Greens government. A tough cop on the beat is critical in the construction and building industry. The Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner is that tough cop on the beat. It was born out of the Cole royal commission which, 10 years ago, investigated the lawlessness, thuggery, intimidation and corruption that existed as part of the entrenched culture on construction sites-a culture that saw itself as above the law and, in the words of the commission 'flagrantly' breached the law latest without any thought of consequence. Examples brought before the commission ranged from unlawful entry of sites by union officials to violence, obstruction of building sites and payments by builders to the unions for industrial peace. One such example in WA saw a builder pay more than $1.5 million for so-called casual tickets to WA's CFMEU. When the Cole commission followed the money trail it could only trace $500,000-the rest of the money to the simply disappeared. These examples were commonplace and have more in common with organised crime than a 21st century construction industry. This culture significantly increases the cost of building and the flow-on economic effects are enormous. In the time that the ABCC has been operating the benefits of a strong watchdog for the construction industry are clear. This According to research undertaken by KPMG rate Econtech, since the inception of the ABCC productivity in the sector has risen by 10 per cent, there has been an economic welfare gain of $5.5 billion per year, inflation has been reduced by 1.2 per cent, GDP has increased by 1.5 per cent and it has helped facilitate significant reductions in days lost through industrial action. Significantly, the powers of the ABCC have led to successful court action, with more than $2.5 in penalties imposed by the courts in the last financial year. Most recently, two unions and a number of union officials have been fined more than $1.3 million by the courts for obstruction, violence and intimidation on the Westgate Bridge project. Yet this Labor-Greens government plans to unwind these economic and workplace reforms by shifting power away from the independent umpire back to the unions. The legislation before this House will make a eunuch of the ABCC and will guarantee three things: a decrease in productivity; that the unions dictate the terms on which the construction industry operates; and a return of the old school practices of delay, intimidation and union payoffs for industrial peace and increased costs. Like everyone in this chamber I meet regularly with people from different industries. At a recent meeting I was told by several builders that they had been coerced into 'advertising' in a union magazine. They told me this was standard practice so as to avoid their sites being shut down through guerrilla tactics or equipment failing to turn up. This, they considered, was a cost of doing business. The abolition of the ABCC in its current form will ensure that some of the more nefarious activities will return in force. I wish to highlight five key ways in which this legislation will damage the construction industry. Firstly, the bill strips power from the ABCC's replacement body, the Building Industry Inspectorate, by enshrining in law that the minister has the power to issue directions as to how, where and when it should go about performing its functions. Given the serious unanswered questions about potential government interference in the Craig Thomson saga, this is a retrograde step. Secondly, by lifting the test for what is a 'lawful' strike we will start to see an increase in trivial strikes action, the kind of strikes that were rampant at the Wonthaggi desalination plant. Thirdly, reducing the penalty for unlawful strikes will remove the disincentive for unlawful industrial action. We can see through the Westgate Bridge case that there is a need for tough penalties for those who do not comply with the law, with over $1.3 million of fines being ordered by the ABCC. In that case, workers needed to be moved by an ex-army troop carrier in and out of the site to ensure their safety. We should never forget employers are also entitled to their rights, including their right to conduct business without the threat of intimidation or reprisal. Employees are also entitled to their rights-the right to a safe workplace free from threats and intimidation. The unions would have us believe that the right of unions to go about their business should be paramount, but it is not. Rights are not a oneway street. The increase in red tape for compulsory information-gathering powers and a sunset clause after five years will see these powers used rarely, if at all, and a return to retribution actions taken against anyone who speaks out about the culture on construction sites. The fact that the sunset clause will not even be reviewed before being removed indicates that the real motivations behind these changes are to silence critics of union thuggery, violence and intimidation. Reduction of building inspectorate powers to investigate by allowing such powers to be switched off means that the building inspectorate will not have the freedom and independence to investigate all complaints. Make no mistake; this legislation is simply to allow the Prime Minister to pander to the union leaders that installed her and nothing to do with making Australia a better or more prosperous nation. The union campaign in support of the election of this Labor government in 2007 amounted to more than $36,430,588 in direct donations and political expenditure. In 2010 it amounted to $24,578,719. The Greens member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, received more than $360,000 across both elections as a direct donation from the CFMEU, ETU and AMWU. Labor and the Greens are not interested in maintaining law and order on work sites and improving the economic welfare of the nation but are instead keen, through this legislation, to pay back their union masters. While I do not doubt that Labor will continue to receive the hard earned money of union members, such as those from the Health Services Union, the Greens pretend that they are on a higher moral plane. If the member for Melbourne and the Greens leader, Bob Brown, were true to their highminded rhetoric and so-called high standards regarding political donations, they ought to hand this money back. But I bet they will not. The Greens simply set standards for others, never for themselves.",152
226,Mr Bandt,BILLS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: it cannot be parliamentary conduct in this place to allege someone has received sums of money that they have not received.",155
227,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," I must admit I have only just arrived in the chair. I will just say to the member for Higgins that, if she is going to make an allegation about someone, she should do it by a substantive motion.",155
228,Ms ODWYER,BILLS,"The member for Melbourne can correct the record after question time if he feels that he has been misrepresented. I will continue. The Greens simply set standards for others, never for themselves. The leader of the Greens and the member for Melbourne talk about rights, but will not ensure the rights of workers to be free from thuggery and intimidation on building and construction sites. The coalition has a proud record of increasing the productivity of the nation whilst maintaining world's-best-practice working conditions. I stand by our record of productivity gains on the waterfront. I stand by the productivity gains that the ABCC was making in the construction industry. The unions and their political wing, the Labor Party, will consistently cry foul that any productivity gain equates to a reduction in labour standards. But I defy anyone in this chamber to name one other country that has working and wage conditions at the standard Australia has. We truly are the lucky country. I do not stand alone in pointing out the flaws in the government's plan to abolish the ABCC. It is not just this side of the chamber that has been sounding the warning bell on what this bill would mean for industrial disputation and increased cost in the construction industry. The government's favourite business adviser, the CEO of the Australian Industry Group, Heather Ridout, warned: Unless a strong, well-resourced regulator and strong legislation is maintained, the risks associated with industrial lawlessness will again be priced into construction contracts, at great cost to project owners, including governments, and the Australian community, Let me interpret that statement for the benefit of the House: the abolition of the ABCC will be a throwback to the old days of union militancy, industry disruption, kickbacks and intimidation in the construction industry. Construction managers are also expressing concern over the fact that the abolition of the ABCC will have a particular impact on small to medium firms that cannot defend themselves from the aggressive actions of the more militant unions. Gerry Hanssen from Perth based construction firm Hanssen Pty Ltd has warned that, should the ABCC be abolished, the corruption and standover tactics will be 'back in a flash'. As with the Treasurer's comments in relation to productivity, the government know how to talk the talk but so rarely do they walk the walk. In the time since the Prime Minister introduced the Fair Work Act, union activism and industrial disputation has increased. In the June 2011 quarter, working days lost due to disputation jumped from 19,700 in the previous quarter to 66,200. In the September quarter it increased again to a staggering 101,300 days. That is a 500 per cent increase in two quarters. This should concern all in this chamber and everyone who simply wants to contribute to building a stronger economy and a better nation. John Mullen, CEO of port operator Asciano Ltd, has cautioned that, 'In the current industrial climate, the country is going backwards.' These are all very dire predictions of where this country heading and the abolition of the ABCC is a giant leap in that direction. The government's response to any analysis or criticism of its Fair Work Act is to mount a scare campaign, flogging again the dead horse of Work Choices. But this is wearing thin, like so much of the government's rhetoric. It is plain that the industrial relations system in this country has gone backwards and unless the government starts to address the concerns that are raised by businesses, both big and small, and their employees, there will be ever-increasing industrial action, unrest at the workplace and decreased productivity. The best way the government can start to address this issue is by abandoning this legislation and keeping the ABCC with its full powers.",155
229,Ms HALL,BILLS," It is easy to see that the member for Higgins is a strong advocate for Work Choices. If there is any reason that we should doubt the sincerity of those on the other side of this House, it is the contribution by the member for Higgins. Firstly, she made a point of saying that there will be no review, and it is in the legislation that there will be a review. That is not being completely up-front or honest with the people of Australia or with this House. She also made a statement that the member for Melbourne received a highly inflated amount of money from unions. Not true. Is it right that a person can come into this House and make statements that really are not true? I believe this legislation is overdue. It will repeal the excesses of the Howard government's extreme industrial relations agenda. The Howard government's agenda was to crush unions and remove the right of workers, and the ABCC was the draconian body it established to do that in the construction industry. The ABCC legislation is was the brainchild of Peter Reith, the industrial relations minister who used dogs and armed guards on the wharves of Australia in his government's efforts to crush the MUA. The Labor government appreciates the role unions play in protecting the rights of workers in Australia, just as we appreciate the role employers play. Both parties are important. On this side of the House we know that unions provide protection for workers just as employer bodies protect the rights of employers. It is about balanceboth sides make an enormous contribution. I have listened to speakers on the other side of the House talk about increases in productivity: 10 per cent, the previous speaker said. Productivity increase is important. But over the same period of time there has been over a four per cent increase in the rate of death on construction sites. productivity to be gained at the price of lives? That is the question I have for the member for Higgins, who has now left the chamber. The Howard government did not recognise that there was a need for balance, and that is why it introduced its Work Choices law-which the member for Higgins is so supportive of-which attacked all workers' rights and was harsh and oppressive. It was the zealots in this parliament who sought to squash workers in the building industry and take away their basic rights. The Howard government's ABCC saw workers like Ark Tribe dragged before the courts with a strong prospect of being imprisoned, simply because he refused to attend an interview in what was nothing more than an inquisition, whilst employers were given a slap over the wrist for breaching occupational health and safety laws. So it was really a double standard that was created under the ABCC. We had an increase in unsafe practices in workplaces, an increase in deaths and injuries. Everyone in this parliament knows that the construction industry is one of the four most dangerous industries, along with agriculture, forestry and mining. When you have a dangerous industry you really need to make sure that occupational health and safety laws are adhered to. Under the ABCC, safety practices were allowed to deteriorate. More workers were injured as a consequence. We on this side of the House realise that you need a balanced approach, and the changes we have before us today are about balance. However, on the other side of the chamber they only listen to the employers. They make no mention of safety; it is all about productivity. If they do mention safety they mention it not for the workers but as a way of denigrating workers in the construction industry. On this side of the House we value Is safety, we value workers and we value employers. I will need to shorten my contribution to this debate to ensure that everybody has an opportunity to speak. I would like to briefly put before the House that this legislation is at the heart of the Labor Party's new workplace relations system. We understand that there are unique challenges within the construction industry and we think that this will balance those issues. The ABCC needs to be replaced. Any body that is as oppressive as the ABCC, any body that looks at only one side of the equation and any body that has led to workers ending up in court with the prospect of being jailed simply because they do not attend an interview is not a fair body. We are about fairness-we are about making sure that both employers' and workers' rights are respected. The position that has been adopted by the government and incorporated in the legislation has been examined by independent legal expert Murray Wilcox QC, and his recommendations have been taken into account in the development of the legislation. There is a sunset clause that will come into play after three years, allowing time for the legislation to take effect. The opposition are not at all interested in a fair workplace. They are not interested in a workplace that has appropriate regulations, where all parties in the building industry have rights. They are interested in work sites in an industry in which it is a one-sided equation, where only the employers-the big companies-have a say; they are the only ones who have a right to be heard. Whilst we respect and appreciate the role that builders and employers play in the construction industry, we know that the construction industry is a very important part of our economy. We want to see it thrive. In my own electorate, it is a very important industry. But we also know that workers in that industry need protection. We know that, in any industry, laws that are so draconian that they are oppressive-in the way that those introduced by the Howard government, which established the ABCC, are-are bad laws. You only have to come to this chamber and listen to members on the other side of the House distorting facts, not being totally truthful about what the legislation includes and not really portraying the true picture. To have a strong industry, a vibrant industry, you have to respect your workers. You have to have work sites that are safe. If you have an industry that knows it does not have to value its workers, if you have a construction industry where safety can be bypassed and if you have an industry in which workers are constantly in fear of retribution if they speak up, then you do not have things working properly. In saying that, I acknowledge that there are some very good employers who do not cut any corners. I will leave my contribution there. I recommend and support the legislation before the parliament today and I will be very pleased to see the end of the ABCC.",156
230,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," There was a good reason the coalition established the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2005. As with most things the Howard government did, it was based on solid evidence, a community and industry need, as well as on facts. That was the way of the Howard administration: clear, careful and considered policies thought through and implemented in the national interest. In the past four-and-a-bit years, and certainly since the current Prime Minister took over, we have seen the complete opposite. Ill-conceived, knee-jerk decision making at the behest of minorities are anything but in the national interest. The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 falls into this typical Labor category. The coalition strongly opposes this bill. We believe that every Australian, whether an employer or an employee, deserves to be able to go to their workplace and operate in an atmosphere where basic law and order is enforced. That goes without saying, and I take exception to the member for Shortland having a go at the coalition, saying that we do not believe in fairness or in safety. Those issues are paramount. We do not distort facts and we do not betray people. The bill abolishes the body that ensures that law and order is enforced in the building and construction industry. We know why Labor is so keen to bring about an end to the ABCC, and that is because they are beholden to their union mates. They are beholden to the union hierarchy who use hard earned union fees to go on to work sites and into workplaces, close down productivity and put red tape and bureaucracy in front of employers. Mr Laurie Ferguson: Why would they do that?",158
231,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,"You can yell all you like but this is a fact. I was speaking to a Wagga Wagga builder tonight and he said: 'We don't need the thuggery of unions on our work sites. Unions are fine but everything should be in moderation. We want to be able to get on with doing what we do best and that is building homes, constructing buildings and doing it with good productivity and the ability to hire apprentices.' But this bill will not enable that productivity and will not enable builders to continue to hire workers in the sorts of ways that they are with the construction commission in place as it is now. The commission was introduced in 2005 in response to the Cole royal commission, which found that the building and construction industry was rife with a complete disregard for the law. It catalogued more than 100 types of unlawful and inappropriate conduct. In today's workplaces and in this day and age we cannot have that. The member opposite might want that but the building industry cannot afford it and the national interest does not need it. The commission also found that existing regulatory bodies had insufficient powers and resources to enforce the law. That is why the Howard government introduced the Australian Building and Construction Commission. But Labor would demolish all that; the Prime Minister would demolish all that. It is so interesting that the Prime wants to do that. We have heard only today how the Prime Minister, when she was the shadow minister for health, said that insurance rebates were part of the family's budget, yet today we see the private health insurance rebate thrown straight out the window. When the Prime Minister was the education minister she took away independent youth allowance. And now the Prime Minister and the Labor Party want to take away the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which is doing its job and doing a very good job. This bill will strip away the protections that enable workers to work in a safe and lawful environment. The replacement agency will, unfortunately, be a toothless tiger will again roll out the red carpet to lawlessness, thuggery and violence. The new body that has been established within Fair Work Australia to replace the very successful office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner will not be, and is not, an independent body. It is controlled by the minister. It is not going to be what we would call a strong cop on the beat. We need to have measures in place that enable fairness and safety. That is why we have the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It is doing its job; it is doing a good job. There are examples upon examples of what happened prior to 2005, before the coalition took the tough decision to return the building and construction industry to law and order. In August 2001, the Howard government established the Cole royal commission to look into what was in fact happening in the building industry. Commissioner Cole reported in March 2003, and the report catalogued, as I said, more than 100 different types of unlawful conduct in that sector. The Cole royal commission examples included Minister payments being made to the CFMEU in Western Australia of more than $1½ million for so-called casual tickets, which is basically money paid in return for industrial peace on sites where not all workers were members of the union. What a disgrace! The Cole commission found that, of the $1½ million that had been paid, only $500,000 could be traced. So $1 million of this money paid to the CFMEU had just disappeared. That would be of no surprise to those opposite because money that is in the budget for all sorts of things just disappears. This is a government withMr Laurie Ferguson: You weren't too vocal on the Wheat Board.",158
232,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,"You mention the which Wheat Board. We will not start about the Wheat Board, because let me tell you that has been an absolute disaster. You can speak to any wheat grower in my electorate of Riverina and they will tell you how bad the wheat situation is going following deregulation. I would not start on that if I were you. If you want to take a sneak peek at what about to be unleashed, have a look at the Wonthaggi desalination plant in Victoria. I am a little bit dubious about desalination plants at the best of times, because we have more water than we need, but we tend to want to turn sea water back into fresh water so we can use it. Every time. I go to Sydney rains, but we have no policies to build new dams. Every time. I go to Sydney it rains, it pours out to the ocean, and at the desalination plant put there at the behest of the Labor government they try to turn it back into useable water. Go-slows at Wonthaggi desalination plant have delayed the project by up to four months. It lost 193 days due to industrial action-this was an example that the Cole royal commission came up with. This is what happens when the cop on the beat is not doing his job or does not have the powers to be able to do his job. Imagine this replicated right across the country. Regional Australia is doing it tough enough, and builders in regional Australia are doing it tough enough, because investment is on hold. In the city of Griffith in my electorate of Riverina, since the Murray-Darling Basin Authority brought out its infamous and ill-fated guide to the Basin Plan, a company which had sold 62 homes in the 12 months leading up to the release of that report in October 2010 has not sold or built one house since. The builders of that company have had either to shift or to move town, or they are just out of a job. It is tough enough for the building industry, and this is replicated right across regional Australia, yet builders in those towns who are actually working on homes and buildings for businesses are once more going to be at the behest of unions. They are going to be at the behest of union bossesthese thugs who are going to come onto their worksites and tell them what to do and how to do it. There will be stop work meetings, is and you can see it happening all over again. The CFMEU will be up to its old tricks, with a weakened regulator still in place. Just imagine what is going to happen on building sites when the construction police tie up the hands of employers and companies to the point where it will be, 'Hammers and it screwdrivers down!' We are going to be seeing union thuggery at its worse in this country again. This bill is a ploy by the Prime Minister to bring the unions and the Labor Left onside to save her leadership-nothing more, nothing less. Employers right across my electorate of Riverina are worried about this. They have written letters to me. Workers are going to be worried about it, tooMr Neumann interjecting",159
233,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,"You can complain all you like, but workers are worried about it, too. Workers in regional Australia just want a job. They just want a job as an apprentice, they just want a job on a working site, and they want to be paid fairly. They want fair conditions. They want safe conditions. That is imperative, and that is possible under the current commission. What they do not want is to always be told to put down tools. They do not want some union thug telling them that they cannot do this and they cannot do that. In most places, as even the member for Shortland admitted, many employers are very good employers in very good companies. A lot of them are family owned and they treat their workers like their own. You are going to get bad workers in any environment, and bad employers too-that is just the nature of the beast-but the ABCC is doing its job. It is doing a good regulatory job and it is stopping those unions from having their way with companies, bringing down productivity and putting in place negative factors which would stop otherwise reputable companies and employers from hiring people. That is why the coalition is dead against the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. Even the wording of the bill is a little bit like the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill this morning, with the word 'fairness' in it. Here we have the word 'improvement' and the phrase 'transition to fair work' in the name of the bill. It is almost editorialising at its worse. That bill was not about fairness in private health insurance, just like this bill is not about improvement. This is a bill which shows that the Prime Minister is beholden to the Greens. It shows that the Prime Minister is beholden to the unions, who we know pay her way and pay Labor's way to keeping their flimsy government intact. This bill is not in the national interest. were in the national interest, then it would have been done many years ago. It is not in the national interest; it is only in the unions' interest. That is why the coalition opposes the bill and that is why it should not be passed. Mr LAURIE FERGUSON (Werriwa) (18:58): What we have seen in this debate on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill is the facade being ripped away from the coalition's cultivated attempt to give an impression that they have changed their attitude since they lost power in this country in the area of industrial relations. We have had all the leaks from the Leader of the Opposition, all of the backgrounding that he was the most doubtful person in the cabinet, he was the one who did not want to go as far as John Howard, he was always a moderate and he knew that they might lose the bluecollar support that had been garnished during the Howard period. But what we have seen in the contributions today from all those opposite is that same attitude of class war politics in this country. The member for Higgins, while supposedly interested in the fate of the workers, said there should not have been any deficit spending, that we should have let the building industry go to the floor, that we should have not made sure that building material companies were supported and that we should have ensured that people could finish their apprenticeships, that people could have traineeships and that there could be spending on consumption by workers still in employment. We have had quotes, too, from Marius Kloppers and Toyota's management, as though they have no self interest in this debate. We have had contributions saying that it is all right that this body, which is supposedly so perfect, If it has failed to gain a prosecution during the whole period it has been running-a situation where Terence Cole, not to put too fine a point on itDebate interrupted.

234,Mr MORRISON,ADJOURNMENT," Seventy years ago today, more than 15,000 Australians, predominantly from the 8th Division AIF, went to hell as Singapore fell to the Japanese and another horrific chapter began in our nation's history, as well as for our allies and the people of Singapore. The indelible scars of these horrific times remain with us to this day and serve as a reminder of what we must never forget. The Australian prisoners were taken to Thailand, Burma, Borneo, Japan, Manchuria, Indochina, Formosa and Korea. In total, 22,376 Australians were ultimately taken prisoner by the Japanese in South-East Asia during World War II-8,031 of these Australians never came home. These figures are often rounded, but I think it is important in this place that we remember and record our gratitude for the service and sacrifice of each and every one of these great Australians for the love of their country. Our POWs were starved and they fell victim to diseases such as cholera, malaria, dysentery and beriberi and died agonising deaths. They were voted humiliated, they were force-marched and they were press-ganged into terrible labour. They were beaten, they were beheaded and they were bayoneted. They were shot and they were murdered with a brutality that I cannot imagine, I cannot comprehend and I cannot bear to think about. But think about it today we must and remember it this day we must, especially in this place, and every day we can-because it was their captivity which was the price of our freedom. After 68 days of a Japanese onslaught along the Malaysian peninsula, the allies were trapped on Singapore Island. Beset by heavy fighting, they surrendered at the old Ford motor factory in Singapore. The unthinkable had happened; the impregnable fortress had fallen. Prime Minister Curtin told the nation: The fall of Singapore opens the battle for Australia. Last year, I had the solemn privilege to join 12 young Australians, the member for Blaxland and the member for Lyne as we visited the old Ford motor factory, the allied bunker, the Changi War Museum and the Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore. We then walked the Sandakan Death March in Borneo in the footsteps of more than 1,000 POWs who started their POW journey in Singapore 70 years ago this day. Only six returned. As our mateship trek concluded in Ranau, where the member for Lyne's grandfather was murdered, I recall only too well the eerie contrast between the peaceful greenery of the jungle gorge in which we solemnly stood and the reverberating clamour of silent voices that cried still-the voices of the victims of Australia's greatest ever military atrocity. While they took up their fight in captivity, others took up the fight on the battlefield. Whether it was the 39th Battalion 'chocos' storming into a firestorm at Kokoda, the hell of the Buna and Gona campaigns, victory at Milne Bay, the defence of Wau, the taking of Lae or our landing at Balikpapan, battles were fought and won, blood was spilt and treasure lost. Heroes rose to the occasionTed Kenna at Wewak, Bruce Kingsbury at Isurava, Tom 'Diver' Derrick at Sattelberg in New Guinea-but none more significant in our remembrance than 'Weary' Dunlop in those POW camps. We remember those they fought alongside on those fateful days in Singapore. We ought not forget the fierce and oppressive yoke that fell upon the people of Singapore for almost four years of Japanese occupation. Tens of thousands of lives were lost in mass executions, but the hardship did not cease with the end of the war. Singapore rose once again, however-a testimony to the leadership and strength of our friends and allies who overcame adversity to achieve self-confidence, security and prosperity. That a nation could rebound as quickly and significantly as it did is truly remarkable-to become a thriving economy, a key player and leader in our region and, importantly, a great friend of Australia. On this 70th anniversary we think of them too-of the camaraderie we shared at a time of great darkness and of the national friendships which have flourished in the 70 years which have passed since. Our shared stories of adversity in the terrible chapter which began for both our nations 70 years ago today remain an enduring reminder of the strength of the human spirit. As we remember the fall of Singapore today, as we remember those 8,031 Australians who died at the hands of their captors in the most terrible of circumstances, may we say on this solemn day, 'Lest we forget.' Burrup Peninsula",162
235,Ms PARKE,ADJOURNMENT," In November last year I had the pleasure of visiting the Burrup Peninsula- or Murujuga in the Indigenous language-in the Dampier Archipelago of the Pilbara region of Western Australia. I wish to place on the record my deep thanks to Dr Ken Mulvaney, an archaeologist and anthropologist with Rio Tinto in Dampier, who acted as guide for the day and who probably knows more about the rock art than anyone else on the planet. I have to say that his passion and care for this incredible cultural heritage was highly infectious. The Dampier rock art precinct, located in a 45 km radius, is estimated to contain more than a million Aboriginal rock art engravings, also known as petroglyphs, but only a fraction of them have been recorded. The oldest rock art on the Burrup is estimated to be up to 35,000 years old and depicts geometric designs, as well as images of humans, birds, fish and animals, including thylacines or Tasmanian tigers, which have been extinct on the mainland for over 3,000 years. The art is extensive, appearing on most rocky outcrops on the peninsula. Located near much of the art are archaeological features, including shell middens, camp sites and quarries, the total comprising a rich record reflecting the lifestyles, beliefs and ceremonial practices of Aboriginal people in the Pilbara area over millennia. As long-time advocate for the rock art, the Hon. Robin Chapple MLC, has noted: This may well be the world's largest concentration of rock art and possibly the only site that provides distinct evidence of the changes to environment, culture and society over such an extended period. The National Trust of Australia (WA) has described the rock art precinct as 'one of the world's pre-eminent sites of recorded human evolution and a prehistoric university'. In 2003, the World Monuments Fund added it to its list of most endangered places-the first time an Australian place had been included. In 2005, concerned citizens formed the Friends of Australian Rock Art, FARA, to raise awareness of the Burrup Peninsula's unique heritage and to campaign for its protection. In July 2007, the Dampier Archipelago National Heritage Place, which includes 68.4 per cent of the Burrup Peninsula, was inscribed in the National Heritage List. These wonders are unfortunately largely unknown to the wider WA and Australian community, and have been poorly protected by past and present governments. Dr Carmen Lawrence, Chair of the Australian Heritage Council and my predecessor as the federal member for Fremantle, recently published an article on the pressing need for action by state and federal governments to protect the Burrup rock art from industrial development and pollution. She eloquently explains the situation as follows: It should be obvious that such a site is a precious part of our heritage, of the world's heritage, deserving of careful study and preservation. But instead of the care and reverence which we would expect to be shown to a site with the significance of Stonehenge, the painted caves of Lascaux in France or the structures of Machu Picchu, the rock art precinct on the Burrup has taken second place to industrial and resource development for more than 40 years. Although there have been a number of partial surveys of this matchless site, many of them undertaken as part of the development approval process, it has never been the subject of a comprehensive inventory or analysis. ……… Since the decision by Malcolm Turnbull in 2007 to place the site on the National Heritage List (excluding the area set aside for the Pluto LNG expansion), the Western Australian Government has still not completed the management plan for which it is responsible. In the meantime, industrial expansion proceeds: proposals for two nitrate facilities and a desalination plant are under consideration. Vandalism is occurring and the few tourist visits are haphazard and unsupervised. This is an unacceptable situation. I note that when the Hon. Colin Barnett MLA was in state opposition, he said this in parliament: World heritage listing [of the Archipelago] is inevitable … The status of the rock art [makes it] in my opinion without doubt the most important heritage site in WA and possibly the nation … We certainly cannot use ignorance today as an excuse. If there is one part of Western where this conflict between conservation and development is most apparent it is on the Burrup Peninsula. Disappointingly, those sentiments have not to my knowledge been repeated by Mr Barnett since becoming Premier and, indeed, an ammonium nitrate facility on the Burrup has been recommended by the WA EPA for approval. The federal environment minister has requested that the Australian Heritage Council conduct an emergency heritage assessment of the Burrup and that is now underway. We cannot have a situation in Australia where we proudly refer to our Indigenous heritage as representing the oldest unbroken course of human civilisation, while at the same time ignoring the need to protect the enduring examples of that culture and that extraordinary record. In the words of Dr Carmen Lawrence: Knowledge and experience of our heritage gives meaning to our lives, inspires us and contributes to our collective sense of identity. The sites, landscapes and places which we can be galvanised to protect are, in some ways, an indication of what matters to us and what we think of ourselves. Carbon Pricing",163
236,Mr HAASE,ADJOURNMENT," Firstly, I wish to thank the member for Fremantle for so eloquently promoting my patch and that amazing art that is on the Burrup Peninsula. I rise this evening to speak on a matter that will change the face of Australia forever, a matter that this Labor government has unashamedly lied about. It is a matter on which the leader of this country has, in a desperate attempt to retain her position as Prime Minister, cajoled, dare I say it, somewhat normally rational, thinking members of the Labor Party to rally behind her and show their supposed support. This matter is a carbon tax, a tax the people of Australia Australia do not want. This government, led by a Prime Minister hanging on for grim death, is forcing upon our nation a carbon tax that we not only do not want; it is a carbon tax that will have no effect on the amount of carbon produced in the global economy. It will merely shift Australian production offshore. This government cares no more for a reduction in carbon tax than I care about the slow, agonising death the Labor Party is enduring under the current leadership. This revenue-raising scheme is based on a lie. We all know the famous words of the Prime Minister: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' The people of Australia are scared. They are vulnerable. They are afraid of this government's obsession with the carbon tax and they are terrified of the ramifications this tax will have on their jobs. They have every right to be terrified. Since January more than 1,800 job are known to have been lost-600 jobs at Alcoa's Point Henry refinery and 500 jobs with builders Kell and Rigby are at risk. These statistics, together with the announcement that the ANZ Bank will be slashing its workforce by 1,000, do not give anyone a sense security. Mr Speaker, allow me to give you a brief rundown on why the people of Australia have no faith in this government. During the last laborious four years of Labor at the helm, 19 new or increased taxes have been introduced. After delivering the four biggest budget deficits in history, government borrowing is at $100 million a day. The cost of living has skyrocketed and interest rates are rising. Unemployment has increased to 5.2 per cent as at December 2011, and this is the first year in 20 years that there has been no net gain in employment. I fear that it will not be the last. In fact, it may just be the inaugural year of no net gain in employment until Australia is rid of this despicable government. Australians are already feeling the associated costs of the carbon tax and it has not yet been introduced. Taxpayers have paid more than $1 million to the consultancy firm Hall and Partners/Open Mind for campaign development and feedback. This is on top of last year's $32 million advertising campaign. I am presuming the company will be providing feedback on the budgeted further $10 million campaign ahead of the carbon tax's introduction on 1 July. This arrogant government is squandering taxpayers' money to provide them with an assessment of its taxpayer funded campaign to sell us a new tax we don't want. It beggars belief. We now know that more than $17 million has already been spent on setting up the agency that will implement the carbon tax, and $9.4 million of that has been spent on operating costs and $8.4 million in capital outlays. This offensive waste of taxpayers' money includes $500,000 for board and CEO recruitment, $535,000 on the CEO's salary package, $200,000 on agency branding, the engagement of 207 staff to date and the engagement of 35 consultants or external contractors. I find it intriguing, to say the least, that $200,000 is to be spent on the branding of an agency which has no competition. I find appalling the fact that contract was originally set at $41,000-odd and in less than two months has blown out fivefold. I know that the time we waste in parliament with ridiculous debates such as that on same sex marriage is designed to take the heat off the government for its lack of fiscal management. We are all alarmed at the complacency this government displays in every matter other than the carbon tax. The people of Australia have every right to be concerned at the rate of knots at which this country is sailing into ruin. They have every right to fear for their jobs. Mark my words, we will all rue the day the carbon tax was introduced. Post-traumatic Stress Disorder",165
237,Ms BRODTMANN,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to talk about post-traumatic stress disorder and the tremendous work being done by two organisations to raise awareness of this disorder in Australia. Posttraumatic stress disorder is a condition that occurs as a result of trauma. If a person reacts to a traumatic situation or catastrophic event with intense fear, helplessness or horror they may develop ongoing problems; that is post-traumatic stress disorder. Not everyone who experiences trauma develops this disorder, but many do. While there is a lot of research still being undertaken as to why some people develop it and some people do not, what is known is that the disorder affects Australians from all walks of life. There is a critical need to raise awareness and understanding about the condition and how it affects those who have it and their families and friends. Exactly how many Australians experience the disorder at any one time varies, but Australian Bureau of Statistics data suggests about 1.4 million people, or between three and eight per cent of the Australian population, live with this disorder. The largest group of Australians with this the disorder are those who have survived car accidents. Those Australians who have put their life on the line during the course of their work face the highest risks of experiencing the disorder. They include our defence personnel, police officers, paramedics, firefighters, emergency service workers and volunteers. Also at highest risk are those subjected to domestic incidents and to violent crimes such as sexual assault. This makes the disorder one of the major health and well-being issues we face. The impacts are devastating. The disorder can tear families apart and destroy careers and lives. The symptoms can include recurrent nightmares about traumatic flashbacks, rage outbursts, depression, insomnia and out-of-character drinking and drug use. People living with this disorder often avoid friends, family and colleagues and even their workplaces and homes as a coping mechanism to help them stop reliving traumatic memories. The disorder can also lead to physical illnesses, such as skin rashes, stomach complaints, cardiovascular problems, asthma, headaches, diabetes and dental problems. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a very complicated illness and can occur alongside or exacerbate other types of illnesses. This partly why it is very hard to diagnose and why there is a lot of stigma and ignorance about it. Most cases can be treated with medication or psychotherapy or a combination of both. However, the symptoms can last for months, years or decades, and they can be episodic. As with many other health conditions, early diagnosis and treatment is critical, as is the support family, friends and workmates. Although this disorder is not strictly a mental health condition, it shares a lot of similarities with mental illness, such as the stigma and misunderstanding about its causes and treatment. That is why Australia's two main post-traumatic stress disorder organisations have joined together to launch Stand Tall and establish a national awareness event to promote and educate all Australians about the disorder. Picking Up The Peaces is a national organisation, based here in Canberra, that is campaigning to raise awareness and increase understanding about post-traumatic stress disorder. It has done an amazing job of producing information and educational material, and it has created a website-pickingupthepeaces.org.audesigned to educate and assist anyone and events, everyone touched by the disorder. It is anxiety, working with Tony Dell, a Vietnam veteran and former Australian test cricketer, who is the driving force behind the national awareness campaign Stand Tall. Tony Dell is the initiator of Stand Tall, which will be launched at Manuka Oval in my electorate of Canberra on Sunday 25 November this year. This national awareness campaign is being backed by Cricket Australia, the Australian Defence Force, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Mental Health Council of Australia and many prominent Australians. It is hoped that the Stand Tall launch at Manuka Oval will be similar to the is promotional event at the Sydney Cricket Ground for the MCGRATH Foundation. Manuka Oval will be a sea of orange, which is the colour of post-traumatic stress disorder awareness. The organisers are anticipating a crowd of 10,000 to witness a day of cricket, soldiers and music. I encourage everyone in the parliament to support the success of Stand Tall and to take of part in it. We need to support our defence force personnel, all police officers and the thousands of SES workers and volunteers who rescue and help Australians when they are threatened by flood, fire and other disasters. (Time expired) Mallee Electorate: Social Housing",166
238,Mr FORREST,ADJOURNMENT," I was very disturbed to discover, between Christmas and the new year, that government departments have been responsible for trampling on my constituents' town planning rights. The offending project is a transitional social housing development in Deakin Avenue, Mildura. It is funded under the federal government's stimulus package. I understand that the member for Dunkley had a similar issue in his constituency in 2010 but managed to achieve a better outcome than my constituents have endured. It is true that social housing is a much needed investment. Indeed, it is one on which I have made strong representation in the past. I stress that my objection is based not on it being 'not in my backyard' but on the simple principle that adjoining landholders' rights to be consulted have been usurped. This project is an architectural disaster in my view-I challenge anybody to look at the photographs. It has come about because the state government in Victoria has a policy of not air-conditioning public housing, so this building is completely enclosed by a steel mesh cage to shade the building. The cage is eight metres high and goes right over the building. Conservatively, this steel structure would have cost at least half a million dollars, probably more. You could have bought and installed a lot or reverse-cycle air conditioners for that sort of money. It astounds me that a 'no air conditioning' policy exists in an arid desert climate like Mildura. The project consists of 28 accommodation units and is two storeys. Its construction is now finished. It is completely surrounded by residential housing. On the eastern side is a 30-unit motel; on the northern side are residential dwellings, acting as homes; and on the western side are two private dwellings and two separate strata title unit developments. It is completely surrounded by domestic accommodation. It is very disturbing that when my constituents went, rightly, to the Mildura Rural City Council to ask what this project was about they were rebuffed. In fact, they were told that because it was a federally funded project it did not have to comply with conventional town planning or development application procedures. This is patent nonsense. This project is now completed and these residents are confounded at the intrusive aspect of this building. The privacy of the motel swimming pool is compromised from the second storey, as is the privacy of the backyards of dwellings. There are 56 rubbish bins stacked within metres of residential bedrooms. Each unit has two rubbish bins-a recycling bin and a conventional bin. The clamour and din that collection is going to create-early in the morning, I presumewill be an incredible intrusion. A 28-space carpark is floodlit from evening to dawn with daylight intensity only metres from strata title bedrooms. I was very disturbed to be advised of all it this and quickly wrote to the Hon. Robert MCClelland, the Minister for Housing in this place, on 5 January 2012 to try to establish what the Commonwealth's role in this travesty was. To this date I have not received a response to that letter. This is very poor form from the Minister for Housing. I find it extraordinary that government departments can ride roughshod over people's town planning rights. Having practised as a consulting engineer for so long, I know that these are rights that are enshrined and that parliaments have protected people's nextdoor privacy.. The Victorian town planning procedures require adjacent landholders to be notified and be involved in the design. Privacy, amenity, noise, stench and other such matters are very relevant. It subsequently transpires that the Victorian government deliberately did this with a V6 planning amendment that made the Victorian Labor Minister for Planning the responsible authority for town-planning issues. He now relies on the defence that he relied on the Mildura Rural City Council to provide the town-planning advice. But that did not happen. This is not totalitarian Communist China, where 20 million people can be shifted to make way for the Three Gorges Dam. This is democratic Australia. My constituents are demanding an explanation. They are certainly looking for natural justice and they are certainly looking for compensation for the intrusion and loss of amenity they have suffered. Manufacturing",167
239,Ms RISHWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to raise a very important issue: future of the manufacturing sector here in Australia. Manufacturing is a key industry for our national economy, providing jobs, skills and investment opportunities across Australia. As we know, there are currently significant challenges facing manufacturing companies as a result of the strength of the Australian dollar, which is affecting demand for our exports overseas. However, I believe manufacturing has a future in this country, and this government is committed to ensuring that it does. This side of the House stands shoulder to shoulder with this industry and its workers to ensure that after the mining boom has come and gone we continue to have a strong manufacturing sector in this country. This is in clear contrast to the opposition, who are prepared to abandon manufacturing if they are ever elected. Like many other electorates, my electorate of Kingston has a strong manufacturing presence, with the most recent ABS statistics indicating that a sixth of my constituents are employed in that industry. Close to a million people work in this industry. It offers wellpaid, high-skill jobs; encourages investment; contributes to research and development and is an important part of our national economy. Labor has a history of supporting manufacturing through tough times. In my electorate I have seen this commitment first hand. Many people were extremely disappointed when in 2008 Mitsubishi announced it would close its doors. I was pleased at the support provided by federal and state Labor governments to retrain workers who lost their jobs and also the support for the creation of new jobs though the co-investment with industry as part of the SA Innovation and Investment Fund. As a result of the government's co-investment, many local manufacturers were able to expand and diversify, which has created jobs the in our local community in the south as well as in wider Adelaide. High-tech, high-skilled innovative manufacturing is the future for Australia. This side of the House is looking at how we many support our manufacturing base to move into this space. One significant example of the state government providing assistance for innovative competition is the development of the old Mitsubishi site in Tonsley. When Mitsubishi left that site, I was extremely pleased that the state government bought it. They have a plan to transform the old Mitsubishi relic into a vibrant and integrated mixed-use employment precinct that will significantly grow the industrial and economic base of southern Adelaide. The site, once completed, will provide training and also support jobs, with the state government's vision that it will become a hub for innovative companies working in environmental industries, sustainable technologies and advanced manufacturing. This will transform what would have been just a vacant and unproductive site abandoned by Mitsubishi into a productive industrial precinct in southern Adelaide. The first stage of this transformation has already begun, with the state committing $125 million to a new TAFE campus on which construction has already begun. That will support over 8,000 students. Like the South Australian government, the federal government recognises the importance of strengthening the industry to keep jobs and skills in Australia. The government has focused on helping industries adjust, through co-investment. Whether it is in the steel industry or the automotive industry, we are strengthening our industry participation plans and appointing supplier advocates to ensure that local companies are part of the supply chain, and our clean energy future initiatives provide government assistance for industries to prepare for a carbon constrained future. We have developed a comprehensive road map for innovation though our 10-year Powering Ideas: An Innovation Agenda for the 21st Century program, and we have introduced new R&D tax incentives and cooperative research centres to enhance productivity through innovation and create synergy between research and industry. This government has an extremely strong record of supporting manufacturing in this country. This is in stark contrast to the coalition, who will not support manufacturing. They want to cut support. The opposition have proposed a $500 million cut from the Automotive Transformation Scheme, and they have indicated that they will cease support for the car industry by 2015. This would be a disastrous blow for the future of the automotive industry. Over 200,000 workers' jobs would be lost, not to mention the many thousands of jobs that are indirectly linked. So I call on the coalition support the car industry and ensure it has a bright future. (Time expired) Automotive Industry Videoconferencing Dunkley Student Recognition and Encouragement Awards",169
240,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT," Dunkley residents can be assured that I will continue to work for a supportive economic and policy environment that addresses the concerns of local manufacturers, particularly component manufacturers to the automotive industry. Recently I was pleased to visit a Seaford component manufacturer and talk with them about their experiences given the downturn in the number of locally produced cars, the high Australian dollar and the scary scheduled start of the carbon tax that they are having to contend with. Colin Guest and Co. stressed the importance of well-targeted government funding and how the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax will affect the viability of their business and the 60 people they employ. When the major car manufacturers are struggling, it puts pressure right down the supply chain, with component manufacturers like Colin Guest and Co. at the pointy end. We need to help these types of businesses not only because of the people they employ but because of the knowledge, capacity and skills that they contribute to the economy. The team at Colin Guest and Co. design and produce world-class drive-shaft support components for rear-wheel-drive vehicles that outperform competitors on performance, noise levels and durability. This is why some 60 per cent of their production is exported to General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, particularly in the United States. The clear and consistent policy that the coalition implemented during the Howard government years provided an excellent to platform for the car industry to pursue success, with higher production levels servicing healthy domestic and international demand, underpinned by over $4.2 billion worth of funding for the industry in the 10year period through to 2015. The Howard government's investment levels and settled policies were based on a strategic long-term vision and supported a sustainable, efficient and innovative industry producing higher volumes of models that met local and export demand. Toyota's local production at that time was nearly three times what it is today, and we need to return to that formula of targeted, thoughtful investment, predictability and support for world-class performance within the industry. It has worked well in the past; it will work well into the future. Those stable policies provided the car industry with the certainty that it was looking for in challenging times. The Gillard Labor government's carbon tax and $1.4 billion of broken promises have left car bosses scratching their heads and wondering why Australia is putting up barriers to production and why big announcements upon which forward plans are made are subsequently withdrawn without consultation. The chopping and changing and policy surprises by the Gillard Labor government have unsettled decision makers in Detroit and Tokyo, and this makes a difficult economic environment even more challenging. On the topic of local small business, I am concerned to learn that a world-class videoconferencing service provider in my electorate is being overlooked by the Gillard Labor government in favour of high-cost travel and overseas owned providers, according to the information that has been made available to me. It is disappointing this world-class business, Express Virtual Meetings, located in Mount Eliza in my electorate, is earning and servicing contracts right across the economy but the Commonwealth is overlooking this quality local business in favour of companies that are listed on the US stock exchange. I am led to believe that nearly 50 per cent of all the Commonwealth teleconferencing services commissioned over the past two years have been given to businesses not approved under the Australian Government Telecommunications Arrangements. Of these businesses given Commonwealth contracts not approved under the AGTA, 100 per cent were owned by overseas countries. It is about time the Gillard government was serious about supporting local businesses when they are recognised as world-class and not simply sending that work overseas without going through due process. Finally, in the time that is available I want to acknowledge the Dunkley Student Recognition and Encouragement Award recipients for the last calendar year. Luke Pagram, Brianna Dillon, Isaac Pavlou, Elana MCCormick, Chloe Baker, Britney Wilde, Pieter LeRoux, Brendon Thompson, Bree Tolley, Joel Nicholls, Harley Muscat, Rachelle Flight, Kosta Giannakopoulos, Jan Silayan, Madison Scully, Leith Bell, Taylah Roach, Josh Gardener and Lauryn Coyle were all recipients of the Dunkley Student Recognition and Encouragement Award. These awards acknowledge the students' really valuable personal qualities of being positive in their interactions with their peers and staff and their attitude to everyday school life and the challenges that they address. The awards acknowledge that they are passionate about improvements in personal achievement, in assisting others to achieve their best and in their belief in and that commitment to their school and their personal goals. The awards also acknowledge that they are persistent. It is about always being willing to have a go and not giving up easily. 'Positive, passionate and persistent', colleagues would know, is my campaign slogan and the approach that I take to my work. It is important to recognise these personal qualities that support achievement for people, regardless of their background. Your postcode does not determine your potential; it is these personal qualities, and they deserve recognition. (Time expired) Page Electorate: Community Activities",170
241,Ms SAFFIN,ADJOURNMENT," Wednesday I attended an event here at Parliament House along with other members of parliament. It was the Heywire event, an ABC Radio event that is done in partnership with the Australian government. It provides a platform for the ideas, aspirations and stories of regional youth. It is a wonderful initiative and it has the support of all members of this place-and you can see that by the attendance. I had the occasion to be with Brittany Armstrong, who is from Casino, in my seat of Page. Brittany is a year 12 student at Casino High and she won with her story about speedway racing-a bit unusual but something that a lot of people follow and love. She was quite surprised and delighted that she won, so it was a nice occasion for me to meet her and also meet with other people. I thank everybody associated with Heywire, particularly Mary Pemberton, the coordinator, because it takes a lot of work to organise it. I also had occasion to visit, in my electorate last Saturday, the 2nd Casino Scout Group, which is in Pratt Street, to look at the work they do and to meet some of the children who are active in Scouting. I would like to put on the record that Casino has 100 years of continuous Scouting history. That is commendable in itself. It is really commendable of the parents who keep it going, because it relies on them and volunteers. They told me that the local state member for Lismore, Thomas George, had been a member of the group and that his name was listed on the honour roll. He comes from Casino, so they were quite pleased about that. I gave them a portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.",172
242,Mr Dutton,ADJOURNMENT,What a good monarchist you are!,172
243,Ms SAFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I am not but I am a good local member and it is what they wanted. I Last got it for them, had it framed and took it over and it was hung up on a wall. They had one but they needed a new one-let us put it that way-so I made sure that they got that. They were delighted with it. So it is hanging up and it looks very good. Another local issue that I am actively advocating for at the moment is Coraki's Campbell Hospital, which is in my seat of Page. It is a small 14-bed hospital. There is a committee there. It is like a standing committee-it is called the Save the Hospital Committee-because every now and then the issue raises its head whereby they feel they are under threat. They do so at the moment. They have had some bad luck with the weather and it did do some damage to the hospital and expensive repair work was carried out. I was told that that would continue over the holidays and I was also told by the health service that they were undertaking a full structural review of the hospital as that was required. I understand that has been done and that I will be advised as to that soon. But the community, without enough information and after waiting for quite a few months, started to get very anxious about it, understandably so, and there was a public meeting and a lot of people turned out-230 people, although Coraki is a small place. I was here in this place so I joined the meeting by telephone. The local state member for Clarence attended the meeting and both he and I gave support to them, as I have done ever since I have been elected as their member and said that I will always make sure that that hospital stays open. I have a petition to that effect. We are collecting signatures on it at the moment in the community. We are seeking three things: ensuring urgent attention to repairs at Campbell Hospital, reopening the hospital at the earliest possible date and the giving of a commitment to the long-term future of the Campbell Hospital, which the residents so rightly deserve. Another event that happened in my electorate recently was the opening of another part of the Ballina Bypass, something that was funded by our government and something that I lobbied for-involving $450 million, and there is state money in that as well. I was there the local state member for Ballina and we did the honours and opened that. It was wonderful to see. We both stood there saying we never thought we would get so excited watching cars drive up a road-but it was good to see because the road was open. (Time expired) Dickson Electorate: Infrastructure",172
244,Mr DUTTON,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to talk about two major infrastructure concerns in my electorate of Dickson. It has now been over a year since the January 2011 floods when the North Pine River flooded, causing extensive damage to the northbound AJ Wyllie Bridge. As a result this bridge closed and traffic was forced to use the remaining southbound bridge, causing traffic chaos and huge commuter delays. It has been devastating to local businesses and a lingering frustration to local residents. One would think that after a year this problem would have been resolved or at least be close to being resolved, especially with the announcement by the Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh, that 'all 89 flood damaged bridges and culverts had been opened'. But I am saddened to say that Anna Bligh was obviously unaware or had not been informed, by the local state members, Ms ONEILL and Ms Male, that absolutely no progress had been made and that residents, commuters and businesses were still waiting. It has been over a year since the AJ Wyllie Bridge was damaged, so over a year locals have had to bear the brunt of delay after delay waiting for it to be fixed or rebuilt. Now, at the beginning of an election campaign, it is announced that a tender has finally been approved. The construction, however, is expected to take yet another year to complete. Residents, commuters and business owners may have been ignored by the state Labor government but fortunately with the LNP candidate for Kallangur, Trevor Ruthenberg, and the LNP candidate for Pine Rivers, Seath Holswich, have taken up the fight. These two hard working locals have spent the last year fighting for action and have been successful in achieving better outcomes for traffic management during the year. They have also stood up for local businesses who are suffering at a time that is already difficult for the retail sector. They organised a promotional day to encourage locals back to businesses in the area and help them to survive until a new bridge is built and commuters return to their regular travel route. Other infrastructure concerns are was constantly being brought to my attention by my constituents when I travel around the Dickson electorate in my mobile office. The lack of trains servicing the Ferny Grove line is one of these and residents of Samford and the Hills District in my electorate find the decision to use public transport more difficult when it is inefficient as well as expensive. The LNP state candidate for Ferny Grove, Dale Shuttleworth, and the LNP state candidate for Everton, Tim Mander, have been listening to locals also and are fighting for a more reliable and costeffective train service. Dale, Tim and the LNP team will improve the Ferny Grove line on weekdays so that commuters will have no need for a timetable because they can be assured that a train will arrive regularly. At present commuters from the Ferny Grove line are currently waiting 30 minutes for a daytime off-peak train. This time will be halved when services are doubled, with a train arriving every 15 minutes. Additional trains are needed to accommodate the population growth in this area and also make public transport more affordable for regular commuters-encouraging them back to public transport, which in turn will alleviate some of the traffic problems, especially along Samford Road, a known bottleneck for this area. To date, the Bligh government has not encouraged regular train travel-it is expensive and unreliable. The introduction of free travel after 10 trips in a seven-day week beginning on Monday on a GoCard is a farce. In a five-day working week most travellers only make 10 trips and the last thing many want to do is climb back on a train on the weekend to get cheaper travel. We have read in the paper about people taking short trips in their lunch hour on so that the longer trip home through more zones is less expensive. People should not have to do this to try and benefit from using public transport. If you want commuters to leave their cars at home and take the bus or train then you have to make it worth their while. Paying for a service that is just as expensive as driving and parking and is at the same time inefficient is not an incentive to use public transport. Dale Shuttleworth, Tim Mander and the LNP team are genuinely committed to our local community, and in particular to providing reward and encouragement to regular GoCard commuters with the reintroduction of the weekly discount. This is something my constituents have asked for for a long time and it is something that, sadly, the state member for Ferny Grove and state health minister, Geoff Wilson, has responded to with a tin ear. Campbell Newman, Dale Shuttleworth and Tim Mander are committed to delivering a revitalised train network underpinned by better planning for the future. Commuters will be encouraged back to public transport and the rewards for all of us will be immense. Hunter Electorate: Oncology Services",173
245,Ms GRIERSON,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak on the release last week of the external review of medical oncology services at the Hunter New England Local Health District. The report was commissioned after 2011 media attention on inadequate cancer services in the Hunter region. Reports told of too many people with life-critical cancer suffering from a medical bureaucracy that moved, according to the Newcastle Herald, with glacial slowness. Story after story of personal anxiety and despair was showcased. A typical wait to see a specialist in the Hunter region was seven weeks, in comparison to the benchmark of two weeks buses for cancer patients awaiting medical oncology treatment in Sydney. On demographics alone, the Hunter region had half the medical oncologists it should have had. People were dying in the time between diagnosis and seeing a specialist or between diagnosis and the commencement of treatment. The public and the media raised their voices for remediation of these failings. New South Wales Health with Hunter New England Health and Calvary Mater Newcastle began an external review of oncology services across the region. In August last year it was reported that a draft report had been completed and the New South Wales government was acting on the recommendations. But the report remained secret. At my request the then federal Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, wrote to the New South Wales health minister, Jillian Skinner, for details. Again, no report details were made available. I find it alarming that any state health minister would be happy to take federal funding but not be willing to be accountable for its expenditure. Whilst our health and hospital reforms have begun to make a difference there is still much to do to bring transparency to resourcing levels, treatment and care standards and patient outcomes. But the report has now been released and we are told that of the 24 recommendations made in the review, 21 will be supported by Hunter New England Health and Calvary Mater Newcastle. There is insufficient time in this debate go to all the recommendations but I mention two. Recommendation No. 2 is that there be no further expansion of sites in the Hunter New England Health area until there is an appropriate increase in medical oncologists. It is a bit catch-22. It sounds sensible on the surface as long as it is constantly reviewed against actual need and actual resources and not used as an excuse to defer justified expansion or to ignore serious recruitment of medical oncologists. Recommendation No. 5 is for the reinstatement of the triage oncology nurse and that role's expansion to include coordination of chemotherapy treatments in the day oncology unit and the Inpatient Oncology Unit. The review found the current system of registrars is inefficient, contributing to longer waiting lists. Anyone who has sat in a hospital knows that in the hospital environment registrars are stretched thin and often are not available. A dedicated trained triage oncology nurse could make a real difference. Of the three recommendations not supported I highlight two that recommended structural change-recommendation No. 22 goes to achieving a consistent approach to nursing practice and recommendation No. 10 suggests a holistic approach by the many cancer related services. So apparently a unified and integrated approach is not supported. As a consumer, that is what I would really like to see. As the member for Newcastle, I think the people I represent would like that possibility explored further and I do not intend to let that ideal slip away. If patient need and care was central to any structure of cancer services then I think integration of services and the setting up of pathways that link those services to guide both patients and their medical professionals would be critical to optimising successful to outcomes in patient treatment and care. I would also think they would be critical to removing any inefficiencies and duplication. I think a consistent high-level approach by most practitioners would also be something that every patient would want to see. Measures are being taken from the recommendations made but the main sticking point to implementation and achieving significant improvement is that New South Wales Health states that HNE Health and Calvary Mater Newcastle plan to work together in order to 'free-up existing dollars in order to invest in the priorities'. Everyone sitting here knows that that is code for 'they just need to squeeze those health dollars a little more and spread it around differently and all will be fixed'. That is just an insult. After years of inadequate resourcing, I acknowledge by both the previous Labor government, according to the report, and the Liberal government, any catch-up will require additional funds, and those funds need to be injected now by the current New South Wales government. The Herald reports that that could be up to $10 million a year. The review found Newcastle's services are understaffed and workers are under pressure. It reveals that people are not receiving treatment that they would otherwise receive in places like Sydney and they are dying as a result. So I call on the local state government MPs-all of themto do the job they were elected to do and stand up for the people of Newcastle and the Hunter so that we do have the oncology services we are entitled to and need.",174
246,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"While I can understand the enthusiasm of the member for Cowan, he should not stand while another honourable member has the call. I call the honourable member for Cowan. Surf Life Saving",176
247,Mr SIMPKINS,ADJOURNMENT," This summer I completed my surf rescue certificate with the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club in Western Australia, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the general manager of the club, Louise Dean, for organising the training course and also the course trainer and club volunteer, Lisa Thomson. Given the beach environment that many Australians enjoy, I believe that it is important to have a good understanding of basic surf rescue, first aid and Australian beaches receive around 100 million visits a year and it is estimated that 80 per cent of all Australians visit the beach at some point each year-and this is not surprising given that Australia has some of the best beaches in the world. While going to the beach can be lots of fun, we must remember that the beach can also be a dangerous place. Since July last year, surf life saving clubs across Australia have executed 9,189 rescues administered first aid on 20,381 patients. Furthermore, across Australia 315 people lost their lives through drowning on our beaches or in waterways, in homes and in floods in 2010-11. To help keep this large volume of beachgoers safe, a number of whom are tourists and often unaware of surf conditions and how quickly they can change, an estimated 158,000 volunteers patrol Australian beaches and each year these members of surf life saving clubs rescue around 12,000 people. As a member of the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club and the Parliamentary Friends of Surf Life Saving, I am well aware of the hard work and vital roles local surf life saving play in saving and protecting people's lives on our beaches. The coalition, which as we all know is led by a committed surf life saving member and volunteer, recognises the invaluable work organisations such as Surf Life Saving Australia play in keeping our beaches safe. As a result, we have committed an additional $10 million to assist surf life saving clubs across Australia purchase much needed equipment and we will extend the Beach Drowning Black Spot Reduction Program if elected to government. This funding will provide Australian surf clubs with an additional $1.6 million per year for five years and will mean that each of our 310 surf clubs will be given around $5,000 per year to purchase rescue equipment, first aid and resuscitation. medical supplies. When completing my surf rescue certificate I was told that it was often difficult for the club to cover the costs of maintaining and upgrading rescue equipment and that any damage to this equipment comes at the expense of the club. Therefore I am confident that funding to assist with the purchase of an inflatable rubber boat, a jet ski or first aid supplies will be a big help to the hard working surf rescue clubs across and Australia. One of the aspects of this program that I am particularly keen on is our commitment to working with the clubs to identify what they need and trying to satisfy this. The coalition finds it valuable to listen to those who do the day-today work and understand how the clubs work. For this reason, the coalition will be meeting with Surf Life Saving Australia in February to discuss other ways in which we can encourage water safety across Australia and reduce government compliance costs and red tape. This approach is unlike that of the Labor government, who are completely out of touch with community organisations and volunteers and are determined to burden them with new OH&S laws. Under Labor's new national OH&S regime, volunteers will now be considered in the same way as workers when it comes to OH&S matters and will be personally liable for fines up to $300,000 and prison sentences of up to five years if they do not comply. Volunteers are often at the heart of the community and deserve our support. We should be making volunteering easier, not harder. In conclusion, surf life saving clubs the nation are not for profit and rely on membership fees, sponsors and grants to fund their operations. As the Sorrento Life Saving Club website states, the primary role of the club is to patrol the beaches and maintain a safe environment for the public and to do this they rely on their volunteer members. Surf life saving clubs such as Sorrento and their dedicated members deserve recognition for their hard work, time and effort in creating a safe environment on Australia's beaches and coastline through patrols, education and training, public safety campaigns and the promotion of health and fitness. I believe that each of these valued volunteers should wear the iconic red and yellow uniform with pride, knowing that they are making a real difference. I congratulate all those members of not only the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club but all the surf life saving clubs across Western Australia and across Australia for the outstanding work that they do for our local community, for the people of Australia and for visitors to Australia. The coalition's promised funding and commitment to working with Surf Life Saving Australia will provide great value and support surf life saving clubs right across Australia. Infrastructure",176
248,Mr BANDT,ADJOURNMENT," I rise this evening to discuss a matter of increasing importance to those living in Australia's major cities such as Melbourne, and that is the matter of planning infrastructure for growing populations. Who is responsible for planning our cities? What criteria are being applied? How can Commonwealth funding contribute to sensible and sustainable planning for Melbourne? These questions are relevant because, as I am advised, during the coming month Infrastructure Australia will across recommend to the government whether funding should be provided for various infrastructure proposals, including proposals by the Victorian state government. I am concerned that funding from the Commonwealth to Victoria should best meet the needs of Victorians, and particularly the needs of those in the electorate of Melbourne. Without sensible and integrated planning we risk wasting millions of dollars on massive projects that serve only the needs of a few. The electorate of Melbourne is the heart of Victoria's economic and transport systems and is home to Australia's busiest container port. The Victorian government has applied for funding for road and rail links to connect the Melbourne electorate with its metropolitan regional limbs and branches. Included in the wish list of the Victorian government is $30 million for planning an east-west road tunnel and $130 million for part of a metro rail tunnel. I have written to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Minister Albanese, to urge him not to provide any funding for the proposal for an east-west road link by the Victorian government and to urge him to ask the Baillieu government to submissions consistent with national aims to transition our cities to greater efficiency and sustainability. The east-west road tunnel has been widely criticised for a number of reasons, not least that the majority of road traffic-about 60 per cent-travels into or out of the city of Melbourne and congestion would not be alleviated by the construction of a cross-city tunnel. I have consistently called for projects such as the Doncaster rail line to be given priority to improve efficiency and productivity. We also know that in excess of 60,000 vehicles travel along the Eastern Freeway in the morning peak period without a rail alternative. I have urged the minister to discuss with the Victorian government the need to prioritise public transport alternatives such as rail from my electorate to Doncaster and better rail infrastructure for moving freight from the Port of Melbourne. As the population of cities like Melbourne increases, we will require infrastructure-schools, medical clinics, aged-care facilities, affordable housing, trains and trams, digital technology and open space. In allocating funding to priority infrastructure, we must be sure that transport proposals are synchronised with planning and other infrastructure provision. We must ensure that essential infrastructure and basic services are provided before buildings go up and people move in. Building without such planning has resulted in communities like Docklands, which is without a school, without a park and without reliable access to television. If you, Mr Speaker, were to look at buying a flat in Docklands you would be well advised to check which side of the building it is on first because, believe it or not, in the middle of Melbourne's CBD you can find yourself without TV reception. prioritise I look forward to the forthcoming national urban policy, which, according to answers given to Senator Scott Ludlam recently, has an emphasis on lower emissions and sustainability and will inform Infrastructure Australia's recommendations and the decision of the minister. We urgently need a new approach to sustainable and integrated planning. House adjourned at 20:00 NA The following notices were given:",177

No-one is saying that they cannot spend met suggest that this government cannot spend other government before. It knows how to spray financing that spending onto subsequent generations.

That is an incredible uplift in the hide to come out and say, 'Oh, but we are spurious set of data analysis. What it does not is simply tax deferred for subsequent generations ability of this Labor government to spend money, debt and to record record deficits. But the political Ponzi scheme sees the transferred on to subsequent years and to subsequent an intergenerational theft of their opportunities profile when it comes time for the subsequent and to shape its economy. In effect, it is actually today and then being able to come into this spruiking about all the money they have sprayed number of worthwhile things that you can do has proven its capacity to make some inroads into comes a day when you have to account for scheme is sucking resources out of current and expenditure. Today, we as a nation will borrow time when the government boasts about the trade being as good as they have been for a incapable of paying our way.

There is quite a remarkable in this nation's parliament. You have heard job they do in spending bucketloads of money. I have not heard anybody that I have money. It knows how to spend money like no it around and defer the responsibility for government was elected, the Commonwealth In the last year of the Howard government, if my budget was about $270 billion. It is now up at government expenditure. Then the government has not the highest-taxing government,' on a very talk about is the deferred tax that is debt. Debt to pay. Again, just as no-one contests the it is unrivalled in its ability to accumulate economic harm and the financial responsibility generations, as if it does not matter. It is to choose the priorities and the expenditure generation to manage and to lead this nation stealing those opportunities, claiming them chamber, as we have heard Labor members do, around everywhere. There is an infinite with other people's money, and the government that infinite range of possibilities. But there it. I have touched on how this political Ponzi future generations to finance this extraordinary another $100 million dollars, and this is at a economy being at trend growth and the terms of century and half. Yet we are still proving to be the Commonwealth of Australia were a lots of 'please explain's from the economic lots of calls from ASIC to explain how their the prudent and good practice that the corporate government they are not held to that same level entity, it would be wondering how some NA of the assertions that have been put out into is no evidence to substantiate those claims. having accumulated extraordinary deficits, political advantage. It has been engineered pulled forward into this financial year and then wafer-thin surplus for 2012-13. So we see how the already enormous deficit which was going Where expenditure can be pulled forward into expenditures have been able to be deferred while the government seeks to achieve some kind of the fact that the broader Australian public economic management, competence and capability. So these additional expenditures come on deficits. These are the four biggest deficits have been arrived at-and I am drawing from when the economy seems to be going well. the trend growth that we are on now should miserably as a nation to fund our expenditures. have a cumulative total of $167 billion, and the Labor government and its members. If the Prime Minister were the chief executive bonus-whether it be a substantial payment contrived financial outcome, everyone would government were in the corporate world, the high-flying executives were manipulating finances to create some arithmetic outcome for happened in the corporate world there would be outrage. When this government was going through Rudd was trying to say that all things that economy were all of sudden quite evil and boardroom, in every economic decision and things he said at that time was that corporate achieve certain financial KPIs so that they would are some years down the track-we no longer Minister Gillard-and Prime Minister Gillard the Commonwealth of Australia, and is doing Rudd was so highly critical of when he was picture. We have a completely incredible set outcome where the CEO-in this case, the for this contrived one-year financial outcome. the fiscal gymnastics, transactional shuffling government is overseeing. We are still yet to Minister and Treasurer have promised on the performance is a guide to future performance the marketplace could be made at all, given there We see this in the way that the government, after has almost overnight contrived a surplus for for one budget, one year. Expenditure has been pushed back outside the target year to create a in this budget and in these appropriation bills to be inflicted on this nation is getting worse. this financial year it has been and where other they have been put out past 2012-13. And this is of political goal that it has set itself in light is quite dubious about this government's the back of quite an extraordinary series of in our nation's history. Remember: these deficits the Labor government's own rhetoric-at a time Any hardship is dismissed as growing pains and enable us to pay our way, but we are failing The four biggest deficits in Australian history that is supposed to be praiseworthy in the eyes of officer of a corporation and she received a or some political kudos-derived from a look quite curiously at that. In fact, if the corporate world would be highly critical that the fortunes of its company and massaging its which they would hope to be rewarded. If that its post-neoliberalism, former Prime Minister had helped make this country great and grow our that we needed a bigger government in every in every household of the country. One of the executives were running companies to try to be highly rewarded. Isn't it odd that here we have Prime Minister Rudd; we have Prime is presiding over a Commonwealth corporation, the very things that former Prime Minister Prime Minister. We have a contrived financial of assertions sitting behind one year's financial Prime Minister-wants to be lauded and praised I am not certain it will even happen, despite all and political Ponzi arrangements that the see whether there will be a surplus as the Prime back of, dare I say, some very poor form. If past then it is very hard to believe the government NA will actually create a surplus, even as it creates outcome for 2012-13. There has been no discussion arrangements that impose cost vulnerability can try to look good in the short term. The shadow finance minister has quite rightly the budget strategy that the government is tax. It is a particular gift to impose a new tax position, but that is what the government has this tax. This tax is not only causing direct costs, causing enormous concern in the business growth that the government relies upon to have with these numbers will end up I sought to ask the Prime Minister about community, particularly in the small business She dismissed that concern and that question. out there amongst the business community, detrimental to their interests, to the interests their communities.

That is of no comfort In the communities that I represent, the mechanics regular scheduled service; they are only coming drycleaners are saying that people are less this cynical fiscal strategy to contrive a budget about how it will unwind these Ponzi on subsequent generations just so the government touched on one of the glaring problems with proposing-and that is the imposition of a carbon and have a net detrimental impact on the budget done as it tries to massage the introduction of which are canvassed in these bills; it is also community.

308,Mr CHESTER,MAIN COMMITTEE," I appreciate want to raise several issues which are of Gippsland electorate. I will start with the critical to the future of the town and which governments. Before I get to those projects, I would like ever citizens, who passed away during the Bernie Walpole. Bernie passed away on 23 friend of the family, I attended Bernie's funeral life. We heard about Bernie's remarkable service government and in sporting pursuits. Bernie There is an old saying that if you want something was always busy, but he always had time for a chat. He was a man of many passions. He loved garden. He loved his family, especially his beloved consider myself to have been very fortunate personal integrity and determination to make anyone pursuing public office. As I indicated, distinction as a local government councillor remembered not just by his family The two projects that I referred to earlier loved to have gotten his teeth into. One is Scammell Park, which will be a group of independent provider of services to adults with a disability services, accommodation and respite services. serving the Yarram district community over which I believe deserve support at a government very well developed and they have applied these independent living units. This is a need that has been identified in living with a disability and residing with elderly care for their children in their later life. those parents to remain with their child while that they need. At the same time, they will be living skills to enable them to continue community when the parent can no longer care for them. I have been briefed over the last couple particular project. I can say that the Yarram application, which came about as the result day of significance. Additionally, it is my all parties are acknowledged for their parliament. I do not want just Labor people to be acknowledged as well, because we took the lead in the opportunity to join this debate. I great importance to communities across the township of Yarram and two key projects that are deserve support by both state and federal to pay tribute to one of Yarram district's finest parliamentary break: a gentleman by the name of December at the magnificent age of 94. As a service; it was a tremendous celebration of his to the community in education, in local was the kind of bloke you could always rely on. done you get a busy man to do it. Bernie his community. He loved his farm. He loved his wife, Merle, who died several years ago. I to have known Bernie for many years. His a difference in life made him a role model for Bernie served his community with great and a shire president and he will be fondly but by the entire community. are the types of things that Bernie would have the plan by Mirridong Services in Yarram to build living units. Mirridong is the principle within the Yarram district. It provides day Mirridong has a very proud reputation from many years. It has some big plans for the future level. Their plans for a $3 million facility are for some federal government support to develop the community, particularly for adults who are parents who may not be able to continue to Scammell Park will provide an important option for they receive the specialised support and care able to help to develop the child's independent to live independently and to be active in the of years by the Mirridong board about this district community is fully supportive of this of many years of community consultation and NA planning. It is an outstanding project and it I commend the board and the staff of Mirridong people with disabilities in our community. They and they help bond our community together. There is another project in the Yarram district develop a community hub, which will include has had a chequered past is to state what childcare services was identified as a major ago. It was certainly subject to some election Peter MCGauran, made a $1 million commitment childcare service in Yarram. That commitment at the time, which was reported in the local program has not eventuated. Given this government's promises, I should not be so surprised. The federal government now has the opportunity district community. This is something that, as the 2007 election. It was a commitment by the truly aware, the Labor Party won that election. same project, so I believe that it is something I am pleased to say that there has been something times in the form of the commitment made community hub project. I want to pay tribute  member of parliament. Peter has worked project and to continue to liaise with the Wellington that could be taken to governments to seek funding support. The Victorian state government has provided infrastructure program, which is a very good has completed a feasibility study to determine community hub model, but it needs some additional understand that council is going to consider determine which is the best way to progress included as a core service. It is likely that kindergarten, child care and community meeting a lot of this government's commentary, if you and providing that hub-type approach where enjoy the support services that perhaps some metropolitan areas take for granted. I think it of government support. The members of the Yarram district community very patient with me as their federal member get funding from the federal government. government as well in that regard. They have to this stage and they deserve to be commended is certainly worthy of federal government support. Services for the work that they do with provide a great service to the Yarram district that I want to refer to and that is a plan to childcare facilities. To say that this proposal is obvious to the local community. The lack of issue in the Yarram district more than five years commitments in 2007, when my predecessor, that a re-elected government would fund a was publicly matched by the Labor candidate media. But unfortunately the funding for that track record in relation to broken to redeem itself in the eyes of the Yarram I said, had bipartisan support in the lead-up to coalition at this time.

They have been when over four years we have not been able to They have been very patient with the state worked tirelessly to have the project developed for their efforts. We still, though, have a long NA way to go. We will need more funding to be secured hopeful that the state and federal governments with the Wellington Shire Council and working citizens of the Yarram district to I must say that a couple of the mums who childcare services in Yarram now have no need school and they are probably of an age now that are continuing to work for it as they recognise communities. It is actually impossible for us skilled workers unless we can offer some of the modern era, childcare services. If we are skilled professionals to our small regional childcare service which is befitting our regional centres. In the time.

If we are talking about the highway all the way up Eden-Monaro. I have not spoken to the member sections of his road are in pretty poor condition as well. My concern is that there really is no long-term the most basic safety features that perhaps highways. Again, I am talking about things overtaking lanes, some realignment of some improvements to the road surface itself. In recent very heavy vehicles on the road. I am talking trucks but also about caravans and recreational were before. That has added to the danger. Orbost as you head towards Cann River on nightmare watching two large vehicles pass come along that section of road. There is highway. I estimated on one trip that there there is actually no shoulder whatsoever. vehicle off into the gravel and into potential So, in my view, too much of the current based on anecdotal evidence, some of which I do believe there needs to be a complete safety strategy for upgrades of that section of road. that, and the current state government has been unfair to either of those governments to suggest available funding is simply not adequate to is trialling some new ideas on that section moment, with some new line markings and some to use their headlights at all times, and there think any of that really replaces the fact that road and it is going to cost a lot of money. There simply has not been a major funding that I have talked about. I understand that, competitive area of responsibility for governments throughout our nation. But, when the No. 1 section through East Gippsland, and lives suffered, we have to find a way to invest in social reasons I have just pointed out but bring to the East Gippsland region in increased linking our communities and making us This is something that I think we need to state and at a federal level.
